bad,Make sure crew is taking their breaks when needed so then everyone doesn’t cone to you at the same time and have to take their breaks    These guys love to play that game so you have to be on your toes
bad,"I have worked in a few different call centers and this one was by far the worst, from leadership to resources it was horrible. They also only want people they choose to succeed and don’t want to be outshined in any way"
bad,I am the type of person who goes above and beyond the Call of Duty and do more than what is expected of me. There is no appreciation for this type of work ethic. They do not care. They only care about what and how much they can get out of you. And if you are not being a yes man to them you have no value.
bad,"do not apply! this was the most disrespectful, shady and unsafe corporation I have ever worked for. employee safety is a far distance second to profits."
bad,"The only reason I have this job is because I need the money. 90 percent of the employees in our group are contractors and will never be hired full time. It's pretty said that they depend on the ""contract"" employees as much as they do. The full time employees are out so much and they know that the contract employees cannot take a day off because we don't have any PTO hours. The only part of work I like is the hour for lunch that I play my game. "
bad,"Management is only there for the bonuses. They role play before a disciplinary meeting and to include HR. They only cover themselves. STAY AWAY. If you get hurt hire a lawyer cause they will deny your worker’s compensation. DM needs to go, he has destroyed the company both morale of workers and with his own managers."
bad,Company refuse to pay for work that they wanted you to do never made repairs to equipment for employees when anything would break they would blame the employees managers would openly brag about how they over charged companies and coustomers
bad,Company is bad  it no hrs and Independence Iowa location sucks u wel work your butt off and not get the respect u need and it feels like your in high school all over agin and the trucks are not good
bad,"Everyday you cough up black snot not a very health environment. You breath in a lot of dust the whole shift that's why left."
bad,You will be treated like the garbage you are picking up. You will drive a death trap on a daily basis and if you make too much noise about it you will be targeted. DM and both RM's are snakes and only care about the bonus your hard work will make them.
bad,"I do no recommend. Employees are underpaid and micromanaged. Unprofessional, ethics violations, under the table transactions, harassments, HR violations, bribing"
bad,Company is not worker orient you are just a number push to get work done middle management and upper management could care less. Get hurt they will fight you all the way through court5.
bad,If you like to work for a maintenance manager that has no knowledge of fixing trucks then this is the job for you. Management does nothing but bicker between each other and accomplish nothing. Will throw you under the bus to save their own rear. Lying is the common practice in every situation
bad,"Waste management doesn't care about its customers or employees, Worst job ever  wouldn't return to work there even if they paid me a million dollars! Run as fast and as far away from there as you can!"
bad,You are expected to do everyone else's job and the manager at my sight was a complete jerk. I was assaulted by the manager and reported it and nothing happened. As a matter a fact he got a promotion. I will never work for this company again.
bad,All of the interesting things that you can find. Also riding on the back of the truck is pretty fun too. The work is easy but it is also tiring and exhausting.
bad,"The management sucks they don't  know wat they are doing, I been here year an I seen more people quite here more then any other job, the culture here is very racist, the pay is basically minimum wage for wat they want u to do"
bad,"All about numbers"
bad,I left cause the managers act like my life didn’t matter they would switch my hours around when ever they felt like it and they were constantly on our back to hurry up very stressful and definitely not worth working in that environment and Wastemanagement doesn’t do anything for there employees
bad,"You are not being hired to sell! I worked weekends, vacations, and nights. I was expected to rectify major billing mistakes, made by billing,  operational issues, and pulled in several different directions, because operations didn't want to do their job.  We never had inventory for new clients. Leaving me with little time to hit my sales goals, or accommodate to my book of business. Hence living off a base salary that was $13.75 an hour broken down. Management was very poor, with zero support.  If you have experience in sales, I would recommend looking somewhere else!"
bad,Demonstrated ability to pick up loose trash and materials. Prepare and handled sanitation equipment. Unloaded collected waste from sanitation trucks. carry out the function of the job.
bad,60 hours a week every week.. they will fire you for one mistake. They treat the employees horrible they have cameras in all the trucks 10 major rules you break any you get fired such a big company your worth is nothing to them. They have no incentives you live at work they work you to the ground such a stressful environment. No job security you can have years and they will fire you in a sec no one will fight to keep you at the company what a disgrace to the trash industry
bad,"I worked for WM for almost 12 years. The first 9 years were AMAZING! Wonderful benefits for health, my manager at the time was wonderful and helpful if and when needed but pretty much allowed me to do my work and since there was another person that actually did a small amount of the work then, my hours were great. I never called in, always was on time, my personal phone was always on in case the drivers needed something and the office wasn’t open yet. I was very good at my job and felt very happy and blessed and respected by my peers and my bosses. My boss at that time very much respected me and most times we agreed about everything and sometimes we agreed to disagree. He treated me fairly but also corrected me if he felt I overstepped my authority. I learned all the safety aspects for the drivers and mechanics.Later, my hours became nearly 7 days a week & late nights that I wasn’t paid for because the DM restricted my hours but gave me other’s responsibilities. I loved and still have close friendships with many people who worked there and have also left for other Waste companies. I learned a lot about the business in general and I loved my job until those last three years. I enjoyed very much what I did and was respected as a dispatcher in the beginning and then a payroll person and then the Operations Specialist."
bad,These guys first accused me of yelling at a woman while collecting her waste than it turned into she heard me from the street and than it turned into I was leaving garbage to teach people a lesson and then fired me so shady
bad,They have one on one meetings with new employees on why they have such a high turnover. There rules are too strict. Nobody wants to deal with that nonsense.  $18.00hr was too low for the what you had to put up with every single day. And they need to make there older trucks automatic switch start working or they are going to see more people become ghosts.
bad,"If I could rate less 1 I would. They make promises they never kept, to my people working there that have no idea what there doing.  Company always talks about how good things were back in the 80's."
bad,"The review summary says it all. For a company as large as Waste Management is, you would think they would have their act together from a management standpoint. They have grand plans, but they're not at all executed properly. Zero communication from upper management to the rest of the floor."
bad,"After working and breaking my back busting my butt for 15-17 hr days with most weekends and holidays required to work, They stuck me in an office continuously trying to find a way to get rid of me, after 15 yrs of service they through me out the door offering a poor package I had to obtain legal assistance"
bad,Do not recommend. Terrible management. Lots of gossip from shop management and fleet manager encourages it. Too many hours no family time. Will let trucks run unsafe and if something happens will blame the tech. Run away from this place
bad,Was hired to do cleanup and litter patrol and was forced to ride on the back of a garbage truck more and more. Wont hire full time and expect you to work full time hours
bad,Worst job I ever had they had no respect for the people that were working for them on the starting line you're just a person and whenever they want they will throw you up work there for two years have never been treated so bad in my life would never go back I suggest to anyone don't go work there
bad,The place is unprofessional. They do not take pride in their work. Only superficially. I am an artist’ . I like to be the best at everything I do. Not out of pride or $. I’m also an entrepreneur. I Must be appreciated and rewarded accordingly. Or I will go elsewhere. I’m not up for negotiations....adios!
bad,"Biggest mistake I’ve ever made, working for WM. From the training center in FL , to the distric I worked at in Menominee falls, WI. "
bad,"horrible , stressful place to work , no appreciation , no help , no sympathy just crank out numbers answer call and sell sell sell or else write ups !!!"
bad,terable place to work managment was bad very dirty place to work employees treat you bad lack of pay for the job that was being done real bad benefits
bad,"This company is ran by poor management in which you will find yourself in a position headed down a dead end road. I never worked for a company with a ""as high of"" turnover rate as this one. The pay is low for industry standards,  and even if you are a strong performer, you get a whopping 2% raise. I would definitely not recommend this company to anyone."
bad,The company has unrealistic expectations. It’s all about. Numbers not really about the people. Management really sucks. They want to be good at everything but really forget about the hardest people that work there which are the drivers. The more you give the more they want
bad,"The St. Joseph Waste Management was a joke as far as supervisors and the truck fleet was worse breakdowns daily, the dash cams had the drivers scared and instead of trying to back their guys more interested in trying to find a way to fire em. Took forever for guys hired as drivers to actually drive so they got more money for my job stressed safety but was times couldn't even get ahold of a supervisor they are union in St. Louis need to organise and have a voice in St. Joseph their losing customer s and money but the guys ya work with are great it's management that's a joke"
bad,"They will work you until you drop,12+ hours"
bad,Do not work for waste management as a equipment operator. The pay scale is horrible and never changes for experience or productivity. The pay scale is like a socialist economy “ no matter how hard you work or how much you get done” 30 cents per year raise is all they give you. The best part of the job was the lunch room and going home after your shift. Everyone hates their job at waste management. So the culture sucks
bad,I was being paid way to low for all the requirements for the job.  No one should be expected to perform at such a high level for little compensation. Great experience though.
bad,Waste management model is hurry hurry hurry up pick up the trash but do your shift of servicing Thousands of homes on short staff  and in limited time. Heaven for bid you have a family emergency  they don’t care what’s going on in your personal life it’s really hard to take off in an emergency because they threaten you with your job
bad,"the management ignore concerns of employees, like health issue with mold. management played favorites with employees. management and training was non existing.very high turn around of employees. not enough help with difficult account and over loaded with account that required constant attention."
bad,This company is a joke!  The equipment that we used to pick up trash constantly broke down.  They sent us out in equipment that often time would be dangerous to drive.  They routes were not managed correctly and management did not care.  The amount of employees that came and left was like a revolving door on a daily basis.  Don't bother to learn anyone's name - they will be gone the next day.
bad,"Racist, lack of opportunity not good at all is a mess not organized at all they act like every spanish person are slaves and treat Indians like they dont belong here. Very bad to work for. They only care for them self"
bad,"Do Not Work Here... Dispatch was a complete headache... The job is based upon Speed... but safety first, right?! No matter what happens, it’s your fault and will lighten your pockets."
bad,What a joke. This place absolutely sucks. Route managers are rude. The one I had it was impossible to get along with him. Total jerk to his drivers. But according to him he could do it all
bad,could be a great place to work if they paid better and the management was better. Management needs to be better trained. they offer some good things but its offset by the things you have to go through. Their trucks are old.
bad,"Stinks, Maggot infested and a Bunch of lying backstabbing jerks and convicted felons, Bi-polor morons. Other than that a great place to work. Dont waste your time at waste of management."
bad,Waste Management overworks and underpays their staff!  I worked at WM for almost 2 years I only got a 42 cent raise!! take it from me to stay away!!!!!!!
bad,"Terrible place to work. Poorly managed. The only thing management cares about is saving money. No teamwork whatsoever. Some drivers work, some are lazy and expect others to do their job for them."
bad,they want you to empty 1000 to 1200 cans a day go to the dump then help other workers out who are lazy. managers are stupid dont waste your time. managers follow you around while you trying to work trying to write you up cause they have nothing else to do they want get out and help .
bad,"This is the worst I have been treated by a company ever! "
bad,Start at 7am. Go up on the line grab the material you've been assigned to.  Put it in bunker and keep area clean. Go to lunch. Get back to work. Clean  assigned areas.  Clock out.  Go home.
bad,"Worst place to work for,They treat you very poorly and like you are just a number to them that can be easily replaced and talk to you very unprofessionally"
bad,Working for this company for 3 months nothing about pay raise. Have knowledge of breakdown and repair of machines. Applied for millwright and was turned down even though they want me in shop to repair machinery. Lead of shop has knowledge but no patience. Wants to hire friends but friends can't work with him. Can't believe he made it to lead with no knowledge of machines working on. No willingness to learn or listen. Waste Management/Dolphin Services.
bad,No air condition during the summer and no heat in the winter. Filthy working conditions. Rats everywhere. Mangment is racest against everyone who is not Vietnamese.
bad,"The most TERRIBLE place you could work. Terrible management, ONLY worried about bonuses and numbers. Constantly putting their employees at danger in order to make themselves look good. Working employees 60+ hours, won’t slow down until there are multiple accidents. Do not, seriously.. DO NOT work here unless you’re willing to give yourself up, potentionally die, or wanna join a cult."
bad,"This company was contract based, thus I was not granted the ability to really established the gist of all the benefits or packages they offered.  My tenure with the company was no long"
bad,to many rules and according to my supervisor they don't give out raises except once a year you got cameras in your face watching everything that you doing too many rules everyday they come up with a new rule when you go to work it feels like you're in on probation you have to walk like you're walking on eggshells
bad,"Office is a clique. They either love you or hate you. Awful pay. Zero chances to advance unless you are bending over. If they replaced the management, the place could stand a chance."
bad,"Managers rule by intimidation,  put uncompromising workload demand under the gun so to speak, my way or the HI way towards employees, very stressful, ridicule work habits to keep your moral down."
bad,"WM bought out the company I was working for, I heard nasty things about them but decided to give them a chance, a month in I wanted out, they don’t want to buy me out so they are trying to make me quit, spying on me with drive cam and cutting down my run it’s a nasty cooperation I work out of Danville, Mississauga stay away from this place if u want to keep your insanity."
bad,"If you’re a hourly employee they could care less about you. Everything is based on managements  bonuses ."
bad,"I do not recommend it if you have a family , you will not have time for your family , some of co-workers are nice ."
bad,Worked 12 hours some days... and wasn’t complaining . Also wasn’t compensated.  Paid almost minimum wage for extreme work. From day to night work but shift is only supposed to be 8 hours because that’s all I got paid for.
bad,These people dont care about their drivers they only care about dollars. Their managers dont give a dsrn about their employees. They are garbage to work for.
bad,"I worked for this company nearly 20 years - 12 hours a day, never called out. If you make a mistake or speak your mind you are out the door. Management over complicates what should a straight forward job. There is no work life balance at all. Long days and no recognition for a job well done."
bad,"The hours was long, the compensation was not worth the pay the employees was unfriendly. There is a lawsuit against them right now for compensation. The managers was unprofessional"
bad,Working at waste management was a different and unexpected experience. It was okay. The supervisor s were very rude and blunt. The company had very little organization.
bad,"The company is good just as a dispatcher we worked 9 hour days,sometimes longer many different ways people did there work no formal training you trained with someone for a few weeks and then on your own."
bad,"Two weeks paid-training by tired (leaving) staff on glitchy equipment including 1980's software. Segregated from existing employees and macro-managed 24/7.  Record-high 'churn' of employees - 'new hire' class begins every 6-8 weeks.  A 'morale rescue/evaluation' meeting concludes the training period Interns to stem the flow of 'leavers'. Millenials/Interns with no interest or skills brought in on the cheap to fill slots. A personalized and subjective 'in' crowd controls the company and all/any advantage/promotional opportunities. A psychologically choking environment and robotic methodology (""it's always been done like this"") is the way WM operates. "
bad,The culture was not great at WM which cause morale to be low. There was no work life balance and the pay was low. I would not recommend this position for someone with a college degree.
bad,The supervisors lack the experience in managing the team of drivers. Has no leadership or communication skills. A lot of favoritism and discrimination.
bad,"Ambridge location is a joke. Drivers are pathetic, management has no idea what they are doing. Avoid this company as a mechanic. They only care about the fat drivers"
bad,Waste management was very depressing because I seen dead animals such as dogs/cats/horses/ etc and came across a dead infant wrapped in a plastic bag. The smell was over the top. Not enough protection to cover your face and skin. But I needed to pay bills so I had to stick with my position until I was able to find another employer
bad,"I worked at WM for 1 year in that time the management experience was awful it now makes sense to me why there is always a hiring event or open positions in the Vero Beach, area other than that the work was hard and long butI I felt like I had accomplished something at the end of the day"
bad,So I applied for a welding position. Got an interview and was told that I would be hired at a utility position. Turned out that I was hired as welder helper. Spent most of my days washing totes. They found out about my cdl and sent me off doing the utility driver duties. While only paying for the shop welder helper position. Granted after a lot of .. I got retroed the difference in pay. Shortly after paying my union stuff I was told if I didn't become a driver I'd be fired due to closing my position. I took the raise and started driving. I was told I'd be sent to a training facility. Didn't happen. They have a lot of extra rules that if you don't get the training you don't know about. I.E. got a few write ups for.. reasons. Mandatory 6 day weeks for low man on the totem pole. Unless the senior drivers need extra money. Never got this rule book till a day before I got suspended prior to termination. They had the nerve to ask me to sign it then and there. Got upset when I refused. Wm non-union employees are not supposed to do union jobs. Caught and reported to the union the non-union route manager preforming a union driver job. Not to mention the pitiful equipment. Lack of  properly functioning equipment. I.E. heater air-conditioner can tipper. Being told the tipper can't pick up the large totes. Doing a two-man commercial route solo. Having roll-off tickets showing up 2 hours after the shift is supposed to be over.  And my favourite... having to run an ASL route with a conventional rear load to be harped on for the time frame.
bad,To many hours and not enough pay and they are very dishonest .The safety of the trucks was another issues also .They would send you out in a truck that was not fully inspected and tags could be expired
bad,"This company is a joke. Everybody is overworked and underpaid in the customer experience department. The CE Manager only promotes Mexicans and Whites and they can’t  keep Supervisors because they keep quitting. The turnover rate is very high. When it’s time to get a raise you can expect a $0.05-0.10 increase which is ridiculous. You can’t discuss pay because everyone gets paid different.. they don’t care about their employees, all they do is use you for special projects and all you get is a certificate instead of a raise or promotion."
bad,Extremely dirty environment would not recommend working there there are really no pros to working there. I was there for a year and it’s just stressful working there.
bad,"Typical Day Very Stress "
bad,"management blames the employees for their downfalls, this company claims to care about the employees but honestly they dont care, one employee was injured while i was there and the manager was not even concerned, management constantly disrespects the workers with no consideration of the 14+ hour days that are being worked, terrible work conditions, poor scheduling, this company could pay more especially with the long days away from family and loved ones and the fact they are a billion dollar company but greed is a huge problem here, 3 employees were fired for small infractions even after 25+ years of employment, also the same employees were terminated with no benefits, you cant take more than 1 week of vacation time at a time regardless of how much time is saved up, mechanic turnover is ridiculous, a lot of people get a job here and when they figure out it is a terrible job they quit, the only good thing that i have to say about this place is we got a small tool allowance of 250$ every quarter which is not even close to the amount of money you'll spend buying tools, you also will have absolutely no time with family, kids, or friends,"
bad,"some peolpe was ok to work with. management sucked, i would not recomend anyone work there.high up need to work in the field instead of having the butts in the office. need to start from the bottom and work your way up"
bad,No work life balance. You had to clock in and out for everything and if you were 1 minute late it was 0.25 of a fraction. You were only allowed 3% of other time that was not on the phone for the month to use the restrooms beside your lunch and 2 15 minute breaks.
bad,"I'm a professional driver, 15 years AZ experienced, i was lured to Waste Management by a recruiter promising me the world and lots of compensation. What they actually are is a CULT, the way they do things will make anyone with half a brain run."
bad,"Company gave  promotions based on popularity, their structure and training is horrible. Micro managed employees after the minimal training and the turn over rate with managers are very high. I had six different managers within 4 years time."
bad,If you enjoy driving 20 year old garbage trucks that smell like rat urine and enjoy being watched by cameras while you do it then this is the job for you.
bad,My day was about 12 hours.  I learned to clean the truck and dump garbage at the landfill.  I learned the safety checks.The workplace was safe and enjoyable.  My co-workers were very hardworking and cooperative.
bad,"This place could be better, have the wrong management in the wrong places. Managers that do much of nothing and overwork their employees. pay rate is very poor as well, they do not compensate or promote experienced internal employees"
bad,I worked 15 hour shifts sometimes. Getting minimum wage performing the same tasks if not more than someone getting twice the pay. There have been weeks i never got paid for at all. And the management didnt respond to the matter.
bad,HR doesnt care nor does the management your just another number for them. worst job i have ever held no feedback would ever be given and guidance was horrible never fulfilled employee request.
bad,"You get to run the compactor 100% of the time!"
bad,I got treated like a prisoner as a temporary employee no one wanted to help me learn the controls on the truck and I did not get proper training on my first day I got thrown into doing everything by myself.
bad,liars all liars will throw you under their own trucks to get rid of you. work home ratio is way wrong and nothing is good enough. Management and dispatch are the worst ran part of this company.
bad,Worst place to work for always breaking down favs on the line for the full timers and very bad place they are always fighting with management never hire .
bad,"Managed commercial collection routes & union driver performance on a daily basis. Directs 18 CDL drivers driving front load & rear load, diesel & CNG trash collection trucks. Also responsible for all associated commercial customer routes, container delivery drivers, & delivery routes."
bad,"Your reward for getting your route done early was to go do more work and help in areas that were not covered. Never knew what you were going to do for the day until you showed up at 6:00a.m., and you never knew when you were getting done for the day, typically 10-12 hours, no breaks and sometimes no lunch, but they would take 30 minutes from your pay even if you worked through lunch.  Would never work for them again."
bad,they close due to downsizing of the company.  We were offer to apply at other locations. Closest one to me was a hour away with no extra offer of pay.  Many of the employee didn't stay with the company.
bad,"horrible management, and discrimination   if you went to managemtn nothing was ever resolves as well if you went to HR they will come and tell everyone"
bad,very sressful and long hours in trucks that are not road worthy.bad management team that never drove a truck..camras in truck and a rule book over 1 inch thick..very very long hours and no job security and no respect from management
bad,"I would not recommend working for them. They are a bad company. Waste Management takes advantage of their employees, and it is not a safe environment to work in."
bad,"Managers in all levels of the company were poor.  Most managed by intimidation and threats.  You could be told about pay raises, but they never made good with any promises.  Bonuses were not going to be paid if manager could find any reason not to pay employees."
bad,Managers are clueless to the needs of their workers.  Very little room for advancement.  All training is on the job training with no real guidance.  Stay away at all costs
bad,"unfortunately the place was difficult to work to much finger pointing cut throat environment, didn't listen to anyone, working conditions were very bad.  people constantly coming and going"
bad,"Management is not consistent with the standard rules they created. It's based on whether the boss likes you or out the door! They won't give you time to learn and trainwithin the period. Boss always says i have no time and if you make an honest mistake then they walk you out the door with out due process/1st warning!  It was a waste of time working their thinking to have a better future! The management nor the union stewarts can not be trusted! So new applicants be very careful and leery in taking a position in WM especially in the Watford, Ontario landfill!"
bad,The equipment was old and ALWAYS needed service. The management team was more so trying to find different ways to maximize profits and decrease payment.
bad,"No work life balance, management is clueless and HR doesnt help, you will have to struggle for smallest little thing to get information. No career growth either."
bad,The pay and benefits was great but when it came to mangement it was terrible but helping the customers with there garbage service was great and I loved that about my job
bad,This was a poorly paying company that didn't value their employees an also no room for growth. The good thing about this company is that you got a discount on your trash service.
bad,"This place was a horrible place to work. The management team did nothing but micromanage employees all day long, you were not even allowed to put customers on hold, they would immediately come to your desk and tell you to get back on the phone with customer and ask them if you could place them on a silent hold. Meaning, the customer listens to silence while you are doing your work."
bad,"This is a high turnover machine. Operations, sales, drivers are constantly recycled. If you are in HR you are guaranteed employment. Add on fees to customers are increased until they leave. There is always a new customer around the corner."
bad,nothing to tell about the company bad place to work. They do not stand behind there workers management can fire you for crazy reasons. Alright as far as pay is concerned but don't be fooled by the stress management likes to put on there employees
bad,I have nothing good to say about this company.  The absolute worst company that i have ever worked for period.  I do not know how they have maintained customer with such bad practices.
bad,I would not recommend working in thr call center. There was no chance to move up. Daily reviews and critiques. Everyone just ooked after themselves. I would not go back.
bad,"I did not care for the Waste management position at all.  Not sure if it was a management issue or just a company issue, but I would not recommend the job to anyone."
bad,Love working outside fast place to work high energy I love the Press is going to have the job I love working with people with great pain and the insurance
bad,To many invasion of privacy laws broken at this company. If you do not trust the people that are working for you than they should not be working there.
bad,I would not recommend anyone to work there.This place is unclean and not a place that I would ever want to  work for or at again.....I don't recommend this as a place for anyone
bad,It is an horrible experience full of lies no hiring bonus.Trucks break down on a daily basis.New drivers get the worst trucks and no help from veterans
bad,We came up with counter dick each other they try to screw you on one roll but yet let you follow another rule they push you to do things that you're really not supposed to do
bad,"would not recommend to no one, this job has rats and rodents running around does not make it safe to work there at all. it smells very bad and they doesnt have the proper safety protection for the job"
bad,"Would not recommend this work place for anyone who cares about safety and themselves. The whole operation is very poorly managed."
bad,"I worked for this company."
bad,"I've had some terrible  jobs but this by far is the worst. Management is terrible, never have parts to fix the trucks, no communication at all, Ambridge is by far the worst location to work at, they expect you to keep trucks running with hopes and dreams basically. The trucks at Ambridge are hand me downs from other sites that are junk that other sites didnt want anymore.  Favoritism is out of control down there, one guy can do whatever he wants and violate company policies while the other guy gets reprimanded for it. Avoid this place at all costs. They preach safety and how much they care about their employess but its all BS. The only employees they care about are the drivers, they get catered to while the mechanics are under paid and mistreated and unappreciated for anything they do. You can work all night long and get trucks up and running so they make their money and come in the next day and be told what you didn't get done. Safety is not #1 there like they say, they let trucks go out that should not be on the road. The pay for what you work on is a joke, the health insurance isn't good. If you want to work for this company apply to be a helper. They make more money and have no responsibilities at all. The tool allowance is nothing, the boot allowance is nothing. Apply to Washington site. The techs there make more money and enjoy their jobs but they are a union site. AVOID AMBRIDGE AT ALL COST! They let certain mechanics act like they are a supervisor and try to tell you what to do or criticize you when they are nobody important and break policies themselves. This place"
bad,"Management awful! Always looking for ways to fire you, you never feel secure. Route manager follows you around trying to catch you doing something. Horrible truck that won't pass DOT"
bad,"Hi, it's money but did not enjoy. Would not go back. Coworkers were good. Management needs to improve.   In the end you are just a number. Work somewhere else"
bad,"No matter how hard you work, its never good enough. Management follows you around looking for reasons to fire you. So you never feel secure with your job. This was a non-union shop."
bad,I worked as an Outside Sales Rep. The management do not know what they are doing and demand 100 business cards a week. There is a lot of politics. A handful of reps get favoured and sales are handed to them. All other reps do not hit their targets. Management then puts the reps that are not hitting target on 90 day improvement plan and then they fire you. The director for ECA is the worst. She is the most uneducated person and all the managers are her minions.
bad,I have worked for this company for 6 years. They have the worst turnover in employment. Management do not listen to their employees. HR is only for Management and not the employee. Trust me if you apply for a job here you will not be there look. If you get written up it is on your record for a year before it drops off. You can not make any errors at all.
bad,"Working at waste management was a complete waste of my time..Pay sucks,the work is similar to slave labor,they work you like dogs during the summertime then come winter they lay you off..I wouldn't suggest this job to anyone.."
bad,"worked alone on second shift alone with no help and no hopes of other applicant hopefuls, management was not on same page throughout the company, you either had to be friends or family to progress, not a good place to work for"
bad,A typical day at waste management was very cold and long not in  a bad way. I learned a lot about garbage from working there like what's plastic and what's metal. Hardest part about the job was the smell of garbage every morning. The most enjoyable thing about waste management was the meetings they always made sure that you were fed good
bad,"I never seen a money delivery truck been follow but at this company I work before they always hide to watch you and they always follow you and tried to hide and follow you a lot,you will feel like vip been follow all the time,and all you have in the back of the truck is yard waste and trash"
bad,Never felt job security due to always outsourcing to another state or company without warning.The pay has got less over the years and the management is secretive.
bad,"Where do I start. They don't care about you as an employee and no I'm not saying that because I'm bitter. I'm telling you the truth. They don't have enough work so you will be off 1 to 2 days a week, the site manager is amazing but his boss the short guy with the big ears is a joke and he only cares about what kind of raises he can get. The only good thing about this company is the amazing group of guys you get to work with."
bad,"I have never worked for, nor heard of such a repulsive company. Between the abuse of their workers and their insane contract policies, I am shocked they are still in business. NOBODY should support a corrupt outfit like this."
bad,"Worked with WM for a 3 month period. Management treated the staff with no respect, yelling and making them feel that they are in grade 2. They couldn't even go to the bathroom without asking. Customer complaints all the time, billing and 3rd party customers are always complaining about services."
bad,"made people feel sick work long hours there "
bad,"Waste Management is an awful place to work, in my time I saw over 20 people come and go inside just one department within "
bad,although the job was in warmer weather year round and I got to see beautiful things on the way. workers are always irritated and they always seem to be on the negative side. although it's understandable that no one is happy about picking up other people's trash and garbage it really brought the energy of my temps down and most of them either left or got better jobs with a better atmosphere.
bad,"My time at Waste Management wasnt plesant. My managers were rude, Th company was unorganized and the employees were disrespectful."
bad,"Working for Waste management  was very fun. Somedays was very crazy and a head ache. But we manage to keep every thing on track. Some days we had maybe 6 or 7 trucks to break down. I had to order emergency parts or call a tow truck to pick truck up. As a parts clerk I paid bills for waste management maintain a credit card of 200,000 for each month that was use to buy parts, get truck fix, towing, food for safety events monthly. I really enjoyed my time at Wastemanagement"
bad,This is the worse job I've ever had you are a slave the managers are the worse people . I can't understand how they get away with working people so hard and long hours
bad,Waste Management is a horrible company to work for. They never trained. Management sucks. They try everything they can to make things difficult for you. They don't care. people are scared when they go into work there. My job there was simple but when I went to work there it felt wrong everyday. Management especially was rude and made threats to me everyday. Sometimes multiple times a day. I was never so happy to leave a company.
bad,Destroys your life and mood. Leadership there is pathetic and has the mindset of accepting failure and generally being a bunch of jerks. I recommend this to someone if they would like to destroy their life.
bad,Long hours and short pay. Management and dispatchers are not on the same page and not the best to work with. Trucks are old and in desperate need of replacement. Managers treat you like preschoolers rather than adults. Huge pay disparity between veteran and new hires.
bad,"If you have never had high blood pressure and are seeking to have a heart attack; apply here! "
bad,"In 1991, I started with Sanifill - a new company that had recently gone public.  We had a lot going on at this new company, and you never knew what was going to happen when you headed to the office each day!  In a few years, we merged with USA Waste, and then another change - in the late 90's - USA Waste took over Waste Management to become the 'new' WM.  Our team went through a lot of changes, and through it all, it was always a great company to work for.  I gained valuable knowledge about all operational aspects of the company, and enjoyed being the ""go to person"" for the newer employees who had questions about the history of our team and the company.  I enjoyed working with our Senior Leadership Team, and feel that I have a lot to bring to the table at any workplace.  I also have made life-long friends while working with Waste Management - and I believe that says a lot about the culture of any company."
bad,this company will work   you to death will not pay out and take  care of their  hurt employees and  cut corners that put their employees safety in jeopardy leaving their  staff to sue to  take care of all medical expenses..
bad,Leads went away and no way to make commission. Turnover is tremendous. 95 percent of my coworkers have left for other jobs.
bad,A very immature managerial staff. Safety not a priority or quality control for customer satisfaction. Advancement only obtained through personal relationships and not considered from qualifications or experience.
bad,"I was hired as a CDL Class A Truck driver but I did NOT drive a Truck pulling a 53' trailer. Instead they were NOT honest in telling me I was hired as a Labor worker! And 100% back breaking labor work with the supervisor always screaming at you telling you what to do every second of each and every hour that you work. This place was not honest and you will not get trained working with human blood and human waste, drug vials, syringes, needles all contaminated. Also contaminated biopsy materials, tissues and anatomical parts that emanate from surgery. You will be working with animal and human body parts with pathogenic microorgarisms infectious to humans. You will also be working and handle waste to include teeth, human corpses remains. All while YOU WILL NOT BE TRAINED and you'll be forced to work as a Labor worker NOT a CDL Class A Truck Driver that I and you will be hired for at your Waste Management Interview! And if you complain to your supervisor you WILL get a notice NOT to show up for work for at least 2 days with out pay! This company is NOT fair I would think twice before wasting your time coming to apply for a job and after your job interview if they like you and offer you a Truck Driving job you'll have to wait at least 2 months for a complete back ground check as well as you have to have good credit to work here and trust me they WILL check your credit. The Waste Management DOT physical is one of the MOST hardest to do and pass. You BETTER be in GOOD physical shape to pass Waste Management Physical Test at there Doctor! This physical test is NO JOKE!! If you have"
bad,I work for wm for 3 yrs and when I started it was great then they started this new sdo wanting you to do everything military style. Then they went from being paid by the load to hourly wage they said they would go off your yearly gross but that was not the case they went off your net after they took out your medical 401 K stocks child support then then they divided that into 40 hrs bs because I work my a## off I was making 120000 a yr then was given 20.00 a hr when I made 36 to 46 an hr don't work here
bad,Waste management treats everyone like just another number.  They over charge the customer and tell there employees it's there fault operating cost are too high.  There so called discounted rates they give employees for trash service is more expensive than there competitors.  All around just smoke and mirrors.
bad,"Silly place to work."
bad,"It was great to work for them while it lasted, but the company closed down."
bad,The management here sucks! The turnover rate is so high it's unreal. Promises are made but not kept. The list goes on. Be warned!
bad,"if you like standing still for 10 hours separating basically trash and inhaling some pretty bad smells, this is where you want to be!"
bad,Good company safety issues new management room for advancement bale dresser screener forklift operator
bad,"Goals are not realistic for a call center and will result in write ups and performance improvement plans used to fire you.  Management is absent and detached from the employees.  You are given vacation and personal days but will never be able to schedule them.  When you need off for sickness or other reason will get an occurance because you can't use your vacation/personal days.  The blame will land on your shoulders for every other department that can't or won't do their job.  There is no advancement, no raises, little incentive pay and not a happy place to work.  Your days are spent listening to customers yelling and swearing at you because they were not serviced or their invoice is incorrect.  The best part of your day will be when you punch out to go home."
bad,"the bosses where mean and discrimination,they where not good people, i thought i would ever work with , but did for some-wheres around 12 years you had to beg for time off and we where the last to get it so u ask for a weekend off a month from now put it on paper ans send it in they would say no you can Sunday Monday off 3 days be four you weekend off"
bad,"I was injured at work, not my fault. I was out on workman's compensation. Doctor approved to return full time, was asked not to return pending an “investigation”, then terminated."
bad,"they do not train their employees, i would not recommend this company or there services to anyone"
bad,"Working here is a joke. I worked at the tampa plant.  The management at this facility is totally incompetent.  From the Plant supervisor on down to the maintenance ""technicians"" they hire (by technicians I mean TRASH line sorters who are promoted to maintenance, dont have any skill or knowledge and are liabilities and gonna get someone hurt or killed)  no one at this facility has a clue about how a factory is supposed to run.  They pay next to nothing for a skilled trade position.  The benefits suck and the wasted management lies and discriminates. If you have a life and/or family,  I suggest you RUN far and fast as you can from this job."
bad,dont bother  no respect to anyone   treats all employees as a number not as an employee   make sure you do some background checking on who your boss will be   hint  undercover boss
bad,"Waste Management does not have great management. I enjoyed my time there, but the management does need to be reviewed."
bad,"It was a small dirty office, which I did not like the atmosphere at all.  It was for temporary help only, so I had to find something else within 3-6 months."
bad,They were not a very good company at all. I would sort through garbage and throw boxes. I had one 30 minute break and that was my lunch. I didn't get any other breaks throughout the day. They are a horrible company
bad,"I applied for a job with the company and 2 months later i was called in for an interview. The interview went very well. The route manager almost reassured me that i would be getting the position, he even went as far as to tell me that i would have to train in florida. I waited to receive a call regarding a start date. i never received a call, so i called asking about the status of my application mind you i interviewed in june and a month had passed and i hadn't heard anything from anyone. I called every 2 weeks like clock work, spoke to the route manager and he told me to be patient that i would hear from a recruiter real soon. I sent emails, i called and finally after 2 months i received a email from waste management thanking me for my interest in the company and that they had filled the position and would keep my application on file. i am well qualified i have over 6 years of Class A truck driving experience. I am a female. is this why they wouldn't hire me??"
bad,Once you hired their first intent is to fire you. They recycle people to cover their regular full time employees for summer vacations and for your first 90 days they will find any reason to fire you. They are more like a bad car salesman they brag everything up and make it sound good and once you've taken the deal you will find they want nothing to do with you!
bad,This was one of the worst places I've ever had to work. I wouldn't recommend applying to this company unless you want to be miserable.
bad,the management at that company is the problem the coworkers are fine
bad,No one knows how to run a company there. everyone just works for themselves no group effort
bad,One of the biggest hypocritical companies that exists. This place lies and has no interest in their employees welfare at all. I would NEVER recommend anyone to work for this company! All they care about is the bottom line
bad,I havent recieved my sign on bonus as of 5 months now. Not being paid the proper overtime in job description. Very racist environment here in Lafayette shop. It seems that only minorities work in the yard or in the garages and white people only work in administrative positions. I have discussed the racism /favoritism from the immediate supervision to managment. Nothing but slaps on the wrists. Its ok money. But its pennies compared to the environment.  Dont work for waste managment in Lafayette Louisiana....Especially if you're black! 
bad,Management I was under was very immature. Raises are measly. They give managers huge wages and the employees a quarter. The did not give any new employees bonuses but they continued bonus' for the rest.
bad,"I worked for this company in Vancouver BC, even though they wanted a driver I got hired as a swamper. Work is extremely busy in residential areas and very condensed tight routes."
bad,"I am a former CSR from the Kirkland, WA office. It is not a company that cares about employees. I was there for about 9 months until I was hired by another company. I witnessed 60 employees get let go during that time period. The place was compared to a POW camp. During the breaks employees would ""walk the yard."" They reduced breaks and lunches, so people were forced to stay on site due to the impossible task of making it back in on time and running the risk of receiving a tardy.They are big on micro managing and will look over shoulders to see what is going on. Anybody with family medical issues were advised that their time was more important at the job. An employee was not allowed to be by the side of their child who was undergoing surgery for cancer because the call center needed them more. A women had a heart attack and was taken away by ambulance, she was fired later that day for an unexcused absence. I received a call from a third party inquiring about why so many people left and I told them it was run like a prison."
bad,worked in a hazordous enviroment around people that barely spoke english and they were shut down by the city of tucson
bad,"This was a very discouraging place to work. There was hardly any training to provide the proper knowledge in order to do the job successfully. Management was horrible, business morale was at an ultimate low, co-workers compained all day, literally from 8:30 to 4:30. If you have waste industry experience you may do well in this position, but you must be willing to work with inconsistency, bad attitudes,no guidelines to help you with your job roles and little to know direction from management. Forget trying to get basic knowledge and relying on internal software in order to have something to help you with, the information is rarely updated with correct information. The pay is low too for the amount of pressure of the job, there are mice in the shop downstairs...very gloomy place to work. I also wrote a letter to HR expressing my concern and have yet to hear anything back from there, you will learn quickly that nobody really cares about you or what goes on there. I would be very hesitant to work in this position/location."
bad,management is stupit at the port albany they have know clue what their doing. Then they sit their and tell me how long it takes to go make a pick up of 45 mins not when you get a DOT 1 inp. that takes 45 mins to hour and 1/2. then the mangment have know clue about what needs to happen with CDL driver at the home offices.
bad,Horrible company and very unsafe work environment.  Management is only there for themselves. Union was just as bad as company. Safe yourself some aggravation and never work here!!!
bad,A tough and dangerous environment. Far too much manual handling of dangerous goods. Small end of life electrical manually loaded into bins.Company never offered me permanent contract despite working there over 3 years.
bad,"The company itself is a good company.  Unfortunately local management is something else to be desired. I feel I was bullied by management and when turned into corporate, local management said i must have taken it out of context."
bad,"Company/Management covers their butt and let’s workers fall to the wayside. Zero respect for us. Makes it clear that a week of training makes you an expert at your job, unable to make mistakes and told they pretty much own you and can replace you just as easy."
bad,"They will tell you anything you want to hear to hire you. DO NOT FALL FOR IT. This place is worst than the poorest country. As long as Corporate is off their butt, they dont care about you. A truck lost its ability to stay in park. They managed to ""fix the truck"" before the inspectors came to inspect the vehicle. Multiple people seen the truck being worked on. Yet they covered their butts and fired the poor dude. No wonder most of us is leaving...."
bad,"I gave my all for this company and was lied to about the salary. I also became ill from a chronic condition and in return was laid off.No one cared to check on me while I was out and would not take my Doctor's note for my condition. I moved closer for them, which meant I have to pay 400 dollars more in rent and to avoid traffic I would get there 3 hours early everyday. Dedicated faithfully, made no excuses and was never late but when I needed them the most they found it quite easy to just let me go. I would never recommend anyone to work there and my manager was the worst I ever had in my 20 years if working. She was completely horrible and had her favorites. I truly believe my skin color played a part in them not caring either. The signs were always there."
bad,"At least once a week the manager calls you not to come in to work due to job availability, you are not compensated for that day. They try to have you use your PTO instead. You never know when you will receive a text in the morning telling you not to come in. On several occasions, I've left the house only to be told to go back home because there were no jobs for me that day. Day to day is unpredictable."
bad,I work at the West Seneca waste management branch. These stupidvisers at my station are beyond help.  They all should take a class on how to treat employees that is why everyone there leaves or in the process I went here with a clear head and upbeat only to be let down. Clock in clock out is my motto here.
bad,Training is inconsistent told different things every week Management does not care about inconsistencies or impressions left on customers by attendants not all charging the same fees .Pay is low hours are high no work life balance only 1 day off per week.Hostile and Toxic environment.No employee longevity with this company???Corporate can’t figure out why????
bad,No eating or drinking in the trucks. No talking on the phone at all. Cameras to watch you at all times. I was told we would be working for 3 years or longer and they laid my whole crew off in 6 months
bad,Saginaw WM are a bunch of uneducated idiots. Trucks broke down daily and it’s always the drivers fault. People that have been there for a long time have no kids and are divorced with alcohol and drug problems. Route managers do nothing. Start at 18.00 for hard work lol I make 3 times that much and don’t smell.
bad,Dont care about your safety. Get the job done no matter what. Dont care about the workers. Trucks are very old and abused. Work less than 40 hours in winter but over worked in the summer. If you get hurt management wants to blame you and not take any responsibility. High turn around rate. Management preaches safety but bottom line is get your route done at all costs.
bad,"Unprofessonal, junk equipment, treated like garbage ( no pun intended). Hurry up and wait. They keep you just short of your 90 day probation then lay you off. And tell you they will call you when work picks up, then tell you you have to re apply"
bad,Transferred from another yard up north so anyone considering a transfer DO NOT transfer here go for Vero Beach. Extremely overworked trucks are complete garbage no ac in 100 degree plus weather. Numerous times had to throw routes without gloves because they didn’t have any.This yard don’t care about its employees or their well being. I did 6 years up north 3 weeks here
bad,"They ONLY care about numbers and NOTHING about the dedicated loyal hard working employees. You are JUST a body, and could care less about you. This place is DISGUSTING, and sorry I wasted a year with this place."
bad,The worst management and atmosphere at flint hauling location. Unsure why they don’t see this or do anything about it. Can’t keep drivers or contracts.
bad,"The job is very hazardous, poor working conditions, and you are exposed to heavy particulates in the air. The  many places in the facility isn't designed for the Technicians safety in mind."
bad,Work hard and nobody cares.  Work until you break mentality and then throw their employees in the garbage.  THe people who work hard have to cover all the slackers routes.
bad,"Poor management, favoritism, obligated long hours , rude speakers , judgmental people   , etc. all the things you have to put up with if you decide to work for this place."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working here. They make bad decisions all the time to make a splash on the stock market. About every 18 to 24 months, they'll let go of a bunch of employees to make it look like they are going to save a bunch of money on wages. The stock price will go up due to their wonderful decision. Then they'll hire people to replace those positions, only to have the cycle start over again. This is mainly for people in management. The drivers aren't usually affected by this process."
bad,"Need I say more?"
bad,This place is criminal. They hire violent convicted felons and expect you to work side by side with them. Other employees file false claims on you and management convicts you while your on vacation. The place is a joke.
bad,"Little to no training  "
bad,"Not a good fit for my personality.  Management were bullies."
bad,"Do not go there or work there. The people are ignorant, have no education. Honestly I rarely say this about people because I think people are smart but the people here have to be stupid."
bad,"Terrible place to work. 100% turn over rate. Crazy rules that change everyday. Hours are terrible the management is a joke. You cant eat,drink,smoke or do anything except drive. You are just a number. All they care about is getting two loads out of you a day no matter what."
bad,"If you love money more than anything else in your life then work here. If you value your life and family then this isn't the place for you, especially if you're black. If I could put less then 1 star I would. They won't allow me to post how I really feel so I'll just leave it at that."
bad,These guys fired me due to bad performance took me over 6 weeks to even get a manager to come out in review me but when he did I did everything I was trained to do in I failed in got fired I wouldnt work for these guys ever again in if I new they was the way they was I wouldnt never have in the first place was a complete waste of my time.
bad,All they want You to do is keep moving can't even get a break when you ask for one then when you get off break they want you to pack out another truck or help someone else even if you was alone an no one helped you
bad,Do not recommend. Very poor management. They over work there employees. Also don’t have qualified technicians to perform qulity repairs. Equipment is in very poor condition.
bad,this company is living in a fantasy world  lost touch with reality ! over 40 years experience the worst job conditions ive ever seen  tells you one thing but expects you to break all corporate  rules for the sake of getting job done  very old equiptment all needs to be replaced for safety reasons
bad,Worst management team ever. Over worked for little pay. Old trucks but exspected to have the. Running like new ones.the training is a joke. Just cya by the management to blame the employees if something goes wrong.
bad,WMSS is a pariah.  Management is inept and impotent.  You are a number and are expected to be abused by your customer.  Constant redundant paperwork and obsessive focus on EBIT. You do not matter to them.  You do not win on either side.
bad,Job was okay but the management had no experience in process of repair or how the plant is to be operated (repairs on machines). Clueless on safety; employees hosing conveyors down while being worked on (welding). Mangers/ employees waiting on machines to breakdown (no machine maintenance).
bad,"If you like kissing up to your boss, working mandatory overtime and feeling no appreciation for what you do then you will love this job. For the other 99% of us stay away."
bad,"I would never recommend this company to anyone.  They play favorites, there is a lot of backstabbing.  They only care about work, and not about family life.  They make you feel as if they are being inconvenienced if you are forced to miss work.  They made budget cuts every year, and fired people at the same time every year.  It was not an enjoyable work environment"
bad,"The union Grove facility in Wisconsin is terrible do not work there, you will regret it. Severely underpaid for the disposal of mercury and other hazardous materials. Management is terrible and bullish.  As many current employees will tell you, stay away."
bad,I was a mechanic  with good job ethics and hard working and was in disaplend for all the time written up for it twice and told the next time would be fired. because I would say something when I would see the other workers taking 2 lunches  and numerous smoke breaks.
bad,"garbage trucks broke down weekly and sometimes daily. Managment would talk down to drivers, treat them like children, and disrespect them. Managment had a name for this treatment— it was called coaching. "
bad,Your tenure will be very short. The quality of life is not balanced at all. Senior area management prefers to hire pervious co-workers and or friends. Making for a very challenging work place.
bad,"Waste Management was fun at the time I started. They had the customer's needs in mind. As the years went on the business end won over the customer end of service. When I left the daily number goals were unreasonable for anyone to obtain and keep. The ""unscrpted"" calls were being judged as scripted calls and thusly you were getting lower scores than you should have gotten, especially when the customer issue was dealt with the first time. The bonus's went from a percentage of your sales, to a percentage of the call center sales, to a percentage company wide sales. No raises were given out in 3yrs of working there. "
bad,I really enjoyed my co-workers. They would help you out when they can.
bad,I enjoyed the work but managment played favorites and overlooked some very major issues
bad,"I worked in resi for 3 yrs in Nashville tn with this company the management was so messed up and all they had was temps how could you finish a route with a temp I couldn't so I quit that funky place, so to anyone looking for a good job this is not the place ask someone that works there or read these reviews it started out good but after a year or so the place went to hell so maybe one day this company will close the door and hire someone that knows what to do instead of sitting on his but all day took away all the safety bonus and wasted the. Money on some stupid cameras but I'm so glad to be gone from that hell hole "
bad,Deceitful on work hours and mandatory overtime. No respect or understanding in regards to work/life balance. They push until you break. Equipment is junk and lack of hours of service and MTO requirements. Constant lies and chaos. I would not recommend this employer.
bad,"The worst place I have worked. The other employees well they will stab you in the back, and what management their is none. You are just a number in their big corporate machine and they don't care about you what so ever equipment is junk and you always feel like your looking over your shoulder they are out to get you type feeling NOT GOOD."
bad,"This place is toxic. You are better off being unemployed than working here. The first year was ok. I was promoted to Team Lead and then did not get much training. It was more of your team, your problem. When the team switched over to a new department, things got worse. Everything was my fault. Oh and pray to God your manager likes you or else they will do everything they can to fire you."
bad,"It was good when I  started, then it went downhill. They were looking for ways to get rid of you if you didn't play exactly by there rules. Also if you had to much seniority. (Then they had more vacation to pay out for less return even though you earned it)"
bad,"Horrible environment! No chance for advancement! They hire ""managers"" straight out of college without any job experience. Everyone I worked with including myself have had surgeries due to the excessive workload"
bad,The more you can do the more they would use you. When you finished your route they would make you help regardless if you had an appointment after work or had to take care of family. Would not work with you if your truck broke down or needed time off. Pay was good but managers would not help solving customer problems or route issues.
bad,"Transferred to Franklin, WI.  Received none of the training I was supposed to as a new hire.  None.  No onboarding or 2 week Florida company training that was promised.  My boss was useless, then quit a month after I started.  We were short staffed, so corporate sent us mechanics.  Our numbers went up, then corporate took 3 mechanics away, we lost an additional 2, and our numbers went down.  I was blamed and let go, which consistently happens here."
bad,"You can work hard and help your manager make a bonus and his 75,000 a year but at the same time your overworked and underappreciated. I love what I do and dont mind the hours but hate the drama and management. The main manager and assistant manager worry about themselves and nobody else."
bad,Customers were rude and would blame you for what Customer Service told them.  Customer Service would need better training on what the costs are to dispose of garbage at a landfill.
bad,"No work/life balance"
bad,"They don't have your back. Will work you long hours without enough of a break. Highly stressful job.They talk about safety all the time yet they will push their drivers till  they're about to drop. Constantly changing the schedule .Very micro managed. No incentives,no safety bonus."
bad,"Worst shop I’ve ever worked at. "
bad,Very toxic work environment. Managers micro manage with no clear direction. Encourages “tattling” vs peer to peer coaching.  Managers are both physically (personal space) and verbally aggressive.  There is no human factor when dealing with hard working employees.  Uses threats to fire you in order to get you to work harder. Unrealistic expectations.
bad,"they don't care much for their employees ..."
bad,"Management is poor! Co workers are just as worse, seems like no one is there to see you excel. You only benefit if they benefit and the supervisors are snakes."
bad,"I recieved a promotion along with all of it's responsibilities yet didn't recieve the raise in pay for two months, which was only supposed to be two weeks. When i said something after a month, they told me to wait another month for the raise, so i sought different employment"
bad,They would not give me the opportunity to tell them that I did not do anything disrespect the company or the staff. I just wanted to grow and maintain my position and move up and keep my mistake from any repeat   and if I had still been their I would tell other new employers that waste management do not except failure or no one that think you can come here if you don't take this job
bad,"A regrettable choice, dont do it. A sad example of a worplace."
bad,"The job is great at first, they pamper you and give you these high expectations but sadly enough, that is all short-lived. The day-to-day life of the job is monotonous. The job set you up to fail, a very negative working environment."
bad,"good pay, long day,s . if you like getting treated like a kid then this is the place for you .Dash camera,s watching you 24-7.new driver,s get the tuesday- saturday shift, and slip seating is expected, alway,s in a dirty unit. Planing a holiday here is terrible-seniority has first crack at holiday time off, driver,s must chok tire,s when vehicle is stationary, such as lunch break, etc. 60% of bin,s are compactor,s. the other bins are open top and usually have garbage in them from winter or are damaged and un useable. if you like the circus life then this is the 3 ring circus youv,e been looking for..."
bad,This I worked at the landfill at El Sobrante the guys there are basically slaves to waste management they haven't local 12 Union that has not gave them a raise and 15 years the experienced operators there make between 19 and they're Foreman's make only $24 an hour the union keeps lying about increasing their wages but if they vote the union out Waste Management might have a better package for them as in wages and 401K management is poor terrible place to work they get too much work into that place too many hours the guys are basically overworked... they only get a 30-minute lunch and most of the guys don't even take their 10-minute break because of all the trash that's coming in there
bad,"This company will lie to you from the beginning. The Hamilton location is constantly hiring, now why if at 28$ it was such a great place to work would that keep happening? Oh, that's right they treat staff like garbage. The woman in charge of hiring will tell you everything you want to here just to get you in the door. Once you get there be prepared to hear a completely different story. If you get close to the end of your probation get ready to be let go. Oh and the ""trip to Florida"" umm ya enjoy communal living with random people for a week welcome back to college. This place has not a clue, don't waste your time or license here what a joke"
bad,"I only worked with WM for 2 months and I left because I will not place myself in a position to do any Illegal work for them."
bad,No room for advancement. They have poor management and care little for their employees. Worked long hours and six days a week. If you like having no life and get little pay this is the job for you.
bad,"No motivation of employees"
bad,It was a very hard job that you have to work every day early in the morning to late in the afternoon lifting close to 300 to 400 cans a day and at least do 12 to 13 hours a day
bad,"Management is completely clueless, home by 3 everyday while drivers are out past 6 everyday. Equipment is a joke, usually down at least once a day. Most other drivers are older and stuck in their own stubborn ways. Not worth the time and effort cause they just see you as a body, never had any intentions of training me, just expected me to load all day everyday. Asked almost daily to mix trash and recycling on same truck. STAY VERY FAR AWAY!"
bad,"With a high turnover rate, you have to think twice about a company. Good old boy mentality between some managers and workers. If they dont like you, forget it. Keep stressing they're big trucks. No kidding? I had a CDL for 15 yrs. This isn't my first trucking job."
bad,This is a very much do as I say or go home no room to show a different way very much a place of hostile work environment this why they have a revolving door of people in Jacksonville
bad,I would not recommend this company to anyone. I have definitely been paid unfairly compared to other companies with the same labor requirements. I am seeking employment with a company with long term benefits
bad,"Low pay, poor management, little to no room for growth. Not the best work environment. This was a call center environment. System was very old not updated.. the managers would walk around every minute behind you, micromanaging your every move, very hard to take a restroom break .."
bad,to much pressure to employee they hire 3 persons and fired 10 and they make a interpretations of the rules only for fired employees and get their bonus.
bad,They preach safety but equipment is old. If their isn’t enough work for the day they ask you to stay home and use your vacation or not get paid. If you don’t make WM your life managers won’t like you
bad,"Long hours in junk equipment, high stress do not plan on retirement from this company they find a way to dismiss any employees that approach retirement age. Paper cuts and any other minor injuries must be reported or face dismissal. Reporting injury results in points towards dismissal"
bad,I wish I never worked for Waste Management.  The work was okay but the management was on of the worst things I have had to endure.  The pay was where it should be.
bad,Actually WM company has alot to offer but they need to re-evaluate manangement.  Wm is a great place to work for....i liked the weekly pay and time off but management is what makes everyone run from this place.  We have favortism......We have HR working with supervisors and not seeing any side coming from the employees...I worked there 10 years and the last few years there was horrible...They work together in getting rid of you if they dont like you!  Some managers were wonderful and you have others trying toooo hard!!!  Much better place if it was new management.....I17 and greenway area!!
bad,"Terrible place to work at, log hours far drive to work, long drive to work site truck old and falling apart management lied all the time did not take care of their employees"
bad,"Very stressful, zero gratification positions for drivers/supv/office admin. they let you know you were lucky to be there and everyone was considered mediocre/average."
bad,"You feel like a number rather than a person. Punch in have a ""safety meeting"" and then it's everyone for themselves after that. Only good thing are the drivers who take some time to talk to you."
bad,"No real training"
bad,"A very stressful place to work. Upper management says one thing and does another. Upper management totally sucks, they dont stick to their word even when they have point blank informed you of something. They fire people for the EXACT same things they do themselves. Stay away!"
bad,"Long hours  extremely poor work life balance horrible equipments or junks  trucks, poor maintenance when any truck is downed they don't have parts ready and to fix any truck with issues even small, it takes long time.Favoritism high level and WM takes your Life and sells your Soul.Horrible place to work to much pressure and Ridiculous some rules"
bad,"Waste mangement not a good place for any one to work it rain dirt has cat,rats, and bitds around in the facility.only gets a 30 minute lunch when the it's hard labor.must stay on the floor"
bad,"Not a good place to work,  poor local management, they want you to work long hours on sub par equipment, band aid repairs are the norm, the shop is dirty"
bad,"At first WM was a great place to work but unless you are friends with management you are never going to move up in the company. It has a high turnover rate, it is a negative work environment and expect to work lots of overtime."
bad,"Not a good night place to work,they never appreciate drivers and are constantly treating you unfair.Depite years of service and hard work they will turn on you instantly."
bad,Work days are to long and management has no driving or fleet operational experience. Along with that the pay is far below any other related company in the area.
bad,"Managers are not given the proper tools and equipment to satisfactorily perform their job.  The only thing that matters to this company are the numbers, not the people.  Upper management regularly fires employees on the spot for no apparent reason."
bad,"this is a bad company to work for everyday they knock you down you only here about everything thing wrong you did and your never good enough, the shop is a joke they have no equipment and what they do have its either broken and they wont fix it or they have one and 17 guys in the shop needing to use it, they want you to fix a truck with no parts so the guys there take parts off trucks that are parked to fix a truck, its a joke. once your on night shift you never leave you will never have a day shift job, getting a day off is a joke they have a rule only one guy off at any time so all the guys with the most years get the days off they want , the night shift boss is great at mad dogging you if he feels your taking to long its the evil eye all night long, everyday your there its like the life is being sucked out and you will have no life endless overtime stay away from this company ."
bad,Thankless managers that have absolutely not a clue on what to do and not one of them has a license to even drive a truck...oh yeah lets not forget about the 9 minute pre-trip they want or the 10 minute post trip...your treated like a king for first couple weeks then your a number like everyone else ...To sum it up the Top dogs are back stabbing spineless jellyfish the mid managers are puppets and they do not care if they pull out of Canada at all don`t waste even a thought of going to Waste of Management
bad,"Under direct orders, I was forced to violate company rules for fear of termination.  100 hour weeks with no appreciation for results.  When market turned south, rather than lay me off like an ethical company would do, they terminated me for violating company rules.  "
bad,"Treated more like a number than a valued employee."
bad,No room for growth. If you don't buddy up to the manager she will always find a reason to write you up so you can't move. It's a revolving door of people because the pay is so low. STAY FAR AWAY!!!!
bad,"wanted me to work all hours and weekend"
bad,"The pay was great. You bust your butt all week and when you see that paycheck, its worth it. Until they start taking houses off of you for some mysterious reason. So, now you are doing work for free.. The management at the Ambridge location has to be one of the worse I've ever encountered. Also, the trucks break down constantly. Once again management comes into play here and tries to cut cost and not fix the issues in a timely manner or at all. This had to be hands down the worse place I have ever worked. Avoid at all cost."
bad,Worst work I have ever been in. Management is the worst they rule through intimidation.Would not recommend this place to anyone.
bad,"A typical work day log in check work emails get call backs done and take calls. Management doesn't know what they are doing and they do not give you the tools to do your job, the pay changes all the time but the DOS like computer system doesn't (redundant work for a sale)"
bad,"Sucks! no home time looking to fire you treat you like 5 year olds supervisors that have no idea how to do the job and they tell you what to do. I just up and quit because I couldn't take it anymore I had a supervisor come out and follow us in an unmarked car to fire my loader called the corporate office and nothing got done about it, it sucks stay away. Junk trucks I could go on and on "
bad,"Its not the right place to work if you have family. They makes you work extended hours, not an organize place."
bad,"Cameras inside truck cab makes for a stressful work environment "
bad,Horrible staff culture were mistreatment is a common every day experience along with the rare occasional good job response.
bad,This company is the worst company I have ever bee employed by my time there was stress full to the point of destruction you might say. The safety  with waste management is terrible because of  management and the continue pressure on there drivers to achieve a goalthat is not doable in a time frame they request and trying to be safe in the process the many people have accidents  and people die get hurt weather it be an employee or citizens on route they care nothing about the workers or drivers just there numbers
bad,"You are expected to arrive very early in the morning to the shop.  Where you are then expected to wait to punch in until after you have bid on a local route.  Seniority is crucial in this process, and even though you have a ""permanent"" route you still bid to keep it EACH DAY.  After you eat up 30-45 minutes bidding you punch in, your helper punches in you start your route.  Some routes are short 6hr some are 10hr usually made longer if you or your helper are not experienced.  It was very hard to plan anything outside work because you never knew what you would be doing. The work was hard, and gross, bad weather days are intensified three times over.  Your pay is based on your stops so you WANT a lot of stops in fewer miles.  Which where I was did not always happen.    At the end of a 12 hr day you were often getting paid $7.00-$8.00 per/hour.  There is  a sense of accomplishment at the end of the route however, you know how much weight you hauled and your exhausted from your efforts.  If you were fortunate to get a shorter route on most days that meant you were expected to pick up a ""shut down route"" meaning one that wasn't covered by a truck on the schedule due to lack of staff, or lack of equipment.  This meant long days and it didn't matter much once you were in the truck you were expected to do whatever was asked as far as picking up the slack.  On three separate occasions during my time there I was on the back of a truck with three other helpers a very dangerous scenario.  At the end of the day the Drivers and helpers were good hard working guys who appreciated each others"
bad,Working in the call center is very stressful. Management liked to micro manage and never showed empathy and avoided helping front line employees. Management would have meetings over issues about customer bills being increased with fees and never took the initiative to resolve it unless the customer calls in to report our error. Policies change everyday no consistency. They screw you out of bonuses by making it impossible to meet the targets. Your expected to rush the customer off the phone and still resolve the customer issue under 2 minutes. The pay was ok considering upper management would get paid better than those really working and merit pay freeze for years. Schedule changes with no real compassion for people who are single parents or family oriented. Lord forbid you are sick they just screw you around. No opportunity to get promoted from within unless you snitch and kiss management's butts. No real training when helping other call centers just read this paper and take calls. Your own manager can't help you just call or email the people on the training paper. You don't value your employees and your customers.
bad,"I worked for WM for 10 years 6 and sometimes 7 days a week.... Mid management refuses to tell the truth about the facts of how much time and equipment it takes to get the job done. OT is not an option it is mandatory. Some of the oldest equipment in the industry can be found in the northeastern part of the country therefore the down time per unit magnifies the need for OT!  Upper management has such a ""Crony network"" I do not see this company changing no matter how much advertising they do during all pro sports venues. It could be better but I do not see it happening with the current structure!  LOW pay is an understatement. Some Route Managers are on SNAP and their children are on the free lunch program..."
bad,"Everyday is like walking into a new job.  Never know what is in store for you.  No consistency, no training, your given a piece of paper and told to learn  between calls.  Management plays favorites.  As long as you agree with every single twisted idea they have, you should be okay.  Sales don't matter in this sales department.  Just kiss enough corporate behind and your good to go.  Your opinion means nothing.  Mandatory Time Off, meaning you drive to work, get there, then made to go home without pay.  Their customers are treated horribly as well.  Extremely high turnover that their customers are put into a call center merry go around if they ask to speak to their sales agent, that would be because the agent was either let go or has quit."
bad,fork lift cherry picker love to operate fork lift . the hardest part bof the job was the had no right size gear for me and i learned to adjust to it
bad,This is not the OTR company that company driver should work for but there is a lot of truck terminals.
bad,"Lack of knowledgeable people to train in job"
bad,"I would not recommend a Sales Position in the Industrial Division in the Midwest states. Extremely high turn over for no reason. One Director has terminated over 20 people for no reason in the last few years. HR allows it to happen. They will not stick up for the employee's. One would think a few red flags might be raised, but they don't care."
bad,"They closed the call station, laid off everyone and paid very little. Management was incompetent and un-knowledgeable."
bad,front line managers are treated like door mats. The drivers have more authority than the manager. front line managers are expected to make the drivers happy at any cost to themselves. the company has taken employee engagement principals to an extreme that interferes with the proper operation of the company. the compensation and expected labor hours for front line managers is not as expected and not equitable.
bad,"Worked in the call center in Commerce,CA"
bad,"biggest waste of my time. some how had a week of my vacation taken away from me. management only worries about themselves and their bonus which then means the work truck is never fixed the correct way and the empolyees get treated like dirt.(unless your a favorite). there is just too much to list. this isnt the job for you if you want to be apart of your family an help raise your kids. if your a good, true hard-working employee you will get used and abused"
bad,"Your day starts anywhere from 0300 util 0930. You are expected to work at least a 10 hour minimum, 12 hour preferably each day. You are made to feel inadequate if you are not there for at least 12 hours. You do not have the tools to do your job (trucks, trained personnel) and what you do have is substandard. Your requests for these tools falls on deaf ears. Management is not responsive to either suggestions for improvements or change. Everyone that works there are constantly frustrated by the conditions. Drivers are forced to work in 100+ degree trucks due to no air conditioning or even a fan for their entire 10+ hour shifts. They pay well, but they will take more from you personally than they give to you monetarily. The most enjoyable part was leaving."
bad,was told very oftend to take my tool box and go home. was talked to worst than i have ever been talk to in my life. the language cursing. the write up over stupid stuff. my nerves grother me all the time i didn't know if it was my last day or not. the lead man even wrote my last on the calender.
bad,..read below when your Customers complain of these practices-you will get fired for the policies of the company...
bad,They expect you to fix Junk garbage trucks on a 8500$ dollar a month budget when one truck needs 15000$ worth of work and not to mention they have trucks that are unsafe and shouldn't be on the roads.
bad,Company is very salty. Often times management is not helpful in helping an employee to advance. Work culture is bland at most; but hey it's a gig. I wouldn't recommend nor go back it was an experience that I just wouldn't do it again.
bad,"Vindictive managers that play favorites. Very lazy management, poor training. Grumpy co workers. Pay is decent but not for what you deal with. Be ready to be in a negative environment. Safety us a joke here. They act like safety is priority, but after they fly you to Arizona for poor two week training, you will then see how bad it is at your yard"
bad,"the drive cam is used to remove you you and is appareent in the way that managers conduct their training"
bad,You have to follow every safety rule. At any point if they want to bad enough they will terminate you and say that it was a safety issue. The managers allow who the want to look past the rules. If you want to advance you better not be on there bad side or they will say they can’t afford to let you move up that there department needs you.
bad,"$26.00 per hour at this time for 40 hrs or less seems great! Wouldn't you rather see a better check with some overtime though?"
bad,The management is absolutely terrible u look the wrong way and ull get written up or suspended inward facing cameras to spy on drivers the money is good but thats it they will skip the whole graduated punishment 1-3-5 day and fire you dont put the stress of this company on your back becuase they dont care phuk that place and its management
bad,Horrible culture. Too much stress for what you get paid. Run away work somewhere else.  Slow to give raises. Area management has no clue how to work with people especially other managers.
bad,"The mrf in Tampa is very bad place, mostly management are terrible, corporate need to clean house ,a lot of workers call this place the prison of Tampa, I am sureprised this place doesn't close down soon, only we can hope so"
bad,"I worked at the Woodstock location and let me begin by saying its very UNSAFE!!! The trucks are not maintained at all and they put ""band-aids"" on the trucks and send the drivers out in them. The manager here is not qualified at all for the position and does a poor job at running the place.. The only reason this place is still in business is because of the drivers and the years of experience "
bad,Truck are falling apart and they refused to do anything about it. Upper management doesn't care about drivers or customer service. Matnance will not bring trucks up to DOT standard.
bad,"management lie a lot , not good training on your driving part  . safety sucks  not good no good  not good not good company , no good training ,They put you on new rounds you never see before"
bad,Management is terrible. They are in competition of each other of who is more popular rather than fixing issues. There are bullies in the office. If you complain to management nothing is done. They take the hardest workers in the office and be little them. They allow slackers to fall asleep and do bare minimum. If you're a hard worker then you will have to pick up everyone's slack while they sit and chat with one another. Don't bother asking for help if you need it only the strong leader there will help. Everybody is just busy gossiping
bad,The biggest joke iv ever worked at. None of the managers or leads have any clue on how to do there own job. Leads are also a joke and you will never hear anything but excuses for those said people.
bad,"worst place i ever worked, rush through their so called training even thought you already know how to do the job but now have to change how you do it and conform to their way.  and  you must remember everything in their ""safety books""  so hope you have a good memory to remember every single rule the deem to be acceptable.management is a joke other drivers were awesome."
bad,"A company so big that it never played offense it just put out fires when it needed to. The game plan was to tax and fee the customers into cancellation and if another company got big enough to get on their radar, buy them and get their customers back. Cult like environment where if you didn't think like the hive, you'd better hide it or get rolled over. Every day was worse than the day before and when you saw me while I was working there you were seeing me on the worst day of my life."
bad,If you complain they retaliate and human resource do not help you they make excuses for the supervisors who have wronged you every one is afraid to speak up cause they don’t want to lose their job yet they are unhappy . You can’t break rules but supervisors break them
bad,the job is smelly and working conditions are poor. the equipment was always breaking down. its a high pass fast moving job where making money is more important than the safety of the employees.
bad,My Route Manager was an awesome person and he understood the meaning of family time.
bad,"There are pros to working here but make sure you talk to people and do all the research you can first, this job is not what it seems from the outside."
bad,I would 100% tell anyone who asked not to bother. Treat u like babies. Write up for sneezing. Have to basically hold hands to do everything. Management tries there vest to fire u. Revolving door
bad,Alful place to work management constantly trying push  employees to do more to the point that they become unsafe the overall morale is terrible because the management makes the employees feel as if the are worthless and can not do anything right also basically brainwashing the employees  into thinking that you cannot leave the company and go to another driving job and make the same kind of money and benefits .
bad,Management is unfair.  Does not follow policy. I liked the hours of operation abd weekends off.  Gave time to spend with my family.  Stick options are nice. Weekly pay is nice.
bad,"Management was allowed discriminate freely against individuals. Human Resources provided no support and simply did not care about the employees, nothing but a number."
bad,If like driving  trucks from the year 2000 trucks be breaking down this is the place for you... I would never ever in my life reference not even my enemy to come here stay away it is the worst work environment ever.. Especially the Pasadena Texas yard please you were warn...
bad,"Waste is Full of Managers, but that is it, they lack leadership and follow through, they roll out all of these grand plans and follow through on zero.  They also have this weird habit of throwing more Managers at every problem so they can argue about how to get it done instead of do it.  "
bad,I was treated poorly and did everything that was asked of me. They fired me for doing what they asked me to do. In Florida they tell you one thing then when you return home safety and sanity go out the window at least at the Knoxville location I worked over sixty hours on a weekly bases. I worked over fourteen every day.  All because management would not listen I had  six years in at republic and was never treated this bad. They told me every day I was going to get fired.
bad,"The hours are long, and they don't pay you enough for all the work that they have you to do. It's a very stressful environment, with horrendous supervisors to make working there even more agonizing."
bad,"When you start working here, everything seems wonderful.  I had fabulous training in Houston, then when I got back from training was when my manager became intolerable.  He has a lack of experience managing people as he has only managed people for less than a year.  I would ask for help, and I was told to go ask the other reps.  When all the reps are females, females are less likely to help you than males in my experience.  Favoritism happens here big time.  When you allow other reps to sell things, and then tell others they cannot, are you not pulling the rug out from under them and being completely unfair.  There is a major disconnect between the higher ups and local management.  A good boss/manager is supposed to be a good coach.  Unfortunately I had a bad coach.  My advice to Management is to stay positive and when an employee asks you for help, actually help them instead of telling them to ask the other reps.  If you want your employees to succeed and stay loyal to the company then be a good coach."
bad,Worked for the company 11+ years they couldn't keep personal. The turnover rate was excessive. Overworked everyone then punished them for overtime and reduced productivity. There were many safety issues and I don't see it getting better as the available employees decline. The money and benefits are great if you don't mind the bipolar attitude that management has toward the workers.
bad,"Managers tell you to do something a certain was and when something happens turn their back on you. The other driver talk about you and spread rumors. 50,000+ rules more made each day. They are always looking for a reason to fire you. 55-65hrs a week, no A/C in trucks temps hit 128 degrees. Trucks are beat up and run down repairs consist of zip ties and tape."
bad,"Managers Not Professional, micro managing, temperamental and short fused. demands time away from your family and than does not appreciate it. Nit picks and disciplines over the smallest things."
bad,Waste management is a job for those who have a CDL and can handle operating fulltime on the trash truck. You don't get any hours due to lack of route openings and management doesnt hire anyone because you must have a CDL to drive.
bad,"Absolutely horrible place to work. They do not care about thier equipment or employees. The management only cares about spending as little money as possible so they can get thier bonuses. The managers and supervisors are absolute two faced worthless people at the Woburn, MA location. If DOT was to walk into this location over three quarters of the fleet would not be able to leave the yard because management refuses to buy parts and update fleet so they can get thier bonuses."
bad,"Massive turnover, Bullying.  They treat customers and employee's worst then trash. Most drivers work very hard under extreme stress and then in the morning or afternoon they are belittled and threatened over minimal nonsense. When you give non educated people a little bit of power its ripe for abuse. Managers will throw anyone under the bus to make themselves seem appealing to the corporate office."
bad,Its a nice sale when they first bring you on. but once youre in the seat its not so cushiony. lots of favoritism. lack of equality. lack of fairness for all employees.
bad,hard to work with management that doesnt have expierence in the business. the work is not hard its a good job u stay busy real busy 60-65 hours 6 days
bad,"For a large company. There is a lot of screwed up locations. West Fargo ND is one of them. Managment there sucks. Trucks are band-aid together. Even their famous tablets are third rate. My personal GPS would be 100 % better. Not a day goes by that I miss that place. Stress free. Money was good. But , cant spend it if your dead! Waste Management you really need to rebuild. You have major problems here."
bad,"other employees are great to work with but to many managers trying to hold on to bonuses managing by bullying and intimidation and slight of hand tactics with pay, drivers are always to blame for everything"
bad,"I worked there for 3 months.  Then I found out they have two escalators in the fine print on the back of their contract and a escalator of CPI plus 6%.  It looks like a 3 year contract but you have to cancel 90-180 days before expiration.  This produced increase of 10 to 15% per year.  A total rip off."
bad,"In the summer you will work 12-14hrs a day.  In the winter you will be forced to use vacation or personal days because they are so slow.  Management is absolutely horrible. They only staff 2 day time mechanics so nothing ever gets fixed unless its shipped to an offsite mechanic.  Any issue that comes up throughout the day is ignored, or passed to someone else by the route manager.  "
bad,"If you are thinking of working here, go drink bleach instead. Management is a joke, there is no career advancement unless you become bff's with the supervisor and don't even think about having a family/life because you will never see them. You will get no bonus, no respect, no training, oh but you do get a free t shirt."
bad,"OMG!!!!!!!! The management is HORRIBLE.... WE was trained to do the job incorrect, we was put out on the floor to take call with my classmate and we both don't know what to do/ sink or swim.....When making a mistake due to you was trained wrong you was called into the supervisor office and harassed. The floor leaders refuse to help you and very disrespectful... NOt a Good place in commerce,ca"
bad,"Equipment is by far the worst I have ever driven. For the work load that we do here we would have nicer newer equipment. I drive a truck that was new in 1993!!! No joke, we get worked 14 hours a day most of the trucks don't have a/c in summer and the heaters don't work in the winter time. Management is by far horrible. At this location you are just a number to them. You are not a human being. Just becareful and think about coming to work for waste management, just remember you are only a number to them. We have a high turn over rate here in roll off here in Indy because of the trucks we drive and hours we work. We have no family time at all. I can't say anything good about this company nothing. I have wasted several years here for nothing."
bad,"This Company has so many rules, a camera on the driver 24/7, they pay a company (SAFECOM) to ride around watching the driver while servicing customers to see if they are in compliance, then the route manager will also sneak around on the route following the driver, no communication policy on the yard and in the truck with co-workers. I have never seen a company spend so much money to get rid of good drivers. I witness drivers being sent home for three days no pay for having an accident- by not fault of the driver. Everyday you run job scared. I was lucky enough to leave on my terms not theirs. In five years I had four different Route Managers. I would like to think as a whole company it is good, but the branch I was at--- really could use a total make over from the ground up. I enjoyed my job and what I did. However the Company/Branch made it easy to leave."
bad,Coworkers always seem to be unprofessional. And higher ups never seem to want to let you explain or elaborate on any situation. Lots of walking and monotonous task. Overall unpleasant work environment.
bad,"Bad Managers , Bad HR , Bad Supervisors , your just a number to them and nothing else"
bad,Your work day will start anywhere from 330am-6am .it wouldn't be a bad place to work if management left you alone.all they do is follow trucks around all day .they park far away so you can't see them .you can't even take a drink of water with out getting in trouble.they have cameras watching everything you do in the truck.if they don't like you they will find something to fire you about.they all ways give you more and more stops and still expect you to return the same time.i will never figure out how they have people telling you how to drive and inspect your truck and the people telling you don't even hold a CDL licence ? Went almost 2 years with no raise they no longer do driver bonuses they are only for the managers and corporate people.
bad,When I switched over to Waste Management I was told we would have a ton of work.  I'm not even in my third month and I only worked 20 hours last week.  The management is horrible here and isn't willing to keep their guys hooked up.  Don't come to work for these guys on the Bakken.
bad,"By far the most dangerous company I have ever been a part of. I have been a professional CDL driver for 25 years and in one month with Waste Management, I was put in more unsafe and blatantly dangerous situations than all my previous years. The drivers NEVER pre-trip their trucks and the mechanics put band aids on bullet holes. If you are a driver serious about your safety record AND you value your life, do not consider WM. You have been warned. Find another opportunity!"
bad,Working for this company is almost impossible.Their is no way to keep your sanity and work for them.I would never recommend working here to anyone.The only ones that are happy are the management because they can treat you anyway they like with no recourse.
bad,No I would not like to review Waste Management.  I worked for them for six years.  Presently I have a Discrimination Suit against them. I'm extremely upset with how they do business.  Not only with me but with other people too.
bad,"While the Insurance and retirement are very good the lack of pay and very little chance of advancement are dissapointing in a company of this size. We had a change of Market area where I worked and the District manager told me that I was making a dollar less an hour than what i should be making and that there was nothing he could or would do about it, the same went for my other coworkers that were making the same as me. We were working consitently working 14 to 15 hours a day with equipment that was falling apart. We continually had equipment break downs that was just half way put back together just to get it back to work."
bad,If you like being treated like a child and always being stabbef in the back you will like wm.
bad,"I am a current employee... for now. Unbelievable how management treats drivers. For the most part they only care about overweights and incidents/ accidents as this reflects their bonuses. You will be suspended and/or terminated for these ""violations"". Very high turnover rate. Unorganized management styles. Long hours. 6 day work week. Less and less incentives. Raises...lol. Safety bonuses... extinct. Cutbacks on drivers, temps, routes making days much longer. No positive remarks. No room to advance within company as a driver unless it's another driver position. Inequality at all levels. Will not pay hourly, instead ripped off with day rate. Much more could be written but I don't have the time. I love my family and miss so much time with them. I hate this job."
bad,"This place did not allow for anytime with my family. I worked about 12 hrs a day, 6 days a week, and sometimes on Sunday too. There also seems to be a lot of favortism at the particular location that i worked at. You were not valued on what you could do, but instead who you know."
bad,"While working as a roll-off driver in one year i saw 9 great workers either quit or get fired because of Unattainable goals and an Unfair point system where you get points against you for things like... you twist your ankle at the job, these go against your performance, even though it has nothing to do with performance. They will have to revamp this system or get rid of it all together because it OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T WORK.....A High Employee turnover Rate....9 in one year....ENOUGH SAID!!!!!"
bad,If you want to work at this company in any position the only PROI is the pay and benefits. If you like to feel like your inaduate and be SLAVED and isolated from your own personal life THIS IS YOUR COMPANY TO SLAVE ON.
bad,"my typical day at work is sorting and removing metal,paper.etc.a lot of friendly and fun co-workers. how to work as a team, so everything at work can be enjoyable.management not a lot to say but need alot of work regarding some personals. the most enjoyable part of the day is the end of the day, no more smell of garbage."
bad,no appreciation whatsoever spent 15 years working for them nights graveyard all the holidays ect... not ever a thank you or so much as a christmas card I regret all the years I wasted working there
bad,If you work harder than the lead.  He will talk bad about to the manager.  What I learn I had to on my own.  Management if they can't find dirt on you.  They will pay others to give you a hard time.
bad,Their is a lot of favoritism. They are not fair. You have to be in the click to get treated fairly. Manager's can treat you any kind. Company no good.
bad,Wasn’t at a good location  and had a bad supervisor. They made us work on our days off Nd threaten to fire us if we didn’t come to work on the weekends and that’s not fair
bad,"The location in which I work is very disorganized, very  little training, bad culture with toxic employee's. Management favors certain employee's he had befriended outside of work."
bad,I would recommend to work for the company but evaluate if its a good fit. I mean benefits are excellent. But money isn't everything. Have self respect and pride.
bad,Long hours clock in at 3 pm clock out around 3-4am five nights a week Management rarely to be seen zero opportunity to advance your career lots of money but no home life
bad,This very stressed environment management keep changing people and it's all about what you do wrong even when you are told that you did something good they still find something bad to say about what or how you did it
bad,"If you want to give a company your soul then this is the company for you ,it’s all about the bottom dollar, management could care less about you or your family life they suck the life out of you"
bad,Worst management team ever. Great company but incentive  pay sucks any little issue drops your pay even if traffic jam is in front of you. Good company but Memphis tn. Absolutely sucls worked there 12 years new mgr came In and literally ran all us veteran employees away.i wouldn't recommend working here absolutely not.
bad,"A typical day started at 5:50 am with a Safety Meeting."
bad,"Very micromanaged, For the pay and the work you do - Not worth it. The drivers in Roll Off were great, Other than that it is just a job and not a career."
bad,Management was pitiful...unknowing of the job... equipment is in poor shape and very unsafe...most co-workers only look out for themselves... wouldn't recommend working for them
bad,"bad management, poor work condition, broken and missing shop tools that never get replaced or repaired. long work hour that don't get appreciated especially when at hire they tell you 45 hours a week. Christmas and thanksgiving are the only holidays you get off."
bad,good job nut at the time money wasn't enough management was good work atmosphere was good employees were great to work with and management were great and easy to communicate with
bad,I hate waste management  from my heart.  Upper Management treated employees like they were disposal diapers. Very unprofessional upper management. Would not advise the timid to apply.
bad,"Big difference between management an hourly employees, HR constantly harassed certain individuals for example being Hispanic in a RM position was frowned upon here in Phoenix."
bad,"When I first started there were 3 people per truck for residential now, it’s only 2 just the driver and helper to do over 800 or more houses a day. They rather overwork their employees than to get a temp as they’ve been doing. Managers will throw you under the bus to keep them from getting in trouble. They show favoritism and discrimination is at a all time high. I’ve been here 8 months and looking for another job as we speak because they only care about their yearly and quarterly bonuses. I’ve called coorpoand nothing has been done so that means it’s time for me to leave. They also over work you and if you don’t ask questions you will be lost in a world wind. Very bad company to work for. The trucks never work so it slows you down on your route waiting for them to repair them. They half fix the trucks just enough for you to get the route up, they send you out on route with trucks that will fail DOT IF PULLED OVER!!!!! If you’re not used to making good money then this may be the job for you. $18 is. not enough for what you go through"
bad,I went here thinking it would be a career it turned into a nightmare. My boss was a new hire he was really cool but did not really have any control over the people who where suppose to be working under him.They wanted us there at 545 am every morning but they did not want to pay us until 600 or 615. It was very unorganized they did not even have the correct maps for our routes. Unless you are one of the boys don't bother. The pay I was told I would make was not what I was paid.
bad,They have the buddy system there anybody on first shift does no wrong everybody on 2nd and 3rd Shift is always wrong and messing up first shift can steal money from and management won't do nothing but somebody starts dozing off and they get fired 2 or 3 hrs Past schedule time
bad,Lack of leadership and when you finish your route they make you do more and they have back doors so you’ll have let’s say 255 back doors that you put 110% to finish and they give you 60 more like you didn’t just do a whole route and say you have to help trucks are terrible breaks down all the time and they never fix it when you tell the just a stressful group of Management and you get no home time you work over 12 hours a lot my advice don’t let them lie and get you to commit like they did me
bad,"My trainer wasn't good at all. She's more of a ""this is how to do this task"" instead of explaining the screens and the purpose of each task. She definitely has a tell you how to do the job, throws you to the wolves attitude. One cannot at their job with this type of training. You are expected to know the job the first few days of starting."
bad,Drivers are appreciated for all their hard work. Hardest part of the job is the work load and best part of the job are your co-workers who appreciate you effort.
bad,Racist pigs. Unfair management and leads. The Sups and leads favor certain employees. They bully enployees that are not in their click. Sups are very racist. They offer paid time off but remove your requests without your knowledge.  Favorites get slaps on the hand for mistakes while others get write ups.
bad,"Waste management starts off as a good company to be at. then you start to notice that the parts are way under stock, along with a fleet as large as they are they run out of fluids, pumps takes months to replace, no set schedule no communication with the techs. the only positive is if you get into the company the only way to get fired is to hit another employee,"
bad,"As a route manager you will not have any life outside work. You will have more on your plate than you can possibly get done in one day. This provides them with their excuse to terminate you whenever they feel the need. The company has a turn over of 74% at the route manager position. Again, they know this but fail to correct it because managers are a dime a dozen to them. You will always have constant employee turn over and trucks going down. They will bring in another facility's rejects to replace your bad trucks. Then they'll tell you that's a ""new"" truck to replace the old one. They bumped up the amount of years to get a NEW replacement truck from 10 years to 15 years. CRAZY!  Don't expect cost of living raises to cover your health insurance increases which are yearly. You will work close to 60 hours or more. I can't imagine why the high turn over at the route management position?! These are not exaggerations. Just the truth.  There is way too much pressure because of the high turn over and poor trucks. Not to mention the tasks on your plate you cannot get done."
bad,needs ethical and morally sound management.
bad,"Management is at a preschool level."
bad,"Terrible work conditions, equipment is old and outdated, hours are terrible and lack of employee support.  Not properly trained, management response to concerns is discouraging."
bad,This is a call center with High expectations. You were barely allowed to breath after disconnecting with a call before you are required to answer the next.  Every phone call is recorded and once weekly you had to sit with a supervisor and review three of your random calls.  they were required to find at least one thing wrong even if your call was excellent and the criticism was NOT constructive.  It was brutal to work here. You also have to supply your own office supplies. I'm talking pen and paper.
bad,"the job was enjoyable, lots to do & learn. the equipment/trucks need improvement.  co-workers are easy going on the most part.  Starting at the bottom ensures that you have to go out of town to cover in Burns lk, Smithers, & Terrace so expect the first year working out of town a lot."
bad,Unfortunately Waste management doesn't  allow you to further your career if you are not attractive or in managment's circle of friends.  I would no longer want to recommend
bad,"I stayed with this company for a long time because i had just started a family and need the medical benefits.  This company does not no the meaning of the word team. It is every man for him or herself here!! Not having the equipment to do your job which includes trucks, parts to fix the trucks, a good reliable crew to get the routes done are just some of the many faults at this company! All you want to do is get the job done and go home but management makes this a absolute nightmare. The cut throat world at the management end of this company is something else. I left this company feeling i had wasted years of my life!! To make a long story short don't get trapped here and feel like there is nothing else out there. The day i left this company that night i got the best sleep of my life!!! Get out while you still can!!!"
bad,"Management isvery difficultto deal with. Nepotism and favoritism certainly exist here. Daily work is okay,until your work is interrupted to assist other departments with work. When your work is behind due to helping other departments, you are now forced into mandatory overtime."
bad,"This company could be a good place to work, however the management is very poor quality and not employee friendly, unless you are a union employee. I would never recommend working for this company in Edmonton, AB. I have no idea what it is like elsewhere but in Edmonton it's all about the money. Employee's mean nothing."
bad,Poor management blame the employees for management problems and feel like they don't care for the employees and treat everyone like a number on a sheet
bad,make picking up trash and recycle hard with miltary like ways way better off at gfl or republic services unless you like working with a camera in your face all day that is if you are a driver!
bad,Overworked 4 days a week. One place I would not wish on my worst enemy to work at any given time. Most times in order to complete your maps< you have to skip breaks and lunch altogether.
bad,Do not work there.  Back stabbing bully tactics by management. Vehicles are not road worthy. Poor management. Say one thing to your face and do another. Zero cross communication. You will be another slave.
bad,"Very micro-management ran. Worst company I have every worked for. No compassion for employees or their lives outside of work at all. Customers really dislike this company and share that with you very openly. Based on how employees are treated, it's not hard to see why. The only upside was that the compensation was good at the time, and budgets were decently easy to obtain in terms of earning commissions."
bad,"Giving this company my very best, was unfruitful due to the lack of support and appreciation from management. Albeit, I did advance to a higher level CSR, the level of performance I accomplished (99/100) was still insufficient compared to those who did exponentially less."
bad,lets start of by saying I haven't quit because I haven't found a new job. the job can get hard on the body. some of the people you work with are nice others.. not so much. defiantly not worth the pay. long hard days no matter what weather for basically minimum wage. I don't know about all agencies but the one im with is horrible. They take forever to reply back to you IF they do. constant mishaps over scheduling and payment. lied about pay increases and being hired on. TO ALL LOADERS WHATEVER AN AGENCY SAYS YOU WILL NOT MAKE OVER 13/HR AND WASTE MANAGEMENT WILL NOT I REPEAT WILL NOT HIRE YOU ON. During busy season its easy to make 600 in four days if you are willing to put in the hours. But as of now I am LUCKY to get 2 shift a week. it is march. This is from personal experience cut my agency out and it would be 10000000000x better of an experience
bad,"No acknowledgement of a job well done ever, promotes from within to sub par employees, if you work your butt off you get no where. Where people slack others have to pick up the pace with no thank you. Horrendous attendance policy, good luck going to the bathroom when you are on the clock. Wastes money on frivolous items instead of giving raises where deserved. Drivers are lazy and make big bucks and thats just great!"
bad,"you try so hard to work and get the job done but you are not good enough for those with more senority I call them HATERS, the working forman and the supervisors lack of experience and knowledge UPPER MANAGEMENT DO NOT have what it takes to run a plant this big, but if you kiss their butt the will love you and promote you specially if you are a snitch,,,you just have to know how to play their little game."
bad,"I was hired as a Inside Commercial Rep  (ICR)  training was for 3 weeks and it did not prepair you for the job once on the floor.The trainer said it can take up to 6 months to learn the job. I never worked for a company where your co-workers were not willing to help you because of the sales portion of the job. Waste Management said they would assit you with learning the job but will fire you before your 90 days were up do to poor job performance. Out of the 11 new hires 2 quit once on the floor and 3 were fired. The ICR they kept missed days and were late I know at least 2 of the ICR are on verbal warnings but they were not fired. I was hired for my Customer Service experience which is over 20 years and was told WM they will train you for the sales portion which is not true they expect you to be on the same level as the seasoned ICR with in the 2 month on the job, all of them have over 10 years experience at WM. I fill WM was unfair and unwilling to gave new hires to chance the learn and grow with the company."
bad,Thought it was a good company to work for.  However they lay off people left and right!!
bad,"If you are right out of high school, college or have been terminally unemployed for years then god bless you and take the OSR job where you will last 12 months. Where do I begin, first you have to sell waste service and everybody is in a contract with a competitor. When they try and get out of the contract the competitor WSI, SWS or Great Waste will file a lawsuit against that small business. This means if you got a signed contract it needs to be cancelled and then you dont get paid commissions. You have to sell $3k a month in new revenue to hit quota. This is dam near impossible unless you have the Miami Beach territory where it is mandatory to have waste and recycling and there is only 3 competitors. WSI the main competitor will drop their pants to steal or retain any account, so this does not help either and with the threat of suing. The sales manager Alex was awesome laid back, now Martin is an ahole and the average OSR last 12 months. You either get fired, laid off or quit. It would be a chill job if the goals were not impossible to achieve. I had a good car allowance, company cell phone, company credit card, paid tolls, flexible hours, laptop, but a mafia works there especially in the account manager side they hate OSR's. I went to a regional sales meeting and all it was peeing on OSR's how we all suck. I left that meeting saying I hate WM. None of those folks can hack it if they tried it today. If they offer you a job become an account manager do not I repeat do not become an OSR!!!!"
bad,"Really bad company to work for. Supposedly preaching the well being of employees but as a manager, they were asking me to push them to the max and if they were not performing good enough, get rid o them. So glad I am gone."
bad,"While I appreciate the company and what they offer to both their employees and customers, the local office presented in violation of what the company expressed as their standards.  Local management displayed inappropriate demeanor and behavior on several levels."
bad,"This place is a nightmare, management is the worst I’ve ever had to experience at any job I’ve worked, ops manager is a uneducated ignorant dummy, district manager is a political California boy with a pitiful geology degree who doesn’t know anything about equipment or landfills! My advice is avoid this hostel environment, money isn’t worth it!"
bad,Was a good move for me in the beginning. I inherited a lot of operational dysfunctions due to poor DM oversight prior to them hiring me. Outsiders did not do well over time within the management structure. Lots of CYA going on.
bad,"This evil MEGA company outbought my company and took over. As part of the buyout they had to offer all full time employees jobs, which was done so, however after employed i was made to feel belittled, ignorant, and flat out made fun of by the original employees, with no ability to speak with any kind of management about ANY issues i feel like these people DO NOT care about me or my family and i was terminated at the very first sign of trouble. Will discuss @ interview. "
bad,"Management is horrible, they always promise for advancements but nothing is ever open. They play favoritism, and nothing is done about managers being messy. The overall pay is nothing for a fortune 500 company."
bad,i was asked to work full time year round for $12 an hour with no benifits. no time off. the upper management and company doesnt care for the employees.
bad,"It's a hard environment, in house upper management is not on the same page with the regional mangement and the direction is really cloudy.... Tried getting a transfer out to other areas but it seems like that is harder than getting my foot in the door at first.  Thankful for the opportunity I was initially given but glad to be moving on"
bad,The only way you will make it hear is if you can kiss butt. HR rules are there to protect themselves and not the employee. And management takes full advantage of this!
bad,you started your day off at 5:30 in the morning had a route you drove 1 hour to get to then it would take you 12 hours to get done most days you worked 14 hours long in heat and cold.
bad,great place to work if you're looking to grow your career for the long term. Great leadership and management program for people who want a normal 9-5 job clocking in and out!
bad,"Do as I say! Oh wait you have and opinion?!? Yea, your fired because I'll make up some stuff beaches I can! Gotta love right to work and favorites!! No ethics!"
bad,"Poor collaboration between the departments; toxic and dysfunctional environment; lack of understanding of what process improvements mean and how it needs to be implemented; poor Ethics environment (employees are afraid to speak up or don't know where to go to raise a concern); lack of professionalism - HR can't even enforce their own dress code; I was often shocked just observing how employees treated each other (yelling, swearing, public criticizing, cursing). Lack of clear direction and ownership; Company Culture in terms of Ethic, Compliance, Professionalism grossly underdeveloped compared to other Fortune 200 companies I know in the area."
bad,"This job started off as a good job to work at, the pay was descent and I enjoy driving the truck and the guys were ok to work with,Then they started hiring new people who know nothing about the job and other people who just dont want to work."
bad,was an easy job . but is so micromanaged and the rules change almost on a weekly basis. were not consistant on passing out punishment for so called violations of company policys and very disrespectfull to their drivers especially district mang. and operations mang.i was one unfairly terminated because of these practices of management
bad,I answered calls regarding waste pickup services.  I had an average call time that they wanted it to be under.  I hardly met my call time requirements. I wanted to make sure my customers were pleased with the service I provided them.  Management was not understanding during my high risk pregnancy.  I had to miss several days due to illness/appointments and eventually was terminated.
bad,"Most services are not offered in the New Orleans Market (recycling, residential roll off, landfill, Pricing through WM is not supportive of competitive environment, especially when the services that make WM such a great company are not offered at this location."
bad,waste management was an unsafe work enviroment.they were not very organized in the mornings and stretched the D.O.T. rules
bad,Don't be expecting to get a job here if you've been in this industry for a long time hr only want noobs that know nothing and don't know there rights and if your an equipment operater that's been doing your whole life your over qualified this place is joke and that's insulting to the word joke do your self a faver go else were
bad,"Management is horrible , the managers always think they're right & there way is the best way . They don't even have a CDL and they give you tips on how to operate your truck every time the camera goes off. For them it's easier said than done "
bad,fast pace job and long hours! Team play a must to be done and have to do managements work for them.Co workers are great but company is just going rock bottom
bad,"At first this place was great. There was no micro-managing. Then the upper management was changed. Once that happened, things started to get pretty bad at a rapid pace. The morale of the entire building went down the drain. Everyone seemed to dread coming into work. As far as the compensation goes, they changed out bonus/commission plan so much. For the majority of the time those that had very low sales numbers were making much more bonus than those of us who actually had high numbers... made no sense. We also wouldn't know what our monthly goals were usually until the middle of the month. One month they changed our goals the 2nd to the last day of the month. Really??"
bad,"If you are sick or have children, they will never let you be with them or take time off. I broke my hand and had to go on short term disability and they wouldn't let me come back when I was released to come back to work from my dr. They told me they were wanted spanish speaking employees only. While I was there, employees would ask to come in an hour late because of their child and they would always deny them. People would get into a wreck on the way in to work and they would fire them. They also look over your shoulder while you are are working and critize everything you do. I was often told I was too nice to customers and needed to hurry up."
bad,Not a fun workplace. Do not make a mistake it with cost you your job
bad,it was a hard job. put you in shape very fast. others worked well with each other . high production. alot needed done in very short hours
bad,Relocated my family from AZ to LA and the entire job is nothing that was projected to me before I took the position.
bad,Management was very confrontational about the wrong issues.If they spent more time trying to find solutions to the problems that were brought to thier attetion instead of causing them. Then bradentons division of Waste Wanagement is without a doubt in my mind selfseficient. I've worked along side of some of the most dedicated hard working men that i've ever seen only to see them scared to speak up about the problems that they were having from fear of being terminated.Waste its self is a great company to work for but even fortune 500 companies are ran into the ground due to poor management.In order for a company to sucseed and stay successful it has to be ran with out predijuce.Although big remember God gave DAVID the strength to slay GOLIATH.
bad,Our department converted all non-managers from salary to non-exempt.  Our department stripped titles and eliminated the tier needed for advancement opportunities.  Training requests for skill development to move up or onto other career tracks are met with responses like how does this benefit the role you are in now or when all your work is done.  The work is never ever done and those training opportunities become elusive.  For these reasons moral in the department is low and process improvement insights are kept from management.
bad,"The pay is awful. I’ve been here for almost 10 years, I operate heavy equipment and run a solo sight and I make 16/hr. There’s never opportunity for pay bumps and there’s never the option of overtime. It’s the typical corporation where the people at the bottom make lousy wages and the higher ups make 6 figures."
bad,Safety is not on the list. They do not care about the safety of others or their drivers. I know this personal. Management sucks. Waste Management Woodland is no good
bad,Do not apply for the heavy equipment operator 1 job in Frostburg Maryland I worked here for a month then they announced they would be shutting down within 3 years so if you do apply don’t count on being here for more than 3 years they probably won’t say anything about it in the interview as I can see they have failed to mention it in the job posting.
bad,"Will lie to get you hired in. Then you see how much of a poc this place is. Old equipment, no air. Dosent care about their drivers what so ever. Will never suggest this place to any one."
bad,Piece of waste worker and  truck drivers always getting stuck employee pushing trucks with dozer which is not allowed by company policy  worker always smoking in machines leaving garbage in the equipment no respect for equipment just beat it and destroy it big comapany they can replace it attitude they need to clean out employees  not worth it
bad,I worked one whole day for the company. They lied to me and in one day I have never seen so many safety issues. Their equipment is junk they only check fluids in the equipment once a week. First trip out and the truck broke down. They told me it would be the easiest driving job I would ever have and that’s a lie. The pay could be better. I would not recommend this company to anyone at all
bad,"Worked there somewhat recently and had been there for many many years. This place is micromanaged. All drivers are great. Upper management has good intentions but the message is lost with local management ignoring corporate ways to suit local situations. Expected to work in an unethical manner by overcharging customers as a way of generating more revenue. The moral is very low there. NO safety bonuses anymore, NO barbecues anymore, NO Christmas party anymore. Once was a great company now gone downhill quickly."
bad,Management and The Equipment is the MAIN issues of the high turn around of employee. The mighty dollar and the investors mean more to them than lively hood of the employee. Just a shame how this company could be great but chooses not to. MUST BE THERE 25 YEARS TO GET A TRUCK WITH A/C AND HEATER.
bad,Waste Management was a good company to work for. My experience there was very pleasurable as they provided OJT (On-The-Job-Training) which aided in the development of my skill set. I left the company because it was necessary for me to earn more.
bad,Managed by people that couldnt do the job themselves so they have zero idea of what it takes. Because you read it from a book should not qualify you to manage.
bad,"The most corrupt company that I have ever worked for.  I do not believe that a single employee would would recommend this company to any close friend or relative. If you are a shady person, you can excel here.  It fits in with their corporate mission!"
bad,"Accepted a RollOff driving position with Waste Management in Brampton, Ontario."
bad,"Current Side Dump Driver. Very poor management with the exception of a few of the transportation supervisors. Ridiculous amount of oversight and rules. You constantly worry about being fired. Have fired two dozen drivers in the last 3 months!"
bad,Juba is the capital city of South Sudan. It had no landfill before Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) came in for help. Many members of the city government employee did not read or write. They did not know how to run the government properly.  we as the project trained them in Juba and sent many in to Asia for training so that they would be able to run their government. we did many things.
bad,"A very selfish company and the only reason why Waste Management has safety policies is to protect the company and not the employees. The only time they enforce their safety rules is when upper management is around. When an accident occurs, they use there safety policies, that they never enforce, to blame the employee and discipline them. It's all about the company and their insurance costs. Employees are expected to do whatever it takes to get the job done as fast as possible but if anything happens, blame is 100% on the employee."
bad,"Pay is great, leadership is awful. Member of corporate is stationed out of Saugus location. Constantly berating employees and belittling them. Money is great, only reason I stayed as long as I did."
bad,worked as Fleet Manager in Saginaw Michigan. Could not perform repairs as needed and many of the units on a daily basis were unfit for service. Safety to employees and to the general public were not priority
bad,this company really don't care about the workers.i shouldn't say the company don't care I know its management that don't care about the workers.your days where 10hr days of trash. I did get forklift certified and became a bailer operator.as for my co-workers most of my co-workers have felonies.the most enjoyable part of the job was having 3 days off.working at waste management was a big change for me after working for Adcock landscaping for 13years
bad,Taking calls helping customers set up and manage their accounts
bad,"While I worked it was ok, I got injured and they had to take me to the hospital from the warehouse, I left my keys with management in case they had to move it, the ransacked my car looking for any evidence of anything so they wouldn't have to pay my hospital claim, horrible people broke some stuff in my car."
bad,"They are one messed up company! Georgetown DE has screwed up management, corporate and values are messed up."
bad,My review of Waste Management is not very good. After working for a company for almost 10 years. They were very cruel to us workers who worked very hard for them. They decided to close a department that caused a lot of hardship on people fighting to keep their familys and minds together. Without a care to the world they threw us out to the wolves and slam the doors in our faces. They lied and never once tried to fix the hardship it caused to a lot of people. But like the saying what goes around will come back. I just pray that they learn to see themselves at the other end of the stick before it is to late. God BLESS THEM !!!
bad,"My peers quite and I was given 2 additional teams and an overwhelming amount of administrative duties. I still managed to drive results...then, they closed the call center."
bad,"Wayyyyy too much micromanaging with this company, expects numbers everyday regardless of traffic situations, camera to watch your every move. I do not regret leaving this company.. whew just a heads up do your research about this company before you apply."
bad,I wouldn’t recommended this place manager was great but people not so great pay sucked you had to earn sick days so if you caught the flu I were screwed.
bad,Management continued to push drivers to work above DOT hours without recourse or be fired as I was. They would correct routes to be done in DOT allowed 14 hour day!
bad,"They blame you for EVERYTHING that goes wrong. Expect you to break DOT rules and write you up if you don't. If you question them they make up answers and expect you to accept it. New guys are treated terrible .Expect to drive trucks nobody else wants to drive and only have to drive if truck breaks down.Terrible equipment! I worked about 8 months,camera's got me fired in Raggedy truck,cameras goes off 30-40 times a day in raggedy trucks,maybe 2-5 times in newer trucks"
bad,"A lot of physical work and not enough pay for the work. This job should put more money in your pockets.  They push safety daily which lets you know that this job can be dangerous and you risk your life or someone else life daily working for this company, which is a salary evaluation itself. The workers are under paid"
bad,"The management were very open to gifts, which would make your work life very, very easy.  On the other hand, if a manager happened to take a disliking to you, which has nothing whatsoever with job performance, you are screwed.  Making a complaint about a manager's conduct would result in them circling the wagons and all against you.  I was advised when I first started to buy a bottle for the route manager, and he'd get off my back.  I'm really sorry I didn't.  I would have avoided so much stress."
bad,They make you work hours that does not support business needs in my department. Mangers still have there jobs when they are not performing well. Show favoritism in a way that you can not report it to hr.
bad,I love the job but poor management. The route manager would cuss at his employees and retaliate if a employee would bring up a safety issue with the truck or the route
bad,If management were not harassing drivers constantly it would be the best job I have ever had.  Company does not really want safety to be a part of their culture.  Company will expect you to work 60+ hours a week and good luck making a doctors appointment.
bad,There’s a reason they’re always looking for people.  They have to change their ways now  that the economy is booming and  they’re not the only job in town.
bad,They just don't see the big picture that humans make mistakes mission 2 zero is impossible with that said it is a good thing that safety is a number one there. There management has never operated a truck there for has no true knowledge of how to overcome task on a company and employee level would not recommend
bad,Poor pay an make you think you are part of the team but when you give advice it goes in one ear an out the other . Preach that they are a safe company but don’t enforce rules like they should . Poor management the whole way up the ladder .
bad,"Management is unprofessional, you are only noticed by being favorites . Management went under investigation for not hiring minorities for supervisor roles and months later hired 3 without an interview, bypassing anyone that may have wanted an opportunity in management. they sweep everything under the rug . The HR department is close friends with all the managers so any reports are given to them and no solution to the problems. If you are a yes man/woman they have no problem running over you . If you speak your mind they will ignore you and kick you out the first opportunity they have. Will also talk to other supervisors about reps in unprofessional manner not feedback to help improve"
bad,"This company has great potential, however due to them outsourcing to India, they left the people who made them who they were with out job security though I was a temp, I fairly enjoyed this company."
bad,"Management is horrible along with HR they tag team to get you out the door if they want to get rid of you. It's all about who you know, not what you know to make it. It's a lot of favoritism from supervisors, nitpicking,micromanaging & harassment."
bad,my day started @ 6am we all did pretrip together 6.15 if no problems out the gate u went to your first pick up.started in kemath then to dump and back to kemath then maybe to Galveston back an forth all day doing ur job.getting the containers empty
bad,Show up at 330 Am and have a safety meeting while the trucks are warming up. Then do our dot inspection before we leave for the day. Head out for our route.
bad,I worked for this company for over 7 years. I did whatever the manager/supervisor asked of me and then some.
bad,"We need more communication, to make employees feel good instead of constantly being yelled at and don't feel like an employee but a number. They need a program makes you feel like you belong."
bad,"Managers are told to treat drivers terribly and not be friends with employees. "
bad,"Poor management, it’s all about who you know and if you are liked or not.  Management can care less whether you stay or go, they will just hire somebody to replace you."
bad,The department I worked in was very stressful with alot of procedure updates that some people had difficulty in following. This led to errors being given without any structure. There was also the efficiency that had to be maintained. So overall it is like working in a sweatshop
bad,good and honest drivers working their. Management is lacking and cause good drivers to leave. Management treats you like a number and when your all used up finds a way to get rid of you.
bad,Waste Management Energy Services is a stressful place to work at when the supervisor are so unfair and pick favorites they watch you for everything and can’t work comfortable
bad,"The pay and benefits are good. Thats about it. At this site you are by yourself all day. What ever tools u bring is all you have so be prepared. They don't give u enough time to work on things the right way and expect miracles. The only way u really work on anything is if it stops moving, then god  forbid if it takes longer then an hour it's to long. You have no crane or lube truck so it's almost impossible to service the machine. They have no clue what a heavy equipment shop should have and don't care because it cost money. WM does not support the service end, I know i was there, it sucks. Then all the paperwork, timecard, ordering parts, etc all in an 8 hour day. You can't work over time because u won't get the equipment to work on. Worst place I ever worked. Smaller companies care and spend more on the service end. There's a lot of b.s. there with management."
bad,Avoid at all cost.  Trucks should not be allowed on road.  I should take my pictures to Dot . Wish I could upload the pictures for you to see and reconsider your choice to join waste management Edmonton. They trip over dollars to pick up nickles.trucks are always broke down and should not be in the roadbut when you refuse they become very snake like. Stay away
bad,"The management has no idea what they are suppose to be doing let alone the people they hire.  Training is horrible, suppose that’s why they’re always looking for employees!"
bad,"Not productive at all and workspace is very unclean. Management style was very elementary and while some of the people were very nice to work with, others especially leadership was very difficult to please."
bad,"My supervisor had to compassion to the fact of me having to use all my sick time for medical issues,  let ne go then and I was meeting all n.y goals n my scores n customer feedbacks were all 100% good, turned out I have breast cancer"
bad,Had an interview scheduled twice. First interview was changed for their convenience. From July 25 to August 1. Showed up for the interview and was met by a cold dispatcher telling me there are no interviews this week. All interviews had been rescheduled for next week. Which wouldn’t be an issue if this was communicated. But I had taken a day off my present job for this scheduled interview  I showed her the invitations and confirmations for the interview and she brushed me off like I didn’t matter at all. Well I was very excited for the opportunity. WM sounds like a great place to work. At lease here in BC it does. But I don’t think any potential employer that treats any person in this way deserves a qualified and loyal employee. Unfortunately the recruiter nor the interviewer will reply to messages.
bad,This was a waste services broker company that did payments of invoices and bulk billing for multiple customer locations. This was not the actual waste management.
bad,Way to much stress and pressure put on me. Zero work life balance! Worked 18 hour days and still didn't make quota most months. My manager died of a heart attack due to stress. RUN!!
bad,"Promise after promise was made to provide the resources needed to allieviate the stressful workplace that exists there now...of course, it was to no avail. "
bad,"WM, they expect their employees to work too many hours, no work life balance. It’s not a rewarding company to work for. The trucks are in horrible shape always breaking down"
bad,It was a great experience at waste management I just had to travel everyday to Bay area the people was great it was a hard job but I stuck with it the pay okay but it was the commute every day
bad,"A typical day at work will never happen. The culture at waste management is beyond poor. Every job position is a rotating door; this includes site managers, route managers, fleet manager, supervisors, mechanics, and drivers. The functionality of the mechanic shop is poorly managed due to the rotating door effect. The biggest issue the site has is inventory and scheduled maintenance. The only good thing is this job will teach you how to overcome several mechanical issues with as little as possible. This job should be used only as a temporary stepping stone to further your career."
bad,"I don't have a lot of good things about the company so I'm not going to say anything. To go into detail maybe unwarranted based on your position, so you should see for yourself."
bad,"the Location in Hillsdale is horrible, they have the welders in a building that is about to callapse(every room has cracks coming down the walls, specially in the weld shop). There’s no space in that tiny shop where there’s no kind of ventilation to clear out the room in the winter(other than the doors). And there’s literally no supervisor at the location just a senior welder that throws everyone under the bus to management. Union job as well but only benefits the drivers since it’s Teamster and union reps only look out for they peeps."
bad,"Management cares only about their own interests, and not the employee's. It is difficult working for a route manager that has absolutely no back bone. They don't care if you are properly trained. You are just a replacement body, because they can't keep employees."
bad,"The Customer Service department was highly unorganized with lack of skills of training others. It was not effective. However, I was moved to do some background work and the person who trained me there was very kind, patient, funny and trained very well."
bad,Challenging Employer to work for.  Difficult to maintain one title.  Training insufficient. Subordinate employees consistently given favorable rights.
bad,"my boss was great, but the bosses above her was horrible. They created hostile work environment and were belittling to their employees"
bad,Management lieing and playing favorites. They make you work over the 14 hours the dot puts into place and doesn't comply with most dot laws and regulations. No safety at all
bad,I worked the paper line I cleaned made sure everything was organized It smelled bad they didnt pay enough and they worked u like a slave for 9.50
bad,I did not like it. I went home smelling like trash the people that I worked for treated us like trash.
bad,Had a dealing with the north east Reginal service manager what a boob! Typical FUMU
bad,"The mana"
bad,Oppurtunity to meet with great people while doing your routes.
bad,management was never there and we were short staffed. no one was there to oversee or answer questions.
bad,Not a good company whatsoever. Bad management. They are horribly unsanitary
bad,"Clock in, make sure your on time if not you get quarter of a point or a point depends how late are you. You learn different systems and also old ones."
bad,I work at waste management in granite quarry i would not recommend anybody to work for this site! The management and the trucks are really bad and they will not fix anything on the DVIR even if it is not safe to drive the truck. I have done everything by the book as far as calling out sick and vacation and both times i have been written up for taking days off when I have in writing for over 4 months notices  although my co-workers are very hard working and a great group of guys to work with the management and the trucks are the worst thing about the company. I would not advise anybody to work for the site out of granite quarry although I'm not sure how any other of the waste management sites are cause I have only worked from this one location.
bad,"Management was the worst, any chance that they get to throw you under the bus they will take advantage of it. No type of acknowledgement for doing a good job. You have to worry about yourself and your own job and lay low to avoid any issues. Won't lie the pay is good but not worse all the issues you have to deal with on a daily basis."
bad,Not much to say just stay away from this company please they will use you make do things that you really don't want to do Management doesn't care about no one.
bad,I just quit working here because my manager didn't care that we billed hundreds of customers wrong every month. Very unethical practices going on there.  The company is good but not the managers. Dont sacrifice your integrity for this
bad,"I work on factory before waste management and then I apply for waste management I was a truck helper, after that they move me inside the office to do paper work"
bad,"I liked meeting new people all the time, I wish i could of got hired on. I was working for a agency for this company"
bad,"WM is prestigious name when it comes to companies. However, this location in Texas had horrible management. The system that they used for ticketing was antiquated. They did not train you properly for the job, and it was the blind leading the blind. The pay was extremely low for what you were expected to do. Horrible job, and horrible people in management. Keep looking for another job."
bad,Terrible pay for what you have to do all year in the terrible weather if you get sick they punish you and you get terrible cent raises every year my last raise was 0.04 cents they pay you bare minimum dont waste your time theu try to get rid of you for every little thing and then wonder why they cant keep people around
bad,"you can't move up in the company .raises are about 30 cents. can't talk to management because they will turn it around and blame you. You can't to HR because they will tell you to get used to it , stop nip picking at stuff, he is just being sarcastic, thats just his personality , we are friends outside work i know he is good person."
bad,"It is a way to get a workout. I was paid by NAOS but in reality, worked for WM. Their management called the shots. They are serious about safety, which I respect. They are not serious about training the low-level crew on how to effectively do their jobs and then fire them. Given a 60% turnover rate (NAOS number) why bother with job or safety training. No one lasts long enough to warrant any investment of time or effort by WM. The line management ignored a safety issue that resulted in an injury to one of my coworkers. That was enough for me."
bad,waste management is a very large corp. I came to waste hoping it was the place I could invest my time and retire. Unfortunately that was not the case. I worked residential for about 1 1/2 yrs which came with low pay and helpers were temps with even lower pay which caused very low morale and adds work to drivers. Looking for better opportunities I moved to roll- off truck and again they pay below industry standard for that position as well worked 15+hrs. a day with equipment that would beat you to death by days end. the equipment and trucks should have been taken off the roads years ago! This is a corp. that claims safety first! I worked that position for 2 years hoping that change would come. Management is very poor and unprofessional. Needless to say I didn't want to leave but had to leave! Work / Life balance is non-existent.
bad,"There was no availability to move up in the company. There was no way to bond with my peers, because each person basically had one room they worked in away from everyone else."
bad,"The job is a call center job, you are on the phone all day.  Customers call in to order new service, check information on landfills, complain that their service is not the exact same time each day, billing questions and complaints about price increases.  There are the good and the poor co-workers, as with each job.  There will always be those who come to work to do an honest and good job.  Then there are those who are only out for themselves and making the most they can, even if it means being very dishonest and causing bad morale among the team."
bad,Picked up garbage from customer's homes. Helped with the senior customers that were not able to bring their garbage to the road.
bad,Typical day at work is very fast paced.  I am big on team-work so I worked hard even though the pay does not match the amount of work that is put in by workers.  The most enjoyable part of the job is having a job.
bad,Alot of hard laborer and long work ours for minimal pay and opportunities
bad,"Micromanaging, un realistic requirments. Upper Management was not employee friendly at all. Very un happy employees about 90 percent of employees are very over stresses and over worded and un appreciated."
bad,To much corporate interference they would change policy very frequently to improve their bottom line and not caring who got cut in the process the people who I worked with in management were great but problem was they had no say so it all had to go threw corporate
bad,"They do not care about the employees, they will lie to you to your face. They want you to drive all day but your not allowed to munch or drink any water/coffee even when it's over 100 degrees. I didn't drive recycle, i drove hauling ash pulling a side dump. Didn't even have time to stop and use the restroom, if you were caught in traffic and couldn't make it you had to pull off and wait to be picked up."
bad,The best supervisors don’t last long in this role. Most quit. There’s no opportunity for advancement there’s no where to go so you’re stuck in the same place unless you quit
bad,Management only care about themselves. They do not care if you're having family issues or whether you have something important planned it's all about how much money the drivers can make the company and how much of a bonus the managers will get at the end of the year
bad,"Only reason why I stayed was our shop was union, most of them arent. They expect you to go over your hours of service and they complain and want to fire you when you tell them your in violation of the hours of service"
bad,I feel that this place had very poor management. I never had a set schedule and was never aware if I had to report to work until the day of. It was very unorganized and the overturn rate rate made it difficult for the employees like myself that wanted to be there to work.
bad,"Worste job you could possibly have,if you are a felon they frown upon that and treat you horrible there would not reccomend working for them at all if you are looking to advance and/or have beneficial things such as health care or dental benefits"
bad,Most the trucks are always in the shop making work difficult. Its a lot of glammed up talk. 15+ drivers quit while I was there and if you aren't able to finish route you typically get berated.
bad,"Waste management , is super quick to hire , and extremely happy to fire. LC life  critical rules can cost you, choose a rte manager, WISELY some never been in a truck at all. Can't keep employees if u always lie to them"
bad,i was at waste management at the dump it was a cool job but the people they had in charge of the temps was not professional at all most of the employees quit because of how they were being treated
bad,"The workday started at 4:30 am and went till the route was done 10 to 12 hours later.  I learned to drive a refuse truck, run to sequence and run routes efficiently.  Management seemed to care about their employees.  The culture is safety based.  The hardest part of the job was to deal with the changing weather conditions.  The best part of the job was the benefits."
bad,"My time at Waste Management was characterized by a complete lack of training specific to the job, despite being told I would be trained when I was hired.  Many safety requirements were ignored, including expecting technicians to perform unlicensed electrical troubleshooting without proper training, and equipment designs which lacked proper safety features.  Waste Management also places far too much of their compensation into the form of bonuses, which leads to preventative maintenance being skimped and needed consumables supply inventories being allowed to run so low that it interferes with the ability to operate.  This can lead to equipment failures, as well as unsafe situations.  Many times it was clear that the challenges of maintenance and operations were simply misunderstood by site leadership, while micromanagement was rampant."
bad,"Company likes to micro-manage a lot..Not a lot of help if you are unsure about something. A lot of pressure & stress, supervisors who lie about staff."
bad,"By far the most toxic work culture that I have seen or even heard of.  The company is lacking in any sense of innovation or expanding into other market areas."
bad,"*Waste Management is not competitive with their pay schedule"
bad,WM states they want their employees to live balanced lives but that company comes first in all aspects. Bottom dollar. Drivers get treated like numbers with Jerry rigged trucks and unsafe routes due to unrealistic promises to customers. Dispatchers do the work of three or four people while management and leads spend more time behind closed doors than managing or leading. You get 18 days off paid until your five year mark but don't be fooled by a planned vacation- they will revoke your time off last minute if your vacation isn't times well with company needs. A lot of people in a lot of different departments will tell you that there are a lot of people here who don't do any work but receive all of the recognition. There is zero advancement opportunities within this company. Which is sad because with as much as this company is worth- you'd think they wouldn't hesitate to show all employees appreciation with decent pay and bonuses.
bad,Only being able to repair trucks without parts. Management  will not allow you to get the parts to maintain the trucks there bonuses are more important.
bad,"Make calls outbound to talk with your existent customers and take calls inbound from customers that want to cancel and try and save them. Spend half of your day at the printer or faxing documents. I learned that it's not just trash. I thought management was awful. The hardest part of my job was actually working as hard as I have ever worked in a job that was not manual, hitting my numbers, making big sales and being excited about it and getting called into the managers office and be told that I was the worst sales rep he has ever seen and I need to pick it up or be fired, stressing out about it and trying to figure why I was so bad and being told by my peers that he does that to everyone. After learning that there was nothing enjoyable about the job"
bad,"Running away from this job,  Company doesn't uphold what promised to employees.  Unorganized"
bad,"Started out good then after 90. Days you find out it's all about the profit. Their form of motivation is to tell you they are at will company and you can be terminated at any time. The benefits are a joke. If hurt you will be denied everything even short term disability. Even if you add to it. They don't care for their employees. They think of every reason to screw , sign on bonus you will not get it. But I'm sure they write it off on taxes"
bad,Wasn't all that excited about the leadership the turnover rate and the lack of communication among supervisors and employees it felt as if the supervisors had their favorite's
bad,You just a number for them look somewhere else don’t waste your time the company doesn’t appreciate your hard work too many rules if you make a mistake you’re done they have cámaras inside their trucks always looking for a reason to fired you waste of time
bad,"It was a poor company to work for."
bad,Upper leadership never listens to Management and always listens to the employees causing the problems. WM is not the company everyone things that it is and they are only worried about their bottom line. They have lost a few things that are import in this field: their people and their customers. They also claim safety is number 1 but they wait until accidents happen before making change.
bad,Management doesn't protect there drivers and human resources is a joke.  There's nobody here to stand up for the drivers. There trucks are routed crust buckets that leak all over the road. What an environmental disaster these trucks can be....
bad,Management only cares about bottom line you getting trash up doesn’t matter about safety as they preach drivers an helpers work like dogs only to have to do some one else’s work. They ask for you to do things that is not told from the beginning just to get you in the door. Tell you one thing an wont tell the customer cause they want their business. A lot of work just don’t pay enough to do this dead end you will stay tired an beat down don’t do it.
bad,"When I worked at Waste Management, I got a lot of hours, but I didn't believe the pay reflected the intensity of the job. Workplace culture was what you'd expected from a garbage management company."
bad,"Long hours just expected, manager never Saturdays to help out, no paid holidays (5 days a year times 12 years) always work Saturdays, no credit ever given, no thank you, no trust, daily lies, threats and half truths. Disgruntled yes. Still here yes. Mortgage to pay."
bad,They asked for an enormous amount of time and no recognition for good work of managers. They did not supply the proper equipment in order to reach our sites goals.
bad,"Wasn’t horrible. Same as any other company. The harder you work the more they expect. Management had favorites and the favorites were the ones that were not very good at their jobs. However, the favorites were the ones that would advance. The good employees that bust their butts were held back from advancing for fear that they would never be replaced. Management is very unprofessional when interacting with employees. Too many rules and other bs to put up with. It’s just trash and the company makes it out like rocket science. Not much thinking involved in the job but the direction the company is going has drivers using tablets while driving instead of focusing on the road. Overall, good for something temporary. Puts a lot of wear and tear on your body."
bad,This company Didn't treat there employees fairly and had no benefits they made the job harder than it had to be and were always wanting you to do extra work outside of job discription
bad,"Very micro managed, management has there favorites. Training was horrible and rushed. Overall company has a high turn over rate with employees and management. I don't recommend this compamy to others. And if you have to use the restroom that's a write up. You get write ups for everything"
bad,The company is not a safe environment because of that hazardous materials that comes in an out if the plant coworkers don't get along supervisor doesn't pay attention to details
bad,"Would not recommend, if your not liked in the group you have no chance in making it. To much politics only take care of their own kind. I had tried but as you can see I was not their for long."
bad,"Under-Educated/Poorly Trained Local & Regional Management, Deceptive Commission Pay Structure, Take-it-or-Leave-it Bully Mentality with Customers & Employees."
bad,Do not work has a helper . They don't have enough work to go around. Drivers get first priority. Drivers do the work of the helper at drivers pay while the helper gets nothing.
bad,"suit up and get dirty...whatever line you are placed at you go there and you start sorting.. the hardest part of the job was having to get inside of the machines at night to cut through all of the trash that may stop the plant from running smoothly..bags, strings, wires, clothes, etc. The most enjoyable part of the day was clocking out to go home"
bad,"Moral is low because they work you long hours and the vehicles you drive and are responsible for are always broken. They run summer tread in the winters here on the ice, and it is unsafe. I was asked to run trucks that weren't safe many times."
bad,The dirtiest job I've ever had. Uniforms are supplied. Double standards all around. It's all about the numbers. The trucks are junk and kept that way.  The work schedule varies with seniority. You will be working nights. It's definitely a challenge everyday...double work. They just laid off a couple drivers and will most likely lay off a few mechanics too. Management talks a good game but very reactive. It's a great job for enrty level techs. The is plenty of knowledge to absorb from the right employees. There is no training and a poor safety program. There are better jobs out there...keep looking. You work every holiday. Not Veteran friendly. I've heard some horror stories.
bad,They start you in one position and keep adding to your work load but not your pay check . When you try to move up they say they need you were your at . Trucks are rags unless your at a big location .
bad,Waste management is a good place for temporary work but not permanent. They need major improvement in the management area. The managers argue and baffle each other due to no organization. They are in desperate need of better communication
bad,The only problem i had was working 10 hours straight with no breaks. employees were team players. It was just that one supervisor who was jus to competitive and wasn't thinking about his team.
bad,"all I can speak of is the Savannah, GA location and it is a disaster.  Aside from the route managers, any manager above that seems either not to care the equipment sucks or they just dont care.  If you like sweating in July or freezing in December then work here.  Most trucks dont have ac or heat.  Most trucks are about 12 years old or older"
bad,The company is going in a different direction. no more paid holidays its always extremely hot and don't provide with fans or a schedule. be ready to work 6 days a week 10 hrs a day if you are in second shift
bad,typical day at waste management was picking up garbage and making sure each pick-up was assign correctly and safely
bad,"The turn over rate should have told me that this company/position would not work out well for me but I gave it a shot anyway. As an Inside Commercial Representative you are required to obtain information and provide quotes for equipment based on rate sheets that are difficult to decipher.The only training provided is web based tutorials and peer side by side observation. The computers are slow, there is a complete lack of support, required to utilize multiple (7)  computer programs, 10 min breaks and 30 min lunch schedules, resulted in frustration and ultimately my resignation. Good luck to any and all that decide to pursue a position as an Inside Commercial Representative at Waste Management, you will need it!"
bad,"day work,they are about safty , but its very hard to do the work and follow there rules,in the timely matter they ask"
bad,"The company as a whole is a good stable company to work for the benefits are great, good vacation. If you do not like your family this is not the place to work, Long long hours for low low pay no matter how hard you work you are not noticed or even a good job.Never ever have the right tools to do the job the best you can do. The management does not care about their employees at all as long as the trash is getting pushed, do not care what time you leave as long as they are out of there at 5 o'clock. My co workers are always always miserable and always complain about hating their jobs. The hardest part of the job is getting the equipment that you need to do the job right, the pencil pushers in the office are never out in the field to see whats going on just give you a hard time about getting trucks in and out in a rain storm. I would love to go back to the company,but, I think that the higher ups need to make a surprise visit to to see whats really going on down there!!!! The best part of the job was talking to the WM drivers and operating big dozers, when they ran!! the vacation and personal days."
bad,Easy job too much stress management went out of their way to write you up as if they have a write up quota which I think they do  employees don’t got your back unless you are used to prison culture  you had to be in a click in order to have any support
bad,This is a fast paced job. Very up beat routes. There are many obstacles to overcome on a daily. There are many accountable tasks that must be completed with safety in mind at all times.
bad,The work life at waste management  is ridiculous you’re underpaid and overworked all they care about is the bottom line at the drivers expense they push you to work 12 to 14 hours a day and then expect you there first thing in the morning to do it all over again. I can go on about their vehicles and maintenance on them but there isn’t enough time to go into it all. If you need a job and money then go for it but you will end up hating it.
bad,Very stressful work environment. Bosses were not very appreciative of workers. The harder you worked the less you were appreciated.  Would not recommend this company for any individual. The bosses had thier favorites. Could not get what you needed for daily work.
bad,"Safety is plays a big role at WM. Numbers are more important. Typical work day starts with a safety meeting, launch in sequence,go out grab a can dump and return. I learned that numbers, how long you sit somewhere, how long it takes to go to and from matter more than getting the job safely. The hardest part of the job was showing up. The only thing I enjoyed about this job were the benefits that I received for my family.  They have Route Managers that have never driven a truck telling drivers how they can do their job faster."
bad,"Site management has network of subordinates that report on peers and managers  while unaware that they are being manipulated by a controlling personality(ies).  Atmosphere and morale is good between fellow employees who’ve banded together for professional survival.  While HR is aware of the issues, upper management ignores the extremely high turnover as employees are disposable assets easily replaced with the next inexperienced person off the street.  Average length of tenure of all office staff (6 support personnel) is <1 year.  Work environment is heavy industrial (petrochemical plant) and offices literally have water dripping in from trailer roofs that haven’t been properly maintained for at least 30 years (wish I was kidding).  Office surfaces must be cleaned from heavy dust buildup at least once every 2-3 weeks.  Any professional considering this plant should avoid at all costs and seek employment elsewhere."
bad,Looks good on a resume. Put in your time and get some experience. Then move on to a better company that values their employees. It used to be a great place to work.
bad,Very long hours....A multi million dollar company and they have some horrible and poorly kept company trucks!!!! Your guaranteed to break down at least once a week!!! Every week!!!! Management is the worst!!!! They dont care about there employees!!!! They care more about the garbage and there quarterly bonuses!!!! Very cut throat company if your not apart of the in crowd dont expect too be there very long!!! Very high turnover rate!!!! The only thing I enjoyed about wm was the friends I made working wit the other drivers and there benefits.
bad,Expect to work 12-14 hours a day 6 days a week. Little to no support or advice on how to meet expectations. Upper management is constantly pushing to meet goals with no direction.
bad,answer phones take payments.  Open new accounts close accounts when customer wanted to close it due to high monthly cost.  Took payments via email and over the phone with credit card. Worked with many screens on two different computers side by side. Hardest part of job was all the screens and knowing when to use them and when not too. Enjoyable part of the job Fridays pay day.
bad,This job consisted of many 12 to 14 hour days. Very fast paced work but also a very cut throat business. The management was poor and treated the drivers like they meant nothing to the company. This is a big corporation whose main concern was how much money could be made and not the well being and safety of the drivers.
bad,Some employees were terminated unfairly.  Pushed out to make room for friends  one female caused divorce but nothing was done.  Bad language was out of control. Bulling
bad,"were not honest in my interview when asked how previous reps performed in area, surprised me a couple months in by eliminating my position and laying me off. left me unemployed and in exit interview was told previous reps didnt do well as the market wasnt good in area."
bad,"Lots of work,never knew when you had to work over time, freezing in the winter, BBQ hot in the summer, constantly changing days off, standing in one spot for 10 hours a day"
bad,"Very poor and wasted management, like a snake looking always to bite you. Co workers tread bad each other."
bad,it was my job to make sure everyone had things to do i sometimes cleaned the field or empty the drum which was a hugs rotating drummer that sifted the garbage
bad,Good place to work at to provide for your self or family. Hazardous work conditions at times with out proper PPE.  Hours are hard on your family and you have to work weekends. No or very little room for advancement.
bad,"Don't work there, if you want to have a personal life. No matter how many hours you work. They  push you some more. And with all that, they'll run and hide, and find a way to put the blame on someone else if something goes wrong or someone gets hurt. Benefits sucks. On less your perfect and don't get sick. If you see good reviews, that's WM, trying to suck you in for the kill. DO NOT BE FULLED!"
bad,Poor Management that lack team support - no follow through and overall negative experience . Poor training programs and employees are bullied by upper management
bad,"As a Manager with Waste Management, I found that WM doesn't have the correct balance between work and life. It was mandatory to work 70 hours per week on a salary pay scale. Your hard work and valiant efforts are often over-looked as a stellar employee. Job duties included Payroll, Managing Drivers, Customer Service, Driver Duties (Servicing Trash Cans), Dealing with Municipality Relations (Contracts), 3:30am Start Time, No Holidays Off, Working Weekends, etc. Being Management there were more cons than pros. It is a great company to work for as a garbage man, as they make more money and work less hours than their own managers. Route Managers were consistently quitting and being relived from their duties, thus, there weren't many managers given the opportunity to build a strong skill set for the position."
bad,"I worked here as a contractor. The pay was extremely low, grossly paid for the amount of work. I felt contractors were not compensated and used to do most of the work with no benefits. I worked at the Corporate office, it was a very weird place. I felt no sense of employee engagement you know how co workers celebrate holidays, birthdays etc it was always everyone kept to themselves. "
bad,horrible place to work. never felt like a real person. only good thing was steady work and bennies. just want to be human agian
bad,The industry has changed dramatically during my 7 year tenure here. The company is micro-managing in response to the competitiveness in the current market to reduce cost and remain viable. Advancement can prove very difficult unless you are in the inner circle at your yard. The job initially was very secure it seemed but as time has progressed and the economic climate has changed so has the security.
bad,There is no direction at this office. No work/life balance. Management is only worried about the duties and not their employees. Position duties are always changing. There is no opportunity for advancement in this office.
bad,The division that is located in Connecticut has transitioned a lot of it's work overseas leaving many without jobs. The environment isn't a good environment for those who are looking for a fresh start it's more for those who are looking for a place to help with the transition and move onto bigger and better things.
bad,Waste Management ha become so concerned about its new philosophy that WM is willing to let go of the people who truly care about the customer. They forget the customer is who built this company.
bad,I started with Waste Management as my second job out of college as a Operations Management Trainee.  I would go to different sites and ride with drivers and audit paperwork.  The whole entire time there was pressure to write bad reports on drivers especially if the manager did not like them.  Also to try and find wrong doings of the managers so it was a complete no win.  After I was promoted to a route supervisor at a district it got worse.  Route supervisors are safety/customer service/managers/miss chasers/fall people for upper management.  I would not wish this job on anyone and feel sorry for all Route Managers with Waste Management.  The company itself is completely out of touch with what driver needs are and send HR people to sites to try and shut them up but no changes are ever made.
bad,"Typical day at work continuous stress"
bad,Waste Management is one of the best trash companies in the country. Most of the positions within the company are being centralized.
bad,I had issues with the department manager.  He confronted me daily about issues that had nothing to do with me.  He soon left the company.
bad,Management is very bad and immature. Talks more and no successful execution. I do not recommend to my freinds.
bad,"At the end of my short career at Waste Management I found it hard to come to work everyday. The company had a odd way of operating and not making it easy on the employees. Decisions were made to ""better"" the team however that back fired for the lack of moral. Although I did move on from the call centre I still find that the management style was the same. Managers seemed to care about you as person and as an employee however their actions suggested different.I have made some lasting friendship from working at WM, find out I can work in a very fast paced environment, and that I can sell and be good at it. It is just not a fair company to work for."
bad,Worked here for 3 months your put your license on the line cause the trucks are total junk they dont repair nothing//pay is'nt bad based on incentives they want you to be safe but they put sooo much pressure on you they put camera's in your truck if you brake to hard turn a corner it triggers camera and records you if they feel it was unsafe you can be terminated wriiten up they preach safety but send you in unsafe trucks I would'nt suggest workin here unless you really really need the work
bad,"It would be a great place to work if you’re single with no kids. Plenty of hours, mandatory ot, and job security."
bad,"As any other employer can use improvement, there are some good customers that I've come in contact with as well as co-workers. This is a job wherein you should prepare yourself for physical work and if you don't think your able to except the challenges that will come with it don't consider it. Overall a good company and benefits are great but physical labor can challenge an individual.etc etc."
bad,Did not inform us that they were losing their contract with Duke Energy very strict companyPersonally I would never make men this job to anybody not a stable company to work for
bad,Most times the customer are rude. The driver are liars. The company itself is great once you get out of the customer service department.  The location is cool as well
bad,"The training was not consistent. Should have one onsite trainer to teach a full 12 weeks. They tested me on information prior to teaching it. They did not address age and sexual orientation discrimination. They allowed bullying via social media by co workers. They have strict guidelines about cell phones at the desk and yet everyone has them out constantly.  Not great for customer confidentiality!"
bad,I didn't stay long but worked overnight its pretty easy to understand and do but the people there got on my nerves. They hired me as a temporary guy and said i could become full time but i wasn't interested. Long hours which usually was 10 to 12 and low pay which was about 8.00.
bad,"worked 25 years took care of the whole landfill put trash in,cover it and some times hauled my own cover took care of the customers no matter who they were made one bad judgement call with what they call a close call and was left go right before Chirstmas  their rules conflict with each other they have so many loop holes to get rid of you"
bad,"Lots of work, so never have to worry about not having work and two locations to work at in North County. Was transportation friendly and easy to access through public transportation."
bad,Small customer service area that takes complaint calls for missed pick ups. Management needs to step up and make sure that it follows thru with the promises they make to their customers.
bad,Employees are great but management needs help in managing employees better. 2 managers on floor with different management types for their assigned teams.
bad,Basically at my site the managers had been there for a long time and are basically waiting on retirement. They put no effort into site or employees and you can tell. Managers have been verbally abusive and HR is a joke and the Managers even said it is a joke to call HR as well as their integrity hotline. It was disheartening because it is a good company.
bad,"If you are not Caucasian or Hispanic you have no chance of advancement. Management plays a lot of favoritism. They do not recognize real good people, only color. If you decide to work here please see for yourself! Strict policies. They do not care to understand family urgencies... because management has NO children themselves!"
bad,"The co-workers at this company are what make it bearable but management and some of the managers that you have to collaborate with to meet goals are undeniably unbearable. The processes are not rock solid and change frequently once you get used to doing them the first way you were required to do them they change again. Managers have favorites and some people are held to a higher standard of work than others. The pay is inadequate for the amount of stress incurred daily. The pay scale is uneven and sometimes new hires are given a higher salary than individuals that have been there longer.Not a good chance for career advancement even if you are qualified the ones that know the job will be kept at a certain level. There are various levels of accountability and dispatch center employees are held to a higher standard even though drivers, sales and others provide barriers to success. The only answer provided by management is all we can do is control what we can control. The processes that are not controllable are the processes that hurt you individually."
bad,"Dirty and unorganized, equipment not taken care of. Equipment is held together by duct tape and caulk. Many things out of compliance with the rules put in place. Under paid and overwhelmed with the work that management expects. Honestly I was there for a few years and I saw 10 people leave this job."
bad,"Limited areas for career advancement. Very less emphasis on skills development of employees.  "
bad,They promised a lot like signing bonus that never happened working late hours. They wanted the mechanic to fix all the trucks with no parts they always said parts are on the way weeks would pass and nothing.there are more thing to say but the day I left was the happiest day of my life
bad,The job culture at WM focuses on overwhelming amounts of work with low amounts of help and very disorganized training.  Every job seems to be too hectic and not worth the money or stress.  They don't listen to their employees.
bad,"stayed with this company for a long time because i had just started a family and need the medical benefits. This company does not no the meaning of the word team. It is every man for him or herself here!! Not having the equipment to do your job which includes trucks, parts to fix the trucks, a good reliable crew to get the routes done are just some of the many faults at this company! All you want to do is get the job done and go home but management makes this a absolute nightmare. The cut throat world at the management end of this company is something else. I left this company feeling i had wasted years of my life!! To make a long story short don't get trapped here and feel like there is nothing else out there. The day i left this company that night i got the best sleep of my life!!! Get out while you still can. You clock in and start working. You have to learn to multitask because you might be working on a truck in the bay and a Driver comes in needs something done on his truck so you have to stop doing what you were working on and help him/her . Management / drivers always making mistakes and trying to blame mechanics ."
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was being part of the Company's Organic Growth Division.  I enjoyed being responsible for the development and growth of a new line of business titled Product Destruction.
bad,"WM was a great place for the first 15 years. The last 5 years were horrible. It is no longer a ""family"". Most jobs are being out sourced and loss of company experience is unbelievable. There will be another ""incident"" like 1997 because all financial controls are in too few hands with no oversight / review by people that know the business. Short sighted management decisions to raise stock prices will lead to long term failure in about 5 years."
bad,Temporary job only...Work condition are acquired... If u really need work then go for it but u can't really move up within the company... I management is rude and unprofessional. Not very flexible either...
bad,Have been with the company for 17 years. At first we had great medical and safety bonus. Medical changed to cigna and did away with yearly bonus. Now they seem to concerned with numbers due to the sdo. More accidents and injuries than ever in my 17 years with the company and I blame it on sdo
bad,"Fast pace work enviornment, ,must have the ability to answer calls at a high call volume, math skills are a must to calculate credits and debits on member accounts."
bad,"I work as a Tractor-Trailer driver at the wellford, SC site. The management is very incompetent, and run all the drivers away. they make up silly rules that try to mimic manufacturing company rules  (Maybe, because one of them is a ex employee of said type company). All the while, not realizing that they are trying to run a trucking company. The job is bananas!!! The manager stand at a podium like a priest every morning, and have everyone open the hand book and read sections from it like it's a bible. Don't take my word for it and try it for your self, and you'll see.Too many crazy things to talk about. LOL!"
bad,Too hard to play the game or even understand it. There are too many systems to control your time and productivity to do the job efficiently and effectively.
bad,salary = slavery at my location. Was told that there was little to no overtime and 6 paid holidays. This is false as you are automatically scheduled to work one Saturday a month unpaid. Any paid holidays are automatically made up by working the following Saturday to make up for the day off.
bad,Could not get a proper schedule nor could not have family time. I felt like i lived at work most of the time. Felt like i lived to work. I went days on end with out seeing my kids or my family. I needed time off and couldnt get it
bad,Due to the nature of the relationship i had with the company i will re frame from commenting at this time maybe at a later time.
bad,management will throw you under the bus to make them self look good company always change rules to fit them give them 110% they still treat you like your dirt
bad,my co workers were fun to work with. management team not so much. managers don't have a clue and are not willing to listen to sugestions
bad,"The Temp Agency, Office Team, will do whatever it takes to fill the training class up. Not only was I done wrong by Office Team so was another member from my same training class. I had to reiterate that I had a vacation paid and planned for and no one listened. The Friday before I called Office Team and the woman who hired me on was supposed to document that I had a vacation and apparently that note was no where to be found. As far as Waste Management is concerned the management in the building likes to make a lot of noise and complain but does not set aside time to better the workers in areas that can be improved."
bad,"Company was ok to work for steady pay benefits were okay. The company name should be waste micro management. They will micro manage every little thing you do down to when you shpuld eat your lunch. Management will never stick by their drivers what so ever. Theyll stab you in the back on the drop of a dime. They have so many rules that change monthly. They have drive cam in the trucks that they only use to write you up for stupid things oh look you took a sip of your coffee and the camera went off write up. Safety only means something when its convient for them. They dont like anyone who speaks up about anything. The trucks are never fixed serious and unsafe write ups go on for months before they are actually fixed. If your friends with the boss for providence you can go to his house for dinner do what ever you want, get into accidents without a medical card and still have a job oh yea you can also come in work drunk and pop pills. So the moral of the story is make friends with the boss and its all butter from there."
bad,"My every day of work required of cleaning,recycling, and heavy lifting. I spent most of my time working 12 hour shift's cleaning out the machines and working on the conveyor belt."
bad,"The are looking ot outsource most middle and lower jobs and keep only sr management by 2017."
bad,"The pay is very well, but not family oriented at all. You have to handle multiple sites, and not a lot of help. The leadership likes to pass off work, and tell you it is part of your job description."
bad,fun place to work but yet stressful at the same time management needs a lot of help poorly managed communication is not the best. one of the co workers is not great to work with sets everyone up for failure if you don't know your job complains a lot as well as most of the company
bad,"Waste Management is a great company to work for the customer service environment is an excellent department to work in, with plenty of opportunities for advancement."
bad,"The pay is good but there is no Job security. You have no life because you work 60 to 75 hours a week. you definetly do not feel like you are a person only a expendible number. I felt like no matter how hard I worked or how good I was with this company it did not matter, the management would just give you more work, push, push, push. I am not blaming the Route Managers! It is definetly the upper Management who have sold the companies soul to wall street,"
bad,i work on the oilfield side and its constantly up and down. very unstable. the job itself is a great job to have but it is hard to get hours when its slow. i love all of my co-workers
bad,"Hard work environment, if you are a brown noser, great opportunity here. There is NO advancement opportunity even once you attain your degree. Management is a joke, more worried about their own positions then doing the right thing, Customer service is becoming a thing of the past with this company. If you want to be used and abused, sure, work here."
bad,Worked for Englewood for 3 years. Their District manager got fired so they brought a new one in and he is all talk doesn't do anything he says. Makes up his own rules and is all coperate not there for his employees what so ever! Would not recommend anyone to work there!
bad,"For some reason they have a problem making money.  The land fill side does well, but the other division have a hard time doing this.  This is mainly due to upper management not prepared/listening to what the workers are telling them.  Facts do not matter to upper management.  They prefer to go off feelings."
bad,"Good working outside"
bad,if you want to get divorced this is the place for you. no time to take care of personal business at all.
bad,"I started working as a temp, on one day I wanted to know what time it was and was fired right away.  Managers, don't forget when you started.  Don't allow that to go to you head, people need to work.  I had good expectations about the company and they went down the drain."
bad,"The management has poor communication skills, and the customer service training is non existent. I enjoyed being able to work in other departments to learn more about the company to see if I wanted to stay."
bad,There is zero accountability for management. No matter what its your fault when they fail to do their job.
bad,"`Days weve vere long  5 to 6 0clock daily every day,some days on weekend,  I learned to be patient, slow down work smart and safe,my co-workers great guys, hardest  part of the work no life balance, no time for family, worked  hard  could do the work, burned me out. loved the job just wise the condition were different"
bad,"Waste Management is like working retail because the hours are long and thankless. Management seemed more focused on the numbers to make corporate happy, while pushing the drivers to do more without the overtime option."
bad,"worked 12 long hours, at first was great place to work. Hardest part of the job was dealing  with the managemment. co- workers were pretty good though when they werent trying to stab you in the back. This is a good job for someone who has no family, will have no free time."
bad,"(ICR) Inside Sales Rep - You are required to provide both Customer Service and Sales at the same time. The programs provided are from the 1980's and the processes are all as*-backward. Your held to 2 different, very strict, Quality assurance reviews for both LOB's. Given a monthly quota for sales, however not given any real leeway for negotiation to obtain those sales. Aside from all that, management is very (clicky). Meaning if they like you, your IN. If they don't, your made to feel like an outsider. Not to mention if your a man you have no opinion around there as all Management including Assistant Management, are women. I can't tell you the amount of people who were hired and QUIT during training because of the environment around there! In this economy.. Not a recommended place to work unless you have a extremely high tolerance for Stress."
bad,Hardest part of the job is not being respected for the hard work that you do.
bad,12 hour days if you finished your route fast you would be rewarded with just having to go and finish the slow guys who knew you were coming. Was treated poorly when ever i asked a week in advance to be out of work by 4 o'clock with my route done to pick up my kids
bad,Standard corporate job good environment. minimal room for growth
bad,Good benefits
bad,"takes care of your families financial needs and health insurance, but but no time to be a dad or husband. only a money provider."
bad,"This Job used to be great, fun and exciting! After years of being with this company it has changed drastically and none of it is to benefit the employee. No one cares about you as the individual it's all about making money for the company but none of it will be paid to you. It's a horrible place to work now and I don't recommend anyone to work in customer service. There are still other departments that may be great but if you start in customer service they will never let you out."
bad,"A typical day at Waste Management involves a lot of time spent with your assigned business unit(s). This part of the job is very enjoyable because of the interaction and the feeling that you're making a difference. The downside is there is a lot of time spent driving from one location to another, which takes time away from other pressing issues. Because of so much time driving, you find yourself needing to work from home, which can interfere with worklife balance. Waste Management could also be a little more employee friendly; it seems that terminating employees is the rule more so than the exception. I believe that termination should be the final recourse, not the first."
bad,"Holding customers to their contracts is almost non-existant. When a commercial customer cancels, WMI will not hold to contract and as an account manager (3yrs on the job), I took the financial hit on cancellations. WMI will price increase up two times per year, on avg of 7-9% - do the math. So competitors can easily slide in and take the business. Never sign the three year contract, it renews LOL."
bad,I would not work there ever again.Most of the trucks dont have A.C. and its Florida.I  am more of an intellectual a problem solver blue collar type of man..
bad,"Smyrna location is all about the buddy system all about who you know to succeed . Under paid, no raises this company does not care if you have a family outside of work it’s all about them. 10 hour days. Rotate weekends"
bad,"Not the same job it used to be."
bad,Don't even waste your time here. This place is a joke and is not to be taken seriously. Run the other way as fast as you can. I see poverty in your future.
bad,It was great working out of the taylor yard  but once I got to the romulus  yard they treated us like  you can imagine I was there for  16 years  the  supervisors at the taylor yard were cool
bad,"Management is fresh out of school no truck driving experience, lack of knowledge on heavy equipment, expected the same results on bad weather days, only come out and see what your job consists of on sunny mild temp days and will sit behind their desk on bad weather  days calling you wondering why your slowing down but expect the best safety practice"
bad,"Management is a rotating door.  Also, Managements dating employees in office.  No job Security, very contradictory Management team and HR representatives."
bad,"I worked for waste management througt an agency . At first it wasn't easy dealing with new procedure and ect.  But I needed the experience for my next job. The supervisor a kid, need to grow to change his habit.  He stressed people out, he seems a really enjoy fire people at the company. Overall it's a good place to start learning the basics about being a dispatcher."
bad,Great com for as benefits and weekly pay was a plus but there is no chance to advance and they give the lowest raises that they can give and expect break yo back type work
bad,Poor management always following drivers and they  harass the drivers with the cameras in the trucks. Can’t even drink water in the truck ridiculous.   They always asking for favors but went you have a incident they don’t know you
bad,I hated it working so many hours an no life afterwards i like a short route an a place with union is so needed in that place. Also management is very bad lack of commuication skills an they tell ur personal buisness
bad,"Too many rules,demads, hours management doesn't care about their drivers it's all about their numbers they contantly lie lots of breakdowns It has a huge turnover rate  wonder why?"
bad,"Over worked. "
bad,Management only cares about their bonus at the expense of their employees. The compensation is rewarding but comes with a price.  This is an every man for himself work culture. Don't expect to work all year round if you are at the bottom of seniority. Expect the worst trucks imaginable to complete large work loads.
bad,Waste Management is not the best company to work for because of the lack of progress. No opportunity to move up in the ranks and half the time the manager tries and pushes you to hard.
bad,operated loader at recycled/trash plant separated aluminum/plastic/card board/glass into sorted drums and 100 yard trucks and roll offs trucks  always greased and maintenance my machinery and DEI's/pms
bad,We were promised we would never work in the rain. But would be paid regardless for that day....lie.every morning at 330 am we had to line up for safety meeting like children and be told things you already know.
bad,Not a good place to work for they aren’t good to union employees they treat the other employees who are nonunion a lot better than the ones who are union
bad,"A typical day is Pre-trip truck and start rout to dump all waste "
bad,"I worked at the Trenton location for a few months, they are understaffed and poorly managed. Regardless of which position you are hired for when your starting out you will end up doing residential work still throwing trash in the back of an old truck, eventhough they may tell you that's not the case. Because they are so understaffed you will find yourself in this position every time someone calls out, which is pratically every day. "
bad,"working up to 14 hours a day not out of the ordinary"
bad,this company is very well known and seems to be a good place to work but it is very risky. It's very stressful to work and have a camera that records your every move because there's a camera in your truck and when you hit bumps in the road the camera will go off and if your doing ANYTHING other than driving you will be reprimanded.
bad,"Shift foreman has no respect for supervisor no work ethic. Co workers get into physical altercation and management turns a blind eye. Mandatory overtime, no regard for personal life."
bad,Getting up at 3 in the morning was the worse thing about this job but when bills have to be paid it was never enough for a person with more bills than the company pay
bad,"thought going in, it would be a great company. maybe its just the manager i was stuck with. But they don't work well with schedules, they hire people telling them that if you work on saturday, you can change with a team member, but per usual, noone wants to work a saturday. They go based off sales, but, you don't get bonuses on a check, if you get a sale, you get it in wm points. But you have to make sales!! They want us to do so much more than what we are being paid. Training doesnt really prepare you for the floor, and the managers lack knowledge. if we have a complaint, then it just goes up, and up, in the air, you'll never hear the outcome or solution. They offer vto, but it's never given. vacation is accrued. so you don't start out with much. If you want an easy going job where you can slack off. WM maybe for you. The communication within departments is HORRIBLE.i thought it could be better. but, I guess not."
bad,WM is broken into regions - some regions are great and others are failing due to their structure.  West Coast has two main regions - one operates really well and the other is on borrowed time due to its structure with the local union.
bad,very stressful due to equipment in bad condition. 5 managers and 3 human resources mgr. If you speak up about a situation or use social media you will be forced to resign. I loved my job but could not stand by and watch as incompetent employees moved up the company ladder.
bad,"very strick. highly micro managed,"
bad,I worked there 3 going on 4 years and was not made permanent. and I kept getting hassled for being slow even though I got the job done. I just could not take the stress anymore.
bad,"Cut throat industry, poor upper management.  Must be a lifer for WM to promote you, must dedicate all your time. Toxic workplace, Learned a lot though."
bad,Waste management does not fight for their employees.  Once you get sick or expecting they look to replace you and not offer workmans comp.  This place do not care about people.
bad,this was the most discusting thing I ever done.the management was very poor where employees were allowed to get drunk on the job and disrespect others
bad,"Great job for a single 20 something. Paid vacations and personal days are great. All benefits are there. Cigna insurance = high Deductible. Management is clueless, they pull routes and over work you. zero chance for advancement. I loved this job at first. it kept me in shape finally got health insurance and the paid time off. eventually you get sick of having to go cover other routes because someone called in and coming home and falling asleep at the dinner table. your just a number to the company."
bad,"A typical day consisted of lots of oil changes.After i got moved up to mechanic i was working on hydraulic cylinders,brakes,electrical,as well as parts replacing with a little troubleshooting.the hardest part of the job was installing the cylinders to compact on the residential trucks and the stink.The most enjoyable part of the job to me was the electrical aspect of it."
bad,i hate my job there the wost place to work at managemant was poor the employes where back stabers a wost time in my life to work there         i don not have to much to say just sad
bad,"I liked it, my job consisted of something  different everyday which is cool , I'll help do it or fix it by myself with no problems .  a few positions opened up,  my work ethic was overlooked  so I felt it was time to go do something else"
bad,"Very fast paced, sometimes expected to do the impossible, favoritism towards some individuals from supervision that is not merit based. Pay is not competitive, no time off till after one year of employment. No sick days are allowed in first year no matter what. Trucks are brand new but poorly maintained. Co workers are the only thing that make this job bearable.  if you don't work 60 hours by your 5th day expect to work a 6th day."
bad,its a fast job that requires you to work long days management has nothing to say to you unless its something negative to write you up. 
bad,"Waste Management is a great company. They have award winning landfills and devote 30% of the land to the preservation of wildlife. However, they do not pay well and the yearly pay increases are offensive."
bad,Equipment was poorly maintained. 1 person per truck to load then drive. Has detrimental effect on body. U train with 2 people but thats NOT how it will be when off training!
bad,Waste Management was very stressful.My boss kept mess going at all times and was quick to fire people. NO one liked her or her attitude. She was not a team player at all
bad,The pay was decent and benefits were good but I would not recommend due to management. Worked years without any raises yet they continued to demand more and more work. Often started my driving routes without any men to pickup and would have to go to a temp service to get some which was stressful and should not be put on the driver. Management should be responsible for staffing. Never any positive feedback only negative and the management is totally ran with an intimidation type of leadership style. Often times when I got done with my route I would have to help others finish theirs and i never got the same in return. Low morale overall which started to affect my attitude when I got off work because I would be mentally and physically beat down.
bad,On a Regular day you’d be gettin trash dumping in garbage truck for at least 13 hrs a day. They pay minimum wage in Mississippi sooo the pay wasn’t that good for all that labor your doing.
bad,"Waste management was a interesting job. I did like the work there and the some people were very nice and other the complete opposite. I did not like how some, we'll most off the staff was of Hispanic race and that is not a problem. Only to some other staff that can't speak Spanish are at a certain disadvantage. I felt as if not matter what a worker was told something else was said behind your back. Also they have alot of family they work with."
bad,"If your looking for an easy job this is not it. Waste Management is a very stressful and demanding place to work. You can expect to work an average of 50 plus hours every week. If you want to live at work this is the place. The turn over of hourly employees and low-level management is unbelievable. If you think you can handle it by all means apply, but you better be the best if you want to make it. Only a few get past the training phase and even less make it past the 90-day probationary period. If you are female, they will not discriminate, you will not make it any longer and you will be expected to perform at the same level as the men. You are at the mercy of mother nature and will face extream weather conditions. Do not think for a moment that you get any holidays off. We work 365 days a year. Remember, at WM you are only a number and the only people that really matter are the shareholders. There is no way to sugar coat this job. Come see for yourself."
bad,start the workday 5am you work until the job is done . dispatch is a joke. they know what needs to be done however they wait until late afternoon to dispatch calls that could have been given to the drivers by noon. you never know what time you are going to get done which makes family time very hard. nobody works together it's really everyone for themselves.
bad,poor job training  poor management to many hours your a number not an employee let go for first offense loto violation. co discriminates against there employees and violates labor laws and has multiple lawsuits against them for those violations  i loved working there up until a new manager came in and took over
bad,"The expectations for safety do not balance with the work expected to be completed. running constantly with unrealistic time expectations. Too many bosses to few subordinates, Overall I was shocked to see that out of 65+ employees that's 75% of them hated their jobs."
bad,"hard to sell against competition when their prices are about 50% less.Terrible boss, who would not get back with you on proposals for 3 weeks. Very cut throat business. Sales Goals are almost impossible to obtain."
bad,"•	Operated heavy equipment in compliance with the company operating safety policies and procedures."
bad,"I  liked the company and the people there. but when i was asked to moved to a different department temporarily, i humbly accepted but when the time was for me to move back to regular department i kept being ignored and basically labeled for being concerned about something i was promised."
bad,"scheduling trash pick ups, building new accounts, transferring calls to appropriate person. co-workers are nice but the management didn't really help you learn to become better at you job."
bad,"The Coquitlam office at Waste Management has potential to be a great place to work, however, the local management team is beyond incompetent. There is no accountability so the employees do whatever they would like with no repercussions from their managers. The managers also try to pass off all of their work to the admin team so they can sit around all day and not have to face the music.  It is a unionized environment but it seems as if the union has full control and do as they please"
bad,"A typical day at work would start very early in the morning around six or seven am. After sitting around waiting to see if you will be scheduled to a route you, you load up and head to your route. Once at you route you start you day by disposing garbage non stop until break. After break you are back at it again until your route is complete. The most enjoyable part of the job was completing the route and heading back. The hardest part of the job was disposing trash from 500 plus homes."
bad,"It is a garbage company, what do you expect.  Sometimes over charges customers.  Good experience.  No room to grow though.  Hire new people making more than current employees."
bad,"Best part of the day is when I get to go home! Other wise cheap pay and a bad manager I don't recommend working here. No cost of living raise since I've been working here they lie about that,you top out at your position and that is what you will be making 16.00 is basically it don't know of anyone there making more then that even the guys that have been there for five years or more. Pretty sad!"
bad,The company requires managers to hit efficiency goals and demand improvement no matter what. They push you until you make mistakes then give you points towards firings. Horrible work environment. Managers want you off the clock when you are done with your route. No coaching unless you are reported for something.
bad,"Work on holidays, Strenuous work, Rain, Sleat, or Snow....  Good work environment, Nice co-workers , Great help , Motivated atmosphere and Takes some  getting use to!!"
bad,"Work isn't bad but you're misled from the beginning about your job duties. Always having to do other departments work for them because they won't allow overtime. No room for advancement, poor raises. Pay is low for the industry."
bad,long days upper management treats employees as numbers and not people. great benefits. lower management treats employees as people and are very respectable...
bad,Management is shaky - they are changing commission continuously.  They will get rid of you any way they can if they feel you are able to make any type of money on your commission. So they are constantly changing it so you have to learn how to work the system to make a commission check.
bad,"Great pay and benefits, my co-workes are great to work with,  company really invests in there staff.  Lots of awards to be won "
bad,"The company values were great. Management was not willing to listen to employees needs. The workers are nice, Management was the only downfall."
bad,Safety rules are good to have but enforcement is a little to much and penalties are a little to strong for the offence. I drove a truck on company property less than 300 yards from the trucks parking spot to the shop without a seat belt and was caught on drive cam and for this offence I was terminated first and only offence
bad,This company is useless as for what they pay employees an hour. For northeast region lousy job for laborer on the truck. And driver pay isn't much more money per hour. I was told that they look for the stupidest thing to get rid of some one who has been working on the job for years to get rid of the higher pay scale guys. So the corporate officials can be paid more money. Largest trash corporation in the world and they can afford to pay people better than what they are paying for the one that is picking up the the trash off the streets. In 13 years since I have worked there. They have only moved the pay scale of about 5 dollars more an hour to start. Where I work now is independent and privately family owned business. They pay more Money to start then Waste Management
bad,supervisor never was there at work when we were. they always left work so if needed something had to wait for them to come back to work. told to break federal driving laws. deny lunch due to a truck breakdown and that breakdown time was considered my lunch.
bad,"Waste Management does not take care of management. all boils down to stock holders. Long hours with no pay. Upper management is in the same boat. They have you work with as few people as possible and expect you to get everything done. The are not concerned about how many hours drivers work, they just make sure they get paid for hours they work. They don't care about the drivers family life."
bad,No job security  and they write you up for everything  and color plays a big part one color do whatever they want the other better be careful
bad,it was good to work here. didnt really like the people or the atmosphere but overall it was an ok experince and oppourtunties
bad,"Typical day at work consisted of long grueling hours sorting through garbage at breakneck speeds, in a hazardous work environment. I learned many things about the recycling process, such as what can and can't be recycled and what its used for. Management was supportive but distant. The hardest part of the job was the physical stress, constant movement through hard work with VERY little rest. The best part of the job was the learning experience."
bad,"that was after katrina co workers was fine,but the smell and the city was terrible,but the pay was good management was poor,but the good thing was i had a chance to help were it was needed"
bad,need better management at this site but have good benefits long hours but have excellent pay work six day a week. not enough vacation time
bad,"Wouldn't recommend this place to someone that I hated, daily fight and backstabbing was part of the culture, to true trash company"
bad,management has no consideration for employees home and work life.  learned a lot in a short period.  a typical day starts at 5 pm and ends between 3 - 5 am and you never know when you show up what time you will be leaving.
bad,Very long work hours and very long commute due to location of offices coworkers were very friendly and willing to assist at any time
bad,"the weekly pay was nice"
bad,"The company was experiencing a lot of changes when I worked there. There were some  great people, but leadership was suffering."
bad,"Employment with WM from the beginning was very unsatisfactory, there are no chances of  advancement, working daily with people who do not even give you the courtesy of saying, Good morning but will request of your assistance. "
bad,Upper Management treated employees like they were disposal diapers. Very unprofessional upper management. Would not advise the timid to apply.
bad,"I do not wish to identify with this company."
bad,"Working at Quality 1 Training in Edmonton Alberta was I would have to say the worst experience ever. The main boss does not care if anyone gets hurt, if you got hurt it was to bad you still had to work....Blood could have been coming out of your head she would still make you work (I'm not even kidding)....I will never go back there again and if anyone ever asks me about the place I will be honest and tell them the truth about the place...."
bad,"Working at this company was a horrible experience, I cried every day driving into work.  If you were trained correctly and given the reaources the job would have been tolerable.   My coworkers were nice and the office building was nice but the management treated you like a child. The supervisors were not properly trained.   All they cared about was being left alone at their desk and if you had a question they would act busy but they were doing personal business.  One supervisor would sit at her desk putting on makeup even while you were asking for help!  Another call center supervisor yelled at an agent (who was on a call helping a client) across the office floor because they were standing up to relieve a leg cramp!  Told them they had to sit down to work!  Then they installed a card swipper on the bathroom so they could monitor who and how many times the bathroom was used! Totally insane."
bad,"VERY STRESSFUL PLACE to work at, I worked in yonkers NY for 4 years but i have been told it all depends on what terminal your from that  really matters etc....the training is soooo weird they train you for a few weeks and stress the fact that SAFETY is their number 1 priority but at the same time force you to complete their routes faster and faster  adding new stops and wont hire new man power and expect the driver to do the job of two guys lol once you accomplish that task soon they will start adding more and more stops to your route and expect for you to finish that new route nearly as fast as the last one and you better be accident free lol this place is a joke!!!.... the supervisors follow you like cops atleast every 3 weeks.They would pop up at stops watching your every move clock your lunch hour call you on the phone while your doing your route giving you extra work over and over then tell you at the end of the day "" HEY buddy what happened today you took longer then usual our productivity is going down you think you can pick it up "" lol."
bad,"The terminology ""being thrown to the wolves"" comes to mind. WM is in a continual state of reorganization in which the employees that remain in their jobs get more and more work piled on them. It is expected that you will have to work nights and weekends to hit deadlines and there is little to no training. There is a distinct lack of organization and management is virtually nonexistent."
bad,"Although the perks of this employer is great (pay, benefits, RRSP's, etc.) the work environment itself, is very negative. Employees do not receive enough or any positive feedback from their management / supervisor team. Will receive the amount of work for 4 dispatchers as opposed to 1. Coverage of areas are constantly changing. In less then 1 month, 4 people quit and were not replaced. Always short staffed. "
bad,"The company is pretty big, and does not really offers the best to its employees. Management lacks professionalism and politics get too much on the way for hard working employees."
bad,"This company would keep you on as a temp for a year or longer before hiring you, you had to work most holidays and the pay was low."
bad,"If you are not management do not expect to have work life balance. Cannot even be 1 min late to work, 5 min late from a 30 min lunch or have a doctor's note to excuse you from work without receiving occurences. Went from 9 1/2 occurence policy to fired at 7. Do not expect to stay here over 1 year.....the only people who survive here have been on FMLA or some sort of other leave. Definately no place for advancement.....must remain in position over a year & no other jobs really to move into. People also expect you to do their jobs for them including billing dept, set-up, dispatch, and supervisors & leads. Horrible culture for such a large organization. They should be embarrassed."
bad,"Training is sub-par at best.  2 weeks of training, 2 hours of side-by-sides and you're expected to not only take calls, but be at the required metrics.  Policy changes daily and the supervisors are close to, but not quite at, incompetent.  Advancement is not possible, dress code is unreasonable for a call center: ""just because we deal in trash, doesn't mean we should look like it.""  The trainer is unfocused, fake and unskilled."
bad,Customers call in with many issues for resolution. Training is good and equips the employee to handle most requests. Management is not a strong presence. The hardest part of the job was getting billing issues resolved. The most enjoyable part of the job was the incentives.
bad,My job position did not qualify me to make an overall review of the company.
bad,I did not enjoy my working experience at Waste Management . I did not like the environment of micro management and I did not care for  the management style of this place.
bad,"it was a great place to work, good pay long hours, not the best place to advance"
bad,"The company at face value is fine , pay and bennies are good, they just don't care about managers, you are there at their disposal , the few unions they do have they really need cause they will dump you in a heart beat , maintenance is a second thought on the trucks  they send out daily , what matters ? THE CORPORATE BOTTOM LINE "
bad,"Expected workers to hours that required overtime but harrassed employees if they worke overtime."
bad,"Waste Management has earned its reputation as a meat grinder for good workers. They pay very well, but don't expect to keep your job."
bad,working on trash learned hydraulic and switches hardest part working on trash trucks was the smell of trash
bad,Waste Management is reducing staff all the time but not because of technology. The IT arm of WM knows in a touch economy people will work 60-70 hours a week.
bad,Great compensation and coworkers were supportive and was a fast paced environment. overall a C - job security is an issue as many moving parts.
bad,"im not very happy here, you cannot grow like they said you can,"
bad,"The worst part of the job, was coming in first thing and finding out someone called off and you were switched to cover their route. They usually called off on their busiest days."
bad,They put more work on you and the raises are only 10 to 20 cents a year.  I was told that I would be plant lead and never got the pay or title.  So I was doing the work and not getting what I deserved.
bad,Your personal stats are affected by your peers. This results in high turnover and no advancement. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for a better role.
bad,due to the dishonsty of managment i quit was lied to many times and told i was allowed to take the days off that were intended for me nothing got resolved also was discriminated because of race
bad,I would never work for this company ever again or recomend to anyone this is the worst company I have ever work for. The management sucks the work environment is to stressful and all they care about is productivity numbers.
bad,They dress you up very good but they don’t pay enough for it to be a multi billion dollar company they don’t pay their employees enough especially their residential drivers we do all the hard work and we are also the lowest paid
bad,Management likes to pawn off there work on others. Long hours. Management likes to have you do shotty repairs so trucks are up quicker. Parts are a pain to get.
bad,Management very numbers oriented with little regard for frontline employees. Very hard on drivers to meet near impossible goals in the garbage industry because it is very unpredictable. Do not apply for residential
bad,"Management was horrible. If you make a mistake and you tell management, you can be fired. so no-one will admit to a mistake in fear of job loss. Management has favorites and they hire fleet management who have no clue what a truck is."
bad,"Stressful, low moral, no courtesy. They make lots of promises , but never fulfill them. Managers paint a good picture of Pasadena Waste Management but it is false. Drivers complain everyday about bad maintenance on Trucks."
bad,"Very fast pace, could be a great job if management knew how to run things. Depending on location could be a good job. Galesburg has the worst equipment,  always behind with employees and you don't know day to day who you have to help because of short staff."
bad,The managers are rude and bully employees. Not much diversity within company. There are no females and only two people of color working at this location. Manager are neglectful of a lot of thing around this fleet. This fleet is very run down and poorly kept by management.  Most of the vehicles are in bad condition and extremely dirty. Vehicles are often in the shop for weeks for repairs. A lot of employees feel their concerns are ignored by management. A lot of turnover within company.
bad,I am unable to offer any information about this company at this time.  I prefer not to participate in answering questions about this company.  Not available
bad,"Long hours, low pay. If you have a family you will never see them. The demand for corporate to make money trumps employee health and freedom. There is very little upside besides barely being able to pay your bills."
bad,"Very demanding problems if you work for the company. A rough environment with the constant threat of massive lay-offs, which they do every 18 months or so. Good pay and benefits. Smart management, for the most part."
bad,"It's a micro-managed company,drivecam records both ways,no smoking,no cell phone,no CB,4 sec distance from vehicles on road.The job is stressful for what they pay is not enough."
bad,"Some good people at this company, but they wait to disclose full information and expectations till after hired. Management likes to delegate a lot of work."
bad,"The environment is very political and inconsistent.   Good people get let go, while others flourish undeserved.  Gets in own way with unnecessary tasks detracting from focused goals.   Systems create difficulties attaining assigned goals."
bad,Work day was full of meetings daily.  Wasted time instead of focusing on more important items.  One good factor is the safety.  They want everyone to come home at night
bad,"Easy Job, great benefits. Management is horrible! Their motto should be, (waste management we hire you to fire you)! They use drivecam as a gotcha tool! You're like a toddler being babysat 14 hours per day! You're wrote up for anything! This place is a revolving door! New employees every week!"
bad,"I worked for this company for 6 months as  yard man. The pay and benefits are top notch. The problems i had was with the site manager and his two subordinates. It was like the three stooges. No daily planning , fly by the seat of thier pants attitude. Very frustrating. No respect for the night mechanics . the site manager was harrasing employeess and corperate wiped it under the carpet, the drivers do nothing but complain about management"
bad,This is a stressful job. You are the only one there for 18 trucks that have a average age of 12 years old and these are refuse trucks that are heavily used. The mechanics before did a lot of not very good repairs so you are constantly fixing dumb stuff. This job is terrible for 1 person
bad,"Waste Management is doing a New ""Driver Driver"" experiment with their rear loaders. So the driver labor's on the back half the day and drives the other. It's $18 per hour and only a 2% raise per year that's 36¢ a year. That's ""if"" they give you one. They sell to you that it's so easy laboring on the back of the truck day to day. But that's not the case. Your in freezing conditions rain heat. Walking through the dump with needles and disease you may be stepping in and bringing home with you. Some have been stabbed by needles from the trash bins. So no hazard pay. No bonus they have ""points"" they give you when you do something for them but they never seem to remember to give them out... You also have cameras on you all day watching you and safety guys following you and spying around corners making sure you follow WM rules"
bad,"It gave  me more experience to do more work and knowledge of things. It was a good job after all. Didn't get pressure on it and most important they respect you from race, to religion and all."
bad,"Im sure other people would disagree. But my experience at WM was just down right discrimination.  When we got to finish out training, we were assigned to our managers. My manager was very discriminating, obviously giving more favorable options to her same skin color."
bad,waste management they will give you a chance to work but I think we are underpaid. no benefits no paid holiday or vacation. waste management is a equal opportunity place to work.
bad,"The company does NOT look out for the best interest of their customers.  Nor, do they give the adequate training for the ""Inbound Account Managers"" to handle situations.  The company will pitch this position as an Inside sales/account management. But, really, you're dealing with customers calling in to cancel their accounts because they are being billed way more than what they had originally agreed to when first signing.  Then, when you tell them they ""can't"" cancel without paying an ""early termination fee"", they then proceed to scream at you profusely.  These type of conversations are, on average, every 7 out of 10 you'll have during the work day."
bad,"Very uncomfortable and poor environment, also trucks and equipment are below Standards.Does not communicate job duties and job qualifications properly."
bad,the management team at my location was only concern about the bonuses and not the safety of the driver. should the driver have concerns about his or her safety they would meet with a manager who would give them a 3-day suspension and a final warning without looking in the action of the accused. I find this lack of concern in bad taste as someone is going to get seriously injured by the person who continuously keeps breaking rules and having the red light camera on while he breaks them is more of a slap in the face.
bad,Residential management is terrible. Bad communcation skills. Talks down to drivers. Treats ppl just like a number. They don't care to hear what you have to say even at the top. Rude HR department. It want be long before this is no longer the number 1 in the industry.  Cannot keep drivers if they life depended on it and it's managements fault but they're to busy or anything to notice. I would hate to see what this place will look like in 10 yrs. My guess moved or shut down bc the turnover rate is high. Ppl say how jobs are when you first start and you don't no rather to believe them bc your new but that place the bad reviews are almost dead on point. I been here a little over a yr and have seen at least a couple dozen ppl quit. Most of which were good hard working guys and ladies. I wouldn't recommend thus place to anyone who has Class A and can easily get another job bc you don't want to risk CDLs for a company like this. Oh and Florida is a joke. They didn't teach anything. Just for publicity to show other industries look we send our drivers away to train. Nothing but publicity. But don't teach anything except unfortunate lives that were changed by the company. So sad.
bad,"Number of calls taken per day was more important than quality of assisting customer."
bad,"Good company conceptual model, poor execution on not wanting to hear the direct feedback from mid-level managers. Culture is ""open minded"" on the surface but not so much in practice."
bad,No job security for management or loyalty. Tips for drivers only which are men. All other tips for laborers go to the company. Last 4 managers after 20 years some are let go for made up reasons.
bad,"Typical work day is between 11 to 12 hours.  Local management is average, at best.  Management style is based on arrogance, intimidation, disrespect, condescension, and a defuse and dismiss attitude.  Micromanagement is a way of life here.  Sold a job during hiring process that never materialized.  Workplace culture is best illustrated by approximately 70% driver turnover in first year of tractor trailer division operation.  Hardest part of the job is dealing with management's ""here's the policy this week"" attitude.  Management wants respect, but shows very little to it's driver workforce.  The most enjoyable part of this job was the friendships and support from the other drivers."
bad,"This place will run you to the ground with their bad management. They are currently trying to make things work with one RM over two divisions, and the rest of the divisions having one RM. This company does not care about you. They don't care how hard you work, and they don't care how LONG you work. While they also pay on an incentive scale (Base is $15.50), so you can be sure that if they have any missed pickups that go on your route, it screws with your money, and you guessed it; They don't care."
bad,Its a job that will work u out a hard job and good job its a good place to work at abd have some good people there to work with and good truck to on hot day they bring the workes something to drink in the heat and take care of there worker and sometime give us lunch and on cold days they have soup for us and sub to
bad,"If you bust your @## every day no matter what it may mean nothing to management. You literally show up at 5am and by 6am you may or may not be assigned a truck. You will start off as a Temp and most laborers stay that way due to the company not hiring any more full time positions then it has too, as a temp you have no benefits and pay is sub $8.5hr. You may work 14hrs one week and then 50+ the next on a blue moon. They keep track of your hours on a paper time sheet that you have no way of knowing whats on it, coming up short on hours is common so you need to document and keep track of your working hours. You could show up in the morning and then told to just stay till noon to replace people aleady assigned a truck(you are not paid till you replace that person)."
bad,I prefer not to disclose a review at this time. I have not worked for the company in over 5 years. At the time of my departure the company was going through relocation and restructuring.
bad,great coworkers but very hazardous workplace. safety issues braught to supervisory attention but not addressed. lack of employee appreciation. typical work day includes loading garbage into trailers without proper safety protection. compensation does not equal life threatening hazards.
bad,"WM is a company of acquisitions and its growth is based off of acquiring successful companies and turning them into battering rams to bully both customers and competition. I worked for this company for twenty years and have seen all aspects of how employees are treated... TRUST ME, this is not a place that you want to work!"
bad,If you move into sales the company pays well. Management staff has an issue with anyone that doesn't fit there click. WM would be a great company to work for if corporate would monitor the local management teams a little more.
bad,"Waste Management has some of the best benefits on the market, including a company vehicle you can take home every day.  The down side is the hours.  You will work long long long hours with this company.  The normal is 12 -14 hours each day.  The day is run by chaos no matter how much organization you attempt to add to it. Be prepared for early mornings and late nights.  If you have no family or children and you're willing to work the hours this could be a good place for you.  Family and work life balance doesn't exist to this organization.  Being the largest refuse company in the world you would think there would be a strong corporate culture to go along with the big title.  To date, WM has failed to develop any sort of corporate culture nationally or locally."
bad,"Great pay, call center environment, high stress calls,  trained to take calls around the country.  You were constantly having escalated calls from unsatisfied customers.  Leads would rarely take phone escalations."
bad,A good place to work. Great co-workers. No long breaks. No benefits. No overtime. The pay is okay. The commute to work can be too much. Doesn't have a good structure.
bad,"As an Inside Commercial Representative (ICR), I receive and process calls from Commercial customers and serve as the end-to-end point of contact for these customers.

As an ICR, I collaborate with members of my team to meet overall call center objectives and enhance the customer service experience while working to exceed every customer's expectation."
bad,day at work can be challenging and stressful at times but hey you get to throw trash all day.management could do more for employees and communicate better and care about employees well being.good company needs work
bad,"50 hour per week job quickly becomes 60-70 hours per week. Ever increasing workload, poor site management."
bad,"you can count on advancement opportunities, but not on the job.  the company lays off people about every 2 years.  they expect 24/7 commitment and its hard to actually take any vacation.  fast paced environment, for the most the people are pretty great"
bad,"Picture this, A company so used to making easy money they have no idea how to be competitive or efficient.  Realizing this, they go on regular hiring sprees to help make themselves better.  After they realize that you cant put lipstick on a pig, they have massive regular layoffs after hiring binges.  Throw in bringing in cheaper foreign workers to displace American workers and you have....The WASTE MANAGEMENT ZONE!     Cue Scary Music!"
bad,"Hostile work invornment, benifits were the best thing about this place. I would not reccomend them"
bad,"PRN "
bad,Members of Management do not convey good leaderships skills. Members of management place their work loads on individual employees with bribery and promises that by doing the work of management and assisting the manager the employee will get ahead. Once this happens and the employee realizes they are being used the management team finds a way to dispose of the employee. This is an unethical place to work.. Co-workers complain all the time. the most enjoyable part of the customer service aspect is assisting the clients/customers and knowing that you have at least attempted to do the job you were hired to do. The hardest part of the job is getting up each day to go to it. A typical day of work at Waste Management in the Germantown  location is hearing all the complaints from customers about their overly expensive billing invoices and the non service they are recieving with the expectation to pay their bill but yet no service for 2 to 3 weeks at a time. Management just acts as though this is a normal process especially in the winter time I really feel bad for the customer. It is a wonder that WM in Germantown is not closed indefinately
bad,during my interview I was so excited to start working for waste management the person that interviewed me told me there was a lot of opportunity to grow once I started training  we had a lot of issues with the computers Most of our scenarios we can never go through them because our computer had problems they always told us it was okay we were going to be OK on the floor once we hit our floor they basically left us that Friday on our own didn't give us no support no managers or any one came to check or show support. Talking to other employees they did verify what we could already see that the company talked so much but showed different in their actions. I left the company
bad,"worked at hazardous material production facility supervisor.13 hr days in haz mat suit .summer in ppe was dangerous and they do not care if you pass out its always your fault . learned alot about hazardous material processing, and how much my body could handle i know if your looking for a safe non physical job THIS is not it. always fixed equipment and was not a maintenance person understaffed and underpaid."
bad,start time is 3am.. done by noon.. must have route completed in the time frame they feel you should be able to complete it! it does NOT always happen.
bad,Answered the incoming calls for several lines of business.Answered a large amount of emails. Had to work several boards with lines of businesses that had calls for the drivers. Had to dispatch drivers to calls. Data Entry of all the work done by the drivers. Had to prepare revenue and disposal reports for the district manager. Learn spread sheets and how to work computer programing. Closed tickets that billed commerical customers as the driver completed the calls. Worked with 2 other women in the office that did other jobs.
bad,"The company did not inform me of the disciplinary consequences. I was written up for an incident. The next incident did not cause any damage, however, I reported it anyway. I was suspended for a week, then I was called in and terminated. I would never recommend this company to anyone."
bad,"My review in a nutshell would be: "
bad,I liked working here as much as the next guy. The job puts alot of pressure on you and there isnt much flexibility for leaving early in case of emergencies. The management was great but the pay was not worth the torture. Also I quit because I needed time off and HR said they understood and I thought I left on good terms but when I reapplied I got rejected. Wouldn't recommend working here if you want to maintain your sanity.
bad,Good job for young guys. Good bennifits but no flexibility for time off. Senior guys get all the good time. If you get hurt they hunt you every day until you quit or fired. Impossible to move up. Crazy rules. Managers reward lazy drivers and hard working ones get more work. Other garbage companies pay about the same with no rules.
bad,Negative and racist work work environment.   The manager & team lead are disgruntled.  Their attitude contribute to negative bitter work environment.  Advancement is frown upon.
bad,I worked for WM for 20+ years . The last year or so it became all a numbers game for them. The work load was getting to the point that you were taking a lunch at the end of a 12 or more hr. day.  They also have gotten to the point you are so micro managed that it was hard to be safe at your job. They want to push safety but are always on you with times. and to hear the words spoken ''good job'' is all but unheard of.  I hated to leave here the pay was good and the benefits were some of the best around.   It took a lot to walk away from what I had but some times you have to go with what you believe in. Play there game and you will be fine.
bad,"Highly do not recommend working at the sun valley location. For a billion dollar company, we never have parts in stock and it always becomes our job to figure it out with out the proper parts. 95% of our trucks are all the same model yet we have parts in stock for other older trucks no longer in our lot. Drivers dont know how to communicate what issues they're having with their trucks and often we get stuck doing things that is the drivers responsibility with no consequences to the driver. Day shift leaves the shop dirty for us to clean all the time. Everything rolls down to night shift and we get left to take care of everything including that nights write ups so it's easy to be overworked. We are understaffed with mechanics but that doesnt stop management  from overworking us. Its very difficult to have a social life and maintain this job at the same time. We've asked multiple times to be provided with training for these trucks only to be told no, we are short on shop tool and when we ask for that tool, we get told were suppose to buy it ourselves. Worst yet, if you're a decent mechanic, you'll be overworked to make up for the mechanics who refuse to learn or take certain jobs. Overall I dont blame the company, I blame the sites poor management and lack of communication with us"
bad,Have great coworkers but communication with management to the workers wasn’t very good. Had great benefits and decent pay. Was hot when it was hot outside and cold when it was cold.
bad,"its a slow paced job that takes problems solving skills, but you will become extremely dirty and there's no benefits or sick days involved, your pay in the Wilson are starts at about 9.25 and over a 4 year time period your pay will only go up $1.50 and no further. nice friendly managers but the tasks at hand are too much for them to handle. the hardest part of the job is swing shift and having to walk about 10 minutes from one work area to another countless times a shift while being under paid for it. the most enjoyable part is the slow paced working."
bad,"they have an open door policy. Management doesn't care about employees. All management cares about is profit. Safety is number 1 at this company. You are given a 2 pairs of gloves a month and if it rains your gloves are ruined and its difficult to nearly impossible to get another pair. WM hats are difficult to get and they don't want you to wear anything else besides WM gear. The hardest part of the job is driving because of 'DriveCam'. The camera is sensitive any bump on the road can set it off. The video is reviewed and any infraction the supervisor will write you up. the more writeups you get, the easier it is for management to fire you."
bad,If you get into any type of situation you will be terminated.  I had a coworker assault me and I did not lay a hand on him.  I was terminated.  He tried to hit my car with his because I was not going fast enough.
bad,"no motivation, constant stress , under paid , favoritism , honest hard work don't get financially recognized. Favorite people do. 40 hrs. paycheck equivalent of a Mcdonald's worker ."
bad,I had 12 managers in 14 years. Management would not assist just assign more work.  I was replaced with 5 people and they still could not get the job done.
bad,Lots of driving into awkward places and somtimes being caught in stressful situations hours can be long and sometimes overwhelming for someone new to the job
bad,"Over all good place to work . Due to tough market competition its hard to make some extra hours , Management is very helpful but very straight when it comes to safety . No room to grow"
bad,"Job stability, just major favoritism if not good in with management."
bad,Waste Management is the perfect job for someone other then me. Even thought it is a ok place to work i just couldn't deal with the disrespect from managers.
bad,"This company has zero tolerance for mistakes, which is difficult when you are human. Cameras in truck are more distraction than help.Pay is low for physical and professional rule demands that are extremely difficult for dedicated workers to follow. Kind of a round room where supervisors ask you to find corners."
bad,"The people I work with are fantastic. However, the workload is unreasonable and the lack of onboarding is disappointing. Ultimately, WM would prefer to hire new employees than train existing."
bad,they promised me a job once my spot was being filled the lady quit who was taking my spot so they kept me In residential to pacify telling me they would move me up but yet and still they havent
bad,"Days can be long which usually start at 2:45 am. A typical day consists of opening the facility, running reports and analyzing data from the previous day. Coaching drivers on performance, conducting safety meetings weekly, manager meetings, driver huddles, visiting customers, and making sure drivers are getting everything on their routes completed. Management is good at site level. Hardest thing to do is work around issues you can't control. Best thing about this job is the ability to work away from the office."
bad,"Great people to work with, training was in depth and lengthy, and relatively easy day in and day out. Company is a bit of dinosaur when it comes to embracing and using technology, so it unfortunately makes relatively simples tasks or request quiet time consuming and also requires far more staffing that otherwise would be needed."
bad,"This was by far one of the hardest job I ever hard a typical day would involve standing for hours sorting through refuse in which many times could be quite difficult the things I learned at waste management is that hard work can pay off and a job is a job and you have to be optimistic, the management at waste management could be bias at times and overall it was not that great the co-workers were nice but at many times it was hard to communicate because of their language origin the hardest part was sorting through the refuse and the smells, the rodents, the road kill, and the bodies, there were not to many enjoyable parts of this job because of the things one was dealing with"
bad,I dedicated over 10 years to this company and was laid off due to supposedly lack of work. After being laid off I see postings for a Roll Off dispatcher the same job I was laid off from.  Truth be told I saw the writing on the wall those employees with the most tenure began to get fired and laid off some rep had over 20 years experience.  I know the bottom line is they no longer wanted to pay us because we started to make too much money as well as earned many weeks of vacation.  So sad when you dedicate your time with a company and they let you go because of money. It wasn't like this is a struggling company.
bad,"My direct manager could not be better."
bad,Management has trouble dealing with employees creating more problems/work than needed creating further funds to be exhausted.
bad,"I opened up the site every morning and sometimes closed it when business was booming. I learned quite a bit through out the years of service as far as being an operator and working with people and management to make it the best experience it could be. Management changed throughout the years some good and some bad. I made an attempt to work with everyone that came in to play. I trusted them and felt that they trusted me to the fullest almost until the end. My co workers were great except for a few that came from other site and didn't like it our way. The hardest part of the job was when thing's changed between me and the people I trusted for year's. I was very loyal to them and worked long hour's and sometimes seven day's a week. The best part was when I felt like I was connecting with our drivers and other company bosses when they needed help with anything."
bad,Not the best retention rate. This is a good starter position until you are ready to move into a higher or new position
bad,"Company offers great benefits, Pay is not good. Poor management. very political."
bad,The managers there understand its a hard job but the expectations are still high the work is alot of labor and can get a little stressful. The most important part of my job is knowing i can get through a tough physical day of work. The other workers make the best of a hard days work and typically are fun to be around.
bad,"The company is great but the pay sucks long hours, and constant change due to different management."
bad,a typical day at work i worked long hours i worked over night on there heavy equiment and trucks
bad,Good people to work with. Company as a whole is going through challenges as several companies are. They have a great ambition to green the world.
bad,"Poor customer service,makes this a stressful place to work .  So the work load is impossible to accomplish adding to the stress level.then comes the poor equipment,the way managers treat drivers and over all work atmosphere is daunting to say the least.."
bad,"enjoyed interacting with other drivers and customers"
bad,"Good benifits, good pay, not much overtime. Cumbersome procedures and top heavy management make it difficult to do your job efficiently. Trained one way and told to do things another way.  Make sure to get all orders by text or email"
bad,"First FT job, after 8 months on job started getting sick at work - throwing up and severe stomach issues for unknown reasons.  Started series of tests since had health ins.  Excuses provided for every dr visit, blood work visit, CT Scan, went to Corp Care to be released (who did nothing by the way) numerous times but kept getting sick.  Written up last warning for time off (had to use all of my PTO which was understood) but final warning was due to being 1 minute late!!!!! But the times I had to work at another Landfill, arrived 10 minutes always before start, was given no key, and had to sit and wait for 40 minutes unpaid for employee to show up - as well as no facility to even wash hands - had to go to the local sub shop to wash hands or use facility.  Never advised of my FMLA rights or Short Term disability benefit for illness - just given final warning.  I'm 21 years old, how would I know how that works - it was their job to advise me of my rights. Worked in water treatment plant with no protection. Was blowing black soot out of my nose.  Asked for mask as was told during interview I would be fitted for one.  Never provided me one.  Results of illness could only be linked to getting sick from the gases and soot in the treatment plant - no other explanation per doctor.  Very poorly run all the way around - horrible first FT job experience."
bad,There were to many safety regulations the site manager at the time was all about herself and making herself look good to corporate but later heard she got fired two months after I quite
bad,"Working at waste management is like working inside a garbage truck . IT STINKS , I never been so stressed at a job before in my entire life . Do not play yourself working there"
bad,it was ok just wasnt for me i feel like i knew i would find somthing that fits me alot more just was to many health concerns and i didnt want to breath in alot of the chemicals.
bad,Trucks not up to DOT standard. No family time. Not a fun place to work. Dangerous at times. Some of the places they service are hazardous. Would not work for that site again. Drivers at that site where fun to work with.
bad,true hard labor need patience and the ability to take in toxic air on a daily basis the pay is good but to be honest smelling good instead of a pile trash other wise the job is good
bad,Very difficult place to work. Money rules all here and the managers are glorified bean counters. I never once saw a manager do anything productive in my time there. They were always inaccessible  due to meetings or were following drivers around waiting to write them up for the slightest infraction.
bad,"I tried to transfer to Texas with the company and the people took ages to interview me. The jobs I applied for were class B and no experience needed, but then they say that I needed to have a Class A for jobs I didn't apply for. They don't value internal employees."
bad,"waste mgt/nts is a good job, but its temporary , once duke power has "
bad,Upper management out of touch with the workforce. Corporate goals not in line with the reality of the day to day operation. Very little accountability.
bad,"The team I worked with made the job fun and tolerable."
bad,"Pay is great, benefits are outstanding, but those are the only positives,  Stressful work environment, lack of leadership.  Lack of vision throughout company,"
bad,"Company cares about one thing, and its not its employees or customers. Poor Customer care. Poor incentive programs. "
bad,"Family was not a concern fro this company. They would routinely have you drive over the Federal DOT limit, with no regards to safety or quality of work done."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the pay. The worst part of the job is poor equipment, drivers are always blamed for everything even if you have no control over a situation."
bad,You are on the clock for everything. You take an item from inventory for the job and go to the computer and the clock starts ticking. That is not conducive for getting great work.
bad,"Everyday, make apts(as with other jobs), sell both business and residential customers our services of trash removal. Visit sites for surveys, make appointments, create a sales agreement, close the business and set our product.  I was successful for 2 years, however after defending national price increases and holding customers to contracts, waste management started slacking on their end with service and locked in pricing.  it made for a difficult sales environment and eventually business dwindled.  Management was set with doing things ""the old way"", very little desire to change with the times and adjust to the environment.  I really enjoyed working with the business owners, they have always been my favorite and I really liked working side by side as we looked at business plans."
bad,"a lot of pressure daily to make thing happen with out fail, hardest part is having to multi task between calls, group huddles, emails, all necessary paper work."
bad,"Management doesn't care about employees , its all about who you know. dispatchers and management doesn't care for anything the employees have to say. Equipment is run down the only way to get something fixed is to red tag it."
bad,"Management is absolutely horrible. Starting with the GM down to the Shop Manager, but go figure they're practically best friends out side of the workplace. Route managers are literally hired from your local fast food restaurants and expected to run a trucking company with a burger flipping mentality. Shop manager refuses to send service trucks out to fix road calls, would rather have trucks towed to an off site company for them to fix instead. All the route managers leave the shop after everyone leaves in the morning and refuse to answer phones or help the drivers with any issues. They don't care if you've worked there 20 years or 2 years. Time served is not worth anything to them, but again the actual workers who are out actually doing the routes and jobs are great people to work with"
bad,"early start times, found it awfully difficult working in bad weather, Was hoping for career  path to management. Enjoyed working with my co- workers and supervisor"
bad,"steady work year round busy days spent walking or slow day depending on the site you work at. management has their favorites and kind of ignores all the rest of the employees. co-workers are all slower than i so it gets frustrating having to do the bulk of the work. hardest part of the job is getting used to the pace at the busier site. and the most enjoyable part of my day is all the free coffee, snack, and sodas"
bad,THE WORK IS TOUGH AND THE DAYS ARE HOT. Management is always looking for something to down grade you on. If something goes wrong it is automatically the drivers faul . Equipment is out dated and never fixed right. Pay is too low for one of the most dangerous jobs in america.
bad,Breakdown between management and employees working way too many hours company cannot keep good Management in shop everyone in shop threatening to quit working 16 hours a day 6 days a week breakdown in chain of command
bad,Meeting the multiple metric measures and provide good customer service is rarely possible.  Working with a huge database and dealing with customers from all over the nation.
bad,"A typical day is on an  assembly line  separating trash. I learned that it is a hazard place to work. The supervisor and management are very nice people. The co-workers are good and help out each other. The hardest is being careful and safe because you may see needles, rats, sharp edges, ect.... on things even thought you are protected with eye wear/ sleeves for your arms."
bad,"I loved the walk in customers and talking with people over the phone..very rewarding!"
bad,"Management needs some work, some employees not treated ""fairly"""
bad,"I started working for the company in 2013 and everything was going good until this Spring 2015. They weren't getting their trucks fixed the correct way and we felt very unsafe in them. We were getting too many stops and not getting done until 6:30pm and then having to be back by 4:00am. The management was very unsupportive towards how many hrs we were working. They also didn't seem to care that the trucks were old with no A/C, too many miles, and not safe to drive. My coworkers were great to work with and we all supported each other. The health insurance was great."
bad,WM is a very well put company to work for. The company itself compensate its employees well. The people within the company (management) are not concern with you if you are not his or her friend. Cross the wrong person and you will loose your job.
bad,"This company has the size and political presence to really change the waste cycle, and how we can help to preserve our planet through green initiatives etc.  True giants of commerce and industry (Apple, google, etc.) understand that old-school sales tactics are a short-term solution, but by providing high-quality products/services that actually help make life on this earth better the revenue will come in ten-fold.  Unfortunately, waste management has a dilemma in their sales/marketing team (by the way the entire marketing dept. was cut by 75% in 2014) in that cold-calling and high pressure sales are a priority over being a sustainable environmental leader.  Example: a direct manager of mine was a former insurance salesman, and literally had no interest in sustainability, green initiatives etc.  With a 30% mark-up and people in command that do not care about the environment, I can not in good conscience give this company a positive review.  Sad."
bad,"Never knew what time would get done. Trucks consistently broke down and repairs were never completed fully. In cab camera with audio, visual, and gps couldn't even have a snack while vehicle was moving."
bad,employees were so busy keeping up that they did not have lots of time to train you.
bad,"the team was great, management frowned on employees having fun at work, or planning things together outside of work."
bad,Pretty much a non stop work environment which demands attention to your assigned day to day processing and to include the processing of minute to minute assignments.  Not enough hours in a 8 hour day to complete the task correctly.
bad,Relocated for the job and got layed off 5 weeks later via voice mail.
bad,How to manage my day in the sales world; How to handle objections in the sales world; I learned the entire sales process and how to be successful at it.
bad,"nice place to work,however to many rules management don't try to help as they should."
bad,Great benefits. Work environment and mangement needed to be trained in soft skills.
bad,Not a bad job for starting out. The company does not like to employees to work there too many years. The managers will rip you apart on everything and you will have to sometimes work on the weekend.
bad,"I was hired in November 2011 as a Logistics Coordinator. My first 3 weeks on the job consisted solely of data entry. There was little training due to the year end activitiess that the more experienced reps needed to focus on. My immediate manager took great joy in not only publicly ridiculing my lack of expertise, but continually JOKING that my position was in peril....this after 3 weeks and very little support. I was relieved that Waste Management eliminated my position while home with Pneumonia."
bad,No hours flexibility. Not family-friendly friendly. Great benefits. Not fairly paid for work required. Not inclusion friendly. Difficult work environment if you don't know anyone working there.
bad,"This was a place if you worked hard you get recognized, or even move up. At the same time they promoted plenty of people that knew nothing about the business and would be just yes men to keep their jobs. That was one of the worst part of the business. Watching your bosses get promoted for having zero knowledge of the business. The HR dept was also a mini firing squad. They looked for things to terminate long term employees. Very sad to see great employees get let go.  Main reason I left was I could no longer tolerate this type of workplace."
bad,"Current management has lack of managerial experience. Highly stressed, fake, toxic, confrontational, lack of humility, bad communication skills and no actual care for the employees. Demand respect but does not give it culture. Mentality of ""You do as I say because I'm your boss and I'm better then you and I know more."" Acts as if they listen to what you have to say but doesn't take what you say into consideration. Conveys pre-determined assumptions before taking in facts. Many things were said but the integrity is lost because what they say doesn't come to fruition, and if you ask them to do anything they forget because they are juggling other things and didn't write it down. Favoritism, one employee could get away with something or say something that another employee would not be able to get away with. Stay away from the WM branch that services the GM plant in Spring Hill."
bad,"I enjoy the benefits and compensation at Waste Management but the work life balance is lacking with the expectations of duties. With all the changes occurring at the corporate level, senior management is going overboard with trying to prove their worth and putting pressure on people that have always done their job."
bad,Working making sure everything clean and right and tight and right I never seen we had to write a story to get a job  this doesn't make any sense at all
bad,"Red seal mechanic typical day includes scrambling around try to fix a dying fleet, where management questions your judgement even if you are licenced or qualified. Even when you are right with diagnostics of a problem, you won't get acknowledged and even get blamed for down time of vehicles. Money is great, got multiple signing bonuses but they will work you till you die! Mentally draining job too. Do it for a short term and you'll be alright, anything over a year and it will feel like you've wasted your life with waste management."
bad,"I only worked there for 125 days, during those multiple breakdowns of trucks occurred on daily routes."
bad,"Recently worked there as a heavy equipment operator. It wasn’t a terrible place to work, but it wasn’t the best. Management would constantly bad mouth other employees right in front of you. It’s kinda like high school there. Communication is pretty bad. You did get two 30 minute breaks though."
bad,"hot and fast paced it does smell yes its a garbage factory. the hours were very good as well as the people. if you don't mind getting extremely dirty and smelling like garbage, then this is the job for you!"
bad,the day started with a long meaningless meeting.to many problems with the obu.trucks were always breaking down.there were many broken containers on routes that took forever to get fixed.
bad,"WM's Energy Services branch in Elizabeth PA used to be a great place to work. 70-80 hours a week and home just about every night."
bad,Not a hard job and it could be fun. But there are a lot of rules and there is an atmosphere of one must be perfect. 100% focused 100% of the time.
bad,"Excellent coworkers but poor management. We experienced a great loss of customers due to lack of communication and business skills among senior management. Good security within the company, but no chance of advancement. The company runs a rundown fleet of trucks and equipment with no upgrades foreseeable."
bad,"typical day at waste management i wouk in 15 mins early. Relax put my safety gear on hard hat,earplugs, steel toe boots,  etc. would walk up to my my forklift check fuel and the liquids check for any damage record what i find on my papaer work."
bad,Their policies are very strict and the environment is that of a corporation....  not for everyone.  You get written up for being one minute late or for punching in a bit late from lunch.  The benefits are great if you are able to keep your job.
bad,Good company to work for. Just not the right fit for me. Great people to work with and good environment.
bad,Over all they are not a bad company to work for but we are made to work in dangerous conditions to which we should not be. My county in which I work does not seem to care about their drivers and their safety out on the roads.
bad,A good starter for first time on the job. A good environment for Young employees.
bad,"liked working there,  people were great, jobs interesting."
bad,Management is was ruins this company. There is a lot of deceit and backdoor dealing involved in local management. The office guidelines and polices are inconsistent. Their lack of compassion and understanding reflects badly on the company itself.
bad,"High turnover during my tenure"
bad,"Over all the job is not bad but it can become very monotonous, and lonely. You're duties are pretty much to get drivers information, give their ticket, memories a few things, send emails and thats it."
bad,"The job itself wasnt too hard. Management was ok. It was just a really dirty and smelly job. I would not discourage anyone from working here because, like I said it wasnt the job itself that was bad. It was just personal preference not to be working in this type of place."
bad,"Working in the Pacific Northwest was s great experience,  transferring to Oklahoma was a culture shock in management. If you don't mind working 5 days a week, 52 weeks a year."
bad,"Expectations are to drive a garbage truck at mind bending speeds to achieve company goals. They profess safety, but not at the expense of productivity."
bad,Hard part of teh job was a typicla day what u learned manawnegnement  workpleace culture the hard oart of the job the em=most enjy part of the job was oing
bad,Work here managers are terrible you work long hours barely any holidays off and are watched by a camera 24/7 managers are inexperienced people who dont know jack.
bad,"There's always work for ""temps"" (My job title). Overtime hours are easily accumalated. You have weekends off but have the choice to work Saturdays. Waste Management have a training program for driving their trucks."
bad,very fast paced stressfull job no real job security the management seem very out of touch with employee needs all about getting job with very little thank you
bad,"worked with great people, job itself was rather mundane, with very little room for growth or promotion. Pay was not the best and job could be very dirty at times"
bad,"Good wages, but very stressful.  My health was jeopardized by the fumes near my office.  They made the hot sauce for Taco Bell and used Capazin, which made my lungs have a reaction."
bad,Always something to do but the overturn is incredible. They are always short handed and you never have time for your family. They do care about their employees but have a hard time keeping them due to drastic schedule changes and lots of work.
bad,The Union environment was negative with way too many office politics.  On the flip side I enjoyed the variety in my work and the convenient location.
bad,Could never take your personal time off.  There was always an argument to receive the time that was earned. there were to many managers and not enough employees
bad,"I have learned a lot working at Waste Management. I have learned how to work with two different computer systems, how to work with angry and irate customers. I enjoyed satisfying my customers day in and day out. The Management team to me did things a little different than what I am used to (not very organized), however they are very easy to get along with. My Co-workers makes the job fun and exciting by making us all feel comfortable, having potlucks and other activities. The hardest part of the Job was explaining customers invoice's to them, sometimes the billing was done incorrectly which made it very hard for the customers service representatives to explain a customers invoice to them. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to take an irate customer from being very upset at the beginning of the call to them having a huge smile in their voice once you have addressed their issues ans concerns."
bad,"Drilling for oil is a very labor intensive job. working long long hours in all weather conditions. Hardest part of the day is weather conditions, and the time frames to get quotas filled. the most enjoyable part of my day is a feeling of accomplishment."
bad,"The work days were long but it was okay because you got overtime, I learned how to work very face paced and the difference between different recyclable. The management showed a lot of favortism my co_wokers were friendly though. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the heat in the summer the temperature was at least 20 degrees more than what it was outside."
bad,Underpaying job is filthy and disgusting.  Dust everywhere even in the air you breathe. When I blow my nose after work black mucus comes out.
bad,"Its your average work place. Provides benefits, pay is decent."
bad,I loved my job..The Management didnt know what they eas doing...Other then that...I loved my job...
bad,A typical day at work is to drive to customer and remove trash. Take trash to landfill. The management cannot be trusted. They will use this information to control you. Coworkers are easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job is lifting trash all day long. The most enjoyable part of the job is you are kept busy all day long and the day goes by quickly.
bad,"Management not in place. Quick turn around, unsafe and dirty"
bad,"Operating work rotating shifts."
bad,"Standing for eight to ten hours doing repedative work.  Masks optional, easy work no experience needed."
bad,"WM is a good job for Call center positions if you plan on being a Customer service rep forever. There is room for advancement if you are friends with the right (white) people. No raises in over 3 yrs, Bonus check's get smaller and smaller while company profits 10's of millions of dollars. Horrible communication and outdated computer systems. But if you don't mind that then its the place for you to work"
bad,Worked with a team of great ux designers. The rest of IT sucks and they don't do high quality projects. Management often made decision to push things out when they were broke.
bad,"Every day a router is required to create routes for each truck driver to follow to pick up industrial sized trash cans. Along with creating tomorrow's work, routers are also watching the current days work. Same day calls in occur from 3am-2pm. Daily calls with route managers and district mangers occur to discuss opportunities and status updates. The worst part about this job was the confidence I had in my supervisor. I was let go due to a complain filed against me. I was never given a warning or asked my side of what happened. From what I have heard, the accusation against me is false. I am taking this as a learning experience and moving forward."
bad,"Start Working At Waste Management During High School , Worked There For Very Short Period of Time . ready To Get Better Job , Work Hard And Maintain Myself"
bad,"Dispatcher would give us tickets to pick up roll offs and dumpster.  Constantly remind you that these must be oicked up today, but sometimes cars are blocking entrance, or having to clean up from the trash left on the ground."
bad,"Good typical day of work"
bad,"MY experience with waste management was very frusting from the get go. The working face was always hectic, my co workers were always yelling either at me or one another, the equipment was always down, and we worked crazy hours. Aside from having an accident(which I willingly admit), I am glad to have left the Okeechobee landfill"
bad,"This job is indeed insane it's always at a fast pace"
bad,I used to love this company. After replacing upper management my whole life changed. I would not suggest working for WMI. Its sad when your area manager gets fired and one year later 6 out of 18 fleet managers like myself are once again looking for a job.We seen it coming.
bad,Management is sloppy. Could not use vacation time as you like. Very fast paced enviornment with no room for error. Typical day is taking around 100 plus customer calls per rep per day. Co-workers were good people with little drama. Hardest part of the job was too much change and inconsistancy. Most enjoyable part of job was helping customers and filling their needs.
bad,"typical work day consisted of help customers if they had questions or special needs that they were able to do things on there own, Management wasn't that good, if you were having an issue at a site or had a question they werent very helpful"
bad,"So, the pay was decent, even though the raises are a complete joke.    And the benefits are great and VERY cheap for the employee, but they have cameras in EVERY VEHICLE called Drive Cam.  Every time there is a sharp turn, or a huge bump in the road, or a hard brake, and it records you.  And then you get called into the office and are ""coached"" on driving better.  I couldn't stand that.  I'm an adult, and would like to be treated as such.  But the overtime is fantastic if you like working.  I enjoyed that the most.  However, you are just a number at such a large company and they treat you that way.  It's a shame, but that's the way it is.  Another huge setback with this company is that the equipment (trucks) which are Macks, are very old, and didn't ride well at all.  And they were always breaking, so you had to deal the the mechanics.  And the majority were not happy.  They were completely miserable.  So you had to deal with them directly when something went wrong.  I was there for nearly 3 years.  I wouldn't go back.  Management are kiss ups, and loved to look over your shoulder.  It's a terrible environment if you don't like being babysat.  It's such a shame."
bad,"They have a salary cap. You pay a lot for not that great insurance. I dont have much more to say, but I cant move on with writing something in here needed more word."
bad,well since I havr worked there it has help me become more aware of opptunititys  I have yet to reach..and I just want more for myself at this point. bc I feel its more out there for me.....
good,Thought it was a great company but it wasn’t  if the didn’t like you they put you on a route that was difficult and they never listen to your side of the story if something happens
good,"This is one of the largest waste companies in the United States, but when they hire 20 people and then use them for 60 plus hours a week, and then lay them off in just a year.....you figure it out."
good,Long tedious hours. Holiday pay a joke because you get no holiday you make up for it the following weekend. If you miss a day no holiday pay. New employees make more than seasoned employees
good,On top of that pay being terrible the drivers didnt wanna give us breaks when we wanted them even thiugh we did all the work and its the rules so i couldnt do that.
good,Okay so I work for Chemical Waste Management in the gulf coast region I drive tractor trailers and have a lot of responsibility as far as different jobs go we are HIGHLY underpaid as far as what we do and experience some drivers have! This place is full of know it all managers as the old saying goes too many chiefs and not enough Indians. Waste management is a multi billion dollar company to only pay tractor trailer drivers 20.00 starting off its really a joke we haul different chemicals everyday They lead us on about us getting raises they tax our bonuses and referral bonuses.
good,"Very unclean work area, co workers where very helpful."
good,No raises for 3 yrars then when they did give a raise it was a laughable 25 cents an hour but cut benefits. they hired a college kid to be route manager who doesn't know a thing about whats it like to pick up trash for a living
good,Contracts and Commercial conatiner sales.  Serviced customers and complied monthly reports.
good,"For the most part, I enjoyed my peers and my work atmosphere, but the workplace itself was filthy. I can say that was the hardest part of the job, the filth. Other than that, it wasn't too rewarding. The compensation was nothing but $8.00hr, And the management treated you as if you were making $12.00hr. No room for advancement within the company. Overall, the job is a job. I learned I could lead a team no matter their past, or differences. People just listen to what I have to say, in a good way."
good,my results are personal and very much independent to the site that worked at. I would absolutely love to work for them again at a different location with different management that I would be working under. This site that I worked under was very biased towards employees due to Management's personal relations and affected advancement and opportunities for all other  employees greatly
good,"I am currently management at a big site. The acquisition of this site is going very poorly and anyone with a non performing area will be terminated. You only survive this for short periods of time, because eventually you will find yourself without the manpower or equipment to do the job needed. Most of us put in 12 or more hours per day. We also take turns working the weekends. "
good,"es un trabajo duro, de constante resistencia, regularmente la temperatura del lugar es caliente, logras diferenciar entre los diferentes tipos de reciclaje, generalmente las personas que trabajan ahi no tienen mucho respeto hacia los demas companeros, trabajas bastantes horas"
good,"Met some great friends there. Weekends off. Management is a joke. Pay was not enough for what you have to deal with. Customers, management and drivers are all a**holes. F**k that place."
good,"i have learned a great amount in this company. Employees are great and help out when you need it. Route Managers can use an improvement, they lack communication which can be very difficult at times in certain situations. other than that they are all very good Managers."
good,it is not your typical trash company. They tend to worry about other stuff then what they should. they have a plan and will stick to it even if it won't work or doesn't.
good,"watch over line workers, make sure machines doesn't jam to continue system uptime, clean machines before work and after"
good,Being efficient.  Being safe on and off the job. Dealing with harsh weather changes. Most of the customers that I've encountered respect and appreciate my work ethic and acknowledge me as a Human Being.
good,I worked there 2 years and was always promised advancements and training but management never followed through. I would not recommend the company.
good,"you must work holidays and are not given a choice. must work overtime and if you need even 1 hour off you have to use your vacation or sick time in order to get it off. they do NOT keep their heavy equipment maintaned i.e broken seats, ac, acess ladders, ect."
good,The pay is ok but it is not worth the lack of respect employees receive.
good,This company is like anywhere else it has it's up's and down's!! They go through site managers every five years!!! They say they are commited to being a family based business is not true!!
good,"It's an okay place to work, but if they want you gone they will find a way to get rid of you fast, just like me they said I took my seatbelt off and I never did it never came off my body. I'm"
good,"One day you are OK, the next day you are looking for another job. No new technologies, and when you try to bring new technologies or processes, they complain because they don’t want to move from their comfort zone. No advancement of your career."
good,"Good company,fast paced,senior drivers control management, they determine who goes home early, and who has to finish routes,works holidays when employees take vacation, felt bad for management, their hands are tide for fear of retaliation from drivers,"
good,"There are a lot of unrealistic expectations.  Great opportunity if things were a little different."
good,The manager doesn't care about anyone. The helpers on the trucks are slow and cause you to miss out of good hours. The management lies about pay and don't follow through.
good,"I was an oilfield roustabout at the Elizabeth PA yard. When work was abundant, it was hard work for a decent paycheck but when things slowed down, management refused to adapt to the changing circumstances and eventually laid off all the non-cdl employees without notice or making any attempt to cross-train them into CDL positions. Do not believe their promise that they'll help with getting a CDL at all."
good,"When I worked for Waste Management I was overworked and underpaid in my role as a CSR. Yes you get paid weekly, but once you pay your bills, and that's it. They treat the reps like children instead of adults and the favoritism called in most definitely played by management, in regard to VTO. Prior to working for WM I always thought this company is a great company to work for....WRONG, they pay CSR's like $13-15$ hr and for all of the abuse you have to take on those calls, it's just not worth it!!! The driver's, ICR ( Inside Sales Reps), Retention, and Dispatch makes way more, so go for those jobs, CSR, I would recommend to continue your job searches."
good,Need to hire two route managers I worked there for a whole year and they never would hire an additional route manager. 6 days a week  12 to 14 hours a day. hard if you have a family
good,If you are in search of a starting place than this is a great company to work for.  Depending on the position there is not much advancement.  You must be proactive and ask for feedback once you have advanced.  If you are a driver and that is your path this is a great company.
good,I hated working there. They would mandatory 6 days almost every week last minute and then threaten to fire you if you didn't show. The job was very fast paced.
good,Is ok but itnot for everyone because job could be a headache it get stressful sometimevut other than that I can say the job will be alright would tell some one else
good,I worked WasteManagment twice each time i worked sun up to sun down. Any weather. You must work at least 5 days a week. 9.00$ minimum wage. Growth within the company is slow. No driving training.
good,Acused of wrong doing and didn't even work there when it happened was also acused of wrong doing after I left could have been a good job but management had no clue as to how to run a landfill working 70 plus hours a week sucked
good,"Let me say selfish company! The workers that are out on the front is not appreciated. Management is very poor. Mainly everything with this company that go wrong gets put off on the workers. I wish the company would treat you like family other than just another employee that management have to deal with. Employees have no rights hear. Also I see poor customer service. Customers with waste management should get the most high service they deserves. People hear are not trained that way. I beleive in giving even my meanest customers good service because that's should be part of the reason they come hear. Managers don't take advice, they know everything even though they was previously a regular worker like you. All in all I wish my voice would be heard and some of these serious issues be address or could cost our competitor's to take some of our buisness and lose a lot."
good,"Great place to work. I wish the corporate will push earning to the employees and advancement. I've been there a long time and got a lot of experience. It feels like they don't want people to advance."
good,Get to work clock in go through safety procedures put on safety equipment gloves hat wrist wear & safety glasses etc..
good,"Started work early. Picked up trash on your route, drove back to the yard, dumped your truck, parked truck, finished for day. Most of the workers were pleasant people.  I feel the management used people from the temp service and as soon as your probation period was close to being done they lay you off to avoid having to pay insurance and higher wages."
good,"-  A typical workday at WM is very stressful in the call center. You have calls back to back, then not only will you be on the phone with customers upset hollering b/c a drvier missed them also the leadership team is hollering ' calls in queue' like we dont already know that. instead of them jumping in to help us they just keep hollering calls in queue, very annoying. The regular work day also insisted of being put into other calling queus when it is not your market area. I take care of TX and OK but often i would be put in to take care of customers in FL, GA , MS, LA, CA, etc list goes on and on. We were never trained on these other market area it was STRESSFUL. "
good,"Same Routine day in and day out, No advancement opportunitys."
good,"Place is decent place to work, due to the co-workers. If I found better I would put in my two weeks notice. The hardest part of the job is dealing the people whom is not sure what the want you to do, and the communication between people is terrible."
good,WM is a company that offers a lot of benefits; however it is hard to achieve the goals within the company. WM gives a diverse opportunity to see how many aspects of the company works and what options are out there.
good,Job is very repetitive. It is 100% a phone job. They do explain that to you during the interview process too. This being my first ever sales position. The hardest part of the job was the consistent cold calling every single day. We had a 50 call minimum.
good,"waste management is not the ideal job but someone has to do it, dealing with items everyday that are biological waste can be difficult, but knowing that you are not wasting the wrong items is good."
good,"Management is very distant and only ommunicates when needed.  No morale involved.  Can never do enough for management to be satisified.  No room for promotion if you are not in the right ""click"""
good,No room for growth and they change company management to much for U to get your pto and any raises or any accuired points U get for attendance. Any time they change management then all of that starts over. And the raises r poor very poor because everytime when management starts over they see it as your time starts over so how can U get a raise when U never reach your 6 months. It's frustrating.
good,The work it self isn’t bad has its ups and downs it’s the lack of communication with management and poor quality of the equipment that they have great people work on the trucks and in the shop
good,Always work they need to take care of employees never want to take opinion of the employees always doing double work because of the poor decisions that management makes
good,Jump on and off a trash truck dumping cans and other trash around into the truck finishing up the route is required In a timely manner must not throw cans when done place them back down correctly
good,"Waste management in Ohio is a terrible job. Overworked, no help. Trucks are total garbage. The good mechanics get ran off by terrible management. Way too much work for the pay."
good,"They claim you can get a transfer, i been trying for a year now , they say they fill the job position and then its posted again in a day or so, so you have to go back online reapply, then do phone survey  through automative system that is so impersonal, then its a waiting game, i got told i had a job and they wanted to fill position in 2 weeks to a month i did my phone interview, and then all the sudden 2 weeks go by i hear nothing a month goes by i hear nothing,in meantime i am calling the manger that told me i had the job , he first return my call saying he was sick, and he still was talking about hiring me, then i get a email saying they filled the position, what the heck after i was told i had the job, they are ridiculous when it comes to transfers, I really think they want people to quite and reapply so they can hire you back at the location you want to transfer to at a lesser pay grade"
good,Lots of hard work long hours 14-hour days Real Talk management a big turnover of employees doesn't care much about your family life the pay is good but you don't have a life outside of that
good,great place to make great money mangers and tiers and back stabbers. they lie and try to get you fired if you are not a liars and back stabbers union is garbage and in the company pocket
good,I started out as a helper but was suppose to be hired as a truck driver my day began being picked up at a location helped remove trash from residences.
good,If you are male. or young and  physically ready this job is not for you..It's hard work and mush for a break.This was my time things may change over the period time since I leaves the company.
good,"Mangment are young immature cause favoritisms throughout the departments. Either your in the crowd or your on your own kissing azz ever day. Old system, poor phone system. System needs to be update or re written so they can condense screens could make the job a lot easier and not so stressful. Having  a real system and not having so many duplication of screens and ones we can do with out and having to go back and forth and it would speed up the system with not having  so many things running! But for now , Doing to much for no money . Single person could not afford to live off this income there benefits terrible."
good,"Management was not dependable, not providing you with updated changes, the schedule was good Mon-Fri at the time driver was too far.  The guys were very kind especially around holidays."
good,"For a part-time job to help get in shape this would be the place to do so. Riding on the back of a truck and picking up garbage on a nice day is actually quite relaxing. Although if you can't easily pick up 50-75 lbs this may not be the job for you. Very hard labor, need to be able to pace yourself."
good,"They say they are family oriented and family comes first, but thats far from it. You have people that dont know how to do their jobs. management that relays on others to do their own job. Its an unhealthy work place"
good,"Manager is very poor in the communication department. Played favorites constantly, especially when it came time for yearly raises. Would constantly lie and change his story"
good,"The pay and benefits are really good. You can't really beat the insurance."
good,"No home life, no way to push back on the company when they mistreat you. So many rules that make absolutely no sense at all, and they will fire you if you speak out against them and their rules."
good,Waste management lost some contracts and I got laid off their where no benefits as well. I was only making $8 a hour and it was a very dust filled environment which is bad for your health.
good,I enjoyed working with the driver's supervisor didn't care about an injury I obtained work related. I would like to work there again in the future. Driver's were nice
good,This was a fun place to work. Everyone worked hard and worked together. I would have stayed but left for a higher paying job. It is a great place to work.
good,"arrive at work look at the schedule it changes look for what route I am going to be driving and what truck I am going to be using"
good,This was an ok place to work for. More flexibility is needed. More room for growth would be great. The pay and benefits were decent.
good,"Good people but out of date data systems from 1980.  "
good,"Management wasn't all that well, people I worked with were always good to be around with, and overall I liked what I did. The company itself is a good company but again there are some people that aren't cut out to be in this type of job atmosphere"
good,"pay was excellent; benefits was good; 401k match; working without supervision was a big plus; truck breakdowns was a constant thorn; supervisors perceptively was not able to supervise according to their experiences, drivers and the personalities involved, it was a broad brush of procedures that at times caused friction. very long hours was the caused of marital problems and fatigue behind the wheel"
good,"the work is difficult and rough on the body, however, the rate of pay is good and the benefits are good if your body is able to withstand the strenuous duties."
good,great job but with changes in sales and management the work enviorment has changed and no longer is a great place to work.
good,For starters you clock in around 6:30 am and from the yard(meeting place) you hope to get a driver and pursue with your route for that day if not you woke up and came for nothing but other than that you are on the road all day by noon you might have lunch are halfway done with your assignments by 4:30 pm you might be done bt throughout the whole day you are working in heat and a lot of conditions most people quit under if you don't have mind over matter you will quit but not me but also you must have a assigned driver every day to be successful n love this job I mean it was good because it was one of my first jobs and also they gave me an opportunity to do so I gave them my all until lack of hours and change of companies from waste management to StarTex so nothing bad just wished things could've went different and then I love the traveling part seeing things I don't see everyday so yeah good experience
good,"Great job, low pay! Management was ok. Friendly environment."
good,"Disjointed, no formal training. Awesome co-workers. Process and procedures are subject to interpretation. Very little support and zero recognition."
good,Too many long days plus some saturdays.The up keep on the trucks are very poor.
good,"Manage an inbound queue of escalated customer calls,"
good,Leaving company because they preach promo with in and don't follow it also they try to sneak changes pass their employees then try to lie about I have trust issue with that.
good,"The position was enty-level for those who are new to the work force or lack skills.  The range of growth wasn't available.  Overall, I enjoyed my job immensely."
good,"A typical day at work consists of constantly rushing and worrying what bad situation is next.  Any time a concern is brought up, we are told well you just have to deal with it.  If you like functioning trucks, work somewhere else."
good,I was up to skunks every night and could not get enough work done there were always behind. Worked everyday I could and was always on time. It did not fit into my life at all.
good,"Felt that the push for development was talked about a lot, and yet it only happened when something bad occurred. The ability to grow did also seem to depend on likes/favoritism rather than skillets. Many times, managers or leaders were just really good employees who worked up the ranks, rather than being prepared to manage others."
good,"I worked very hard in this position without support.  At one point after a crisis I worked for 22 straight days.  I worked in the rain and mud, along with heat, cold and wind, never mind the stink and the risk exposure.  Everything I learned about the job I learned on my own.  The CEO tells us that employees are the most important asset which is nonsense.  There's a ""gotcha"" culture in place from HR and Area management.  I'm amazed I lasted a year."
good,"Its an amazing job but the management doesn't care about you, and even if you dont have the parts to fix the trucks they wont take no for an answer and theyll run them anyway. Its not all sites and its not every day. But you have to stand your ground or get stomped."
good,"Looks like a great company from the outside looking in however it’s not what it seems. Culture isn’t what they portray, it’s a complete profit based company that truly doesn’t care about the customer experience or employees. They only care about $$$. Management is really poor as well. They are great at pointing the blame and pushing responsibilities off on employees below them. Benefits are ok, pay is way below the market base per your job title. Bonuses aren’t good either. Annual pay increase 1%-3%.... Not a very good PTO policy. For such a massive profitable company, you would think things would be better for their employees. Super high turnover for employees and customers."
good,They favor drivers as a tech you work long hours up to 70 a week pay is good shop is hot hot hot working every other Saturday little room for advancement paid training but work all holidays exept for Christmas new years and thanksgiving
good,"Typical day , ok ?, what I learned  is basically things I already knew, management , well enough said.? culture you have to be in the club, hardest part of job is getin there, the most enjoyable part is going home."
good,"There was a lot of pressure in this role, very high and unrealistic targets for the team starting out. Great manager, but he was given tough goals with very little support."
good,"work based on unit availability and required repairs found on periodic pm inspections. Overtime available, including callout responsibilities. Work done goes by what is needed, then unused units and parts available."
good,"the company is great , however, if you upset the management team they will put a target on you and do what they can to make life difficult regardless of performance"
good,I did learn about trash and recycling while working here. I always thought I was doing my part until I actually became an employee of Waste management. As far the procedures for advancement within this company. They do not offer inside good opportunity's. It was also hard to know your job when they are constantly changing management and policies but not updating the floor or CSR on how the procedures are supposed to work or properly training them.
good,"hard work "
good,"It was great in the beginning, then management stopped caring. There was no open communication with the office people, leading to giving out mis-information to customers."
good,"difficult to  learn new routes every 2 weeks. other drivers knowledge of who ""tips""and they race to collect tips even if its not their route. cheating route drives out of the tips."
good,"Horrible communication skills between management and employees.  Therefore, you never knew what was going on and he found out the hard way. That's not a way to run a business and most of the employees were in different states and had horrible communication skills."
good,Drove garbage truck and also was a helper on the back of the truck.Worked really long hours and in all kinds of weather. Met lots of nice people and work friends.
good,A typical day was 8 hrs spent on the phone calling customers who were late with their payments and making arrangements for payments or collecting payments through the phone.
good,work was very demanding no career advancement long hours uder appreciated employees hard to continue education because of the long hours of work and traveling distance to and from can be trying to say the least.
good,Fast paced company with great benefits. Great hours of operation for someone who wants to stay at home versus OTR Truck Driving. Great employees to work with that are more then willing to show new drivers the ins and outs.
good,Typical day of driving and handling waste containers.  A lot of little things to be aware of as pursuant of management. This is a good company to work for. Excellent benefits and rewards. Good rapport with other drivers.
good,It is good job but hard work and lots of hours. Pay is not great and no vacation or holidays off. Work between 10 and 12 hours a day. Not bad job and lots of good people to work with
good,wake up early have long hours a lot of standing physical work people you work with are friendly management is good there pay is good hardest part of the job is the physical labor
good,It takes a while to get used to the smell of garbage everywhere. You also get it on your clothes and shoes. Other than that the work is easy to complete.
good,Fast paced work where your told to get done as fast as you can but get yelled at for going too fast. Company is more worried about the cost of an employee getting hurt than the actual employee. Your a number and if there is an abundance of people willing to work for them you can be replaced at any time. Helpers where I work start out around $11 an hour and drivers at $16. For the work they want you to do in the time frames I don't believe its enough for a multi million dollar cooperation to pay its employees.
good,There used to be an office in Canal Winchester when I worked there W/M combined markets and got rid of the office personal. It use to be great place to work before all that.
good,"Its a corporate company so your just a number , doesnt matter how committed you are or if you work like a slave.Go in do your job go home, thats the only way youll last there #flyunderradar"
good,It's a great job but very hard to move up as drivers are union so everything is by seniority. Being the only long Haul drive my job gets stressful and very demanding.
good,always wants more wont let you advance the pay is good and benifits are excelent but the driver us just a number and they could care less about them never good enough
good,"You work 12 hours a day. You always get pushed to do more work, yet they always stress safety. You can't do as much work as they want you to do and be as safe as possible."
good,On a typical day this job was quiet easy. During my time there i did not learn much other than what the company uses to make money what was valuable and what was not. The manager i worked for was a really good guy but when it came to the supervisors we had one guy who would threaten the employees by literally getting so close you cold smell what he had for breakfast also the other employees would not help with your job and explain what exactly you were suppose to be doing instead they would report you and get the other employee fired i witnessed this a few times. The job was simple so i cannot say there was a hard part of the job.
good,All employees will be asked to do many reports.  A lot of them are not sales related and can really hurt the sales process.  This is an operational first company and is not driven by sales.
good,"I felt harassed most of the time, supervisor stalks you on your route, has no problem making your day harder, then wonders why it takes you longer. your on camera while you drive, no smoking, no eating, no drinking liquid (not alcohol) obviously. your lunch was up to you to take and i felt like my work load was so enormous and heavy that i was too stressed to stop take a break, or eat lunch, i developed a appetite sup resent disorder just from working there for 9 months."
good,"It totally depends on your position & if you're a ""favorite"" to determine your treatment. Some of the drivers and dispatch get treated like trash (irony) and it's usually the best dispatchers anddrivers treated that way. "
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is your fellow coworkers. You are expected to do the work of 3 people with minimum pay.  The benefit deductibles keep going up every year.The management bonuses depend on the amount that is spent on their employees, etc, so raises are very far and few between even if you go above and beyond in your job duties, rarely is it recognized."
good,A typical day at work involved spending hours on the road while managing endless conference calls and emails. The average work day was 12 to 14 hours 6 days a week. Vacation time was next to impossible to schedule. Process trumped objectives.
good,"Utilize Microsoft Office, Internet Explorer, OCS Routing Software, Manage Roll Off drivers throughout the day, manage emails and phone calls."
good,"To stand up to my commitment a typical day can go by like I have been there just for 4 or 5 hours, have to answer the phone queue and action customers requests as I am completing other e-mail requests at the same time from sales reps and other customers. Learned new systems. Management needs more improvement. The hardest part of the job is no appreciation or motivation on what you work hard and complete in timely manner. The most enjoyable part of my job is the satisfaction of the customer when they end up in my line. Standing up to my commitment I gave the employer by completing my tasks in timely manners."
good,"Time management is key to the ccr position. Continual non stop customer service."
good,"routine daily house to house pick ups of garbage and compost."
good,"Waste Management has offered the opportunity to enhance outside the box thinking.  This position demands constant attention to details and the movement of the operation.  "
good,good company to work for. need to know others to climb the latter
good,"Typical call center job, with a push for sales. Compensated for the products you sell. Management is shifty."
good,"Patience is always key"
good,"Not a flexable company, The pay structure is such a hidden topic no one wants to talk about, The leadership is non-helpful at all."
good,"Waste Management acquires a lot of smaller companies, so lay-offs are high."
good,"There were no typical days, each day offered a challenge, I was able to utlize my mechanical skills very often."
good,"There are very long days,i learned how to be a leader of 25 plus men.Management was very involve and did the best they can.I had some great and hard working co-workers.The hardest part of my job was been away from my family,and the most enjoyable part was my co-workers."
good,Garbage companies are not the place to work very nasty... Supervisors and lead drivers are very rude to employees so structure at all.
good,I learned a lot about Waste Management and how to handle calls.  Management showed a lot of favoritism to certain employees and not very understanding with me being a single parent.  Co-workers were great.  Made a lot of long time friends.  Hardest part of the job was given too many things at once for short amount of time to get done.  Enjoyable part of the job I did get to travel to other call center and assist other agents.
good,"I watched this place change faster than I could believe. When I came in to interview, I couldn't believe how happy and relaxed everyone looked. People were friendly, and there was a real ""team environment"". Training was decent and I felt fairly well prepared by the time my training class hit the floor. But after about a month or so things started to change in a quickly-escalating domino effect. One thing led to another, work got piled on for things we knew nothing about, and the pressure to meet diminishing daily ""metrics"" increased by the day. People started walking out left and right, all you heard in the break room was how much everyone hated their job. We got more and more swamped as more people left and they refused to hire anyone to lighten the workload. Instead they made mandatory overtime. I could never find my supervisor (or any supervisor for that matter) when I needed him, management was constantly making huge decisions behind everyone's back and masking them with ""fun activities"" and jeans days. The only good thing about the job was the benefits, opportunity for bonuses, and (usually) a set Monday thru Friday schedule 8:30-5. This was just in the call center, but based on the calls I received by the hundreds weekly, operations and billing didn't quite have their stuff together either."
good,Wake up at 330am drive 2 hours to site work 12 drive home 2 hours. Most of the people I work with are fun just makes long day.
good,"the job was good and i enjoyed the actual work"
good,Fun place to work you interact with different people. I learned the different types of material that can be recycled. Some Co-workers are great to work with others might not. And the hardest part of this job is to make sure that BOLs have all the information correct and that the weights are correct for each of the trucks that is being shipped. The fun part of the job is that you interact with many people and learn different things everyday.
good,"Pay is fair, often you are cheated if you work on incentive.  .  Often feel every day is your last.. Feel like to many people out to cheat the system and not work as a team."
good,"Decent salary, good quarterly bonus potential, very stressful, excessive hours, very high EBIT expectations"
good,Great Job great work schedule
good,"Waste Management is a great company to work for if you are a single person with a strong back. A typical day at work would be removing refuse from over 500 homes in a specific routed area. I learned the onboard computers, the correct way to dump the garbage trucks, and how to be professionally safe while perfoming my job. The co-workers are great people that do care about one another, but have a lot of gossip. The hardest part of the job would be the non-stop repetitive lifting in all various weather conditions, Which isn't that hard once you adapt to the job requirements. The most enjoyable part of the job was the joy of watching little kids get excited about the garbage truck."
good,"You come in to a lot of new updates a lot of new changes, even to the point where you hd to call the customer back ."
good,"Waste Management is a great place to work, if you can get hired on as a full-time employee; which is no easy task. I have been with the company for almost 2.5 years, and am still retained only as a contractor. This is the case of numerous people at Waste Management. Additionally, the company is in the middle of a massive organizational change and is losing large amounts of revenue each quarter. Budgets are being squeezed and slashed, a hiring freeze is in place, and people are being laid off, without any notice."
good,"At the corporate level They are working very hard to be the best, they just might get there . As to this location-long hours great pay & new training programs, current mangers routing can be a hazard to your home life. Anticipate 12 hour days, & cherry picking of routes. Great place to launch a career as transfers are always available."
good,No work and home life balance. Hours are long and they are not flexible. No public transportation. The pay is good though. I recommend this for young adults.
good,"Work is not bad, the worst part of the job is being on call all of the time. There is no time to relax and enjoy my family and my life. Hours are flexible which is a benefit."
good,"Only thing upper Management cares about is getting their bonus. They park vehicle for simple repairs because a different truck had an expensive repair. The shop managers never get a chance  to fix the equipment because of the budget their given. If you like driving worn out trucks and working for a company that doesn't care about you enough to fix your truck, then take the hiring bonus they offer. If they would pay people what there worth, they wouldn't need a hiring bonus."
good,"Poor management, poor HR. Changing management new mgr likes to micro manage and has no compassion for employees. Doesn't take work related issues/conflicts seriously."
good,Your hired for one job after your on you have to work back of garbage truck as a hired driver. 10 12 hours a day walking with only 30 minute break allowed per day
good,"You work very hard to make your salary. I am a Project Manager, Procurement, Asset Management and Vendor Relations and I make less than $40k a year on hourly wages. Benefits are great and affordable compared to many companies today"
good,If U get hired for waste management work directly for them. Do not work for any temp service or staffing agency it's no good. It's better incentive to work for waste management directly.
good,"I dont really have anything to say I’m still here it’s a pay check so whatever. I’m looking for better pay so I’ll be here until that happens, some departments get paid way more even though we do a lot of work. Hope they fix the pay issue or they will lose good people."
good,"Personal onsite managers were amazing but once corporate comes in everyone is shoved aside for the bottom line, corporate only cares about what kind of revenue they can get out of the site and makes the onsite managers do there dirty work  Regardless what it does to their report"
good,Its ok could be better the pay is very small not enough money for all you have to do wish they would go up on the pay the managers need more training they dont know the job
good,It’s a good company just the pay is not good for the amount of work that your doing and  The physical work that you have to do other waste management yards have smaller routes
good,Upon arrival I understood that hours were going to be long and I was fine with that. After 3+ years on 50+ hours a week it takes a toll on you especially with no end in site.  A typical work day started with a driver meeting and launch. Following in the launch you would prep for a meeting at 9am. Meeting was scheduled for an hour but it never lasted less than 1.5hrs.  The expectation was to be in the field 70% of the time.  After your daily task were complete there is no way to be in the field 70% of the time. The hardest part of the job was the lack of clear direction. The most enjoyable part is the group of people you work with and the relationships you build.
good,"I am not sure what I am doing wrong I have been trying to move up in this company for the last 2 years.  I get interviews but no job.  I love the set up for Waste Management.  The people enforcing it is the issue. I work hard, I am reliable, dependable & I go above and beyond I just can't get a head.  I had to quit my last job for the same reason."
good,"I was at this company for 9 days and was not given the change to prove myself because I did not meet the expectations of the manager that micro-managed everything and had me on 12 projects at one time, but was unable to complete one because I was given a new one every other hour."
good,Employees are all unhappy as they are over worked. Not enough employees to help with work load. Management does not assist with solving problem. Friendships control advancement not work quality.
good,Just don't know what to say about the Omaha branch but to fire someone for being sick is just wrong I put my life on the line everyday for the job for three years and was let go
good,Very disorganized facility they discriminate against people they show favoritism they lack integrity they have no compliance in place for there standards of operation on the floor all in all it is a very frustrating work environment
good,"Although a high pressure, challenging position, I enjoyed building a rapport with the drivers and customers I supported. With that being said, the raises were very subjective and not conducive with the rising costs of living."
good,The worst experience I ever had in my life and I got stabbed with a poker device for landfill trash by a employee in manatee county highered Express .
good,I thought that the management was very poorly ran a treated people like a number if you had any problems they just didn't care felt like all the overtime and helping on other routes management never really appreciated it like I said just felt like a number
good,"This job can be very fulfilling when managed correctly. Fast-paced, hard work. Long hours and busy weeks. Benefits are good, paid time off, and holidays off. No weekends unless a holiday falls during the week."
good,Poor Communication with the drivers never follow through on what they say. Always expect you to do thing outside of your control. hours and pay are poor.
good,"opportunity to make more with incentive pay. hard work, poor management. unfair expectations. micro management. Indecisive management - follow the rules today, and the next day don't follow the rules do what I say. Confusing on any given day what the expectations really were."
good,"Management does not care how their drivers get the job done, as long as it is done. Regardless of lack of safety issues.   It is a very stressful job, but safety guidelines are not always followed.  Employees are blamed for mishaps or accidents on the job."
good,"don't get me wrong wm is a pretty decent place to work. my biggest beef with this company is the trucks are the absolute worst. the management cares nothing about the drivers and its simply every man for himself. other than that its tolerable. the pay is decent and the benefits are out of this world, the best ive ever seen"
good,Is it good place to work but the management sucks and a preacher about safety first but safety will not get your job done and they will yell at you if you don't get it done
good,"Total do as I say not as I do culture. The place is a joke, they reward people who don't do their job well and punish the true labors with only more work"
good,"Demanding work, compensation needs to be better for the amount of work that is given. Doing extra work and helping other departments is frequent. Hard to get promoted or move from different departments."
good,Waste Management it was an stressful job when i first started it was to hot & we had to stand up all day smelling trash. This job had some good workers but never give us no days off or no benefits
good,The company gave everyone a $2000 tax break except route managers and there appears to be gender inequality in salaries. The job itself is stressful but rewarding. Overall pay is competitive. High turnover of managers.
good,The day starts off real smooth as usual we come in we exercise stretching overall the staff is very cool really don't have problems the thing is they don't want you sitting around playing around long as you coming to do your job I think you would be okay
good,"The company is a very rewarding company, the turn over rate is terrible.  Members of management have a life cycle of 1 to 3 years. With zero comfort level. Expectations are unfair to balance home life and work life.  Schedule isn't standard, it changes at will of higher manager.  The equipment is poor condition, when opinion of it is said, there is reprisal.  Cannot feel secure, there is not any loyalty or  zero benefit to trying your hardest.  It doesn't gain anything."
good,Very stressful work environment with great benefits.  Long days with plenty of OVERTIME when available. Plenty of job opportunities within the company as a lateral move.
good,Cannot give an unbiased opinion. this company has many ups and downs at times it feels like there are more downs than ups but to each their own when it comes to the WM experience.
good,"Company is very corporate and old school and would rather hire from the outside than build from within.  I have been here for 11 years and many times tried to advance into management but have always been denied for not having previous management experience."
good,This job was work harder and harder but low pay.They haven't hired anyone permanent in a few years. So you just work threw temp until they fire you.from being stressed over no advancement
good,"Worked close to 10 hours daily, work life balance is not the best. The management at Waste Management is very old school and refuse to evolve with the current society."
good,"If you have allergies this is a really bad place to be.  They take forever to hire from temp to perm.  The pay is only $10 (if you're perm and not temp) for a job that anywhere else pays a starting wage of $15.  That may have changed since the wage increase in tacoma.  I was glad to have the job when I needed it and my coworkers and boss were awesome, but as soon as I found something else I was out of there!"
good,"favortism, incompetent leadership, no accountability.  if you are looking for a job, expect all of these things. only thing constant is change, if you can ignore those things you are good."
good,"Benefits are good, pay isn't enough to raise a family on. I enjoy the welding part but employees don't stay long as they find out what the base pay is after starting.  The employees are skilled for the most part.  No opportunity for advancement.  Dead end job."
good,the management sucked and they had bias sups. who formed judgement based on their personal preferences. I didnt like it their. however the company itself had a decent core value.
good,The benefits are great i love how your able to go to one particular place and take care of your needs. I enjoyed the job on the operations side of things.
good,I would answer between 60-200plus calls a day advising clients of options for trash removal. it was an interesting job but can be very stressful.
good,The fault runs downhill. The higher ups (side load and etc) needs help so they take from rear load then next morning complain how rear load couldn't finish. Set up for failure. Co-workers are great but nobody has good things to say about the job except the benefits or pay (after overtime).
good,Waste Management was also a great place to work. It afforded me an opportunity do my job and also work in the Sales Department selling their products and to go from site to site training other employees on their computer system.
good,The management in grand rapids is terrible and they only care about making a profit for the company. The equipment is antiques and always breaking down. If you enjoy being yelled at and treated bad for having a truck break down on you that has over 1 million miles on it and barely runs. ( but that is always the drivers fault). Bad can't stress that enough.
good,Unable to perform at my best due to the misleading information and directions from those who are getting paid to know better. Frustrated to work with no worth!
good,All the employees at Waste Management are excellent people. Including all the managers. Everyone there works as a team until the job is done.
good,"A typical day at Waste Management, waiting in the hallway for the workers to punch in and making sure they're on time. beginning with the daily stretching exercises, and heading off to start running the system."
good,"I would recommend employment for 1st line, management has its struggles as it relates to communications and fairness in Ault location, average place of employment"
good,"bad management, no job advancement opportunities at all."
good,"Where you worked was based off a daily cycle where a certain day determined where you worked and what responsibility you held in the workplace. Working there I learned the basic required skills for waste management which was how to clean out the carts. The management there was respectable, the manager was a good leader/motivator. My fellow colleagues were decent people who made decent workers. The most challenging part of the job was cleaning on top of the rail cars. Along side its difficulty it was the most enjoyable part of my day because it kept me occupied."
good,"The facility i supervised processed over 55 tons of material a 10 hour shift."
good,Management staff aren't trained for the jobs their in. The company needs Managers with a stronger transportation background.
good,"A typical day at waste management starts at 4:30, you work long hours, with great pay and great benefits. Most co workers are great your all working for the same goal, however more often then not you have temp to hires working with you instead of another driver ( to save money) but since they are working by the hour sometimes they tend to slow production down because they are working by the hour so the slower they go the more money they make but it doesnt help the drivers production averages."
good,"A typical day at work... there really isn't a typical day. Your work hours range anywhere between 12-16 hours a day. Granted, it's only a 4 day work week, but there a lots of long and stressful days. This I think was the hardest part of the job, being able to find work/life balance; it just doesn't happen. The best part about the job are the people I work with. Everyone there is very supportive and are willing to lend a helping hand."
good,"Daily job began at 7:00am with a small briefing.  Tickets for repair work to be completed on malfunctioning compactors put into order of importance and need.  I am the only field hydraulic repair man and my day is very long.  My day should end at 3:30 but I have never finished a day on time.  My day usually ends at 6:00.  The hardest part about my day is the lack of support and communication between the home office, dispatch, customers, and field tech."
good,"very hard labor outside , enjoyed driving trucks... learned a lot of masonry work"
good,Lack of training made it hard to excel.  Rules and regulations change daily.
good,Fun to work with Co-workers but management was something to be desired
good,Odd hours make it tough to maintain a decent work/life balance.  Limited positions available as they have been downsizing the past few years.  With that said the pay is fair and benefits are adequate.
good,"Need I say more"
good,"A typical Monday anytime of year, you take about 100-120 calls in 10 hours. Very emotionally taxing, because most customers are complaining, or else you are being asked the same question repeatedly by different people. A lot of personal work is involved, such as how to do processes in the DOS-based system."
good,i was a city driver that picked up the big blue garbege cans. that were hauled on the back of the roleback trucks.
good,"Typical work day at WM is very busy. I enjoy working here because you learn alot and the most important for me is the interaction with my customers. The hardest part of the job at times is dealing with unruly customers however, I still remain calm and positive."
good,Great benefits.  Up early in the morning. Lots of hours. Not a lot of time off. Good people. Good management. Wouldn't mind working there again. Yep yep.
good,La compagnie est présentement en restructuration et je ne fais pas partie des personnes qui vas garder son emploi
good,"The Waste Management facility at 5201 Bliegh Ave. Needs improvement, I loved working for this establishment.I think they need more great people throughout the company and i think it will be a success with the right people in the right places and not to be bias to anyone."
good,Basically expects you to cater to customers no matter if the lie on you or not. Fires people weekly which always puts pressure on the few drivers that can still tolerate the chicanery of upper management.
good,"Working here is a great way to challenge and improve your work ethic. You'll be challenged mentally and physically, and if you pull through it'll harden you as it did me. Cleaning a never ending mess through blizzards, rain and uphill and ditches was very physically demanding. The company I was hired by was extremely unprofessional in about everyway, but thats not Waste Management's fault directly. Id almost recommend people to this job just to see how long theyd last here."
good,Waste Management is a great company to work for but like so many other great companies it’s the team they put in charge to run the company makes the place undesirable to work at only things that makes it worth while is the O.T. Other than that the starting pay rate is not the best considering how dangerous and stressful the job is.
good,Productive and good workplace to work at. good benefits good learning experience for me and helping us keep America clean. safety is always being displayed and is recommended.
good,I worked as a Landfill Gas Technician 1. They did not provide me the device to make sure that there is enough oxygen to breathe when inside an excavated hole to repair pipes. I was never provided a uniform and my clothes were ruined because of getting leachate sprayed on my daily from fixing the pumps to drain the leachate from the bottom of the landfill and canals. I was also underpaid for what I did for them. I had developed numbness in my fingers that caused them to frequently feel painfully cold and useless because of being exposed to the pipe cleaning fluid and adhesive when working at Waste Management.  My vehicle to use for checking the gas wells was finally fixed only when it got a flat tire and was unable to be driven uphill.
good,A good company to work for but a high turn over rate. Low on staff so more is added to a person but never extra pay. the office is full of gossiping women
good,"I thought i would have been there long but, i got injured. The work environment was okay, everyone was friendly and kind. Met new people and was amazed by the things people put in the trash."
good,"Long hours, demanding schedules. Safety is not followed consistently.  HR is not fair and consistent with dealing with issues. Boaderline hostle environment when you speak up"
good,I'm a temp at this job the workload is getting light and it's time to move on.Working in extreme conditions can be taxing over time. I'm greatfull for the opportunity but it's time for something different.
good,"low paying job and raise are no more than 20 cents"
good,"Like many other organizations Waste Management  sends work overseas and outsources therefore, there have been a culture change as well as a decrease in employees."
good,"Great place for someone wanting to learn about the maintenance field. the work is dirty and can involve overtime is many cases. overall, it was a great experience."
good,"Management at the Davie location is terrible. As soon as they hire, they fire. There is no room for error and they love to micro manage. Also, you better have thick skin to work in the Davie office."
good,"A typical office work day. Job was customer service, payroll and accounts payable. The office staff was friendly and helpful. Had to get use to smelling trash trucks."
good,"no advancement, in 5 years two raises cause company did not make enough money even though CEO made a heck of a bonus.  started at 12 an hour, after 5 years was making 12.33 and hr"
good,"I am considered a ""new hire"" and undergoing training.  I haven't had sufficient time to create an opinion regarding the work environment.  So far I've worked 10-12 hour shifts, 6 days per week.  It is a very fast paced environment that will keep you on your toes."
good,my experience at WM was horrible. they always tried to make me operate a truck that wasnt legal to be on the road. break downs multiple times a day.  the only good thing about the job was the health insurance was cheap and the pay heck was straight
good,"Job does not pay as well as it was advertised. It is a job, but can be stressful if you don't get your work done and manage accounts appropriately. New management needs to listen to employees and set realistic goals so employees can reach and exceed sales goals. Also company should focus on growing employees into different roles so associates treat the job as a career and not just a paycheck. People are great and easy to get along with. More money made would make for happier employees"
good,"Long hours and low pay for management, Upper management only interested in numbers and not how to get to the numbers they want.  Hard to meet the established goals with the resources provided."
good,"Work day way 5 am until...  Supervision of drivers and helpers covering several cities spread over multiple counties."
good,A lot of hard work . but the insurance is awesome and the challenges of the job can be exciting and scary at the same time . there could be a better training structure
good,Omaha Residential went from having leaders who knew their job.. to Bosses who have never been on a route and have no clue how the job is done. Bottom line on paper is all that matters to Route Managers now.
good,Good place to work but poor management. People are lazy and supervisors have favoritism. Hours are crazy and supervisors are not professional towards their workers.
good,"Culture isn't that great. Management could use some work. Just do what is expected of you. "
good,"I have been with the company over 5 years and have had 4 different bosses so far. With each boss, is new changes and makes it very stressful on the shop and employees."
good,"The job was quick paced, but benefits were good. The job was a little dirty at times. If you can get on 1st first shift its a whole lot better. Management was horrible afraid of being fired for any incident, trainig far and few between, basically OJT ."
good,"Fast paced, preferring you change out parts opposed to finding and repairing root cause of problem. Management in control of technicians, even though they do not know what you are actually dealing with."
good,"They treat employees like children, Managers are more interested in playing childish games than serious work. Expected to make critical repairs with no parts."
good,"It was a great place to work but  you will be working outside and very hot or rain or cold conditions, you have to run jump lift, very physical job sometimes stressful when you have to go help other people you have to be excellent with working with others."
good,"Fast paced physically demanding work,very dusty environment without climate control,not much opportunity for advancement..liked the early work shift and some good people to work with"
good,Overall WM is a decent company. The pay is never consistent and not competitive . Management is out of touch with staff. It is almost impossible to move up or into a new role.
good,"Working here gave me life long skills.  The management was not supportive.  Having children seemed to be a bother, if you had to call in due to sick children."
good,Typical day is standing at conveyor belt and pull plastic and glass off the conveyor belt to put in huge bins.Management was fine. Co-workers were alright. The hardest part was smelling garbage all day and sorting thru it. This was so boring I felt like I was just wasting my brain away. I left because I was constantly getting Bacterial Skin Infections all the time.
good,"I enjoyed working with my Coworkers."
good,"Waste Management is a large corporation that does function well considering it's size.  Typical day for me requires putting out fires and resolving issues for multiple departments and fiels sites."
good,Co workers and immediate managers were all very helpful and fun to be around and work along side.  The higher management were very unorganized and were not great to work with.
good,"It is a major US company, with rigorous profit margins, and competitive expectations. The compensation was good, the hours were long. It was salaried work. It allowed me to excel as a self starter, who relied on his wits and experience, rather then the college he attended, or who his daddy was. This generally caused conflicts with some of the management, who protected their castles, and worked as hard at CYA, as they did at trying to understand just why the project wasn't going the way it was bid. Waste Management as a publicly traded company, was usually pretty good at sifting through the smoke, as far as middle and upper management were concerned. They focused on the bottom line. This was lost, when they shifted our sole owned subsidiary to another company to handle oversight and control from the corporate level. I worked with the company, until they closed our office. I'm not sure how many times the name has changed since Waste Management shifted control to Brand Companies, or what it's even called today."
good,"Good company to work for. Great Benefits to the employees. Safety with this company apply only when the higher up people are watching! On typical day time went fast, everything went smoothly. Learn allot with this company being my first real job!"
good,"In time you can acquire vacation and personal time."
good,"picking up trash all day,learned to drive a trash truck,management were mean,co-workers good people,hardest thing of the job was the tiredness after work,money was good"
good,"The company as a whole is wonderful, but local market constraints makes it unbearable to work.Reorganization would benefit the company as a whole."
good,the over all company of waste management is a good company to work for. the benifits are good and pays is good. looking to relocate were waste management is not located
good,"Purchase orders, assists in troubleshooting and resolving safety, service, and operational issues. Set up customer tickets for service."
good,"early mornings, none stop action a lot of physical labor, lifting and dumping, always focusing on safety. great reviews from customers, the pay was great."
good,Not family friendly. Can't use a sick day if it's your child YOU have to be sick or you get an 'occurrence'. Office environment has way too much drama. Management will throw you under the bus real quick if they tell you something and then they can get in trouble for it...
good,"Good company overall. They approached and attracted me from a company that I was with for nearly 5 years. After 1 very successful year that resulted in driving 12% increase in upselling revenue at the call center, they decided to reengineer my position. Very disappointing."
good,"60-80 cold calls per day"
good,maintain recycling plant machinery and equipment. design and fabricate tools and equipment to help improve production.
good,"This company was great to work for, until they closed down the call center."
good,"They'll work you into the ground if you're at the manager level or above, expecting you to be ""always on"" with email, etc. (nights/weekends/holidays.)"
good,"A typical day as a Route Manager; Arrive at 3am and run reports to be discussed with Drivers arriving at 4, 5 and 5:30 am. Perform three launches with drivers to start their routes. Review previous days routes for performance and set schedule to meet with drivers on routes that did not meet their goals or that had issues the previous day.  Meet with District Manager at 8:30 to review data, employee, truck issues and schedules for the day.  Head out to driver routes, customers and attend Conference calls and meetings as scheduled."
good,"Have worked for WM for 4 years. Overall, I liked working w the people I do/did."
good,"Upper mgmt wants everyone to be a drone. Things change almost daily and that is ok, but if they allowed free thinking and employees to voice opinions, they would not have to change so much. I was hired in as a temp and did nit receive much training. We were expected to ask our co-workers and have them train us as well as do their work. And do not have a customer complain on you, because then you would be jobless. Mgmt kept having us assist in other queues and route our calls to other centers, causing us to loose sales. It seemed that they were wanting to edge out the need for our dept at this center."
good,"Waste Mangement is a descent place to work benefits are ok. If there is a holiday in a particular week, you will have that day off but in return you are required to work that Saturday."
good,"The hardest part was the heat and odor of smelly trash, to learn how to operate garbage trucks levers.  My co-workers where  very cool . The job was very typical ,driving , routes and direction an operations"
good,"While Waste Management, as a whole, is working towards a great goal, the call center environment is harsh and makes you feel like a number."
good,"Great local team, and drivers, hours can be very long.  Need to concentrate on team building."
good,"At Waste Management, your hours are somewhat flexable. Customer needs are always at the top of my priorty list. The hardest part of my job was not being able to meet my customers needs, due to services we could not provide. I made good friends at Waste Management. A great place to work and grow."
good,picked up the local trash and took it to the land fill so it can be disposed of.
good,Good if you like working nights and plenty of overtime..
good,"If you are looking for long hours and good pay this is the company to work for..... but the trucks are trash... play in steering, oil leaks, and play in gear shift and when you write it up on DVIR the shop will say doesnt effect the safe opperation... and wont fix it... if its broken or leaking they will put a band aid on it and your on your way... untill it breaks down for good and then put on the down list... and then you have to drive something even worse then the truck you were driving... its sad ..goodluck.. you tell management and they dont care as long as the job done.. so easy to write you up for anything... but if you need time off or more hours they will work with you on it... great pay. I know its all profit but dont understand why a multi-billion dollar company has equipment like this.....very sad..."
good,to many good old boys. need a balance of cultures. if you know what i mean.
good,"For Waste Management, I was a CDL driver, serving commercial and residential areas picking up garbage and recycle, and then delivering the waste to the landfills."
good,was there just over six month just to be trained for another fleet job
good,ii worked long days 12 to 14 hrs
good,"Employer offers the world when in an enterview, then once your"
good,Hard working employee group always focused on doing the best job possible
good,Your expected to learn very fast and be very customer minded. Customer service is a important goal an deffinatley a big part of your job. Speaking professionally and courtesy is very important not only to customers but fellow employees also.
good,"Waste Management's place in the business world is exciting, but it is still run by the ""good old boy network"". Diversity is mandated on paper only. Promotions are not readily available. Management is good in some areas, but they are not very good at developing talent. After 4 or 5 years the pay is good."
good,customer service . check in trucks and input information in computer. cleaned office when needed . also helped co worker when in need of help.made copies of drivers trip ticket for every truck that unloaded that day.
good,"It is a tough, heavy job and you must realize you are dealing with rubbish vehicles and the smell can get terrible..............................................."
good,"Heavy machinery operator specializing in equipment such as"
good,All they care about is getting that trash and recycling up and nothing else matters. The management throws their weight around and threaten employees if certain things are not done in a manner of time and when it comes to our families or personal business we have to put it off or not go at all and miss out on things such as an army buddy that you served in the war with and they tell you can go and when the times comes it's a problem
good,"West Texas location-Orla. Not bad at all just needs some improvement in several areas. A lot of people hired out here don't know much of heavy equipment, but it could be a good place to learn from."
good,"I enjoyed working for waste management and was always active and busy. Pay was good and great benefits for me and my family, co workers were great to work with, Excellent team work,supervisor was also good to get along with more like family."
good,It’s an OK place to work if you don’t mind management not knowing what the h3ll they’re doing  or not wanting to tell you and treating you like a 3 year old
good,"-Wasn’t able to work unless someone where to able to come in "
good,"I enjoyed coming to work and learned so much.  The different trucks had there own way of driving and going out and picking up the cutumers carts was different at fisrt but came easier as time came by. Then came the weather changes, that in it self was a challenge.  Nerve racking at times but was great to still to learn and pass it alon to others.  Over all enjoyable."
good,"Good place to work as far as the benefits. However, high turn over with management and it is definitely Corporate America. You have to please the stakeholders. Expectations to perform are extremely high."
good,work life balance needs improvement. Not ideal if you don't work close to your job site. The benefits are good. Just be mindful of your surroundings while working to remain safe.
good,I felt like this job was not at all like I thought it would be like.  The company was ran by one family and they are all in upper management so if one does not like you non of them do.
good,"Must have a strong stomach. The smell was incredibly horrible. After the initial shock of the smell, it was a decent job. I enjoyed being maintenance worker, it gave me a lot of new skills to add to my repertoire."
good,Horrible on boarding process. Very little assistance in market strategy. Fight or flight mentality. Outdated approach to sales processes. Training assistance was minimal. Primarily learn as you go but expected results faster than you gain any competitive knowledge.
good,"They got rid of a lot employees and those left are stuck with more work and no adjusted pay. “Catty” work environment, management is a joke, and the pay is low compared to most places."
good,Great benefits but they over worked you. Worked over 60hrs a week which leave you with no time for your family. At the beginning is great but after a while you get burned out.
good,"The manager that I worked for was over bearing and very hard to work with.  Waste Management is a very good company to work for."
good,"Decent company with good benefits and pay. If you are a Route Manager you will not have much if any of a work life balance. You can expect to work at least 60 + hours a week and some weekends as well.  They pay higher than anyone else in the industry, but its because of the hours you will be required to work. There are no holidays in this business. If a holiday falls during the week, you will be working the Saturday of that week to make up for the day off.  As an RM you have the chance to earn a bonus every quarter. Most of the metrics you are measured on are out of your control and your bonus is left up to the drivers and how they preform during the quarter. There are very few metrics you will be judged on that you can control. If you have small children and want to see them grow up, this isn't the job for you."
good,"the company has good benefits for vacation,401k, life insurance, or stock options. But the company is set up so they have no liability for any thing that can go wrong. All employees sign off on all operations  on I pads so any thing that breaks or fails is your fault.after being there 2 months I found I made the same as a 8 year employee"
good,I cannot speak about management as a whole. I can say my manager was very tough to work with/for and it was due to that experience that I would not make any recommendations.
good,Steady work pace. High demand job tasks. Work environment amongst workers is great and family-like. The pay and benefits were fair but the management department is definitely the only negative.
good,"I was very unhappy with the work environment here, it was toxic.  The upper management knew exactly what was going on and did nothing to stop the harassment from employees to the management and the bulling from peers."
good,"Waste management pays well so it draws people from all walks of life. The issue is that the metrics are unobtainable, you ultimately end up feeling like you are drowning because you spend all day in meetings or on calls calls as they are changing directions and you can never actually get your job done."
good,Had problem getting them to pay me what i was told my pay would be when i was hired in due to what i was told was a pay freeze threw out the company..
good,"From 5:30 am in the morning, my job duty was to go through the neighborhoods and empty their waste. For 8 hours a day, hard work and dedication.just over whelming do to the sun."
good,My lead supervisor was amazing he was understanding and very helpful. But his supervisors not so much. They have no souls. The higher up boss of the company never stopped one of his supervisors from making racial remarks about interracial relationships. I turned him in and that is how I lost my job.
good,"I smelled so many different smells that I never had before in life. All of them were disgusting, but, my coworkers and supervisor made the temp service ticket job awesome and fun to go to because of team work."
good,"I'd absolutely recommend this employer if you aren't in need of a cost of living wage, and don't mind having 60+ hour work weeks... and don't mind having a random schedule, which includes randomly being selected to work weekends and holidays (whether you're available to work them or not), and being moved from shift to shift at random including overnight shifts. No stability, and the pay doesn't make up for it IMO. Benefits are pretty good though"
good,Your time is under strict supervision as you have to be available for phone calls at all times. Mondays are the busiest days of the week. Customers are very impatient.
good,I think Waste Management is a wonderful career for anyone looking for the opportunity to succeed in life. Their are some different ways that the operations part could be ran but that is the same in every job on this planet.
good,"Customer Service training was good"
good,"starting with cleaning the grounds, then moves onto sorting trash and ends with cleaning the machines. i learned how much it takes to work in a fast pace job. i never really saw and managers, but the employees made the job more enjoyable, nothing was really hard except keeping up with the pace."
good,At some point WM needs to get into the 21st century and start treating employees with respect. As the largest waste hauler in the country they lead the way in everything except human resources. Still to much politics and boys club for company to keep good people.
good,Good job but cutthroat  sinyorty doesn’t mean much benefits are really good but the pay is a little low for the work we have to perform they should be more Competitive
good,Started off as best job i ever had. Soon after new management came in..it’s like you had to become a robot and do everything they said their way.  You couldn’t be your own person and bring in your own style like they say you can with being an outside sales rep. Favoritism happens big time here. No matter if you are putting in just as much effort and hours.  Your manager won’t care.
good,You work through a temp service for 7 months !! Promise to get on with Company within 6 months of hire only to be flip flopped around. Work your tail off never get rewarded. Management in other departments runner over. Everyone is over worked from the office to the hoppers. The pay makes you feel like you don't have any other choice but to leave after so long.
good,"My daily duties included:"
good,Stressful. Could treat employees better. Big company does not treat you like a smaller company does. Takes long to promote from within company and management can be better.
good,Be prepared for 14 hour days and weekends. Good pay and benefits but no time at home. Need to micro manage in order to meet the metrics. Upper management needs to understand challenges on the ground
good,nice work place fast paced and as many hours as u want. the managers are not to good with the employees and your hard work goes unnoticed.. great location
good,"I worked in the call center at WM.  This job is very fast paced.  They are moving the call center to Phoenix.  The worst part about the job is how micromanaged you are.  The rules are the rules and you are written up if you are one minute late.  Furthermore, you receive an occurrence if you need to take a day off unexpected even if you have the personal/ vacation time.  You are even given an occurrence if you are in the hospital or in a wreck!"
good,"Good company to work for, but the salary is lower than competing companies. Company expectations put a lot of stress on the employees, but do not compensate well for that."
good,"pros"
good,"I worked here as a temp for a little over a year. The work wasn't hard, but it wasn't exactly a clean job either.  I found work elsewhere because I would have most likely remained a temp."
good,"All in all not a bad place. It was fast paced in the sorting area and was hard to keep up at first. Once you find your groove though, it wasn't so bad."
good,This company has a great business plan and is incredibly profitable but is not a family friendly / employee friendly environment. Employees are continually under the microscope and turnover is incredibly high.
good,"No comment, I do not have much to comment,that's all but is very dirty but people are working there are very nice this work please is very cold so if you want you can go"
good,everyone got along good pay fair sometime great groth in the company great pay good coworker great trips fun place to work great coworker staff is great
good,"Waste Management is a great company to work for.  Currently working as a contracted employee with no PTO or vacation days.  Contracted employee's are not included in the company meetings or e-mails that are related to their business.  Makes you feel like an outsider.  "
good,"Great benefits, no work/life balance.  stock option and health insurance are the best.  The hardest part is the long days of work 6 days a week.  The best part working with people from different backgrounds."
good,"Waste Management can be a good company to work for, depending on the circumstances. It has it's pros and cons; like any other job. They offer excellent benefits, decent pay, and lots of overtime."
good,The work enviornment was great. It is a very stressful and high demand industry and it is all on the dispatcher to make sure that we get the drivers to our customers on time and that the job is done corretly
good,"lay offs annually when I was there in order to keep increasing the dividend.  Therefore you were constantly made to feel that your job was not secure and further, employment retention decisions were highly loaded towards long termers..."
good,"Pick up 300-450 homes of trash.Front load truck nice for job.9 hrs of work is standard per day.Union reps don't do there job,no one looks over your shoulder they now have camera's."
good,"My overall experience with WM was a great learning tool, I held various positions which led to learning the business from all aspects."
good,Every call center has its pros and its cons. Things are constantly changing but the system is not up to date or modern. Systems being utilized are also not cohesive. There are many errors that can occur systematically but the employee is still held accountable. However the environment is friendly. There is room for advancement provided that numbers are met.
good,"This is the most fun I've ever had working. We worked in a small group that worked independently of one another, unless we ran into complicated problems. We were able to keep above an 80% return rate on machines that had been recycle for various issues. The management was able to talk to us and address some of our concerns. The only real draw back to working here was that it was a warehouse that didn't have air conditioning and was extremely hot."
good,I believe that waste management as a whole is a great company and this particular container shop the management sucks i mean they had no communication and there's a buddy system going on meaning and the lazy people get all the love and respect
good,"You clock in and start working. You have to learn to multitask because you might be working on a truck in the bay and a Driver comes in  needs something done on his truck so you have to stop doing what you were working on and help him,."
good,"The company has great benefits however they downsized the Leesburg office which created layoff's. Very busy phone center processed incoming call concerning billing, service issues and new clients."
good,"Room for improvements with Managers. "
good,"I enjoyed the group chats and all day support. The weekly meeting were most helpful. Things were always changing, so the workflow was steady."
good,"Safety Practices were good. Pay was good."
good,The company was a pretty good place to work with great opportunities for those that were willing to relocate. I was not so that did work out in my favor.
good,"Average place to work did not like the manager I had, he was not very knowledgeable, and used my same review, year after year without changes... Lazy"
good,"A Lead's typical day at WM Centralized Dispatch is 10 plus hours of leadership meetings, monitoring group email inboxes, addressing service escalations, engaging in coaching conversations, conducting and preparing for team huddles, assisting with radio coverage when warranted, updating metric boards, and any other duties/projects as assigned by the Dispatch Supervisor and/or Area Dispatch Manager."
good,"The thing I love about working at Waste Management is the people.  I feel supported and appreciated by my manager and my team.  I love working with customers and problem solving to find the right solution for their needs.  I love to learn about the industry and how the changing dynamics of our business impacts our clients.  Change is a constant at Waste Management and although I thrive on this change, I too am looking for a career change, in order to apply my skills and learn new things, after working 20 years successfully with this company."
good,"Must be thick skinned to work in this fast-paced environment. I learned that they are very clique-ish, but very organized , not very firendly or inviting, but very willing to share knowledge and train someone."
good,"While there was room for advancement, there were also many aspects that could be improved upon regarding the treatment of employees. Not all employees are treated as if on the same playing field."
good,Tough job and contracts make sales that much harder. You can get a customer on board and the price and relationship are there but a previous company's agreement keeps things from moving forward
good,I worked there for 5 years adn the management were not together. The job was a great job and I made good money and had great benefits. I would still be there if it wasn't for personal issues at home with finances.
good,"Although pay was competitive for the industry, WM fails to provide career paths for those interested in advancement. Management is more concerned with their own advancement, and are seldom interested in development of their employees. Employees are not encouraged to seek advancement. I enjoyed the actual work and the industry, especially working with third party vendors and customers."
good,"This is actually the first company that I have enjoyed working for since most days, since day one. Excellent benefits, compensation is ok. Laid back work environment, management is OK. Would like more privacy in the way the office is setup though. And management does tend to micro-manage here, as well as show favoritism."
good,"Waste management was a good company to work for, or to work with."
good,Working here is getting a high level of responsibility without reasonable compensation. Operate Heavy Machinery without getting certified. Get the experience but not the recognition.
good,"Fun working environment"
good,"needs work on keeping personal, pays every week, blah blah blah"
good,Great people and benefits. I traveled extensively and met and worked with great people throughout the organization.
good,"As a former United States Marine, I am an early riser and like to meet with my appointments as soon as the offices are open and what is convenient to them to work with each other. After my meetings, I make sure I annotate what went on in the meeting, what I have to do to make them happy and or close the business with them. Sometimes I am able to get a verbal yes or close the deal on the spot. This also depends if they are in a contract or not. I used Saleforce (SFDC) to make sure I had all my calls, emails, contacts and appointments set up.  I have a game plan when and where I will be for the week. Each day of the week I try to hit certain zip codes so I am not driving around like a bumble bee. I learned that when I am on time and show up to my clients when I say I will be there. clients respect me and trust me, it also lets them know I am dependable and reliable to accomplish the missions that need to be done. I got along with my co-workers and sometimes they would ride along with me and I would teach them the ropes of the business and my territories. I get along with people and that is something I am proud of. I know how to treat people and if there are fires that need to be put out, I am able to calm clients and take care of their needs to make sure they continue to be a loyal customer. The hardest part of my job was saying good-bye to my direct manager that I really enjoyed working with. He left the company roughly five months after I joined the company. The most enjoyable part of my day is meeting my customers and prospecting for new ones. I enjoy being around people and"
good,"Work day starts at 5:30 am. We receive a route sheet for the route that is to be completed that day. We have meetings regarding issues from the day before. 6:00 am we pre-trip our trucks. 6:15 we leave the site yard and start the trip to our routes. Cutoff time is when ever we finish. We go to the landfills and dump our trucks. We drive back to the site to post trip and park our truck. We complete all paper work from DVIR book to route sheet. Then we turn these in to our dispatch. We clock out. At this job I've learn leadership skills and how to solve and fix problems. I've learned that some times i may have to pick up where other fail for the greater good of the company."
good,drove a steady route through out the week used good judgement and maintain safety at all  times
good,"I arrive at work one hour early to be prepared   Then I put my safety gear on.  Then I go to my station to sort recycled materials.  With my co-workers and management, we make a good team.  We work hard and respect each other."
good,Waste Management overall is a good company to work for in some respects.  From a Call Center perspective it lacks the right leadership to cultivate a team environment necessary to achieve great results.
good,"Typical day; Spending countless hours reviewing emails, repeatedly explaining processes to Sr. level colleagues, due to lack of company employee training. Mentally drain, physically drain.   "
good,"Helping to clean the streets of waste was fun. Learned how to use the machine on a garbage truck, so that was cool too."
good,"very mentally challenging trying to plan n schedule a full days route when you are only allowed to see half of it.Management is new and not very knowledgeable of the business.I get along well with my coworkers.I enjoy being outside ,not being stuck in one place all day."
good,"i was a lead man in a city dump that was fast paced and interesting, we would always find new ways to do our jobs"
good,I only work part time but it does get busy through out the day. Friendly Co-workers and management is very nice.I schedule pick ups for customer as well as set up new service.
good,"Great pay, middle management does not care about safety, if you write things up on the DVIR you are told you are complaining."
good,"When I first started this job I loved it. The people were great, the job was simple, pay was great. But the longer I was there, the more changes came. We were expected to do triple the work, started taking calls for multiple other call centers with pathetic training and no one available for assistance. Supervisors only cared about maintaining stats, but couldn't care less about who was providing good customer service. I ended up walking out because I couldn't handle the stress or the companies BS anymore. All the calls were angry customers because Waste Management couldn't do their job. No containers for customers, but still charging them for the horrible service they were receiving. All other departments, dispatch, billing, etc were completely useless. Horrible job."
good,"a typical day began at 5 am, after a safety meeting get the truck prepared and begin the route. picked up residential customers trash and recycling and went to the transfer station. I learned how to operate class B vehicles efficiently. Management didn't care about the employes. Co workers were often frustrated. Hardest part of the job was staying positive after management told us only negative things. I enjoyed starting early and being off early"
good,"As a former MRF Manager I, in Spokane, WA I was responsible for two metals buy back centers, and two MRF's. My offer letter said MRF II Manager, for the duration I was there, I asked why my title did not match the offer letter. I was literally lied to for fourteen months that this was not an issue. Well if it is not an issue, than change it? They did not. The current position posting indicates they are searching for a MRF III Manager. Good luck!"
good,"My typical day in customer service would include investigating customer complaints about merchandise, service, and billing. I would key information into computer to obtain computerized information. Able to follow up on recommended adjustments to ensure customer satisfaction. "
good,"the only place I ever worked where work comes before life, a severe lack of understanding of life's mishaps and unforseen events on management's part."
good,A typical day at work consists of 70 to 90 calls per day ranging from everything as simple as a trash can being replaced to billing issues or upcoming waste events. I've learned how to accept change as a way of life with the company. The hardest part of the job of the job is that sometimes the rules can be too strict and that they are always changing but the most enjoyable part of the job is that I work with a great team and that I genuinely love helping people so when I end the phone call and I've turned an angry customer into a customer who understands the whole picture and realizes where the misunderstanding came into play.
good,I learn something different everyday. Part of my position is to investigate and resolve the situtation. This makes my day go faster. I enjoy my co-workers because we work as a team.
good,Very physical work hours arent so good overall it isnt too bad but i wouldnt suggest it as a career.
good,Overall it’s a great company not perfect but a good company good benefits good money stable work lots of hours lots of overtime and great people The management is correct although not so flexible with the hours but for somebody who’s trying to buy a house that has a family it is a great job
good,"So they hire just about anyone which is great EXCEPT for the fact that the work gets put on the people who are good and efficient at their jobs. High call volume makes the day goes by fast. Easy to learn the basics but everything after is case by case. Management is very attentive but cold at the same time. Meaning, They hello but it feels very cookie cutter like or not very personal."
good,Management at WM is currently evolving which has and is creating a change in the culture.  It remains to be seen whether this will be a positive change.
good,run into a lot of drivers who dont want help and treat their help poorly. For example : A driver i was assigned to had finished his day with me without a complaint and had went to HR and told them I was a terrible helper and made false accusations that were proven false by the help of front view and rear view cameras.
good,"Great work enviorment,but corporate micromanages drivers way too much.They will terminate a good driver who has been there for 30 plus years very quickly.No room for error so as a driver you are constantly uncomfortable because they micromanage every little thing.Pay is great though."
good,Offers good benefits compared to some medium size companies in Connecticut. Offers an okay work life balance.  Management needs to make employees feel more appreciated.
good,Management is the biggest issue. The job itself is ok. Management doesnt know by experience which makes it difficult. If management had hands on experience and knew more about the facility it would make the overall a better place to workManagemeiclosed minded
good,All of the benefits for WM are pretty good and the pay is fair with the exception to medical. It is 80 20 with an $800 deductable per person. If you have a child or need some kind of surgery it could cost you a few thousand. To me this is unacceptable for a huge corporation that makes millions. You will work between 48 to 56 hours most weeks. The people you work with feel like I do.Managementaajoke.
good,The pay was great.  The management was not so great.  Some were decent others were not.   They didn't want you to have common sense.   There was a lot of competition.
good,When i started there it was a great place to work but the last few years it has completely changed. It used to be about the employees and take care of everyone and now its all about the numbers. They need to squeeze every bit out to make upper management happy and don't care what its doing to the workforce. Drivers are easy to replace mentality. New drivers are happy do to they cater to newer drivers to make sure they stay but veteran drivers are unhappy. Supervisors at the Bristol Yard have completely turned over and moved on to much more paying jobs and new management knows nothing about the business or listens to the employees. All new drivers go to Florida for training center. New supervisors go to Chicago for training. Supervisors don't have the time to work with drivers in the field to improve operations due to amount of meetings and huddles they need to attend. Upper management puts in 8 hours a day where supervisors and drivers put in 12 plus hours a day. Not much room for advancement here anymore. Used to pull form the drivers to move to management but no longer.
good,Very little culture unless part of the customer services team - the best part about working for waste was the location. However the management team were great!
good,I am currently looking for other opportunities. It would be a great place to work with better management/supervisors. No clear processes or procedures.
good,"work life balance is hard / compensation decent / on call more than not. Continuous training and safety is key. responsible for budgets, production, ordering, maintenance, and safety regulations"
good,"IF you aren't built for it, or if you have co workers with no sense of safety. I did enjoy a lot of the job. The heavy lifting, the journey, the blood and sweat that went into feeling like you accomplished so much! the reason I won't give this a good review. It is a temp service, there is a long wait to get on  a truck, there is a lot of reckless new comers that think nothing of you or your safety. (Had someone try to throw a can right into the back of one of the trucks which landed on me instead)"
good,The way that managment is ran makes the work enviorment  really hetic.They over work there employees and pay them little to nothing.the benefits are good.
good,"I worked at waste Mangement for a year as an intern and that’s all I would do. No one wants to help, you really have to seek out the nice people if not you’ll be stuck. It’s very repetitive and you get scored for everything you do. As an intern i was doing what the full time employees would do. If your looking for an easy internship do it."
good,You will meet a lot of friendly people and the job is ok also you see new area and meet a lot of people and the money is good it will be ok once you learn your route and get the hang of things then you will fall right in place smiles
good,"management don,t care about employees at all one mistake and they do not forget it. it was nice working outside in all weather all equipment had enclosed cabs"
good,"I Worked here 22 years. It was good at times and it was bad at times. I think that happens everywhere."
good,"Job titles have very little to do with job responsibilities. At one point, employee participation events occurred regularly but a dramatic shift occurred several years ago.  When that happened, employee morale took a downward turn."
good,A typcial day at work would be seperating the recycling from the garbage all day. Since its a garbage-job its really dirty but you have the uniform that is needed for it.
good,Fast paced and heavy lifting alot of the day overall I really enjoyed my time at waste management.we started at 2 to 4 am  Monday through Friday got done anywhere from 2 to 4 pm. Had to work good with driver or it wasn't a good day.didnt spend much time at the landfill
good,Pay is great but work life balance is horrible.  Working 60-80 hrs a week as a manager with failing equipment.  Always depending on other people to do their job so you can finish yours.
good,"hard nasty work, people not friendly, "
good,"Overall a good place, outside of the camera in your face and strict policies, you could be done in 9 hours or 14 up to you. Management is inconsistent with certain people. They change the policies almost weekly. If you can drive and not have camera events you’ll never have any problems."
good,"Working with waste management was a pretty good experience. The workplace was very relaxed, had good goals and high expectations. It gave me a good feel for the waste industry. On the flip side the pay really needs to be increased for the type of work that has to be done. They also need to provide benefits for the workers who go through temporary agencies because the work environments are of high risk and are very dangerous."
good,This company had a smaller administrative/support staff for the size of the organization. The job security was questioned on a daily basis due to possibilities of department closures for geographic locations.
good,"Low starting pay, very minimal raises.  Management cannot make a coherent decision based on personnel and vehicles.  Trucks constantly in bad condition."
good,"Besides A great business, some of the employees weren't taking their jobs seriously. When it came to tips from customers, the drivers hold back certain amount of tips from it's helpers without reasoning. Other than that, most were decent."
good,"I worked at Waste Management for over 5 years.  The pay can be good depending on the department and sales commission and the benefits are also decent.  That said, the company makes little to no effort to make the work environment positive, fun or engaging. This is strictly by the numbers. Management basically follows a guideline and you start to feel like what they want is a robot not a person to represent the company.  For example, the employ services from companies like Salesforce to track everything the agents are doing and use data to try and tweak performance.  Guidelines also change constantly as management does not really know what works and what does not work, they just keep trying different things in hopes of finding greater success. Management also does not like to advance from within as they know that anyone that has done the role and knows what works and what does not work will want to provide input and what they are looking for is someone that will take orders instead. You will burn out quickly at this employer because what they want is for you to sit in a cubicle and take or make as many calls as possible and then they will use stats to micro manage."
good,Overall all this is a good company to work for if you know the right people.  They pay well but demand a lot. I enjoyed working here but management need to be retrained.
good,WM have great Benefits and pay. They have long 10 to 12 hours days 6 days a week. They have high turn over rated due to strict a rules. They have a large fleet of trucks but struggles to keep them up and most are unsafe.
good,"Typical day was compiling reports, preparing acquisition proformas, accounting support, keeping in contact with remote operations, working with regional managers."
good,"At waste management your expected to already be an expert at everything. When your not, the ""leads"" then chastise you and make snide comments over the radio"
good,equipment wasn't the best to work with or on. management wouldn't buy or approve purchase of things needed to do our jobs. I feel the company at the time was undergoing changes and was trying to make an attempt to not spend money on equipment nor people.
good,"Waste Management is an okay job for those who want to work a lot and make a lot of money. Ours was Union. Which resulted in good pay (25.76 an hour) and extremely great benifits!! Commercial starts at 2am and you get off whenever. Usually 12-14 hours a day. Routes are always growing. Means longer days the longer you are there. A lot of guys who’ve been there for years look 10 years older due to the stress and lack of time for the gym or healthy eating. Managers were pretty good! Residential started at 530am with same pay. You can take home 1000 dollars a week working 54 hours a week. So all in all, it’s a good job, but maybe temporary. I just didn’t have it in me to keep working weird days off, nights and extremely long hours.  Wide variety of new and ancient trucks. A lot of guys work there and do 6 days a week because they hate their wives and home life."
good,good company and opportunities but some management members are difficult to work with at times. Commissions are low compared with our companies and management always changes amounts
good,"Good place to work   Very structured  You have to have very good computer skills to work here. Only drawback are the goals set for salespeople during recession years,"
good,Worked for the company for a year and pretty much missed a whole year of my daughters life.  Could not balance life and work at all.  Always working extremely late hours weekly.
good,"I was a truck driver for a very short time.  I was let go for an traffic incident. The hours were very difficult to work, Management was very difficult to work with and not very flexible."
good,The benefits are were awesome and a good company to work for.  The workday is long and stressful but you will have a good paycheck.  One of the downside to the job is its a six day workweek.
good,"The managers can be unfair/rude to the employees. Picking on the reliable ones to do all the work for the same pay as everyone else with the same job title. Not easy recommendations or reputation buildup busting everyday for them. Unless they need different approaches to making the company better later on. Place gets hot and doesn't cool down ever, especially in summer. No cooling systems whatsoever in tight/hotter areas. When working in heavy dust debris where dirt clouds surrounds you like for example ""the pits"" underneath the machines if you're a screen cleaner(one job title up from a sorter); they don't provide heavy duty respirators/masks. You use the same glasses/basis respirators you would use for everyday sorting. Personally got Bronchitis from working there. Had to wear 3 basic back-to-back respirators on my face to avoid inhaling/consuming black debris after everyday shift. They give one break (15 minutes) for a 10 hour shift. But, it's really only 10 minutes because it takes a couple of minutes to get out of the working area, and you have to be back in the working area ready to work before the 15 ""break"" is over. Sometimes breaks are taken away if employees take too much ""break time"" coming back from a 10 (supposedly 15) minute break. You have to work on some special holidays. Like Christmas Eve, or Memorial Day weekends. This work isn't easy. The overtime pay (time-and-a-half) is there if you want to make good decent amount of money. Most employees don't know how to work hard, and rely like the managers do on the reliable hard working ones to do all the work. Overall,"
good,"Waste management is a good company you can work a lot of hours and never receive credit for it , the route managers are inexperience and have no clue on how to manage the routes Pasadena area is ran by the leas drivers because the managera are lost and the lead driver is prejudice"
good,"Nice team to work with, good benefits. Management of workload and resources can be improved further. Communication between the headquarters in US and offices in Canada will help the company get even better."
good,"Great place to learn the industrial mechanic industry, very fast paced great for New comers. Lack of communication in management to workers. Stressful atmosphere due to poor inventory upkeep and short deadlines. Dirty smelly job only for those who are dedicated to the cause. Poor opportunity for advancement always given high hopes and promises just to have a new guy brought in and given your opportunities promised. Poor pay raises and no shift differential."
good,"Worked as dispatcher in Wixom, MI.  No opportunity for advancement.  Very corporate environment.  Nice people to work with.  Not too stressfull - staffed well."
good,"Login, work my queque follow up with current customers, inside sales, fast paced, upsell. Enjoyed the employee recognition. employees were a great group of people to work for"
good,Job that pays a bill.Nothing more.Would love it if they would pay more.They should also have some kind of employee incentives.Just need to listen to the employees a little more .
good,"3 a.m. in the morning start time, up to or more than a 100 accounts a day, a bump dump and hump type job you have to about being wide open from start to finish"
good,Waste management was a very exciting job experience learning how to work with others and learning how to work well with others and be a dedicated to your team and safety for you and others and just having this experience
good,My first time working a at a telephone customer service call center but it was face pace which I loved and paid holidays. After your trial period full covered benefits .
good,"There are inconsistent managing methods being used there."
good,It's an easy job you just have to find your own pace the management is understanding the culture is diverse and the hardest part of the job is running across dead animals but the the most enjoyable is getting out at 2:30 p.m. or sometimes earlier
good,It was very quiet and lifeless. Everyone here seemed upset to be here and there was no sales atmosphere to thrive on here. Managers hardly helped you with your situation and a lot of the problem solving had to be done by yourself.
good,"Waste Management is considered a leader in the Solid Waste business.  As a large company it struggles with divergent and sometimes conflicting goals."
good,"I was in dispatch, had to answer phones/ emails/ and personal IM to ensure quality service. I was also on the safety management team and volunteered for any volunteer events they offered."
good,WM's culture is good.  My role is within their In Plant Services as a subcontractor.  Subcontractor role is challenging because meeting customer's expectations and requirements on top of your own company's increases the pressure and workload.  WM struggles as a company to retain good talent due to the demands of the roles versus average compensation level for a middle-technical position.  As a whole the Waste Industry is a positive growth sector but is prone to tight financials because it is generally a cost to customers without commercial gain.
good,"I have been with Waste Management for over 3 years now.  Fast paced, stressful, long hours.  The good thing is they have good compensation and the people I have worked with are really great people and always willing to help when needed.  Management is OK, favorites are picked and if you are not one of them, then you will have a tough time."
good,It is a good place to work just would be a better place if the company reliezed that it isnt the technicians that are the problem when they go through 5 techs in 3 years should probably look a little higher when its also happening in other shops under that same supervisor
good,"Large corporate national operation. Pay scale was good, work schedule was heavy and physical constant pushing to get the route done. At times would get help and/or give help to others if things didn't go smoothe, break downs or holiday volume. Very strict regarding rules and regulations, zero tolerance."
good,Great company for benefits but management is not great. Hourly pay at my location was less than in bigger cities.  Trucks are old and break down a lot.
good,answer inbound calls concerning waste and placing orders for bag the hardest part of the job is that sometimes during winter season customers don't get their trash pick up due to weather even when they see other companies get there trash pick up
good,very difficult position due to the volatile nature of the business and the pricing structure of the competition in the market. Salary was fair but was very difficult to make bonus
good,"•	Dispatches drivers to calls as they are received, using information on customer needs, drivers’ locations and loads, and daily factors to balance cost and speed of response"
good,"I was a 20 year veteran driver. In that time I have seen this company go from a great place to work to a good paycheck only. Before USA waste purchased WM, it was a great, customer focused business. After the merger it is ONLY about taking care of the stock holders. Parts are always on order for trucks. Trucks have over 200,000 miles on them. They leak every fluid imaginable, they are rusty and yet WM still charges 2-3 times what the competition does. Take the job, for the experience then start looking for another company that cares about its employees and its customers. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"
good,"management is great locally."
good,This is a decent company to work for. They have decent benefits. The management when I was there could have been better. Overall it wasn't a bad place to work.
good,"My typical day at work began with taking phone orders, account balances, the culture of the workplace was stiff, because of the high volume of calls.  The hardest part of the job too many leads telling you to do things differently.  The most enjoyable part of the job was learning about the trash industry."
good,"dusty and smelly, follow safety rules, cool work environment,some  team work, it gets very hot in the summer,break time and when its time to get off best part of tha day."
good,"very very dirty job , but you will make a pretty good living off the income provided from this company. Stressful at times but over all its good job security"
good,"Maintain and up keep of all fleet vehicles to keep running everyday. work on front loaders, roll offs, residential/rear loaders. repairs consist of changing parts, hydraulic hoses, minor electrical repairs."
good,Safety meeting given by non cdl holding managers. Learned that the harder i worked the more i was expected to do while others werent held to the same standard.
good,"Pay is good and so are benefits. Culture change is needed, a lot of negative vibes, little support from supervisors. Attendance policy needs to be revamped."
good,The great thing about Waste Management is that you can easily move up the ranks or be promoted if you work really hard. The bad thing is the lay-offs. It happens every year and it is really terrifying. The company is really cheap and have shareholders to keep happy so they're solution is layoffs.  I've been with the company 7 years and we have had lay off each year I have been here.
good,Very nice building and tight knit Senior Management team. fun days for employees and fast paced environment.  I don't see a lot of area or room to move up in the Procurement world here in the Waterloo office. Nice people but could pay better.
good,"Learned the basics here, have nothing bad to say. I was afforded the opportunity to learn a little about every facet of operations from the plant to on the road."
good,"Having Worked for Waste Management you will learn a lot about rules and regulations that is associated on the commercial side of the business. "
good,"There are some wonderful people working at WM, but the internal issues/struggles and management makes it difficult to enjoy your job. Turn over is high, not many are happy but they stay due to pay and benefits/insurance coverage. I wish is were better, I would have retired from WM."
good,Great Company doing great things but the wrong people leading the organization.  There is no room for growth at the location I worked in.
good,The training department needs better trainers but once you learn the position everything is ok.  The benefits are great.
good,Is an ok place to work. Could have done some things differently but was a relatively good job. Some employees could have been treated better with a lay off situation.
good,"Management was not supportive of sales staff.  Very operational focused."
good,I worked in a team dynamic which was horrible. The manager of the sales coordinators has NO idea how to properly manage a team because she was so busy trying to be everyone's friend. The adoption of the this leadership style only led to a destructive department.
good,"All days are pretty much the same. You show up, listen to a safety brief, load the company vehicle, get in and go. You learn little of the oil and gas industry and more of the processes of cleaning up the messes within it and that's it. The management staff is excellent if you know how to get along with them, though sometimes confusing and misleading often un or misinformed adding an extra level of difficulty. Also very tight nit as 3 of them are immediate family members. The crew leads don't count as management and are like some of the co-workers but with an edge of laziness to them and a bit of false pride in their title. The co-workers are really a hit or miss on any given day, they mostly talk and act like 16yr old teenage girls that pretend to know everything, so information from them is very unreliable. some days they work other days they dig for excuses or call off. abusing their privileges and making it harder for the rest of us. The hardest part of the job would would be coping with the supervisors misinformed and confusing list of directions given to the crews to go out in work, often ending up in inconvenient last minute changes and unprepared extended work days. You do not receive raises like informed in orientation, some in the field for 4+ years still making less then 15 or 16 dollars an hour, and the only room for advancement is when someone quits or is fired and even then it's seniority or favoritism or hiring someone from outside first instead of skill level or production quality. You only get 1 day off regardless of what you were told in orientation, and sometimes"

good,"•Insure safety around working areas."
good,"One route manager tells you to do one thing, and before you can even get started on that task, another route manager calls you to assign you another task. Many unhappy customers on routes. Was sent out one day to service a customer that was missed on normal route, was told by management it was a residential customer with a rolling hand cart.... WRONG!! it was a 2 yard container overflowing with maggot filled trash. Management instructed me to transfer (by hand) the trash from the container to the residential hand cart I took there to switch out. Oh, and I was hired as a roll off driver. Never did get to do what I was hired for. I self terminated myself..."
good,I love when I go out and start serving the customers.  I learn that every day we have to go out and drive safe. The hardest part of this job is that we have to service our customers on time some times because traffic .School or land field big lines.
good,"went out on short term disability, when healthy and recovered was let go due to my position was filled and I didn't have a job to go back to"
good,"Easy enough job, redundant paperwork and computer work."
good,"Remove and install tires, A/C and Air compressor, starters, brake chambers, brake shoes, slack adjusters, valve cover gaskets, pinion seals. Report all my work through Transman program."
good,No chance for growth. Bad management. Management didn't listen to dispatcher suggestions.
good,I have enjoyed the past eighteen years that I have worked for Waste Management and I do not want to give all the years I have put in back but I do not see myself going any farther in this company and I am not comfortable with the direction the company is going but over all I like my job.
good,"A typical day is research and project management activities.  I learned how to data mine, build relationships and influence without authority.  My co-workers are the best.  I love the team work environment and the sense of community at WM.  The hardest part of the job is not being able to touch each of my co-workers  when I need to, as they are remote.  However, I compensate by video, virtual or teleconferencing to resolve issues or talk about next steps.  The most enjoyable is delivering for the internal customer what they have laid out in the requirements of a project."
good,"the hardest part was conforming to the waste management way of doing things.  It was a job, not much enjoyment on picking up trash."
good,"I worked in the Energy Service Department and it was a newer division. They didn't quite have everything together and didn't have enough work for their workers. Benefits were good and so was compensation. No complaints on Waste Management, they just needed more work."
good,Call center atmosphere and applicant must be able to sit all day
good,"Taking inbound calls ,learned about all lines of the business. Management was very helpful and pleasant.We all acted as a team we all help one another. The Management team would give us lunches from time to time and have little games throughout the day"
good,"One call center to handle 3 or 4 counties which means hundreds and thousands of customers. On a busy day I would answer over 150 calls not to mention the calls that I would have return. I would take in payments, complaints, set up new customers etc. There  was 2 Managers 4 supervisors and like 5 leads. All making sure you where in your seat taking calls and if you were away from your desk they would know how long you were off the phone for. I did like it here for a short time. I left because they were not flexible and understanding of what was going on in your world."
good,"I work with a great crew.  "
good,"Transition is the motto at this company. Many consolidations to streamline business practices and save money. The stockholder  benefits from this theme. Great  benefits, pay, and attitude based on the ""corporate setting"".  This company is a place where one can make a career but it takes time."
good,"Always busy, learned more about my job title. Good Benefits"
good,"I loved what I did. Its always fun to meet new people. The management was garbage when I was leaving. The pay was very lousey. I picked up medical waste. We shared a warehouse with a terrible put together medical waste solutions company. Managed very badly. Someone was always on you about something that had nothing to do with your work ethic, or work. It was ran very badly and the main supervisor was just god awful."
good,"I do everything from electrical, hydraulic, welding, and driving."
good,"When I first started with this company, they seemed to really care about their employees, offering all kinds of perks and making an effort to make employees feel appreciated."
good,I supervised numerous employees  and assisted other supervisors with computer input.
good,A place with good employees that are focused on work.  Upper management expects entry level managers to make up the shortfalls of limited labor force.
good,"My major responsibilities here include"
good,"Would rather not say. This was not a pleasent experience, never the less a life changing experience."
good,"Productive fast paced environment. Sufficient tools provided for employee to get work done. Great place to work; however, the company is currently experiencing a transition period due to reogranization."
good,Le travail consistait a déservir des entreprises en ramassant les bacs de vidanges.
good,"stress full, good driving skills,superviser needs skill in leadership, co-workers are ok, the hardest is driving, engoyable is end of a work day."
good,"this job demands too many hours and time away from home, very little training, and management dont show any interest in caring about employees"
good,"I have been there for 11-years, great people to work with, great boss, i enjoy the early start time-3:00-A.M. The drivers are alot of fun . Very strick on safety, which is good, so we could go home safely."
good,A typical day at work would be to pick up 3- 7- tons of recycle from crubside. You were always up dated on new ideas and techniques.
good,This company was very loose and laid back. Working in an environment like this takes getting use to.
good,"I worked at 3 different locations in Minnesota, so I had a variety of staff and management to work with. I enjoyed the majority of my co-workers and managers, but had several conflicts due to my age (I was 20 when I started working there). I appreciated the ability to transfer between offices when different opportunities presented themselves."
good,"It's not a bad job, it's like any other job where it depends on management. Some sites have good management some bad. Other than that it's not a bad job, descent pay, good benefits."
good,i enjoyed my time here but unfortunately my boss at the time felt like she could try and harass me in ways i did not feel comfortable with so work environment was awkward at best
good,Great company to work for but it strict as heck. Recently they been doing crazy think he with the pay but beside that it great...never mind that pay is everything. I mean the pay is confusing but you make decent money
good,"Waste Management said on Monday it would buy smaller rival Advanced Disposal Services for about $3 billion, as the top waste management services provider looks to expand its footprint in the eastern United States."
good,My houres varied greatly and it was hard to plane appointments.  I started out getting a lot of overtime but we lost some accounts and my houres dropped a lot.
good,"I was employed by Waste Management as a recycle and front end loader driver in Marietta, Ga, USA, good company to work for, good people, good pay. They put me through my class b CDL, I worked there for two years, it was my first job in the USA after emigrating from the UK."
good,Culture between operators and pickers was amazing. Most of driver respect the hard work workers put in upper mgmt is caring and amazing. I would recon ya gone work there
good,Its was a little hard but fun also when you have help on the truck with you!!! It's totally different feeling from any other job!! Waste Management is as wonderful job
good,This company works you into late hours work more than you are suppose to when finishing your route they add more work to your schedule making you work longer hours
good,"My expirence at waste management it was easy.. i was working independent for the majority of time, when we got put  in groups to work they all team work. i learned how to do the bails grind the plastic.."
good,"would've been better to have better wages and an ASL route but Florida is a little behind in those areas, had the pay been better I would've stayed longer but now I'm moving to the midwest"
good,Assisted driver with loading waste onto truck on a designated daily route. Hard working job being a trash man great benefits but you had to be a truck driver
good,Work is exciting here because every required facility that enhance effective output is in place. Everyone is eager to do his best to earn extra bonus.
good,I would like to drive for waste management. I am a good driver. And with little training i know i could be one of their best drivers. If they are hiring for Drivers i would except it
good,"Direct Management was awesome. Work Time was rewarding. Was promised to keep my job and be hired on full time, was let go instead during the slower season."
good,"The issue are the same in every company, the lack of loyalty twards the the people that makes the company great. This was a good company to work for, but didn't take care of there own."
good,Typical day at work is servicing waste removal at all Waste management contract loads. Interaction with Waste Management customers by helping with all requests and needs due to waste services. Workplace management and culture has a satisfaction due to servicing the customer with a smile. Management has a Goal and communicates the importance of prime customer service. Most of all the job makes customers happy and satisfied with our service.
good,I once worked for the company and it had its benefits and it had its times when you would want to quit its jus like any other job. There is nothing really I can say .
good,"Great company to work for. Good benefits, decent pay, management did their job and seemed to care about the individuals. "
good,"typical day includes at least 50 to 75 calls from drivers, 75 to 100 emails answered from Sales Reps and National, routing over 300 tickets for drivers for the next day"
good,This job is more of a (just getting out of high-school type of job... the good thing is I got hired on the spot.... the bad thing is.... the work is very stressful and tiresome so you would expect a higher pay... but that wasn’t the case
good,It was not as bad but I have a preference of work that does not consist of taking that much heat.. the working conditions are horrible I could not drink enough the feeling of passing out every other day I would not wish on anyone
good,"Great company, sloppy training process. I believe they could develop a more stable and organized training process that could develop the employee into an amazing employee for the company. The drivers run the company and the managers do not have any power."
good,"Constant moving and lifting, work in any type of weather and it’s a 7 days a week job. All equipment must be purchased outta your own pocket. Learned new experiences thru the job overall a decent company."
good,long days expected to work crazy hours sometimes... poor management.
good,"At waste management, depending on how you get in the job your pay is not worth the work you put in to the job. Also it’s easy to get fired if your not on time or earlier. I had to be at waste management by 3:40 am and my schedule was from 4:00 am - 1:30pm and the manager had a rude attitude on daily basis"
good,Good employment friendly workers always willing to help u if u struggle they make sure your hydrated and keep energy give you breaks if you need one helpful
good,Overall good company to work for if your looking to start a career in disposal truck driving. Lots of opportunities to grow and learn the business. Largest disposal company in the world.
good,Okay to work at customers where always friendly and fun to talk to mgt. At times didn't care but work place is fast pace and hard work sometimes got off at 8 at night depening on holidays
good,"I spent 10 years at Waste Management and loved them all, I had to leave because I returned to school and my work schedule could not be flexible. I learned new things all the time. The Recycling industry is very interesting."
good,"It was  was good to work in dulsco and I have spend a great time with my crew ."
good,"Fast past hands an eyes steady moving watching out for multiple things."
good,"It's like clockwork. You, like people all over the world, go through a drawn-out interview process, vetting and getting vetted for weeks to determine the right fit, and then you finally agree to terms. After you're hired, things look promising, and there's a buzz of excitement in the air as you meet new co-workers and dive into a sexy project."
good,"Hardest job anyone can do. "
good,"The corporation restructured the position I was in. The position was moved from Edmonton to the United States. It was a great place to work. Company benefits, vacation, location and parking was great. Loved working with the customers."
good,Dont get caught slipping with drivecam but benefits are awesome pay good depends on you if you a go getter or not but just be prepared to work 50 plus hours
good,"The pay is decent, the managment is ok, the benefits are great, but the hours will kill you. You have no time to get home and sleep and start all over. No time for dinner barely. The hours are too long per day."
good,The company was a steppingstone for my future career plans. I needed a respectable occupation to gain business experience. I am glad that I was able to find success and balance school with my work responsibilities.
good,"When you start you get a 3-5 week training class which helps out dramatically.  After that you're thrown to the wolves.  Managers and supervisors are always in meeting with no help from other peers as they are on the phones.  All calls are monitored, recorded and scored.  If you do not meet metrics to they standards, forget about advancement or even employment."
good,"It was an OK job I learned a lot and gained experience if I didn't have to relocate I would have stayed longer "
good,My work experience  with work management they didn't hire many ppl wastes management also people was getting hurt and they don't give no payrise they didn't care if u have emergency
good,Long days and hard work in the gas field but all together it was a great experiences and better benefits. Management looked for work and we all tried our best to make money and be friendly to the environment
good,"Working for this company has offered me some of the greatest work related experiences, I have ever had, the only problem one would come across is the fact that we work a minimum ten hour day which is also a six day week."
good,A day at Waste Management is fairly relaxed. The relaxation creates an easy work environment but also creates a lack of communication. The hardest part of the job is having minimal training on tasks that are asked to be completed. Management can also be very unprofessional and inconsistent in company policies.
good,I like working here until recently been a lot of changes for the better but been hearing alot how were not doing the job right and we should be doing it like this and then when u vent a issue seems to be just past along like it's nothing
good,"This was a great office environment and location.  Most of the people were friendly and helpful.  There was access to the downtown tunnel, which I loved!"
good,"I worked for Waste Management for almost 3 yrs, and was offered a better opportunity to work. I would go back in a heart beat. I enjoyed working for this company."
good,WM is a good place to work for the people who want to work just for working hours. It is a very healthy place to work for as it has all the facilities for an employee to work.
good,"All customers have unlimited accounts meaning that they can throw away as much trash as they want every week and you are required to collect it all. Very fast-paced. Trucks are complete junk. 2003-2005 models. They break down all the time, making your day longer and harder. Dispatch is always adding extra stops to your route and the route manager rides your back. The pay and benefits are pretty good $18.50 an hour. If you can handle the stress from dispatch, route manager, traffic and below par trucks than its not that bad of a job.  Everyday starts at 4am. Weekends off except for after a holiday then you work the following Saturday at 2am."
good,i need to make more for area job located in so i can live here. they also have not given me anything but quarter raises. but will give u a bonus. so that is a plus
good,"Cleaning up garbage making sure everything was up to code and removing materials that did not belong in certain area of the facility, was decent while i worked there but all the fumes were too much for me."
good,The overtime is not at will and is mandatory. Some days work over 12 hours and expected even more. Some days I would punch out and not get paid for the overtime I worked
good,"Hard work , long days but good vacation time off, good health, dental, vision,  insurance.  Good pay start out with raises yearly. Customer appreciation on holidays for your service to them."
good,It was a good company to work for.   Pay was a little low.    I only chose to leave when they were down sizing.  Now I wish I would have stuck it out.
good,"Develops and interprets organizational goals, policies and procedures, and updates project plans as needed. "
good,"Good work atmosphere, physically aggressive, friendly environment, good management, flexible schedules, great pay, good benefits, room for advancement"
good,job was a good one good pay liked every min of it for the most part it was always something diff when you went into the land fill job was easy but people never run outta trash
good,My job consisted of repairing compactors and front end containers. I also welded on the trucks doing various welding tasks. I welded new floors in front end trucks and repaired tarp systems on roll off trucks.
good,A typical day was ok with a lot of tasks at hand learning different fields of jobs. The work was steady and some changes as well overall pretty good and fulfilling.
good,"This company uses up their salaried employees. Long days, not a very good work/home split. Lots more time spent at work than at home. The compensation was good, but not good enough to stay."
good,The company is generous but does not pay helpers well.  It is hard to advance without a drivers license.  Good hours. People are nice.  Drivers are lazy.
good,From my experience at Waste Management is that once you’re accepted you’re going to have a great time but you are always feeling down because of the bosses
good,"If it wasn't for the people I worked with I probably wouldn't have been there as long as I was."
good,I worked a temporary position during the summers and school breaks for two years.  I  did not pursue a full time position upon graduation because my degree was not in same field as my temporary position.
good,good place to work i would still be there if it wasn't for me health. Management was very thoughtful and considerate when i stepped in to resign there were no hard feelings
good,"Typical work day, however, the company had limited drivers and the trucks needed multiple repairs. Expected to work fast but safe. Some of the commercial property accounts were not located in lighted areas."
good,"Team environment is friendly and engaging. Management of employee support is poor, lack of communication on updates or changes in regulation. Poor planning on customer impact."
good,The job was OK but i feel i was under paid. The employee's and managers was great. Handled any situation professional. The company was full of veterans that you could learn a lot involving the company.
good,"WM is the Industry Giant and tends to be very innovative in solving clients Waste needs. Very fast paced environment. If one is flexible and willing to work in dusty areas, the money is good."
good,"Waste management is a fine company  with benefits  and stock purchase I like the working hours are fix you don’t work pass 5:30 pm, people are friendly ."
good,"hard working fun at times "
good,"Manager are selfish, hardest part of the job was when I had to finish other peoples route because they couldn't handle it."
good,The business goes in cycles - they grow and add a lot of people and then trim back and cut a lot of people. These cycles are about 10years long - so just be aware of when you join.
good,"Waste Management was a great place to work for five years, however advancement opportunities were very minimal. The money was great and bonus structure had me all smiles. Commercial sales was a great department."
good,"If working through the temp. agency the pay is less. it Is hard labor, but comes with many hours so overtime comes often. management was great. the workplace culture is not to social. and the most enjoyable part of the job was the continuous opportunities to get overtime."
good,I was told my job was permanent but it wasn't.  I thought that was rather inappropriate and underhanded.  I was released from work after only four months on the job without notice.
good,This company is very fast paced and requires you to be customer focused and safety focused. The work is not hard. Babysitting drivers all day can be stressful. Didn't know how much customers cared about their trash until I started working for the company
good,"The management staff were not available for low staffing, extensive routes which became a stressful and busy position. During the summer months trucks would break down more frequently which made for longer days in the heat without the staff needed to perform daily duties."
good,Recent changes have created a sense of favoritism among management and some employees. The pay scale has changed for new hires and employees with seniority and more knowledge and experience make less than new hires yet still expected to carry a heavier work load and train new hires.
good,Its a great company just make sure your family is ok with you working so many hours. Working 70 hours a week is not family friendly.  I love my job but raising my grand it make it tough.  Routes are long and we need to start earlier but they wont as the RMs and dispatchers dont want to come in that early
good,Waste Management provides opportunity for employees to advance their careers and pursue promotions. managers were supportive and provided positive work environment.
good,"It is a fun place to work you are constantly moving, you do get to wear headphones and listen to your own music. However it can get really smelly and gross."
good,fast work place safety long days pushing trash lunch was the best part of the day work was six days a week very fast work place it was hard all day ever day
good,"never got into the always going to a different state ,pumped lagoons like behind excel plants and spread in fields and rode in tractors and a lot of semis as a passenger"
good,Great opportunities well respected people willing to help you fast pace days go by fast always new things to learn crane forklift managers willing to train
good,A typical day is just getting to work make sure you have all the safety equipment they provide you. I learned how to use an air gun and how to properly use a harness
good,I learned what it meant to be strong mentally and physically. Didn't know management.  Get the job done and safely Picking up trash when it was raining and it was 90 degrees outside. The most enjoyable part of the job when I got off..
good,Long and rushed days.  Management expectations were not always reasonable. I learned to rush through tasks while trying to be as safe as possible. The hardest part of my job was not knowing when I would be getting off because of the amount of work given to me. The most enjoyable part of my job was my teammates.
good,a real good place to be employed at  the hours are a luttle hard to get used to especially with a family but it can be done  great co workers and management was pretty decent
good,It was an okay job just requires you to do other things aside From driving the truck like becoming a hopper. Hopping isn’t for everyone and they should have separate positions for those who only want to drive.
good,"I haven't worked there an a very long time I can't really say much about it.I was young around about 18/19 "
good,"My day at work involves customer service, answering phone calls, scheduling service for clients, assisting in finding answers for clients questions and concerns."
good,Simply ready for a career change do not have anything negative to say I am ready to do move on and do something that  matches my education and professional expereince
good,"Garage is badly maintained, work environment is not the best when u work under all kinds of weather. Parts not in stock when needed to complete jobs or assignments"
good,It was a great job.  I wish things would have went better so I didn’t have to quit the job. But overall it was a great job and I wish I could go back .
good,"I enjoyed my time with this company however their management style was very inappropriate at times.  They were previously a small town company with a handful of private investors before they were purchased by Waste Management, and were very inappropriate by today's HR standards."
good,"-	Excellent Data entry skills "
good,This was a up and down type of job that calls you back as needed typically in the summer time. When you work in the cold they need you to of course prepare for  all types of weather conditions
good,"it was an okay job i really enjoyed how they feed us and made sure we were okay. Some days were really long while some days it was short, staff was willing to help us learn/"
good,This is a good company to grow with but it is a large corporation and with that comes the multiple managers and micro-managing.  The company does pay well and the on site managers are great.
good,throwing garbage all day (10-12 hr days) on huge routes with minimal pay and only 30 min lunch breaks. Rain sleet or snow you have to be out there and they encourage you to work on the weekends.
good,My time at waste Management I've learned a great deal of things that can help me with future Employers. The thing I liked most about to he job I that you get full benefits and paid every week.
good,it was a fun place to work. the people were cool to work with. the bosses didnt really appreciate us much though. but overall it was a great experience.
good,"I’ve been working at WM for a little while now and it seems to be a nice environment. Friendly people, somewhat flexible management and nice cafeteria. There are some paid holidays and good vacation/personal time. They do have you pass knowledge checks during training and a final exam, so pay attention. Pay is every Friday. I would love to see their training improve a bit. My class was a bit rushed and unorganized. They lay a good foundation for customer service, but more focus on the customer experience would be great. Overall, nice place to start your career. Lots of room to grow and advance."
good,Work at a steady pase was self started every day. You get to work at your own pace.  If you stay at a good pace and finish on time they will give you bonuses
good,The site I worked for in the mountains of Colorado stayed busy and seemed to be trying to make the waste collection as problem-free as possible. We were encouraged to support the recycling options. Customer Service was a high priority.  A lot of people have been and will stay here for a long time.
good,"Decent place to work sometimes can be challenging due to corporate politics, this is not a place for technically challenging projects, good pay, everything else is just ok."
good,a typical day really depended on the weather on cold and rainy days it was cutthroat the wind chills was hard so you had to dress for the weather the managers was great people to work with the smells wasn't to free all the time but great work experience.
good,"A good place for entry level workers to gain knowledge and experience but if you want a higher or more competitive compensation, you have to look outside of WM."
good,They're okay job they're pretty good benefits now I work for them through a temp agency back in the day so I have never really work for the company itself but I have work through a temp agency work driving their equipment so
good,"The pay can be better, not a lot of room for growth. Over all the benefits are great and the company is great. I wish it was more room for growth... .."
good,answer incoming calls. Respond to customer email.  scheduled container exchange. train new employees. handle billing inquiry and locate missing payments
good,"Normal 9-5 job. Ok job security and benefits. I left because I started a family in Forks, Washington. Not a whole lot else to say about the job......."
good,Poor management is the reason alot of people leave. They pay you a nice amount to start but its very hard to get more money. Even when you move up they dont want to pay you more. The best part about the job is the benefits.
good,I believe that this company is very well at what they do but i just thin that their safety and regulations aren't enforced as they should be and they just care about numbers.
good,Had to do crub side residential trash pick up. Road to to dumb sites to unload trash.Long hours bad weather conditions rain sleet or snow. Had make the best out of the job just was thankful have one .
good,"Steady work"
good,"start work day at 6:30 am, we stand on the line to sort out the garbage waste, its a diverse work place people from all ethnic backgrounds, we seem to all get along , very easy going but strenuous work environment. the hardest part of the job is standing for long periods of time. I enjoy when I get a break"
good,"working at this place was fine. Fellow workers were easy to get along with.  steady rate of pay, competive salary in industry.  Very physically demanding"
good,"Over all is a good company to start a career, since they hire without experience,  but at the same time eveeybody doesn't have the privilege of getting trained for other lines of businesses.  And employees with experience are hired directly for other positions,  while a lot of good employees spend years throwing bulks of trash behind a Rear End Loader garbage truck. Plua, the routes are so big and the rules are so many that good employees can be terminated at any day, no matter how many years of hard work and dedication for the company.  "
good,"can't use your bluetooth or the CB can be suspended for it. Watch your speed. Maintain at least a 4 second following distance, if you don't you can be wrote up."
good,"Okay, work environment. Some of Management is not professional. But other than that the job itself isn’t bad...employees are friendly. Paid holidays off."
good,overal with my time with waste management i enjoyed the experiment and the things i have learned  i have learned how to be more of a a team player and tought me patience
good,"Waste Management was a good company to work for. Unfortunately it's so large your years of service are forgotten when new management teams take over, and you can easily fall threw the cracks, and have your position eliminated."
good,completing work orders and ordering parts was first thing . Staff meeting getting marching orders.hardest part of job was having to fire someone . nothing really enjoyable all stressful
good,No comment at this time.  I do not wish to submit my review of this company at this time.  Nothing to add.  Nothing to share. Not willing to submit a review at this time.
good,Managers are treated like door mats. The employees have more authority than a manager. front line managers are expected to make the employees happy at any cost to themselves. The company has taken employee engagement principals to an extreme that interferes with the proper operation of the company.
good,management dopiest care about employees only bottom line and there bonuses . then transfer in new managers and systems change and back stabbing . good guys bad management
good,"Again, I do not wish to provide a rating or summary about a previous employer "
good,"Though a better training program could have been in place, once the knowledge is gained to perform your role, it can be a great company to work for and the pay is very well."
good,"Enjoyed my employment there. Salary and benefits are excellent and the work is hard but easy enough depending on what you are doing. Unless you're in dispatch, women have a more difficult time moving up."
good,Waste management was a good place to work  they work well as a team. Pays well lots of hours to work.  Great benefits and good working  environment .Crazy hours  work at a  good paste
good,"A typical work day for me a requires focus, attention to surroundings, utilizing safety protocols & being able to communicate with your driver. The most important information I learned is how to overcome a variety of challenges on the job. I make it my business that I learn not only my job but also the Driver/Supervisor position because I'm in the process of being a Driver/Supervisor in the near future. Work place culture is about completing job goals, following instructions, teamwork , meeting deadlines and to satisfy customers that use our service. The hardest part of the job is that not knowing what type of situation you are going to come across on a route. The most enjoyable part of the job is having a day without incident."
good,"In an ideal world, people would be equal in rights, opportunities, and responsibilities, despite their race or gender. In the world we live in, however, we constantly face all kinds of neglect based on different attributes. All over the world, certain people treat others with prejudice because of particular features they possess. Unfortunately, this happens even in places which, by definition, should be free of all personal prejudices—specifically, in offices and other business surroundings. This phenomenon is called workplace discrimination; not every unfair behavior at work, however, can be assessed as discrimination."
good,"You start your day doing your pre trip, then go out and service customers. At end of the day you would empty out your truck in the landfill then you would do your post trip inspection on truck."
good,"if you want to make some money its a great place to work. great benefits all around,the company takes care of its employees. now if your the time that loves to have a life, this company is not for you. 60-67 hrs a week 3am start 630pm off. off every sunday and one weekday off. you will not work mon-fri until 3-5 years with the company. work, eat and sleep will become the normal life for you. my advice make your money then move around...but if you dont care about family time or having a life its a great company...over its the cream of the crop. waste managment is the top dog but will work you like a dog...you wont have a life"
good,"Challenging, ever changing atmosphere. Very busy with a mix of qualified employees. Lacked vehicle specific training. Lacked management of operators. ..."
good,Ok job....it was brief but I enjoyed the work...if you dont mind the trash and smell it's a pretty decent opportunity...me personally I rather drive the trucks...
good,it's a good place to work. but has issues like all other jobs. the only things is that you never know what time you get off. an you can't plan time with family
good,Its was an alright job just to many rules and they don't focus on the drivers point of view but want to tell you what to do all of the time and not listen to you.
good,A typical day is sitting in front of the computer. Checking emails. Trucks come in hour by hour and you log in their information to dispose of the garbage then print them a completion ticket for all their hard work. Some transaction through credit and sitting the whole day waiting for trucks to come by.
good,"Nice place to work, the employees are hard workers, Overtime is available. Management is completely corporate atmosphere. Management can be empathic when staff is in a crisis."
good,It's was actually good I got a position there until I went back to school but it's good money only if you can actually get the job and you have to wake up extra early
good,"Come in early, stay late, work on your weekend off and don't expect a well-deserved raise."
good,Waste Management is a hard laboring job with not enough pay.  I would recommend the job to someone who does not mind to much hard labor in all kind of weather.
good,"The company provided a good amount of training. After that, however, there was not much support given on the floor. The hardest part of the job was not having enough information when new procedures were implemented. This made it difficult to serve the customer."
good,"The upside is being able to help customers in need, especially the older folks. The pay was excellent and the co-workers were good people. The downside was management, the way they took care of their employees, equipment, lack of knowledge on day to day operations, and the hours. I liked that we had weekends off, but not everything is open on the weekends, so it made it hard to make it to doctor appointments, etc."
good,"Multiple tasks and hard to accomplish for one person, even though you want to do it time just is against you. Diversified tasks which I love, just wish the load was more evenly distributed and fair."
good,A great work place where you get to interact with people. Great benefits for you and your family positions where you can only move up in due time. Would never turn this job down
good,Its very challenging didnt have any trainning skills management!..no organizations no since of direction scheduling problems. Equipment needed alot of work.
good,"It's a call center environment, the turnover is huge. It can be a good company to work for but typical Corporate enviroment, good benefits and vacation."
good,"good place to start your career, pay is not as high as other companies in the industry, but education and training are best in the industry.  good place to start."
good,Worked both in the field and corporate environments.  Both exhibited a very nice work culture.  Networking a must as  one could not simply rely on great work to guarantee advancement.  Departments were constantly being absorbed or repurposed.
good,Fun place to work but not necessarily a place to start a career.  Especially if you have a quantitative major in college.   All of the people who work there are pleasant and welcoming
good,"Overtime available, many opportunities to work extra hours.  Diverse co-worker community. Benefits are not great, no paid time off offered to full time employee."
good,This was very short experience as I just consulted and help hire and train sales force.And did out of my home. However did enjoy meeting a lot of nice people.
good,"Too preoccupied with making trucks high tech, ie.  on board computors, and camera inface to watch your every move. Not competitive. Lost 80% of business over last 10 years. Create atmosphere of distrust and resentment. Write you up and keep you on edge if you have job from day to day. nonsense procedural rules that hamper operations."
good,I had to work for more thank 6 months to get hired in. Certain individuals did not have to wait that long. no African American in a prime position. no
good,"This was a great place to work, the environment was fun and energetic. The only negative was that they did everything by the book there was no room for interpretation."
good,"Great people at WM, some of the best people I have ever known I met while I was working at WM. Excellent brand, they are a recycling industry leader. Customers who aren't under contracted pricing get 20% price increases every year. These customers then break their contracts with WM, and the salespeople are penalized financially for these losses. WM runs lean, multiple RIFs over the past decade has decreased the layers in their sales organization making it extremely difficult to advance upward."
good,"answering irate members, trying to resolve trash related issues."
good,"It was a very fast paced environment that taught me a ton of things. I worked there for 10 years and learned to comfortably navigate AS400, Excel, Microsoft Word, V-lookups etc. It was an inbound/outbound call center where we would deal with customers on a daily basis to collect past due amounts, educate the customer about their trash service while providing great customer service and correct any errors on the accounts pertaining to receivables. For example, credits, debits, adjustments, write offs etc."
good,"Management didn't care, but the overall company experience was nice and the employees were amazing."
good,if you follow instructions you will always have job no type of rain outs as long as you stay busy they will never send you home when working here everyone does all kinds of jobs
good,the hours are awesome and the route managers work with you always.   There is never a day when you have to not get hours.   It is great if you like to go to work and only see your boss 2-3 times a day.
good,"My time at Waste-Managment was some of the hardest work I've done. It was good pay, good hours. Work depended on how hard you worked. Reason for leaving Waste-Management is honestly because I wanted better for myself."
good,What can I say. Enjoyed working for Waste Management. worked there for 10 years. Good benefit good wages and pretty good work hours. I would recommend it.
good,Good company to work for in an entry level customer service position.  I have not worked there in about 15 years and I feel that I am no longer qualified to review the company.
good,"Good company, too many hours for salaried employees.  Work too many weekends, 10-14 hours a day.  I didn't agree to work every other weekend and manage remote locations."
good,"Job requires a lot of physical work, must be able to read maps, learn time management, the ability to constantly get in and out of the truck over sometimes 1,000, times a day."
good,"customer service job, the manager tried hard to make sure that we were all happy in our positions, my co workers were good people ready to help if needed."
good,I worked as a scale operator. Pay was good but not worth getting sick all of the time from lack of movement (sat for 11 hours a day)and environment was very dusty.
good,"come in do daily inspection report on vehicle, proceed to route and collect refuse or recycled materials, at end of day take truck to refuse or recylcle plant to empty truck"
good,Waste management is very unorganized in the can shop the management over there is horrible. We never have materials needed to conduct our jobs properly.
good,"this place is no fun to work and management sucks. the only management that that is valid at this place, is the management in the name of the company."
good,"Performed PCMS on company vehicles prior to driving to location, upon arrival confirmed safety gear and equipment to be used on selected assignment.Transferred liquids to/from designated areas, corrected potential hazards before implementing set procedures and safety precautions. Inspected crew members and vehicles for PPE, appropriate identifications and certifications."
good,Work was hot and heavy in the summer months and cold and boring in the winter. things have changed so much since i worked there that i really should not be reviewing this branch of the city
good,Worked hard to move from front line to management. The company is good at recognizing and developing talent. There is a disconnect though between front line management and corporate.
good,WM is a great place to work! There are many opportunities to learn various lines of the business while working alongside a team of great people! The company offers competitive benefits and the opportunity to have a good work/life balance.
good,my time their was great it was a wonderful experience for me because that was friendly work place.being there you were family and the bosses where great to work for I was happy for them giving me a chance.
good,"Work with persons of various ethnically diverse backgrounds and physical disabilities.Environment is positive and is where safety comes first. All treated equal."
good,"Made good money and had great benefits.  Drive cameras in trucks, easy job to get fired from.  Tons of bosses. Employees get a year end bonus in November,  a visa gift card for $25. All the bosses and supervisors get a bonus in November as well, a check for  $50,000.  They also get a new truck every year. Good place to work as a supervisor i suppose."
good,"Good company, great benefits, upper management not very knowledgeable of whats going on. Never return phone calls, and if you have to go out on medical leave, they leave you high and dry"
good,J'aime faire beaucoup d'heure j'ai pas peur de travailler et apprendre de nouvelles chose
good,"A typical day can be exciting and sometimes difficult for a mechanic, you never know what you'll be doing from one moment to the next. Refuse trucks have many complicated systems, they can be challenging to diagnose, but rewarding to repair. The other mechanics and managers have upbeat, yet diverse personalities, which make the work environment appealing."
good,start my day of early worked all kinds of weather with long hours a sometimes weekends. hardest part I had to deal with is the truck itself. wasn't always in good working order.
good,"Worked at WM as Parts Manager, had a positive relationship with other staff and mechanics. Only problem I had was with my supervisor. The supervisor was angry, hot tempered and mean. He bullied the mechanics and myself daily. I was able to do my job and shoulder the burnt of his 'dictatorship attitude' for over a year. Unfortunately, head-office sent down a layoff notice and three people were let go, one mechanic, one welder and myself. I was not upset by the layoff, rather relived that I wouldn't have to work with RM again."
good,A typical day consist of closing billing tickets and entering them into Access for reports.  Run reports  Answering emails.  Calling the customer for payment.
good,This is a good paying company with great benefits. If your a recycle driver start time is about 6:00-7am start. Depending on your shift and location your working at. There is a high turnover rate for managers. Co-workers are ok just a lot of immature drama talk.
good,there was not much to learn or how to progress with this company. i work with a nice bunch of people who makes the time go by a lot faster.
good,"Work was hard, great job, very dirty industry. Work and drive requirements were set very high for some individuals and not so high for others. You can have amazing evaluations and be ""top of the class' and still get overlooked"
good,a fast pace environment to get truck on the road to accomplish the job. new technology on natural gas. had to work will with management for we can have enough truck to run the routes. worked will with co workers and we had family BBQ be because we spent more time at work then with family. working in side of the hoppers with the garbage it smell bad at times. learning new things every day with new trucks
good,Working on a convener Belt sorting through garbage. most enjoyable part was cleanup at 230pm. and fridays were shorter. hardest part is reaching the pick count that you have to do.
good,"Early start time, 12-14 hour days, customer service, dedicated routes, strict rules to follow, Hardest party of my job is staying fit and driven, I have learned Self Respect and great Customer Service, Management is Office work only not out in the field they are more worried about there bonuses"
good,"cool ly learns and applies new information and methods to work in assigned area"
good,"able to have every other weekend off."
good,"Great company, but the work load is way to heavy for this job. Long hours and can never get caught up with the required task."
good,Worked a year and a half and it was a great schedule to work 8am-5pm. The benefits are great and you can get easily involved in other areas.
good,"Attention to detail is highly required. Interactions with many different groups of people: Employees at different sites, Customers, Vendors"
good,"A great place to work, with good people  to work with. good compensation, however not a great vacation plan. Poor compensation for medical leave."
good,Fun to work with the employees. easy to relate to. Management unaware of what is happening on floor. Agents need more training and coaching on sales objectives and to meet sales quotas..
good,"I started early mornings, Monday through Saturday, pre-tripped my vehicle and headed safely out to the route to service customers. I collected recyclables curbside & delivered bins when necessary.  Upon completion of the route, I disposed of the recycled materials at the disposal site. It helped to keep me in good shape."
good,WM is a fair employer.  The company has a benefits package many people find useful.  There are many challenging positions available.
good,"Good salary, great working environment good managers except for one."
good,"Great building and location, typically everything is on one floor. Unfortunately there was a mass layoff option that came into place after a few years of me working there for salaried employee's. The hourly employee's were fine but they did give a great package if you volunteered to leave."
good,"WM is a great company with good benefits and advancement, but the work / life balance is not balanced.  WM employees often have to choose career over family."
good,"Outside Sales "
good,"I worked here for one year in an operational management trainee program and am pleased overall with my experience. My boss took my professional development goals seriously, and I was given many opportunities to prove my value. When I did good work, kudos were given. When I made a mistake, I was given patience and a lesson learned was the focus. "
good,management was only worried about their bonuses and not the employees. And was asked to repair and fix things even if we did not have the correct parts to do so and would leave us to make unsafe work habits.
good,There never was a typical day at waste management each day brought  new challenges @ rewords.One thing i learned at wast management was anyone can be good but if you don't have a good strong team you will never be great.The management  there was some of the best i ever worked with personally for me.I  really got along good with my co worker thought we had good moral in the work place.I think the hards part of the job was i tried to exceed all expectations of my co workers.My most enjoyable part of the job was working together to complete a common goal.
good,This is a basic position based off queue tickets and escalated emails.  Management is OK however does give the feeling of uncertainty amid constant change.
good,This job can get tough at times due to all of the lifting of garbage that takes place.And you don't have a set time to get off of work its whenever an issue comes up or when you're done with your tasks. No set times.
good,The days are usually long and very tiring.  I usually would work 12-14 hours a day.  I would work in all different kinds of weather environments.
good,"-Cold called 20-25 business a day."
good,I  really liked working doing the job I had . I knew pretty much what to    expect . i  did around 10 - 15 cans in the morning pending if the paint man or welder needed my help for some other project. we worked as a team and i was shown i was well needed being the wash man. i took pride in my work and i love being part of the crew .
good,"I worked 12hr.days. I leard to operator Front end Loader and Baler  .The management was fair.Co.workers were the best, The hardest part of the job leaveing.I enjoy my job"
good,Great balance of work and life. They are concerned with the quality of life you have while employed.
good,"Besides the long hours and being very under staffed, the job itself wasn't too bad. Had a lot of respect for management, their door was always open. I'm just a strong family oriented person, and the 14 hour days got to me after a while."
good,I have been on medical leave since June 25th and will be released after a couple more doctor appointments for return to work date of 12/1/14-Since I have been out more than 12 weeks I will not have a job upon returning. That is the only reason that I am leaving Waste Management due to no other positions open at this time. I have enjoyed my 8 years with this company.
good,Loved working to help the environment but the company needs some help.
good,"Service Industry"
good,This company will always be here. I answer phones and process accounts in between calls. You learn a lot on the job and the co workers are very knowledgeable.
good,This is too much work in a dirty environment for the amount of oay received.
good,"Higher then normal turnover of employees for even this industry, management was usually confused as to which direction to take the call center. Nothing in writing to give direction."
good,"Go to rigs and haul off drill cuttings, deliver lime/trash boxes.  Learned how to run a roll off truck. Management has a difficult time communicating with drivers. My co-workers are nice people and helpful. Hardest part of the job is not knowing where your going and trying to follow a map in a semi.  Most enjoyable part is working by myself."
good,Work life balance is good. Co-workers are helpful. Learned salesforce.
good,Co-workers were very into gossip. Hardest part of my job was taking calls other agents had messed up or had broken promises to the customer. Most enjoyable part was the supervisor's as they really looked after you.
good,An day loading an garbage truck is far from easy. Enduring the weather of all season
good,sorting through trash being careful on the machines that you use daily.
good,Not a bad place to work if you are looking for plenty of hours and a management that is willing to give you all the overtime you would want.
good,Responsible for collection of outstanding debt for major business
good,Great company to work for. I would refer this company to someone looking for employment.
good,just a job that paid the bills it was hard work but the co workers were fun to be around and great team players i enjoyed making money
good,"Days were long and could be prevented with better maintained equipment and better staffing.  Great people to work with, very team oriented."
good,Great company love the hours and pay but did not like the fact that the supervisors do not work together
good,"•une journée de travail typique"
good,Great place. I enjoyed it. Good co worker and great boss. I learned a lot. Working as a team is my strong point
good,i didnt work here for very long so i cant really say much about the work place and how the company is
good,"A typical day assisting customer"
good,Company with aggressive goals and programs.  Becoming more and more centralized to Corporate office in Houston.
good,"Waste Management employees are encouraged to set the bar for customer service and account management. I learned to utilize my multi-tasking and negotiable skills to schedule hundreds of truck, train and container ship loads across the globe. In addition to my regular daily tasks, I was the only representative in my office to cover not one but both of my supervisors desks while they were out of the office on sick or vacation leave. The hardest part of my job was the very narrow possibility of advancement. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with a fun and diverse group of which many I remain close with to this day."
good,My typical day. was setting up fences an keeping the landfill liter free. I learned that cleanliness is a lot of work at a landfill. I manage to stay motivated daily. although I worked alone most days I had very few co-workers which made my day fairly easy. the hardest part was trying to maintain the property in bad weather. the most enjoyable part was when I had projects I had to do that day.
good,This was promised as a full time job because of the sale of Kipp Refuse to Waste Management they used us to set up route from the Kipp Refuse company and then myself and three brother go when they had the routes set.
good,"If you would like to have room to expand in a company; this is it. Waste has a lot of work available, and you can learn port-a-potties too!"
good,Company was going through a downsizing and morale will highly affected.
good,"This is a great company to invest in and be apart of if you are on a management level or consulting. However as a Project Specialist, under the umbrella of Customer Service, there are many obstacles and ""politics"" that are present and make it difficult to advance. The environment is more of a who you know and not what you know. I chose to move on once I realized there was no longer advancement opportunities for me without ""playing the games"" associated with moving forward within the company. Typical day was to come in and gather information to respond to escalated corporate issues. Those issues were the result of missed deliveries, pick ups, billing and corporate project rollouts."
good,An evolving organization especially in Supply Chain management.
good,"hot, messy, undesirable"
good,This company is in the waste industry. Hours start at 5 am and can last until 6 pm; depending on the amount of volume of trash being dumped at the transfer station.
good,"Fast paced environment."
good,Nothing special.  Punch in Punch out.  Is trash service what else would you expect.
good,"operated forklift for unloading and loading containers, learned how to grade plastic for recycling and retail. worked in a team with very hard working co workers in a safe  working environment."
good,"Not a good place to work with 4 different unions."
good,This position only lasted a short period of time. I worked in the billing department while I was their.
good,Work hours and work load are reasonable creating a stress free work enviroment.
good,"Great place to work the short time I was there. Got offerd a front load resi-driver position within a month. Didnt have much time to learn the route or get full training before my ride along with the supervisor. The day of the ride along I was really nervous and distracted from driving and struck a overpass. No one was hurt some damage to the truck. Needless to say I was fired over the incident, but I wish I had more training and a chance to learn the route before being placed on it. Overall I did enjoy my job and was doing really well besides that one mistake. Life goes on you learn from your mistakes,  take it with pride and continue to do your best, I would love to have a second chance because I have never failed at anything."
good,The best part of the job was finishing your daily tasks in a timely manner.
good,Expected to get a lot of work done in a quick manner. Coworkers were nice and helpful however no rewards or comments when goals were reached.
good,"Waste management is an excellent company to work for,good pay,good benefits,always had 40 hour,I myself lost interest in the job,every day was a good day at the site I enjoy the men I work with.As for their supervision it is a different supervision than I,am used to on construction job."
good,"Worked good amount of hours for good pay, too much work for the two of us who worked the job."
good,Trash to gas is an interesting technology and is sometime difficult to deal with.
good,"Good place to work, good balance but limited opportunities to be promoted"
good,"Based on nature of environment it is difficult to maintain a clean work environment however, the company makes every effort to maintain a health safe work environment."
good,"This job is phically demanding, and dirty. Its dusty, and loud constantly, long hours for low pay."
good,"typical work day, is customer retention, and satisfacation. Have learned different negotiation tools as well for the Waste industry."
good,"started at 4 a.m. was usually off by 2 p.m. inspect my truck check all tires, and fluids.Recieved paper work from superviser.The best was the people I worked with, and the customers I met."
good,"A typical work day consists of clocking in, checking truck out, firing up on board computer, leave yard and start on route, pick up waste from all active customers on route, return to yard, weigh and dump waste, fuel and post trip truck, sign off computer, sign all paper work, clock out and go home."
good,Waste manage is ok to work for.
good,"All trash haulers typically start pretty early in the morning, usually before the sun is up."
good,"Great place to work and develop your craft. Waste Management is a company that is changing the way it does business, by turning its focus towards more sustainable practices."
good,just a job. they give good benefits though. you do get paid weekly so that is nice
good,Hard physical work in bad equipment. Good customers with decent customer service.
good,nice work flow great managnemet Great working environment
good,met many creative and dedicated folks. Decentralized operations can create tensions and goal detours.
good,Great people to work with and great upward mobility opportunities.
good,"Learned all aspects of account management, from generating new leads to account retention."
good,"Great guys I work with in our small site, rout mgr is great to all except mgmt above that level... And another wage freeze.. not sure about that"
good,"Reviewing all waste streams for Eli Lilly and entering into a reporting system. Making sure all information is entered correctly by a QC process following the entry. All must be entered and returned to the customer in a timley manner. The hardest part of the job is a -0- error rate expected on all data entry, there could be over 3,000 entries per wastestream."
good,"checking the status of accounts & contacting customers, great co-workers the worst part of the job was the traffice getting to & leaving work"
good,Ever changeing environment with new material to learn at your request
good,Downside of WM is job uncertainty as the company is continually reacting to Wall Street's expectations.
good,They do not explain how things work and the way to process information.
good,"Very good place to work, but sometimes hard to make friends."
good,I enjoy working there. The management team is good. There is just not a permanent position available at this time.
good,"Start by help running post trip lanes for garbage trucks.Check lights and any reported problems from drivers.Fix everything that takes less than 15 min. Otherwise have them write it up for later in the evening when main body of mechanics came on duty.When post trip was over i started my PMI`S on trucks.(lube,oil,filters,and inspect total vehicle.) I learned to make hyd. hoses and install them.Brakes,rebuild Allison transmissions, torque arms, cross- members and other parts on outside of engine.Co-workers were good.Helped out when first started.The hardest part was the SMELL and the heavy lifting.Most enjoyable part was going home."
good,Extremely well intended company trying to make the world a better place for everyone. They provide the tools to help one succeed. Exceptional mid level management. Great co-workers.
good,"Good Management, independant working conditions, good support from upper management"
good,I was very disappointed that I got laid off after having been a loyal hard working employee for so many years.
good,its alright. I dont prefer to write a reivew on this company.
good,A typical day at work take avg of 80 calls
good,I am responsible for servicing anywhere from 800 to 1100 customers daily. The Management ensure we provide the customers with great customer service as well as being safe and responsible. Most of the co-workers are helpful and willing to teach you some of the things you may not know.
good,"Working for Waste Management for the first year was good however as time progressed, major office politics became a daily occurrence and made the atmosphere uncomfortable. Unfortunately, they highly stress being fast and efficient but to also provide excellent customer service balanced with sales goals. It is easy to be customer orientated personally but as a whole, although they like to proclaim they are all about the customer, it is not necessary the case as each supervisor is very different in their expectations and it is very difficult to maintain an even flow to please all of the many expectations each supervisor has for you. Attendance is highly focused on although there is over 60 people in your department, management will not work with you for Dr's appointments or other life issues you may need to address. They simply care for cheeks in the seat and will pressure you to remain at work regardless of what my be happening outside of it (sickness, injury, personal loss)."
good,Who knew that being an environmental solutions company could be so complex!
good,"call center , can get very loud at times"
good,"It's been a bitter-sweet experience for me working for Waste Management.The bitter part of it all is the micromanagement/point system which contributes to the high turnover rate of the employees.The sweet part of it includes giving me an opportunity to work with/get to know all kinds of people, teaching me to work as a team, time management skills and challenge me in ways I've never been challenged before. The pay is relatively good & the benefits are very affordable and rewarding."
good,"A good company to work for, but at this location where I am it is a lot of favoritism. Management will create jobs for certain people and don't post them position until that person is hired. The benefits here are excellent.  The pay is okay, but a lot of work.  You will do more than your job title, which is good to put on your resume"
good,"The job is good ,if you like working outside ,but if upper management gets involved  in anything ; that floor management  should handle, then it's b.s."
good,"Fast pace and consistent work environment.  Didn’t allow for room outside of work sometimes. Long days and tiresome. Cases of saying one thing and doing the opposite happened a little too often.  More good things than bad, just didn’t work for my household and schedule"
good,"Depending on the district you work at, the hours can be extremely long.  The work load is also heavy however, with the right team in place it can be rewarding. If you are looking for an 8 hour work day WM may not be a good fit"
good,Expect to work long hours and utilize new industry technology.  Prospect must be open to change and adversity. Overall...not a bad place to work. Managers need additional people skills. Compensation is complicated and in some ways misleading.
good,"Great Place to Work.  Regularly adjust pricing and makes the job very reactive.  Angry customers dictate your day, but potential to make money is very good, if you can navigate around the mechanisms developed to stop you from making money."
good,"Enjoyed working there, benefits are very good, paid weekly. Hardest part of the job was getting up very early in the morning. Most enjoyable part of the job was the camaraderie with fellow drivers."
good,The big issue with waste management is that there is no training and you have to be a self starter or get left behind. Because of the exact reason we should be paid a lot more. $19-$20 an/hour is what the minimum should be for this position.
good,This company is a fast paced and hard job. Management can be difficult at time but you are paid well for what you do. If you are looking to advance in the company it can be difficult and slow moving.
good,"If you department is fully staffed and you have a competent manager, you'll do fine here.  Training and orientation are haphazard.  Fellow employees are helpful, but everyone is very busy.  Work is good, solid, logistics."
good,Job in general is a good job but does not pay enough for the amount of hours you work. Most days it felt as though the paycheck didn't match the amount of hours in put into my job. High stress level and long hours can have some wear on the mind an body after a long period of time.
good,Early to work not a hard job but a lot of walking and in an out of the truck at a steady pace to finish the job in a timely manner sometimes it takes longer
good,"Great COMPANY to work for, but like all companies there are good moments and bad moments. Management makes the difference, unfortunately my most recent experience with management at the has been a very poor experience. There are a lot of politics in Management. The kind of politics that make you decide between what ""feels right"" and ""what's going to progress my career."""
good,"It was ok if you were in the right site with the right people. Generally a boys club, but if you work hard you can get by without isolation. Morale was once high and employees knew that the managers door was always open."
good,"I love my job as roll-off driver. Great benefits. Fair pay."
good,"I was working long,stressful hours. It was long, hot days. Nasty environment which some workers wouldn't come to work. Thankful for the job opportunity but I'd hope it was a little better."
good,"Tractor/Trailers, hydro vacs, tandems.  InCab Camera. Days vary depending on business needs, customer requests for each day. Timed via GPS @each stop."
good,"Was a great place to work,It was a good while ago when I worked there.I have heard they made a lot of changes, some not for the better.I did get a lot of good training,"
good,"Pros"
good,It was a very productive company it’s salary didn’t match cost of living and I had to find other employment to support my family.I wish this company paid more because I really liked working there.
good,"1. Poor work life balance"
good,"Very stressful place to work, the customers are brutal and very disrespectful about their garbage. The customers are some what obsessive and verbally very negative"
good,"Great Coworkers and management was okay. They were in a time of transition from when I was working there. Benefits were good, but the pay could've been better for the materials and the environment that we were working around. Overtime is iffy whether they want you to work or not."
good,Doing a good deed for your community it was always rewarding at the end of each work day knowing I made a difference in My community it always pays to do your best.
good,"My role is a very ""think outside the box"" position.  You have to find unique solutions for even more unique challenges.  You provide customize-able programs to assist customers with  saving money while simultaneously generating revenue for the company.  I have learned more about trash than I would have ever imagined. There is not a typical day at work.  When your work day becomes typical, something is wrong :)"
good,I enjoyed it but it was temporary. Ive started school ( high school ) again from summer break. It were a summer job. I couldn't complain about anything. I enjoyed the team who i had there by my side.
good,"A good job for a young healthy person. Good pay and good benefits. Bad work environment, very hostile. Not a job for people with a thin skin.  The pay makes it worth the headache."
good,"The people of Waste Management are wonderful people, however minimal growth opportunities. Work environment is very safe and fun. The team's comradery is excellent within the departments of this company. Schedule's are very flexible as well."
good,"Public Sector Management allowed me the to utilize my skills in a fast paced, quick changing environment."
good,great job lots of hours you can grown with this company just don't have time for your family. if you want money this is the place for you to go everyone get togather hard work
good,"(A typical day at work)"
good,They take care of what they perceive is in their best interest and that of the publics view. If that means hanging an employee out to dry then so be it.
good,You need to be very focused and detailed to be able to excel in this job. It has shown me how to multi-task many different high priority projects at once.
good,This Job is a good entry level position for anyone entering the company. The hours are great if you live close to the location. The attendance is very strict and many people are let go due to this policy.  There was a very high turnover rate which can stress the work group in making team goals.
good,"Great place, great pay, great benefits, bad management. I had 5 going to 6th Manager in the 14 years. Met some really great people. It was the longest place I had ever worked so I obviously liked it"
good,"A good place to work, support for learning new skills was provided.Good work culture and  Benefits  Package with incentives in place. Overall a good place to work but lacking in job security.,"
good,I was a female working in a male environment..  I worked very hard productively and efficiently.   Nothing worked when trying to make suggestions to better the UNION and CO.   I stayed to put my son through college.
good,work day to day. early mornings all the way to the evening sometimes later. You get paid for all hours so being there all day should not bother. its a good job.
good,"pay and benefits are top notch. hours are long, always short handed, terrible shop equipment, bad attitude managers, most are idiots, who would want to work here? with all the negatives the overtime is always there , all that you want with plenty of cash to go around. dont let a little smell scare you away"
good,Very enthusiastic team always fired up for the day. Accounting is highly demanding in terms of quality and performance - you've got to know your stuff!
good,"Manually and mechanically loaded or emptied residential containers into trucks. Frequently"
good,"Very tough job working in elements and dealing with the vehicles. Management was OK, pay is good, benefits are pretty good. No personal life. Other employees are good to work with"
good,"Pay and benefits are top notch. Working on landfill equipment is not the best. Needles and vials of blood on the machines, dirty diapers etc. Gotta have a strong stomach. Management is ALL WAYS watching you and questioning everything you do. They have cameras everywhere."
good,This is not something that Indeed should force people to do.  I am looking for a job not trying to waste my time filling out information for your site.
good,"Working at Waste Management has been great and terrible all at the same time. On one hand, there's great benefits, great people, and a laid back work environment. On the other hand, there's no room for advancement (in my position), average pay, tiny raises, and a lack of job security."
good,"Typical day at WM was very fast pace with goals and dead lines.  It is a great place to take on large projects working with multiple people in other locations.  WM provides on going training and education as needed or required."
good,"Hard parts about this position is mainly the hot from the sun , if your not fit , you will but very sweaty and tried before the day ends , pays not bad but could be better"
good,"Needed to work to work to help support children and myself. Job was not as fulfilling as I desired, but needed the income. Job did not require to work directly with people."
good,It was very long days with the frustration of being watched. The customers were always good and nice but the days were hard when your told to move faster and faster.
good,Everyday working at abbey delray you can learn alot because of the older people an there life story. It help me everyday as a person because different things they seen in their life an its makes you want to explore the world.
good,"It was  a very fast pace environment which made the time go fast. They had a unsatisfactory training program and no support, basically you were independent to know and understand the job."
good,I get to set the routes up they way it makes the most efficient way to complete. I coach the driver about the plus and minus in the route. We review the LOB day has a group before the start of everyday..
good,I started as a driver and advanced to trainer.  I trained all new employees on the policies and everyday expectations.  I monitored all employees and did their reviews.  I worked closely with management to get all the employees on one team.
good,"Extremely long hours- 60+/week"
good,Waste Management is at the top of the food chain when it comes to safety.  They have a really good on hands training program.
good,Company takes care of its employees.  Good Benefits and time off policies.  Pay does not correspond with work.  The job that I do is all contract based.
good,"long hours, have to make up holidays, not much time off, trucks are mostly old, co-workers are good people, always being watched by drive-cam"
good,"great job. solid company. worked there for almost 5 years and I loved it. hard work, start early (3am or 4am) and often would work 10 to 12 hours a day. salary and benefits were great."
good,I felt the salary was not commensurate with the amount of work and time expected. Sales people were not forthcoming about future business and how it could be meshed with current customer services being provided.
good,"It a great company, but the pay changed after working there for 6 months. In the application it states that the beginning pay is 60,000 a year. I have been there a couple of years and I'm not seeing that pay at all. It's also bad when old truck break down an your sit for hours waiting on a mechanic too come and fix your truck."
good,"I really enjoyed this job throughout my college career. It was very tough to think of myself continuing with the retail side after college. Would love to work in their corporate office though, the upper management I had the pleasure to work with were awesome!"
good,good benefits not good a place if you have a family out late everynight.They train good. Management is pretty good when you are doing your job right.
good,"Long hours, hard work, decent pay and benefits. Bad management and the company doesn't compete with other trash service. Drive cameras are a major pain!!!!"
good,I sorter through the recycled material everyday. I work the 2nd shift. I love the people I work with. I hate how the bosses treat the people.
good,Every day was a new adventure.  The office was a fast go speed at all times.  I learned to be organized and be pateince.  The hardest part of the job was the management.  The positions were not constant.  But I adjusted well.
good,"As a digital care rep, employees would write over 100 emails per day. Very fast paced, but calm. Worked directly with dispatchers."
good,Very busy.  Didn't learn what it took to do my job.  Management was unable to help as needed.  Co-workers were great.  The hardest part of the job was struggling to do it correctly when you weren't trained thoroughly.  The pay was most enjoyable.
good,"Start times for front load drivers was anywhere from 2:30 to 4:00 am. Sometimes this was tough on drivers. Operating the truck was fun in my opinion especially when dumping containers in front of kids....they would just watch in amazement. Having to back out of every single container was both challenging and stressful. Servicing 75 to 160 customers you learn to back really quick. The people I worked with were cool but like any place you have that one or two that seem to be lost in left field all day long. Management? Oh man don't get me started. For the most part immediate supers were cool upper management sometimes they just didn't have a clue. In my opinion the hardest part of the job was cleaning out the back of the truck at the landfill while it is raining...Rrrrrrr not good. The best part of the job was the ""Thank You"" we would get from a customer when we picked up their container."
good,"My shift is supposed to be from 1500-2300 but I work 1200-0300 on most days. I have a family and was told that this wouldn't be a bad job for me. I originally took this job because of the pay raise, but now I have no time with my family. I have only been here a month and its a descent job, but not for someone like me with a family to see only on the weekends."
good,Great company with a great future.  Very metrics driven culture.
good,Most enjoyable for me is dealing with customers. Team work is important and at times enjoyable. Hard part of the job is the broken bags.
good,"Worked with Maintenance Manager on balancing budget, ordering parts for trucks, picked up parts, entered in work orders in to system, and helping maintain hours to stay in budget."
good,"Routing drivers, Payroll, fill in on driver routes, incident/ accident investigation. Route observations, talking to customers, inside sales. etc.."
good,A typical day is full of proactive and reactive duties for a customer base of 1500 customers that i manage in the Ohio area from my office in Michigan. I have learned alo t about small things outlined in contracts that the average person would miss signing things in their personla life. i enjoy my co workers. My opinion related to management is neutral because they change often so its hard to build a relationship with one person. The hardest thing about my job is not knowing if i will have one tomorrow. there are several departments within the company that are moving to Arizona. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my customers. I enjoy learning about different companies and learning their business.
good,"A typical day at Waste Management consisted of working in an office  environment answering inbound phone calls for existing, new, or past customers; regarding billing, service issues and questions, or setting up/cancelling service. The job required extensive customer service, multitasking, and computer skills. There was much computer data entry involved while speaking with the customer. I did learn many computer skills while working at Waste Management, and also learned what the garbage/ recycle industry entails. Management was usually helpful if there was ever a question or an issue that needed to be resolved.  I very much enjoyed working with my co-workers. The people I worked with were all very pleasant and helpful. The hardest part of the job would be the fluctuating schedule and the call volume stress. The work hours were first shift, but the hours would change weekly, or last minute, so it made it hard to keep a set schedule to make plans. As far as the call volume, many times calls would be back to back and calls would drop quite a bit, so it was a bit frustrating at times. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the fact that I can help customers with their questions and needs, and that every day was different."
good,"My day at works begins with some preventative maintenance, with review my emails for any new safety concerns in the company,  a walk around the facility to make sure there aren't any new safety concerns that need to be addressed, I also cover the scale for breaks and cover the equipment operators for breaks"
good,CSR in a call center environment. Received customer complements from customers.  Handled customers inquire through phone service in a timely manner.  Processed various accounts. Reconciled accounts when necessary.  Informed customers of products and procedures available to customer in their specific area. Provided account status to customers. Process payments. Setup repair and swaps. Assisted customers in retaining accounts and purchase of new toters.
good,"Managing this site was the biggest career challenge I have faced so far due to a contract labor agreement.  Opening, closing the location plus having six employees with 25 plus years of experience conditioned me to be prepared at all times.  The most enjoyable times were found during trials and triumphs with my co-workers and employees."
good,"a typical day from 8-10 making calls, setting up appt and paperwork"
good,it a good company there give you free lunch (the times a was there)if people throw away stuff you can keep whatever you like. 
good,Pickup trash and transport waste to recycling plant for processing.
good,It was a good place to work. I learned a lot about diesel trucks and how to service them.
good,Controlling the flow of garbage. Learned about the importnace of recycling and how to turn garbage into compose. Management was ok... Could be better if they communicated with each other. Co workers were ok fun to work with. Hardest part of my job was covering the garbage with Tarps. Most enjoyable part was the pay.
good,WM is a great place to work and has an incredible pool of talent among it's workers. The challenge in sales is that the internal functional silo's prohibit a unified work force.
good,Typical Day
good,"11+ years with the company handling multiple positions. While I am happy to be a part of Waste Management, there is little to no room for advancement and I would like to grow with a company."
good,"Company offers training to better your job performance. Daily safety meeting for safety of yourself and others."
good,Learned how to work well with others and also help with making packets for customers. Liked the hours and the people that worked there as well.I only worked in the summer there but it was a good atmosphere.
good,"Over all great company, ultimately  safety is the goal, but money gets in the way. Always talk about being safe,even if you have to turn away client, but ultimately will give up employee for money."
good,"They are long hours and very fast paced. And expect a lot from veteran drivers.  But since it's hard work  we can't keep  drivers and we are pushed to compete or routes and cover others on a regular basis. "
good,waste management always been a busy place to work sometime hot and cold and raining day. In the end of the day liked working there because I stayed busy all day all night made days pass like hours .Over all a good place to work.
good,I would recommend it. Its fast paced and you learn a lot from being there. If you learn you can move up in the company. The benefits are good. I've learned a lot from bring here. You learn slot about what is done with waste materials.
good,Fast paced but the management isn't very good. Maintaining vehicles for us to do our routes seems to be difficult for waste management. Not enough dependable vehicles and not enough driver's.
good,my job was great until my two roll models and best bosses left and a new manager came in and made my life totall which made me have to quit which I never wanted to do
good,It was hard work required a lot of listening dot-dot. I did a lot of cleaning and a lot of heavy lifting... It was very fast paced and sometimes very difficult
good,"It has good benefits. Management is not so good. Extremely fast paced. The other OPS are nice and good people. Drivers are union. Able to learn a lot at this job, but no room for advancement."
good,Good culture in making sure everyone works together and contributes.There's benefit in being able to watch firework after work at stampede and also have tickets to rides on the last day
good,Long and early hours on the operations side.  Many perks and benefits that keep employees around.  Not the worst job but you'll likely be giving up some personal life.
good,"Need to work on what they preach, need to show drivers they care. Ok place to work, good money and beanies but the grass is not greener on this side of the fence."
good,"Sales Consultant"
good,"Work is easy and fun, however management is always inexperienced. Rather than hiring from within they hire outside of the industry to babysit teams rather than actually lead and direct."
good,Would consider working with WM again.  Enjoyed the culture and the diverse workforce.  The hardest part of position was competing with competitors and pricing.
good,Enjoyed working there and co-workers was great as well.  Everyone was willing to help out each other. Enjoyed coming in to work each day and my supervisor was easy going.
good,"As an accountant, we work on a monthly workload, first 6 days is month end close and the remaining time is Reconciling and other assignments.  It is long hours during close but after close, the workload lightens up.  No weekend works which is great.  No micromanagement as you know what needs to get done and very deadline driven so as long as you hit the deadline, you are good."
good,"It's an alright place to work if you can handle sitting at a desk all day.  I liked it at first, but seem to have hit a brick wall in advancement, and I'm looking for something more."
good,"I worked at the landfill and it was a dirty job. We picked up garbage all day when working outside and it was gross. I also worked in the office which was nice, but there was not enough work to keep me employed. The hours were good."
good,"This place will test you on every aspect of your life.  You have to stand firm on your faith and beliefs.  It is not the workload, but the people.  The job is fairly easy and training is a breeze.  You will have what you need if trained by the right person.  Just be smart and quick thinker.  The call center is full of females with petty drama."
good,"Waste Management is a wonderful company to work with as an employee or contractor. The culture is friendly and management offers an open door policy to accept accolades or constructive remarks. That alone, is a great selling point because the culture encourages workers to be comfortable which increases employee loyalty."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Waste Management."
good,Company itself is good to work for.  Manager of the department at the time was not good at all. Should not have been allowed to staff most of the department with her daughter and daughter's friends. Great disappointment.
good,What I enjoy most about working for Waste Management is building team relationships that last a life time. Team work makes the Dream work.
good,Waste Management has very good benefits and starting rate but the management and promotion process are lackluster. Definitely enjoy the physical work of the job and being able to stay busy and active throughout the workday.
good,"nice starter company, good benefits, management was ok to work with. recycle was better to work for than refuse pickup."
good,"early start times. very physical job, you will probably run/walk about 6 miles or more  day and pick up by hand around 12+ tons of trash..if you have a strong stomach and enjoy hard labor this is the job for you"
good,It was an good job when I started but as time went on the job got worse and not a team any more and the management is not the best
good,"I work here for 11 years, love it and hate it, I gotten good on what i do, the job sometimes is super fun, but most times is stressfull."
good,"The setting was very Corporate and quiet."
good,Friendly environment.Find dedicated to work.Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop.no politics.The most good part of the job is working with my colleagues and learning more from them.
good,"I assisted the driver from the back of the truck to pick up regular & recycled trash.  "
good,"Very fast-paced and you must be flexible. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping employees' understand their benefits so they can make good choices for themselves and their families.  There is a lot of variety in what I do each day.  You are exposed to different departments to get your job done, so learning new things are always an option."
good,"The Ewing office would be more enjoyable but what is missing is  LEADERSHIP. You don't know who is in charge because those in positions of LEADERSHIP do everything they can to not distinguish themselves as LEADERS, but they want the accolades and the credit. tsk, tsk, tsk...smh"
good,"While I have enjoyed my time at Waste Management, I think it's time for a change.  My co-workers are very nice people, my managers are adequate.  A typical day at work is closing work order tickets, running and checking edits."
good,I enjoyed working for waste management overall it was a positiive experiance. The homlife work life balance is great. Managemt that they have in place trys very hard to make you the best at your position.
good,I was not at this employer for a long enough period of time to explain details of this environment. The operating system was not really user friendly and caused confusion and more of a work load for all departments in the workplace.
good,"Responsible for the daily collection of refuse (garbage or recycle) within a set area. typically 3 loads per day with a drive to and from the dump site. co workers were awesome, as were some of the management. The hardest part of the job is working during the cold and wet seasons, with increased holiday refuse. The best thing about the job is the pay rate and the tips during the christmas season"
good,"Survey truck for problems, check for any route pickup changes. Drive and pick up garbage per schedule. Report any extra charges, ie... extra washer or dryer, and problems with the truck, ie... engine losing power, brakes slipping, etc..."
good,"Waste Management is a great company that values the environment and it's customers, but not so much it's employees. You are a cog in the wheel, and there was no push or incentive to change that. "
good,"Enjoyed the staff management aspect of the position. Due to excessive staff turnover, much of the time is spent putting out fires and handling escalated calls from customers. Employee Morale was a significant and continuous challenge. What I enjoyed the most was the feedback from the associate population, simply for listening and being there to answer questions, even when I did not have an immediate answer. Being new to the waste removal industry, I learned quite a bit about removal, re-cycle functions, etc. The call center in CT was struggling due to the staff instability. Some Managers were supportive, especially my direct Manager."
good,Great team of dedicated co-workers make the tough days enjoyable. These same co-workers have been responsible for helping me to learn and develop throughout my career.
good,"This place was amazing and probably the best office I have ever worked for. The calls that were taken weren't stressful at all and all my neighbors were very kind and helpful.The only problem was that a comment was overheard, misinterpreted, and two days later, I was fired. No warning, no wrist slap, just fired."
good,"The job is fun and always changing. The lifestyle is different. You are working so early half your day is almost an overnight shift. 12 hour days.... yeah, normal. Dont expect anything less. Weekends off!!"
good,my job was to put the trash in the trash truck. i had my hard days of work but i trained myself for the task. i enjoyed helping out the places that were need for. and working with my team mattes
good,"Waste Management was a well managed business.  My particular job had 47 sites and involved travel at 75%.  The job involved a heavy application of my labor relations background which included working with the Teamsters, Operating Engineers and others.  This job gave me an exposure to the transportation industry.  There was a heavy application of environmental and safety issues.  The travel was the most challenging part of the job."
good,"Get up in the morning go to work,pick up trash. Co-workers were great to work with. The hardest part of the job was driving in the winter. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to talk to my costumers."
good,I would set up companies to use WM for their trash pickup. It went from calling to set appointments to selling.
good,I worked 7 to 4 and i enjoyed what i was doing.  Did data entry for the billing dept and help customers with any questions regarding their invoices.    I got along with all of my co workers.  
good,"In my opinion Waste Management is great company. Since the start of my employment I have learned a great deal about the rubbish world. Being on the Dollar General Team allowed me to greatly improve my communication, grammar and wording skills with higher ups (Corporate Officials). I enjoy working for this company, however growth opportunity's are very limited. My work load has more than double in the past year and no increase in pay has come about yet.  "
good,Waste Management is able to identify talent are are willing to promote within but it'll take time.
good,"Daily work includes: Safety meetings with management as well as coworkers before beginning work, Pre trip inspections and route inspections. accessing routes via tablet. verifying helper states with help agencies and beginning route. Drivers are responsible for timely work safety on the road and maintaining customer relationships. other work includes but is not limited to roll of delivery and pick up as well as 18 wheeler flatbed bail delivery and pick up"
good,"manging employees inventory budgeting, warranty,insuring routes are covered for all three sites"
good,"I had a good experience working here but was not happy with the compensation I was receiving for the work I was providing. I worked long hours and was never told I was going to be given a raise for loyalty and consistency. My raises consisted of pennies. As I worked for the company I remember watching a show ""Undercover Bosses"" where someone in management shamed an employee by not allowing this individual time to use the restroom while out on there route as a driver. Another case where an individual was working two peoples jobs yet only getting paid minimum compensation for one. Once the media captured these two instances several things changed in the work environment within the office and field. Do I think things like this still occur, yes. If the compensation was there and management valued individuals more rather than looking at numbers I believe the company will have happier employees. The company will always thrive because of its monopoly of services in certain states and cities but just because a company is successful I don't think it should ignore there employees needs and suggestions."
good,"stress filled day .lots of walking . no breaks .work with one other driver, service at least 300 to 500 hundred customers daily."
good,"the job is not bad at all typical day would be clock in at 630am pick up trash in a safe way for no one to get hurt specially the helper that throws the trash all day in the back of the truck. go home after the job is complete usually at 7pm 9pm the latest. co-workers are awesome I think management could use some improvements, the hardest part of the job is to pick up all the trash on time most enjoyable part is when it's time to go home even tho it's late and dont get to spend time with my family cause it's late"
good,Pays good. Benefits are ok. Management could be better. Made me make a delivery while wife was in labor
good,"The trucks sometimes break down "
good,I loved working there i sorted paper.cans boxes cleaned bales cleaned up when the machines went down worked in the office sweeping dusting moping and cleaning windows washed down lockers cleaned washroom cleaned cafeteria emptied all garbage helped maintenance when they needed a hand with something cleaned parking lot sweeps glass out glass pit.
good,Pays good but can have very long hours and they want more and more out of you each day. Managers do not always care about you or anything. They are all about the numbers
good,We were a subcontracted company put in charge of fabricating and manufacturing the control panels that went inside of garbage compactors used at various businesses from McDonald to nuclear plants.
good,"I was lucky enough to get a really good schedule, but collections was just hard work. I hate calling people and asking for money, which is why I didn’t really like it. Their computer systems were outdated, would prefer a web-based system."
good,"I worked at waste management for 3 years but I was recently let go due to I only made one error while I was there and got let go, but otherwise it's a good company  , great benefits to many rules, and management makes decisions that is ridiculous, example my truck broke down I'm only allowed to work up to 14 hours, but the management says get your route done then come in which sounds great, but when you start work at 6am and cannot come in till 10 or 11 at night and your route is not done and I asked management if I could finish the rest in the morning, and said no get your route up then come in no matter what time it is, now you tell me if they care about you, I've been loyal to waste management and volunteer for weekends, holidays I worked on Christmas day, thanksgiving, even on a Sunday,  and they let me go after 1 mistake"
good,"I was a recycle truck driver for them, which consisted of coming in very early in the morning, typically 6AM.  Some days I would be done in 8 hours, some days 10 or more.  It all depended on the route and traffic.  I was a solo recycle driver so I did it all.  I drove the truck, picked up all the cans and dumped them myself.  It is a very physically demanding job.  The good thing, is I was in the best shape ever!  Pay is very fair, though so working the extra hours was always worth it.  Most employees and staff there were friendly and helpful when you needed it.  I had lots of issues with the recycle truck's basket not dumping properly, and the mechanics never being able to fix it properly, which could really hinder your ability to get your work done, and could add some time onto your route every day.  I always seemed to get lots of freebees and stuff from them all the time, which was cool.  This was one of my first CDL jobs, and was in my mid 20s so I didn't take this job as seriously as I should.  Some routes made it very easy to miss cans (Very spread apart) and constant weekly add-ons made it tough to remember or find new cans.  So I was on the top of the list of the number of missed cans per month...which they advertise on a big board for everyone to see.  I always found that to be a little low."
good,daily work consists of preparing fleet to conduct routes for the day. ensuring all drivers have preformed proper pre-trip and that vehicle is in good operating condition. conduct daily scheduled work as well as emergency road services as needed.
good,"It is a good company to work for. I like the hours get out early enough to be with my kids. Like the weekly pay and the fact that you can start"
good,"I learned about efficiency, profitability and accountability"
good,"Great job to start your career, but if you are not into Sales, do not waste your time. It was a great culture, until new management came into play and now there is no work life balance and it is very cut throat. If you can handle that they have great pay and benefits."
good,good place  to work safety if there number  one goal  great team to work for they treat there people good   pay kinda  low for a operator with time but for a beginner  pay very good
good,"Starting at 6am with a safety meeting, then driving a residential garbage truck, frequently getting in and out dumping waste with some physically fit individuals that know how to do their job. Management is great! The Hardest part is being in all the elements year round. The best part is they provide Gatorade and water during the summer, and provide uniforms, and working boots."
good,"very little accountability for employees. plenty of work, very little gets done. no actual technical work gets done, most if not all get sent to second party."
good,Waste management starts there day at 5 am and you retire when you finish you garbage collecting route. Works is hard and driven but the co workers are pleasant.
good,The tribe sent me to the police academy to help build a police department.  It was a long process and the job ultimately became a security department.  I built that program from the ground up and it was challenging but quite rewarding.
good,"Co-workers are great and management is wonderful. Strong core values in safety, environmental services, and health care."
good,"Waste Management is a good company to work for. I would have liked to see more team work, and effort in the work place. They have an excellent benefit package."
good,"daily duties include quality controlling the invoices that are sent in for billing to Waste Management, I apply checks that vendors send us to the correct locations that are paying us for, I call vendors daily and inquire about rebate payments that have not been made yet. I work on separate projects assigned to us. "
good,I loved the physical work. I loved being outside all day and putting in a hard day's work.
good,"I have worked for Waste Mangement for 2-1/2 years. I have done one job as an administrative assistant, and I fill in for the scale house as needed. I get along well with my co-workers and the managers. They aren't the problem with this job. It is Corporate Management that is causing all of the employees to have low morale. They have cut jobs, and have forced everyone to do more than one job. I am going to be forced to do my office job AND the scale house job or I will not have a job. I have enjoyed my office job, but I did not get hired to do TWO jobs! I have pretty much taught myself in the office, and I am proud of the job I have done. I am very sad that they are forcing me to leave the company."
good,"Work days varied; from traveling, scheduling meetings with prospective/current customers to analyzing reports. I've gained more affected time management skills and learned to delegate by being responsible for a large portfolio in multiple states. There was a great deal of team work and support system from co-workers and peers."
good,the job security is top notch you never have to worry about the world running out of waste. Work is constant  heavy intakes at times but very laid back easy going place.
good,The job is very demanding for the amount of pay. They should definitely pay their reps more with everything the reps have to do. They are flexible with family life and the environment is friendly.
good,A normal day at Waste Management is divided between regular daily paperwork and receiving around 250 trucks. Management doesn't usually give good feedback. Good hours.
good,Waste management is a good company to work for. The benefits and job security are really nice. At times the management and willingness to fix equipment seems lacking.
good,"Fabulous company with lots of opportunity for development and growth. You must put the time in, and prove yourself. If you do, the compensation package is amazing. Management was phenomenal, but with any fortune 500 company, there is definitely some nepotism. That’s to be expected however. Travel policy was great and allowed for decent scheduling and "
good,"I enjoyed working for Waste Management. "
good,Nice good place to work all is well strong place to stay with pay is ok they are headed in the right direction they now have the right CEO in place and he is making his rounds to visit sites
good,They hired me remotely and let me work from home so that was awesome. A little lacking in communication with upper management. Had a really fun experience visiting the landfill.
good,Worked as a Customer Service Rep in a call center environment.  Calls were inbound and dealt with customer trash services for a specific region.  Job offered very flexible schedule and pay was average however offered good benefits.  At times job was stressful due to WM servicing new areas and getting familiar with what was offered for specific regions.
good,"The worst business ethics I have ever seen and ever hope to see. "
good,"Waste Management bought a mom & pop company I worked for back in 1998. I stayed until this year. I couldn't take the micromanagement anymore. I loved my job but you couldn't do enough for the management. I wouldn't recommend taking a job there, unless it's just until you can find something better. They will let anyone manage the site, even if the managerial experience they bring comes from McDonald's or Blockbuster. A manager apparently has no need for experience in the field or even a basic understanding of how to deal with employees & customers that are  found in this type of business."
good,"I have been at this company for 2 years, sure they have huddles were you can earn points and shop on their website, but when on the phone with customers, there are some that are not happy."
good,Great outside sales role with limitations on advancement because the higher paid sales jobs are easier than the bottom level outside sales jobs due to more aggressive terms offered to major accounts. So those major or strategic sales managers stay where they are.
good,"The Company had went through 8 Supervisors in 7 years. Very Poor Management made you question the company. Supervisors would fail to schedule dumpster  repairs for delivery and then blame it on the shop workers. We constantly ran out of steel and welding supplies. But, very safe environment."
good,Receiving sorting mail for distribution of payments. Learned how the inside of the Garbage offices work glow works. Management was experienced and their door was always open. Co workers were friendly and helpful to all co workers. The job was not hard The most enjoyable part of the job was learning and accomplishing above task for the team
good,"Growing and changing company, things are very dynamic. The challenge is learning how to manage change, stay positive, work long hours, and keep in touch with the customers."
good,"Don't recognize good team member's, Sinority rules. Some individuals treat contractor workers low and nothing is said."
good,"A fairly typical accounting job. Fellow co-workers were great people and helped to create a fun working environment. However, the pay is not competitive and there is a heavy workload."
good,Waste Management is a decent company. Work week is Monday to Friday 8:30 to 5:00
good,Inbound sales from contractors. Customer service. Excellant place to work. I would still be there if they didn't move to Michigan.
good,"I am glad I left there, was not happy, treat their employees with little respect"
good,"Waste management is a great company to work for they have great benefits and insurance, but you have to work hard! I basically work two jobs here and I only get every other weekend off. Some of my co-workers are hard to get along with and aren’t team players and they don’t get penalized for not helping! I have two kids and I rarely see them even only working 8 hours a day sometimes 12 hours!"
good,It was an overall good company to work for and it was good money . Everyone there is nice and easy to work for and is always willing to help no matter what the situation is .
good,"I enjoyed working at WM, I worked with a lot of very dedicated people."
good,"Long hours, great co-workers, challenging.   High turnover on managers.  Often kept in dark."
good,Helpful learning environment. Work at your own passe and friendly coworkers.
good,"They need to change aministration,,with people that are professional, and tread people equally. February 2020,they still have to many,lacy people working they recruit temporary workers and,is a problem when is to many lacy people"
good,"I love what u do and I enjoy working but, I just wish I could have more hours and more pay and more work. and wish they would keep there word and promises."
good,"If you want a consistent work style with the same route and always being home every night this is a good place. It's trash, there will always be trash. It's going to stink, your going to get wet when it rains, your going to be cold when it snows. Your outside handling it all. It's a great workout and a great pay. It stinks, it's heavy, and your going to work for it."
good,"great pay rate, although maintaining consistent hours can be a challenge. if you can get approved to work overtime its a great job. overtime and extra work is almost on a first come first serve basis"
good,"there are three major recycleable items we looked for numbers one, two and aluminum. we opened all the trash bags and pulled those recycables out."
good,Waste Management believes in keeping individuals at same rate pay even from start pay. They believe you should be happy with benefits covered and push that as a raise each and every year. If you ask to move up they willingly find ways to get you out.
good,"This is not about Waste Management, WM is great Corporate.  This is about Waste Management Logistics (WML) which is owned by WM.   If you work for Waste Management Logistics (WML) then you'll will be doomed. Management are always insulting employees,  you will be treated with disrespect, you might be even calleding you names."
good,"Decent hours, terrible pay for the amount of work. Not for the squeamish. Handle trash all day, so be ready to deal with some disgusting things."
good,"Two shifts, 1st (usually two positions) AND 2ND (5 poaitions) if you have a family...YOU WILL BARELY see them. I believe its the reason for a high turnaround rate. If you dont mind missing kids school events or important dates...find a different job. This position will test you"
good,The management does not care for the drivers. Management has a long way to come in the way that they treat and speak to each other as well. This is coming from a Waste Management route manager!
good,This a good job with poor management. Management wanted enough trucks ready for the next days routes no matter what had to be done. Even if you are putting unsafe trucks on the road. A lot of times there were no parts to repair trucks and you would have to remove parts from already down trucks. It something goes wrong the supervisor was the fall guy. Management preaches to act and talk to employees in a certain way and then do just the opposite. The fleet manager in Louisville is a hypocrite.
good,"A typical day starts before the sun is up and ends well after its setting. The operators make a decent wage, but the manager here is this evil overlord person and she loves overpowering people and making them feel like they're simply nothing and easily replaceable. There's a lot of chiefs and not enough Indians here. if you're just passing through on your way to a better position elsewhere, it's not a bad place to work, just not worth the low wages and high stress that comes with accepting a position here."
good,"I learned how o be safe on the road;"
good,Will give you a chance. But will try to tap you out. Sometimes its a great place to work sometimes you will hate it with all your heart.
good,I hated my life every day I went to work. The only cool thing was smashing things with a dozer. Good luck ever getting a raise and be prepared to hear about how poor your work is.
good,Management do not care about the people that work for them.Brunswick ga  site is very poorly  managed with the employees often taking over. District management very weak lacks authority.  Race is also an issue there big issue.
good,You work with a lot of temp employees that could be intimidating at times. Continuously have to finish other people's work while they slack off and reap the benefit of pay
good,"I started this job to have more job security , a schedule, and work less hours. I encourage you to not ignore the managment issues others have experienced. I was a star employee for 2 years, then we became short handed and I was struggling with my health for a couple months. Managment took advantage of me, screwed over my vacation,Overloaded me."
good,Walking in to the company I had a lot of responsibility but little experience in Landfill operations. I picked up a lot and I lead a 2 crews of 22 persons and I built a team. Things improved but I received little help from  management and they were not able to send me to any training because of corporate rules. Lack of loyalty from upper management. But I loved the job and had a lot of loyalty from my employees.
good,The stress is high due to moves needing to be completed in a timely manner and dealing with drivers who sometimes are less than co-operative. No real advancement but they will work with you if you want to transfer to another department.
good,"unrealistic goal set by company,the company expects you to move through traffic at a slow pace and to pick up, dump[ and redeliver withing one hour or less not factoring traffic condition and if you miss a time you are in the red and you lose a percentage of your base pay"
good,"known for lay offs esp the call centers. leaving m any families distraught. other then that had many great years of ""experience"".....very strict mngmt....................."
good,you work a lot if you know how to do it then get all the exsperance you can in case you choose to move forward and you will have a lot of exsperance to take with you cause they will teach you some good stuff
good,"I check my email in the morning and respond back"
good,"was put in position w/o proper training."
good,the company does many things for the environment which I found to be very  interesting and beneficial for our communities
good,Management was terrible. Always had to help other people in there. Most divers were lazy so i got stuck doing most of it by myself. in need of change.
good,I have worked in my position with Waste Management Recycling for 10 years. I have been very successful and been awarded many times. I am a trusted leader and expert in my field yet I have no realistic advancement opportunities. This company is extremely flat in terms of structure.
good,High paced environment. Large customer book of business. Very competitive market. Minimal room for advancement. Constant changes to rules and work environment.
good,long days stressful working conditions old fleet  small amount of spare units never ending task list  no time to catch your breath before a new task is assigned
good,Management got 10x more chances than everyone else.  Some manager shouldn't have been in charge of a garbage can let alone a district of a billion dollar company
good,I worked in the roll-off department as the lead dispatcher and that was the only advancement I could do according to them I didn't have the skills to be a manager.
good,"My skill and services were no longer needed. Overall, i enjoyed my time working for this company. This company has a lot to offer but finding the right location is very important. Where people are honest and work as a team, again great company."
good,"very unorganized, losing $ every quarter and management hasn't a clue what to do with that side of business.  "
good,"Good job.Poorly managed."
good,I was the only person checking in drivers in the second highest volume yard in the district. Highly efficient and proficient at my job. Always maintained the highest level of accuracy. Management had a low level of knowledge of day to day activities of drivers and dispatcher. Drivers are difficult after a twelve hour day of driving.
good,The management team had no idea about any job you did. It was always a numbers game with them. No one cared about you or anything else. When I first started it was a great place to work.
good,"pre/post trip inspection, delivering products to local farms and businesses. Worked with help. The job was fairly easy and gave me the ability to interact with customers."
good,"During the four years I was employed by Waste Management I reported to 4 different Directors or Senior Managers each with a different management style. Everything was in constant flux."
good,woke up at 5 am for work. went to another county to work mostly. With a good hopper the day went by fast.
good,driving from place to place all day long. working with the customers first hand..
good,A typical day at work would start very early in the morning. There are usually lots of job duties that will need to be prioritized. Managing employee daily issues and commmunicattion with your management team is essential. The route management team as co-workers are a very fluid and family oriented team. The hardest part of work is working the long hours. The most enjoyable part of working for Waste Management is having a variety of projects to engage in.
good,"Waste Management is a company that does not value your time or input regarding policy matters, they are flexible based on department but non negotiable within each department"
good,"Management was not good where I was at"
good,"I never got a chance to finish training. My trainer told me how good I was doing. The training process stopped. My trainer never spoke to me again,literally!! After that,manager gave a week off,came back to work,then he fired me. There is way more to to this story you wouldn’t believe. Left my  job of 7 yrs. l loved working for WM. I drove 100 miles a day that’s how much I loved my job."
good,I am usually the first one there in my area the other co-workers that work in that section come in 30 min later. I learned a bit of customer service. working with numbers most of the time. also sorting and dumping containers that had glass bottles. help out in other areas.
good,I had the pleasure of learning new jobs like different computer systems and learning some accounting. I also got to learn how to operate big front loaders! It was very interesting.
good,The management at the site was under staffed and stressed out. The company wouldnt do more about training its managers better. Hard to move up in the shop due to union buddies and favoritism as well.
good,"busy establishment, hours of operation was 6 days a week.  Lack management it was uncooperative, not a very big establishment and not many employees for the Hawaii island of Oahu.   Too much waste and not properly managed."
good,Great entry-level. helps develop strength and endurance and a clean friendly enviroment. The management was great but the work wasn't equal to the pay
good,"In the beginning as any Job atmosphere, there are always boundaries. It is best to keep to yourself at all times. Benefits, were outstanding. My first Dispatch Manager was magnificent."
good,It was the wrong restaurant in the wrong area! Chef was amazing and the staff worked together. A true blessing to work with. Want an amazing time to be apart of
good,In the beginning the hours was ok and everything went well.  But the moral and management changed hands and everything went bust.  I had family issues and could not work the long hours and over an hour drive every morning to work.  Needed to be closer to home.
good,Productive and laid back.  Great environment to work in.  The employees treat one another like family.  Enough work to keep us busy through out the day.
good,"A Typical work day for waste management would include, going in and working at a conveyor belt picking plastic from cardboard as well as picking plastic at the end of the day we would leave and do the same the following day."
good,Flexibility to build your own team. Coach and develop drivers. The hardest part of the job is the reliability of the equipment.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with.
good,need to be paid more for the amount of work thats given. Management could be better with communcating. Team work could improve just a bit. Co workers make the job
good,"Company is a good company, Management gives the company a big view. Very small, so NOT much room to move up. Raisers are a few cents each year (ONCE A YEAR). NO OVERTIME, but Benefits are GREAT but not if you want a Check to take home each week.."
good,"Need Day Job, job is great but need opportunity to work days due to visitation schedule with son, missing out on greatest part on his on my world....."
good,Non stop quick thinking paced environment. Need to ensure service routes covered and completed daily and deal with incidents. Try to promote safety and promote recycling and proper use of all the 3 cans at customer locations.

good,the job was ok i use to pull out the rollin garbage cans i learn how to operate the back of the garbage truck crushin machine my co workers were gud to me the hardest part wast beenin in all different types of weather
good,"Not much to say about this position. There was lack of hours, which did not allow me to learn any new skills or trade."
good,The best part about working here is the never ending knowledge. I literally learn something new every day.
good,"Usually the day starts at 6:30am, but I never knew when I was getting off. Very hard to schedule things after work. Being outside in summer weather is great. Many good people to work with."
good,"It was a very high stress job and very busy, great benefits.  I did not know anything about dispatching or routing, but the training is not very good.  You have to be able to self learn a lot."
good,"Waste Management is a good company to work for, although this position was a ""project"" job and was very misleading. Other areas of the company are probably better to work for."
good,Company has great Pay only if your willing to work 60 plus hours per week. Company has great Training as long as you are a safe driver. work days are about 14 hours every day.
good,"I worked in A waste management facility where they had union, so it was not a fair environment. There was no space for growth because of the seniority’s."
good,Good money but long hours. Never sure when your getting out. Stressful and demanding. Good benefits. Can be tough to have a good work and home balance
good,The company isn't willing to provide wages that is beneficial to there employees whether temps or employees you never get what normal companies are paying minimum wage there pay are less
good,"Great company for recent graduates and/or interested in the waste industry.  There are room for advancement/growth however patience is needed since WM believes in mentoring program.  Salary is average however benefits such incentives, discounts are a bonus."

good,"typical work day started at 4:30 am with ensuring routes were covered. after drivers were released from yard, then addressed customer and employee concerns on a daily basis. Interfaced with management to ensure all issues are delt with."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my job with Waste Management and was looking toward a future with them. Waste Managements retirement benefits are very rewarding to the employees. It was also very rewarding to see my goals accomplished through my employees.
good,Working for Waste Management was a fun but fast paced job. It definately was not a career option for me. It was a stepping stone. Waste Management was a good company to work for.
good,"Treated quite well as a driver, managers were very polite and helpful. Always offered a monthly lunch and daily free drinks. The only complaint was the lack of pay for the work, which I heard has changed recently which is now fair. The benefits are not that good, atleast for my situation."
good,You will work hard but will be compensated fairly for it. This is the classic corporate America job. This is a hard company to get on with but I highly recommended it if you get the chance.
good,"Waste Management was a good experience and they did believe in training to get you started.  However, they did have discount for college and vacation benefits, PTO, and sick time."
good,"A typical day including receiving service requests, executing inventory orders, scheduling, account management, and customer interaction.  Very diverse position."
good,"When its good, its good, when it's bad, ITS BAD!. don't let them fool you with the ""once and a while"" call outs. make sure you get as much as you can at negotiations."
good,"It was a nice place to work, but it was a fast-pace environment so you had to be aware of your surrounding. Once a snake was found"
good,"A typical day at Waste management would be going to work clocking in, having a quick meeting with the supervisors and heading out to the field for my position.  I would go to the sites that are assigned to me, do my assessments and move onto the next one.  When its time to clock out I will go back to the office to end my shift and check in with my supervisor."
good,Very dirty plant conditions working with construction  material.  Plant buildings and equipment need updating to further improvement in recycling material.
good,depending on weather it can be a ok job i would like it if you wasnt in trash all day but besides that its a descent job some days are going to be horrible but some are going to be ok
good,"I liked working for this company but the only con I really have is the weather. As far as the pay and the work environment, it's a cool place to make a living."
good,"I had a good time working there, I didn't like working graveyard, but I liked the work itself, it was stinky but you get use to it, I liked the atmosphere, the work itself was simple,  I was excited about advancement but the man I filled in for who left on an injury ended up coming back so ultimately I had to give him his job back."
good,"Management horrible. I really wouldnt recommend Bradenton location. No matter how hard you work, they want you to work even harder. Other than management, co-workers are great."
good,"Nobody actually wants to pick up garbage. Once you get into the swing of things, it is pretty easy to do your job and follow rules. Safety is key to excel. Be willing to do your job is basically it."
good,"Early to rise to get everyone's trash picked up."
good,"Expect to have black bowel movements and black buyers lol"
good,You work long hours and have no idea when you will be off. The trucks are not in good shape and the mechanics don't like to fix them. The benefits are nice but you can't get any days off that you want.
good,A slower paced work environment makes this a great place for someone who can't move fast due to medical reasons.  The Owner is understanding of your limits and will work with you.  The typical day consist of sorting recyclables from waste and placing it in the proper containers.  You may find yourself stripping insulation off of wire or dismantling an old machine for copper and aluminum.  The co-workers are nice people and the work is not to hard.  the worst part of the job is the smell.  The best part of the job is finding an old item that you were looking for.
good,"Building in decent condition, company provided tools in fair condition, Fleet aging and can be challenging to repair, training opportunities rare and often out dated,"
good,"Had to learn everything quickly and on my own, Company provided training to assist, very little assistance from upper management or co-workers"
good,"A typical day for me was taking over 150 calls, assisting with any problems and assisting co-workers. I learned a different function on a daily basis using the new system. The best part of the job was assisting customers and co-workers."
good,"I did enjoy working for Waste Management, but they need to do something about the way they treat their employees by not looking for a reason to terminate them on a daily basis."
good,The people I worked with were great! My boss  was a great boss.The hardest part of the job was worrying about drive cams and there extreme rules.I learned a lot of good driving skills.

good,"As a site foreman at the landfill I enjoyed the supervisory possition. Landfill makes it sound nasty, but in fact I was in a part of the landfill that only handled construction debrees. I like to operate heavy equipment and I feel that I am good at it. I have operated about every kind there is both above ground and underground. Not really sure why, but I also love the office work of being a supervisor. The computer work and paper work appeals to me."

good,"Great benefits, vacation and sick leave is not like any other company I have seen. Wages are livable. Very high pace"
good,"If you want time w/ your family, find something else. If you live to work, then this is the place for you. The job can be rewarding when you succeed, but expect to put in more time on your schedule than you can afford if you have a family."

good,One of the best employees there. Rain sleet or snow I got the garbage up . Running routes that would have lasted 10 hrs some days but managed to get the job done.
good,Tried to control traffic on the site. Sometimes not possible. You are outside almost the entire day. Twelve hours per day can make for long days. Minimum wage pay. Ok for the work you are required to do.
good,It's alot of work and we also had to work overtime alot.you have to work at a really fast pace and get really dirty but that was part of the job.it was a nice experiment.
good,my job was sorting trash and recyclables from a slow paced conveyor belt into the correct bins. Preforming cleaning maintenance in work area at the end of shift.
good,"Is a great place to work, especially if you want to advance in your career. "
good,Waste Management brought in non union company bought us out was thankful for the work. Would still be there if they did not drop unions. They took really good care of trucks
good,"Fast paced. Early mornings, cold winters, stay hydrated. Good pay and benefits with vacation pay.  Management is ok, half-safe environment. Smells bad."
good,"WM is a great company to work for great pay and benefits. Really great co-workers, always willing to help each other out when needed. Management is a little strict but, as long as you follow the rules you have nothing to worry about."
good,"I loved the insanity and the thrill of the work, and we were well paid for it.  Not for the faint of heart.  Now I'm writing another 20-something characters to complete the minimum requirement."
good,"Waste Management is a good company.  Local managers were very appreciated; however, upper management did not seem to care.  They were all about the bottom line."
good,"Overworked and stressed over trying to maintain, and keep fleet of outdated falling apart trucks. Managment is stretched to thin. Understaffed for the amount of work expected in tight deadlines."
good,"Good job good benefits, chances for advancement, its like when you were a kid and you played with your Tonka toys bull dozers, big dump trucks excavators all kind of power equipment but for grown ups and you got paid."

good,can be very rewarding when overcoming challenges on a daily basis. Continuous improvement is a part of every day. Very professional work environment with lots of support structures in place
good,I really enjoyed working at WM they treated me Good. I was a Good Front end driver they were sad to see me go. I have an open door to return.  The one thing I dont like is the cameras and the constant feel of loosing your job if you make a mistake. Things happen the industry as a whole has under qualified drivers.     Let’s face it the younger people today for the most part are lazy and useless know one wants to earn a living with a little hard work. All looking for easy way out.
good,Assumed wide range of office and staff administration responsibilities in addition to accounts payable functions along with other company needs..  It was a very enjoyable workplace.
good,"Lots of rules but it helps to prevent accidents ,they need to pump more money especially for the hard working driver,not hiring someone from the street with no experience and pay him more than the exists driver the hard working one"

good,"Answer Inbound calls resolve customer missed pickups and billing issues in a timely manner"
good,This career development didn't apply to plant workers. More dedication needs to be given to plant associates. The workplace culture is not the same throughout the organization but rather culture is based on the location you work at. Everything seems unorganized and left many employees uncertain.
good,WM is a great place to gain experience and knowledge.  They are flexible when it comes to family situations.  Paid time off and benefits are good as well as the culture.
good,Raises are dependent on how much management likes you. Lots of work and no lay offs. Busy all year long. Wages do not keep up with the cost of living.
good,When I was first hired I was told that trash is not more important than family. Well that was not the case. It got to where I was working more and more hours and taking more cans because some of the other driver would pretend to be slow so that they could go early and left us to pick up after them. Work hard get screwed
good,This company offers great benefits. Drivers must have good communication skills and ability to know when trucks need to be reported for maintenance and care.
good,as a swing driver my hours vary from starting at 4am to 6am and not knowing what time you will be done but plan on 10 to 14 hours. Its nice when you have done the route before so then you know what to expect
good,"Okay company to work for, positive work environment and staff. Residential is a tough gig, especially double route, have to be cut out for this type of work."
good,I am grateful for the opportunity to have an internship at Waste Management. I primarily worked under the Public Affairs Manager and the Office Manager.
good,A fun company with many incentives. There was always another goal to reach with plenty of opportunities for growth. A blended age group with the older more seasoned mentoring the younger. Well rounded working environment.
good,"Very busy environment, operating heavy machinery, and has to always be aware of surrounding.  Learning key nature of job position, the management is informing and trains appropriately. The workplace culture helps to remain maintaining a safe workplace. The hardest part of the job is lifting heavy objects and knocking out all the tasks. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know the staff coworkers, the hours are a good amount and helps."
good,"good place to work. Too many managers with varying opinions..tough to get a straight answer.. If you work hard and stay positive, job is solid. tough to advance career"
good,"It was a stressful, cut throat place to work.  You had to fight for your business both internally and externally.   WM laid people off on a regular basis “with your job has been eliminated”"
good,4am shifts riding around gathering trash . I learned that you have to be ready for long hours.management works with you and recognizes hard workers. k

good,"A solid company, with lots of opportunity to make a difference. Company is working to modernize & go through digital transformation to continue to improve service and culture."
good,"If they just paid more and had less 24 hour on call shifts, The management is good. The resposability and stress are heavy. Constantly  on call with little help."
good,Every day is challenging and offers new opportunities for growth. The growth is both personal and professional. A typical day offers the ability to develop problem solving skills.
good,"Job pays well. Great benefits. Some of your co workers are cool, others will cut your throat if they think it'll gained them some type of recognition with management."
good,Leadership has taken on the belief that it is better to get rid on your long term employees and bring in younger employees that work cheaper.  Lots of stress and pushing unsafe practices on the drivers.
good,i like working here great place just its grave yard shift life is good smells great trucks are clean ronnie is a great person and lots of people to guide you
good,"This is a good company with good pay and many benefits. My particular branch left something to be desired in the upper management. Other than that, it was a solid job."
good,Waste management was a fair place to work if you could handle a demanding schedule and were very safety conscious. As long as you completed what was asked of you without injury or any mishaps involving the assigned equipment you would find it very beneficial in terms of salary and job security.
good,Everything is amazing with the exception of management. unfortunately they make a lot about how they personally feel about you and less about business.
good,"-Process service tickets."
good,"I had to learn how to push throw working at this job, You have to be mentally strong to do this job everyday. Not because its hard, its because its usually blazing hot."

Later I became the office manager.  My responsibility included, payroll, benefit adminstration, accounts receivable and payable as well a rental sales."
good,Typical day at work would be to inspect your forklift prior to shift and then begin to start your day by going over all the product to see what needed to be started first.
good,"pay and benefits are good, management needs improvement but aren't bad. Long hours but weekends off. The company needs to invest on new equipment as well on maintenance."
good,They have HR people who are extremely rude. I would not recommend this job to other people. The only positive is the amount of hours and money you COULD make if it isn't slow
good,Company always looking to make a difference in the community by promoting green solutions to waste removal. The work culture was a bit stressed and management liked to put pressure on its' employees as a way to get the most productivity.
good,"Not awful, lot's of travel for me. Hours are long. Good benefits, pays well. Company is focused on returning dividends to stock holders. Typically, WM has a RIF every 2-3 years"
good,Began working for the company after leaving the military in Oceanside California and transferred to Georgia with a small pay increase. The benefits were good
good,"typical work day was hard, long shifts hard work and you have the grull the environment. typically the managers and drivers were nice and accommodated your needs. most of the driver/loaders got along. hardest part of the job would be the grind of filling a truck. most enjoyable would be going to dump the truck."
good,it was a good job until lAKRISHAand bridgett started working there. they both are terrible managers and should be fired.                        ...................................................

good,Contracting with local mine companies for roll off containers and local area business. To set up trash disposal. Day to day communication with the public. Resolved customer problems. And set up new services.
good,I enjoyed my time at Waste Management.  WM gave me my first experience in working around a production lab.  Many companies contract with WM to disposed of their hazardous waste material.  The people I worked with were generous and willing to help new comers get acclimated to how things were supposed to be ran.
good,"Ability to work independently, company provides the tools necessary to be successful, travel, work remotely, great co-workers and business partners"
good,"great people to work with, provided safe environment for employees, works well with the public. held safety meetings before going out on route"
good,Great company with great people. They moved managers around excessively. I had 6 manager changes in 1 year was a bit extreme.
good,"a typical day would consist of loading pallets, different materials in our haz-mat building. My skills I have learned is plastic/cardboard balers, more experience with different forklifts, rotators, compactors, dock plates. Working with my co-workers is fantastic, we work as a team. Anytime someone has a issue, we help one another to resolve it. The hardest part of my job is dealing with the new management. They do not want to listen to new ideas, suggestions to help improve to the process. The most enjoyable part of my job is some of the freedoms I have in traveling to different locations within the GM plant. Plant is very big, I like to explore the different ares and see how the cars are built,"
good,Always updating systems and procedures to be more efficient. Adding customers and working with drivers to have the best service possible.
good,Great job. Overnight. Set procedures for safety but not for processes on jobs in factory. More of a play by ear in regards to how to accomplish tasks.
good,"a typical work day is 10 - 12 hour day"
good,"A good place to find reliable employment.  Waste is an undeniable part of our existence. As a result, the management and recycling of waste become a necessary part of our lives as well.  Which makes this an excellent opportunity for employment."
good,"Routing drivers daily, customer service, comprehension skills & problem solver"
good,All my work experience was productive and good working environment. However no cooling during summer. no heat during winter. extreme work load.
good,The upper management at the call center is Horrible. The team leads and management were great and seemed to really care about the employee. On the other hand their boss was never there and when she was she only cared about numbers and really could care less about the customers on numerous occasions she would listen in to my inbound calls. She by accident pulled her head phones out of her lap top and the volume was up and it was my call on the lap top she was listening to she was sitting diagonal from me could help but hear it. She is Extremely unprofessional and holds grudges. So stay on her good side if there is one.  There was very little support from her position from what I noticed and that call center would run much better if they replaced her. The company as a whole is a great company and believe in being the best everyday. I don't work there any more but I bleed green and yellow to this day. I hope the higher management for the area really look into the call center management to see why they have such a high turn around its because of the manager. Over all I would recommend working there.
good,"Waste Management has given me the opportunity to utilize my skills as a data entry specialist."
good,"The work was good. Physically demanding. The people were good, management was good. Lots of overtime. So much that I was basically gone 4 days a week."

good,Job was great to learn about all areas of EHS. Enjoyed the travel and benefits. There were a lot of new opportunities to work with different hazards and safety challenges
good,"Every driver has a route that they work for the day. There are three lines of business; residential, commercial, roll off. Each driver has set routes that they work every week except for the roll off drivers in which they do the work as a call in/need basis. Each driver is on their own throughout the day and work at their own pace to get the routes done. The day is done when the work is done. The faster you work the sooner you get home."
good,would have like to have stayed with the company. the plant I worked at closed down. i was not interested in any other postions within the company.

good,Great opportunity to learn and grow fellow co-workers were great. Enjoyed every moment of my time working there.  Its a hard job but a rewarding one.

good,Work environment centered around continuous improvement and differentiating from competitors.  Relied heavily on the workforce to accomplish this.
good,Its mainly going to residential residents and taking their garbage and putting it in the truck
good,"A typical day usually involved organizing calls, visiting customers, helping to solve problems, preparing quotes and and managing my territory and expense account. Our division worked as a team.  My coworkers and I needed to communicate on a regular basis to make sure jobs were scheduled in a timely manner, quotes were sent out and leads were communicated to me. We worked closely on all projects to insure that we met the customers needs and kept the customer in compliance.  I learned that communication is very important in any job, not only with the customer but also within my own organization.  Also, I learned that attention to detail and meeting deadlines was a very important element in my sales job as well. The hardest part of the job, I would have to say, is the stress involved with this industry.  Many times we would get calls where we would need to handle something ""yesterday"" or the customer would incur fines. On a positive note, though,I loved managing my territory, helping my customers and meeting with and developing relationships with them. This was the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,This site is a 24/7 operation. Hazardous waste facility within a small town. Many employees have been employed for 25 or more years. Small turn-over rate.

It has become my second family.  My co-workers are awesome and a pleasure to work with.  The hardest part of my job is lack of opportunity for advancement.  There are opportunities to move around between departments; however, not much room for advancement beyond a specific point.  The most enjoyable part of my job is my hard working team, the community partnership, great benefits, and positive moral."

good,"Maintaining a variety of heavy trucks, keeping the shop clean, working in a safe manner, recording all work performed and parts used."
good,"The design of mechanical equipment used in waste management operations offer our team with the possibility express new ideas for equipment enhancement."

Waste Management has a wealth of resources and is a very safety minded company. There are many idustrial sectors that WM has Project Managers embedded and each has its own challenges and unique requirements. Being a Project Manager is enjoyable because the learning never stops and each job is different.
good,Sales Coordinator department worked together as a team. Work was dealing with internal and external customers. Maintain service and customer calls as well as helped with national and broker accounting.
good,"My position offered me the opportunity to learn new tasks continually. Some days were very stressful with multiple deadlines. Change was a way of life. I was able to offer assistance in areas that were not familiar to me and my opinion mattered to my superiors and my staff. Hardest part of my job was sometimes the lack of hands on training. It was ""here is the new system"" and you spent your own time on learning it. We had a great network of piers to reach out to so there was always help available. The most enjoyable part of my job was the people I worked with. There are amazing individuals."

good,"If you want $$$ and hours, then this is the place, otherwise you have no family life."
good,"Replaced decals on multi family waste bins, attended events across the city."
good,"Waste Management is a great company to work for. A typical work day was challenging because the customer service calls were always different; billing calls, service issues etc. I learned as a customer service rep to listen closely to the customer and do not interrupt the customer until they have explained themselves and to assist them and follow through with the call . I also learned to put myself in the customers position and do not take the call personal. Management has improved during my tenure at waste management by updating the tools used to providing excellent customer care but at the same time this caused positions to be eliminated. Co-workers worked as team players. The hardest part of my job was when customers were not satisfied with service and became irate however the most enjoyable part of my job was satisfying the customers and developing a relationship with them."
good,"I worked for WM for nearly 23 years, and progressed through the organization the entire way. I believe that the executive leadership is innovative, and moving in the right direction. I believe they evolved into a direction that was not as directed toward environmental progressiveness as I would have wanted, but overall a great place to work."

good,it is a great place to work. great co-workers and management. overall a great place to work.
good,Waste Management is a great example of a corporate American success story within the energy field.
good,"I never thought I would be in the Waste Industry. I held a few different positions and promoted from those positions. The job itself is very fascinating. Working with WM was a challenge as change was met head on. I accepted the changes that were placed before me. Unfortunately our economy took a bad turn and I watched as we restructured to improve into a real lean model. There are growth opportunities, you have to be able to move with them."
good,A lot of Health and Safety papers and Meetings. Trucks were half Decent and Management was unattainable a lot of the time as they were spread to thin.

good,Long hours not for millennials 55 hours per week minimum some newer trucks have to deal with sharps brealdowns camera watching you and the road seatbelt on or fired give you a phone but if you use it while driving equals fired route manager for commercial is biased on HIS boys either your one of them or your out other management is ok. Benefits are Ok but pricy
good,Overall good company to work for but could use improvement in creating opening for advancement. Could use improvement in benifit in quality of health care coverage for employees
good,It's a place to work. The management could be more involved in the daily processes and have less favorites amongst their employees-but each job has it's vices.
good,Detail oriented culture ensures that the fleet is safe and efficient. Benefits are generous and systems are very user friendly. Departments are interconnected to ensure the best use of resources.

good,"Good company, have different benefits., but they have to change their ways now that the economy is booming and they ‘re not the only job in town. They ‘re always looking for people"
good,"From what I've experienced, good growth potential within 6 months, however, based on performance and supervisor nomination for promotion. Some managers micro-manage too much. Employees not allowed flexibility. Fun environment and competitive between markets."
good,"If you're seeking alot of overtime and never a dull moment, then this is for you. Garbage turns off more than a few but the financial gain in certain positions of employment are worth it."
good,Waste Management Was A Pretty okay Place To Work The pay Was Fair I Got Good hours pretty cool crew to work with okay Management and it was a stable job

good,Waste Management is great about promoting from within the company. I speak from experience as I was promoted four times in the 17 years I was employed.
good,I enjoyed working for this company. The pay was good and the hours were plentiful. Even though we worked in the sun for hours it wasn't that bad once you had a drink. I would recommend this job to a friend
good,"The best thing about Waste Management is their benefits. They are beyond what most large companies are willing to pay. However, the Management team does not understand the roles of the front line employees as much as they should. It is a large corporation so there are a lot of politics and they sometimes seem to care more about the shareholders than the employees."
good,"WM is a large organization with many positions across North America. If you're willing to relocate, then the possibility of a promotion is quite good in time."
good,"The hours are unlimited, I work anywhere from 40 to 70 hours a week. I have gained experience in many areas while here. I have managed two sites, dispatched, delivered, navigated, ran the scalehouse while performing my duties as a Operations Specialist.  Hardest part of job is lack of communication from management. Manager has been gone on medical several times, when he comes back there is no communication, lots of confusion and no structure. There is no team work and things run poorly when he is here, when he is gone everything runs smooth and the team works great together. I enjoy working with drivers, fellow employees, vendors and customers."
good,"Nice place to work, although the location has now been closed."
good,Lots of advancement opportunities. Fun workplace with solid culture. Management structure is challenging. Hours can be long but work can also be rewarding.

good,Drove a residential garbage truck and learner different jobs quickly as I am a fast learner.  Management for the most part was excellent and the hardest part of the job was driving a truck that didn't work properly or broke down ALOT
good,"A typical day at Waste Management call center begins and ends with mostly back to back phone calls.  Some customers are simply checking on their service schedule or reporting a problem with their dumpster or service.  The customers call  also to order rolloff containers for construction or home cleanouts or to order new service for their home or business. In the dispatch department there are two different divisions; dispatch and routers.  As a router you analyze the stops that need to be serviced on a given day and assign the stops to the appropriate driver.  As a dispatcher you being taking calls from the drivers, answering questions and problem solving.  Management is basically the same as it is everywhere. Not too bad, not too good."
good,"i learned how to pack garbage, but the hardest part was packing garbage while the truck moving. my enjoyable time was working with my co worker everyday."
good,Good money but no social life. They work the pookie out of you. You drive all day long in the traffic of Nashville. Its very mentally disturbing. No time to yourself.
good,"clock in,safety meating,qc truck,head out to route.start route whit helper until rpoutr is finish.manage cares more about the numbers than the employes at the end of the day.hardest part was not having help on a heavy day.the most enjoyable part was the woek was linear simple."
good,"No opinion. I'm giving no opinion because I don't want someone to base there choice in taking the job because of what I wrote in a review. It's a job, it's going to suck regardless."
good,Pay was to low for my travel time and I didn't get my raise and promotion AS PROMISED. Some of the company workers were good to work with. When Consol energy bought it out it went downhill.
good,"Prepared engineering recommendation initiatives such as maintenance support, Preventive Maintenance (PM)"
good,"Nothing out of the usual, or negative to say about working for this company, normally had a lot of overtime that you were expected to work. Could be a little overwhelming trying to keep up with routes at busy times of year."
good,"Responsible for scheduling commercial pickup, worked directly with customers to resolve issues and complaints, credited payments to accounts and maintained call records."
good,This company was great at training and collecting information needed to help those who are new. Very strict though. Its a very nast jib but some one has to do it. I think i value that aspect of it
good,"Waste Management is a great company to work for. However, it is extremely hard to get advancements. The company is competitive with initial salary packages.  Most people that work there are comfortable and happy so there is not a lot of turn around."
good,Roll- off driver  front- load  driver  rear -load driver container deliver boom truck  operatater  heavy equipment operatater  bagster truck operatater transfer station operatater
good,"It depends on your position if WM is a good place to work.  I have had good jobs there and badjobs there.  I have had good managers and badmanagers. Overall, the jobs there were good.  One doesn't leave good jobs if they don't have to.  They leave bad managers.  I left a bad manager there and my next job was a good one.  Unfortunately, I lost my position and a job I really liked to corporate restructuring."
good,"WM is a large company and there are good managers and not so good managers.  For the most part, it is a good place to work.  Get in, get your experience and move on.  Stay too long and you'll get frustrated."
good,I really liked working at waste management just needed more money for my family fast pace and sorting always have bbq for all co workers everyone would laugh
good,"I would answer inbound calls for residential and commercial customers. They would have billing questions or service issues that needed resolution. I learned how to be patient with a irate customer and avoid vocal collisions. Time management was also necessary in order to complete assignments by prioritization. "
good,Pay is low.  Clocking in and out.  Employees are judged on favoritism and not experience and senority.  Lack of communication when openings are available.
good,typical day at work consisted of picking thru trash constantly all day it was the worst job I ever had but again the people I work around made work enjoyable to go to the culture was great hardest part of the job was the trash but I was the best at what I did
good,"Company has good training programs. "
good,This is a great place to work with great benefit and pay. The only hardest thing is the long hours.The people there are like family. We have birthday parties every month and cook outs. Great one a year parties.
good,"This was the most interesting job I've had, as it pertains to meeting and interacting with various people of all walks of life. There are a great number of individuals who greatly value the service that we provided. On the contrary, there were also a great number of individuals who severely disregarded our occupation as well as our personhood. However, these individuals only prompted me to continue to offer the best service possible to help them."
good,"It's a rough jobs but it's easy to follow work together as team, there a lot of Process (waste garbage), however health and safety is important for company and for employee. At the end, some Process are worth some reward."
good,"If you have a clean CDL with experience driving heavy trucks they will hire you. I spent a week in Pittsburgh for training, stayed at a nice hotel with meals paid (even got reimbursed for the gas), learned a lot, they're VERY heavy on the safety.. Came back and hit the road with a driver trainer who told me ""you have to learn the back of the truck before you learn the front"", so I rode on the back throwing trash, sometimes it was couches, recliners and mattresses etc (watchout for the glass & needles).,(btw they send you for a DOT physical as well as to a gym for a tryout before you start also), other days I drove while he threw trash also. They will time you to the second and wont cut you loose until you're fast enough - 10 seconds too slow X 500 stops adds up. We started at 2am, had a quick safety talk then went out for a quick pretrip on the truck and pulled out in order - hated this part, you weren't allowed out to the truck until it was time to go, so in the winter you're heading out in a cold truck with frosty windows, and the trucks have a million miles on em. Don't expect to just come in and work 8 or 10hrs and go home, they're going to pile the work on you and you'll go home when you're done & if you're constantly running behind and other trucks have to help you - well you're gonna hear about it. Typical day was 12hrs, pay was by the hr so lots of ot. They give you all the bottled water & ice you want (you'll need it), sometimes doughnuts in the am & ice cream when you get off in the summer. Also they pay for your boots, and free trash pick up if you live on their route,"
good,Keeps you busy and loves the pace. Everything is kept neat and always clean up whatever you mess up whenever finish. Don't ever hold on to objects that's tied down on the lines. Be aware of your surroundings
good,"I loved my Job, I learned a lot. I would get to work before the sun rose and leave when the sun was setting 5 to 6days a week. I cared about what I was doing and in some way I thought they cared about us, but I was wrong. your just another #. There was such a good mixture of people from all different back grounds. But No Job security. So everyone would try to through others under a bus and blame the weakest person for it because they would not stick up for them selves. They did not want to make waves. The hardest was dealing with management. They see what is going on and turn to attack the weak with everyone else. The most enjoyable part of the Job was knowing at the end of the day you did everything you could. And that self pride I took in the work I did meant a lot."
good,"started out as inside sales and promoted to outside sales. very productive. Maintained a cliental of 2k which consist of cold calling, up dating contracts.The most challenged was unduable  50 calls per day  and resigning 20 contracts along with finding new business"
good,I worked in the office doing account receivable and collections. I didn't have enough to do to keep me busy though. I was usually able to get more work and help out other co-workers with theirs.
good,"My day at work was always extremely busy.  I learned to multitask from weighing disposal vehicles: dispatching:  Keying customer's complaints and not out into Waste Management software MAS.  Enter driver's daily route sheet into PMT; answer all incoming calls etc., I managed machine operator and yard help. The hardest part of the job was not being able to take 30 minutes out for lunch without interruption.  The most enjoyable part of this job is being able to perform multiple assignments and make it home without passing out."
good,Good pay with good benefits. The treatment of employees is generally good. just be aware of  ever changing corporate policies.
good,I love being outside working in all kinds of weather dealing with customers doing my routes making sure it got done.   Don't know what else to say about this job.
good,"great team atmosphere fun to do, "
good,always on the go  my co-workers were great. I learned many different things the hardest part of job was working around trks and people with a large machine
good,"I operated a front end truck and when the weather was good and the truck running up to expectations the job was great. Having a truck break down or weather stop you from completing a route only meant you had to do that much more the next day and because your days were already full it made life tough sometimes. "
good,"typical busy fast paced"
good,"Once i clock in, i proceed to my assigned truck and head to our stationed  routes. Since i'm great at what i do, my shifts never last as long as others. I usually help others since i finish early. I learned patience at this job and the management is pretty ok and always work around my availability. My co-workers are not as dependable but friendly and inviting. The hardest part about the job was being able to be in a good state with my body. I am getting worn out and i'm worried about my bodies state. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to get through my routes and have customers thank me and reward me for properly handling their trash bins."
good,WM is a very good company to work for.  I enjoy my job but I wish there was room for advancement.  My Boss is fair when it comes to work related issues.  I would recommend the company to others who are currently looking for a job.
good,"Good job but was Laid off....Loading/unloading common carries."
good,"Started when the flood of 2013 was just happening, they brought me in for maternity coverage, with a chance of a permanent position."
good,Great place to work with excellent benefits. A company that still believes in promoting from with-in. This leads to a healthier work environment with dedicated & engaged employees.
good,"WM always asked for the most you could give, and then a little bit more.  It was hard. But the people I worked with were great so that balanced it all out. And the pay was pretty good. Really hard to move around the company though."
good,"The Job began Early in the Misty Cold weather in Seattle Outside all day.  First we started with a safety meeting and any updates to routes. Then a release to our trucks to do our pre-checks, then off to the routes. on route can to can in and out of the truck. 800,900,1000 cans a day. In and out of these horrible streets in Seattle. Fun hard working job. The energy put into the job was rewarding. Great place to work."
good,"I was stressed out most days but the benefits and pay were hard to come by in other position outside the company. They helped my family move from one state to another in order to keep my job and then closed that facility a few years later, I had a choice to relocate during this consolidation too."
good,"Ensure that the customer is in compliance will all EPA regulations.  Work with customer employees, onsite laborers and 3rd party vendors to ensure compliance and job is completed to customer satisfaction.  People skills are very important.  Management and customer employees are good to work with.  Most days are even keel, but when things go south, they do so in a hurry.  Seeing the job get completed."
good,I like working for waste management because I get along with everyone there.  They all like an extended part of my family in whom which I care for.

good,Great Company to work for! Great benefits and compensation. Day to day routine changes at the drop of a pin. Must be able to adapt quickly to whatever is thrown your way.
good,"Work and stay focused on the task not the smells one is surrounded by"
good,Co-workers were easy to get along with and very friendly. The manangment was fairly decent.
good,Large company in a mature market so constantly looking to cut costs.  Survived 3 major layoff/reorganizations in 10 years and countless small ones.  I was able to work in several different areas and advancement was possible until most recent layoff.  I did not get laid off but opportunities dried up so went elsewhere
good,Good company with competitive benefits. I was always concerned for my job security in spite of my performance. The people I worked with were all professional and easy to get along with too.

good,"good work place then new management, location and added branches; made it difficult; 85% of employees that has been there for many years are suddenly fired through out the new transformation."
good,"The days here can be long, but they tend to taper off at the end of the week. The workflow is fairly easy to pick up. The Managers here are okay; things have a laid back but take-care-of business feel to them. My coworkers are great though so seem a little high-strung. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the customers. They can be downright psychotic, but then you'll have that one very kind customer so I guess in the end it balances out."
good,"Long hours, driving different routes, in many different trucks... I learned how to be efficient at being flexible. Co-workers were real easy to work with. Management was challenging, constantly problem-solving to be more efficient concerning the routes. Hardest part of the job was not knowing what route I might be on until I arrived to work. Most enjoyable part was dealing with fellow co-workers and the customers."
good,"sorting plastic for recycling"
good,"Mixed directives made day to day management difficult."
good,"Insode sales call ,co-workers really nice to work with "
good,"I learned that when you think you got ""FRIENDS''' at a job,think again.The employees at WM are for themselves only and will sell you out to make themselves look good to management.In return management doesn't really do a great job of managing employees,they let people do and say what they want,as long as the trash is picked up so there numbers always look good. Hardest part of job is doing your route,then going to do someone else route because there buddies with lead driver, and lead driver lets them do nothing. "
good,this place had avery nice and big shop with great equipment. the people there were pretty nice but the management pretty much sucked. plus they rush you to cover about 100 trucks a night. overall it was a nice job

good,"always busy, inputting info in the system, leaned a lot of computer skills, Management was always changing every 2-3 years - most co-workers were alright - only one bad seed - not having work to do when the computers are down. Talk with all the drivers about their day"
good,Communicated with customers and outside sales managers to process temporary dumpster roll off orders. Typically the clients I deal with are larger construction companies and their project managers. Account management and cross-selling was an essential aspect of every customer interaction.
good,"A typical day of work is keeping busy with many applications reviewed,learned to deal with different type of people and their personalities, management was great and very professional, everyone works together as a team for a more efficient way or resolving working matters, the most enjoyable part of this job was knowing that at the end of a day a difference was made in helping someone."
good,"A great company to learn, make friends, and grow personally!"
good,Good solid company but difficult environment for advancement. I was able to expand my knowledge in recycling and environmental solutions.
good,"I am not a permenant employee, so this job is cool for what its worth. I dont really have anything bad to say it is just okay nothing special"

good,Waste Management is a great place to work for. There is plenty of room for advancement.
good,"very long days, preached safety but expected high productivity"
good,hectic work days with things changing constantly. good pay.
good,I enjoyed my time there up until they had a massive Corp wide layoff of all managerial positions.  They also cut a lot of local jobs where we had people that dealt with customers and they developed a bond with them.  Now customers need to call one place where none knows their name or where they are from.
good,"very good challenging,  a  lot of learning options, working with less qualifies people and taking desired results. learning of management skills, lead a team of 500 people."
good,I was under the assumption there would be more room for career advancement but since being with the company my only move for advancement would lead me in a direction that would take  away from my family or completley  up root my family
good,"Working with Waste Management as a Driver helper is straight forward and fast paced."
good,Waste management is a great company to work for good benefits and pay    Management are pretty good with helping solve problems or address issues      It is a physically demanding job in all climates   This job is definitely not for the weak     I was there for 13 years until an accident   If not for that I’d still be at waste management
good,"The full-time/permanent employees are great people, willing to assist in certain duties if needed. Work can be strenuous at times, although I enjoy hard work."
good,When I first started with them it was a nice experience . As the year progress there  was little advanced opportunity which left me doubtful that I could excel with the company
good,Waste Management is a good company to work for. Their benefits are good. They have opportunity for growth. Co-workers become family. The support for your co-workers are above and beyond. These people become friends for life.
good,You have to be ready an think for this job an me I'm good at it. I take pride in everything I do so I would say it's a good job but you just got to continue.
good,"Good pay for good work.  Opportunity for overtime is always there.  Holiday pay and paid vacation. Benefits, including health insurance and retirement are a plus."
good,Great starter job and easy to move around within the company as long as you put in the hard work. Attendence policy is a little strict they do not care about your personal lives.
good,its could be fun for a little while but it gets old but they have good benefits health care and all they'll help you get your CDL if you wanna Drive the trucks
good,The following is only based on my experience. I will say that as a hole WM was a great company and I was great full for the opportunity. I however was the lead tech/only tech at my shop with the oldest equipment. I worked an average of 60-75 hours a week. Great pay but no time to spend it.
good,Best job I ever had could have used better management job is running mid October 19 and shop could have used a few more certified mech .over all it was fairly good place to work
good,How you start your day is exactly how it will go in this field of work. What steps this job offer will be the drivers you work with that bring light on your experience..
good,My coworkers were my favorite part of the job. also the work environment was pretty good. Very laid back . The hardest part of the job is that it is repetitive.
good,It was a great company paid good gave plenty of hrs got a lot of overtime it was professional I would work there again they care about the people that work there
good,"Things are changing with new Leadership team but old habits will take some time to change."
good,Started at 3 a.m. got done by 1 p.m. stand on the line and sort out recycling from trash kept the line going fast area kept clean very fast paced environment
good,Descent place to be. Good money. Bad home to work balance. Hard place to be if you value home time with kids. Little career advancement. If your good at your route you will stay there because your good. Not slot of incentive to succeed
good,A relaxed job but can get pretty stressful but a great starter job. Much room for you to raise up into rank. I love it but defiantly wouldn’t stay for a career
good,Great company just the manager I had at the plant I work was the problem many people and supervisors quit the job. In the y at and a Half we went thru 6 supervisors and uncountable employees all for the same reason MANAGER. But over all great company and great coworkers
good,"Some days you just want to come into the office and do your work and go home.  Too many people walking up to your desk and asking for one off favors instead of opening a ticket to have it worked on accordingly.  Supervisors are more organized and give better direction than many managers.  I reported to a different person at least once a year.  The turnover is constant.  Stability at the management level would be great and promote a better culture there.  "
good,"Waste Management is a great company doing great things for the environment while making a nice profit margin.  The bonuses were awesome.  The company is very innovative on the technology side of things and doing a lot more than you would think a trash company would do.  I was fortunate to have great leadership and management to report directly to.  The company has a serious push to get the stock values way up.  And they have moved a lot. The down side is that we were seriously overworked and under resourced to get the job done.  We also had virtually no budget for training per individual.  The leadership was very supportive of family and family issues as they popped up.  They also allowed some work at home days and allowed for us to adapt schedules as needed when I did volunteer work in the community. The only complaint I have is that they overwork the staff they have and are not showing any signs of improving in that area at all.  But your helping the environment and making a profit at the same time, that is something to be proud of, and my kids were proud that I was doing that too.  I was constantly challenged in the technologies, troubleshooting and never had a moment to get bored.  We rotated duties in alignment with best practices every couple of years or so and that also helped keep things interesting. They were also exceptionally supportive if a family member or an employee got seriously ill, they stood behind you and adapted the schedule as needed.  "
good,The hardest part of this job is dealing with the smell of it and if you can get through that you should be fine. And you also have to deal with a lot of attitudes but you have that at every job.
good,Great digital experience focused on technology innovation to delight customers and meet both the business and digital goals. Great digital teams working in agile methodology taking on many initiatives/projects.
good,"Excellent job to have.Very friendly employees. Culture of safety will be adhered too."
good,I loved this job. Was hard work but the pay was fair and the company offered a lot of benefits to the employees. I wish I still had this job good company to work for.
good,Great place to work great people just no room for advancement the pay can be low for some of the position. Upper management is not the best. they tell you that they prompt from with in but its not true.
good,Did payroll for salaried and hourly personnel.  Enjoyed the position.  Enjoyed coworkers.  I was confident of my knowledge of my position.  Enjoyed the interaction with coworkers regarding their payroll and benefit inquiries.
good,Waste Management has great benefits! They care about their employees but being a hopper is hard work!  I have made good friends within the company and if you don't mind lots of running in ANY kind of weather and heavy lifting its a decent job.
good,WM has started a Coal Ash remediation group and is learning how different it is from Landfill operations. They are very good in the waste business. They have a great push for safety culture and the environmental aspects.They provide great heavy equipment for use on projects.
good,"they are hard to work for they watch you all the time and have other company follw you and see if you are doing any wrong if caught you could lose your job or get points that they give you,"
good,"I would suggest this to others. I just don’t have much to say about them is all. But they are a good place for others, again I’m looking for a moved up position in my career life is all. (:"
good,"If you don't mind working full time and overtime then its a great place to work, sometimes super busy but sometimes super slow. Mostly work with men, very hard to change your schedule"
good,"Working at WM was a great experience, with great people and high integrity.  If you have the driver to succeed you will be awarded for your efforts.  I was proud to be associated with such a great place."
good,"Call Center setting, handled inbound commercial calls, assisted commercial customers with special projects for disposal service, as well as handled all billing and service calls. Each opportunity to convert call to a sale. Have to be honest at times it is hard to sale dumpsters when Waste Management is the leading disposal company with the highest rates and at times pre existing customer are aware they can demand the floor rate to avoid loosing the sale.  The overall culture is tricky, either people are awesome and like family or people are unfriendly, dishonest or unethical, pretty cut throat, and back stabbers, and quick to throw others  under the bus. In eleven years we under went 3 call center supervisors, current supervisor (mircomanage) and the turn over rate is extremely high.  On the other hands some members of Management & HR can be pretty cool."
good,"Workload can be hectic at first until one learns how to operate the system. One will learn the differences between hazardous, and non-hazardous material. The management is fair, and the workplace culture is dusty. The hardest part of the job is the work culture."
good,I enjoyed working at Waste Management unfortunately due to a family emergency I had to leave my position.   It could be stressful at times.    Training needs worked on along with some Management.    More work for employees than can be handled properly which can be stressful at times
good,"Started day with a meeting with supervisor to discuss safety and planned jobs for the day. Performed repairs on schedule and brake down trucks. I learned a lot from on the job experience and available training. Management was fair, they would help with information, and getting equipment to make jobs easier. Most of the people were easy to get along with on sharing information and helping each other, there was some what of a turn over of employees. The hardest thing of the job was keeping up with brake downs and some of the planned jobs. Most enjoyable things of the job was learning new things of the trade and getting to know some of the other employees."
good,early starts and late nights picking up residential trash and recycle items. the benifits and the pay were not the best but where comparable with other companies in the industry.
good,Always felt like my head was on the chopping block when i moved to Birmingham. Had to cover several shifts as manager myself because of the lack of technicians or supervisors. In the end it was the running shorthanded that did me in.
good,Not hard work and slow at times but overall it is a good place to work. The management is good and attentive to the employees. It is an easy job and our coworkers and super nice
good,"Great job for a starting out mechanic to grow into. Work can be a bit repetitive, but makes managing your shift easier, Training was 2 weeks paid and well worth it, ASE test reimbursement is nice."
good,I like the people i worked with but i didn't like the work i did as for running and picking up trash bins. They should have better ways then us jumping out the truck and stuff.
good,Was always pressured to finish route at a ridicules time by my router manager. Was pushed to the limits of all the rules and safety road regulations. was under lots of stress at times.
good,"Benefits are very good,  working saturdays after a holiday for straight time sucks. Get passed the smell and maggots and its not bad. Tool allowance, rewards program"
good,Good benefits. Hard work. You work very long hours. Can be frustrating with the heavy traffic in the cities.Good thorogh training. Prepares you to be safety conscience.
good,"This company helped me gain invaluable management experience.  I was able to learn how to manage, decipher budget deficiencies, and how to correct those issues."
good,"Great place to work, enjoyed coworkers and the job I did.  Learned how to effectively communicate with customers and to maintain excellent customer relationships."
good,"I am not interested in reviewing Waste Management. I currently work there and I do not want to do or say anything to deal with my current position."
good,"It was basically first come first served . We would make it to the job sight at 5 am clock in and hope we had a truck to get on. So if we didn't have a truck we basically had to sit and hope a worker tap out. But, if u had a truck it was a long workout of riding on the back of the truck jumping off and on for about 8 hrs or however long the route was that particular day."
good,"Quick decision making early in the morning, able to react and adjust to truck breakdowns and route completion to assure all costumers are serviced daily."
good,If you enjoy customer service this is the job for you. If you dont you won't enjoy working here. There are opportunities for growth but you have to earn it
good,Great environment to learn sales. Good culture and training. Not much room for career advancement. Vacation and PTO time are not  with the time compared to other companies. Need to be more competitive in this area to attract better talent.
good,Fast pace work.  You often have to go help others finish their routes.  I often had issues with management not sending help when needed.  It is so face paced and the trash route will wear on the body and mind and it is easy to get burned out.  There are other positions at the company that are not as bad as residential trash routes but the company does not rotate drivers to experience that.
good,The only reason i left this job was because i was in the medical waste portion of the company.I had just recently had my baby boy.. and it was a very dirty job. Didnt want the possibilty of something gross being on me. and getting on him.
good,As a single mother working at Waste Management provided good work-life balance for me. While at Waste Management I was able to grow my skills in Sales Operations Support.
good,"On the oilfield side of waste management the job is very much lots of action followed by periods of down time.  There is very little work life balance.  I would keep my phone on all the time.  It was not a problem, but there was times you did not get any sleep because people calling all the time."
good,"Very safe work environment, fast work , good benefits. Need to work on fixing management skills. But over all I wish I never left. You can't go back, you can only look forward."
good,Start early in the morning 430 and typically get finished by 430 pm. Plenty of overtime and excellent benefits. Very fast paced and stressful atmosphere
good,"Plenty of room for advancement with the company, as long as you're not in a union shop. Management varies, they're a nation wide company. Everyone in my shop worked well together. I left because I didn't like the shift or commute."
good,"I have good benefits for the worker,good place to established a career, but is to hard to be promote to growth with the company, even if you hard worker."
good,Was supposed to be hired on at the raceland location. Was hired on in harvey location. So quite a drive with no compensation for that. Other than that its alright.
good,Great people to work with. Company is safety driven. Too many corporate initiatives. Start early and work late. Do not apply if you are afraid of work. Managers required to wear many hats.
good,I loved working at waste management. The people were so welcoming and helped me get use to the job fast. Its an amazing job for someone who loves to be outdoors in all working conditions and not in a warehouse or a factory all day.
good,"I effectively organized prospective clients by developing sound marketing plans and maintaining key information in the prospect database. I worked with legal sales contracts between Waste Management and private and government businesses."
good,the work conditions affected my health. Even though given the proper equipment after two weeks my hand developed rashes. A week more and they started to rot.  The tips of my fingers started to die and lose feeling.We were given masks that were useless against the airborne particles causing use to sneeze a black substance. The job was ok but my health was more important.
good,Great place to work until purchased by another company. New management rifted current management and the 401K and retirement were bankrupt. Lost everything.
good,"It was a good job with good benefits, the work is really hard and you don't get compensated for working harder then anyone. They will expect the world out of you and wont give out the dollars. but overall this company will get you by. if you need a good job and ready to give 100 percent apply"
good,"I drove truck through residential area to pick up trash on a daily basis, physically demanding job, in all weather conditions."
good,Workplace culture was very monotonous - lots of phone calls from angry customers/residents. Hardest part of the job was answering 75 to 125 calls a day.
good,"It has many advantages, such as great benefits and pay, but the commute time to downtown is not good. Also, the management is sub-par. Not much room for advancement, but that could also be the department I was in. If they would consider letting employees telecommute sometimes, it would be a great job. Otherwise, it's just ok."
good,Hourly pay was good along with lots of hours but not family oriented at all.  It is a big company and you are nothing but a number to them
good,"Good company. Great benifits. Lots of overtime and rules to keep you safe. Loved working on my own. Keep in mind, you need to be ok with the Drive-Cams."
good,Very well respected company with plenty of room for advancement. A great place to gain experience and knowledge of heavy equipment operations. As well as knowledge of osha regulations
good,"It was a great learning experience . I learned time management skills . A typical day would consist of a morning meeting, pre-trip of inspection of my truck then starting rout at the set time given by your employer . Proving waste or recycle removal service within accordance with the time given by employers. The hardest part of the job is when you have trouble with your truck are it brakes down.The guys I woke with were like a time who help to get the job done."
good,"Had a great manager in my last position. Very accomodating and professional. Great benefits, worked with good people."
good,"Overall liked the job working in an factory facility, Ive learned certain skills to move forward in my career. The hardest part of the job was the first day of learning everything which quickly I caught on and got the hang of things"
good,"being a cashier seemed fairly simple to me, I took orders and served it to the customer after the assembly people prepared the food."
good,"The trucks ran well and were maintained regularly.  All necessary tools were provided to do the job well.  It was hard work, but very honest work."
good,"Too many regulations makes it unfriendly place but it's still a good place to work on the overall."
good,"Great place to work but, it can be hard on family life at times.  Pay is good and they treat you fair.  Other drivers are willing to help you when you need it."
good,"I have learned a lot about safety on an entire new level, the dangers that  occur of working in the oil field and how you and your team has to be alert at all times."
good,"A typical day at work from start to finish was basically driving the truck and pitching garbage, switching with my partner every half hour or so when not working with a TO.  I learned to be a team player and work professionally in safely picking up and disposing of garbage.  "
good,"I would get picked up from my house around 3:30-4pm (after school) and be brought to the job site for the day, go on a truck, start working, get dropped back off at home."
good,"My day to day operations are within the Contingent Labor Program at Waste Management. I assist with coordinating moving parts of multiple projects and the administrative responsibilities that accompany those projects. I work with a team that is very proactive towards achieving the results as specified by our business leaders / partners. The most challenging and rewarding experience of my job is trying to keep the status of the projects updated, which turns out to be the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"good job have no complaints, good hrs over timeis good they work with you people are good they really know what there doing."
good,"interesting work place in where I can grow and develop many skills because every day has different challenges. co-workers are so friendly, working with them is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,Enjoyed working at Waste Management. Learned about exporting and enjoyed my duties. Co-workers were great to work with. The hardest part of the job was working with different personalities.
good,"Trained 40 to 100 students, up to six classes a day. Taught water conservation, Astronomy, and STEM classes. Great working staff with backup help."
good,"Account manager of 450 med to large clients."
good,"Responsible for sorting trash, metal, and recyclables from clean cardboard and paper off of a moving conveyor belt. The ultimate goal being to produce clean paper and cardboard bales. Maintain machinery and floor housekeeping in a swift and diligent manner. Lifting objects over 50 lbs on a regular basis. Successfully maintaining stamina while moving my upper body and standing up essentially for the extent of each shift. Lock out/tag out trained and certified."
good,"What can you say ...."
good,"Assist in overseeing daily call center operations, quality monitoring, disciplinary actions, coaching, escalated issues and resolutions.  Assist in overseeing approximately 30 on site employees, 5 digital care representatives, and worked closely with our third party vendor WEST representatives for coaching, quality and escalated issues.  Worked as department liaison for billing, operations, sales, public sector and data entry.  Also, department business analyst for Siebel platform (customer service management platform) and Green Pages (customer service knowledge base.  Worked closely with corporate team analysts to help test, modify, update and develop new customer service platform."
good,"Loved working at  Waste Management, worked there for 11 years.  The only thing that I did not like is some managers would hire family members and that caused issues with the rest of the employees."
good,"It was not a terrible job to have, however management would ignore employee needs in such a manner as to barrage arrogance to their fellow employee."
good,the job is not bad. the biggest problem is the mgt. and your truck will brake down almost everyday. this happens to everyone.
good,I enjoyed getting to know the customers. enjoyed knowing the drivers and getting to know their families. I learned how to react to a situation calmly
good,overall a good company to work for and good team environments.
good,"Have you worked overnights? This is not that, but you could say it is."
good,"WM is a good job with excellent benifits.  In my experience, once you are comfortable with the job and able to do everything that is expected of you, the work life balance is not bad.  New programs are being put into action to help drive efficiency and drive out lag time that is putting a lot on the plates of the Route Mangers.  Due to a corporate resturce, many of the opportunites have been cut in half.  So if you are not willing to move and uproot your family, advancement is limited."
good,The corporate headquarters may have well been down a few blocks from Wall St. Although that is the job of the upper management to increase the worth of the stock for the stock holders many of us feel they had no problems sacrificing some to please Wall St investors.
good,"Inbound call center, receive between 60-80 call a day, Very High pace work environment. What I have learn with my time with my employer,every customer is different and how we handle each customer issues. Management is great with employees, they have an open door policy if any issues would come up. My follow co-workers are good as to helping out one another. The hardest part of the job when we are unable to provide the customer needs, there are times that we could be out of trash conatiners or if we made a billing error and we are unable to adjust billing that might affect there property tax. The most enjoyable part of the job are the people you come into contact with on a everyday bases. If a customer request for a payment extension we are able to help the customer. Container replacement when customer containers are stolen or if there is an emeregency with damage containers."
good,Good company to work for. Very safety conscious. Takes good care of their trucks.
good,Enjoyed my time at the company and enjoyed my position. The work days flew by. People were great.
good,"became environmentally conscious and a serious recycler, good people i worked with, customer satisfaction was number one"
good,I enjoyed working there. I was very busy and I had approximately 22 drivers a day that I dispatched work to daily.  I learned to multi-task and prioritize my work. Good management and good co-workers.
good,Any standard day can range from a simple PM to welding floors to an in-frame rebuild. Most days are worked with zero supervision. A very difficult part of this job is communication. It does not exist.
good,could be an awesome place to work if the catch up their procedures with their expectations
good,"busy fast paced always changing.  Managers are very nice but you will every minute of the day there.  Time flys when having fun,"
good,"definetly good place to learn new things ,its a big corporation so things are always changing,management is open minded and easy to get along.the hardest part of my job is that it keeps me away from my kids and wife."
good,In Florida it was good.
good,Diverse work force. Flexable work schedule allowed us to work from home when needed.
good,"A typical day is very fast paced, I work on issues that are time sensitive. Everyday is a new learning experience, I learned that good customer service is a must, I use each interaction with our clients as a model to improve the overall level of the service that I provide. Management is very approachable and I am confident in their leadership skills. I work with a great team, where everyone is truly always willing to lend a helping hand and you look forward to going to work everyday. The hardest part of my job is lack of training in specific areas. The most enjoyable part of my job is working for a company that is evolving and understands its impact on the environment."
good,learning to sort differnt things out the trash and working the line
good,This is a stable company to work for with smart and strong leadership. Efforts are being made to grow the company.
good,"I really enjoy working at Waste Management, however, at the end of January, 2013 our call center is closing."
good,Waste Management would treat thier drivers like family. When I was done with my route I could go help others with thiers. giving me the option to go home early or not. which almost never happend
good,Policy and procedures would change on a daily basis. Our department consisted of 18 reps so we were like family.
good,Started off as a regular driver and 2 years later became a relief driver. got route sheets from dispatch in the morning. sequence new starts and put them in order. once on route i picked up trash in a timely matter while providing good customer service. first trash job i had so i really learned the whole metro area goegraphically. very physical work with lots of overtime.
good,Training definitely needs improvement geared to specific job. Not everyone is hired as an Inside Sales Rep so they need to work on tailoring their training to fit individual job descriptions.
good,"Not much to complain about, except for management on the local level. That was the main reason I left the company."
good,A large company that lacks a well-defined culture and does not provide stability and advancement opportunities for all employees.
good,"good hard working job, long days but good pay for what you do friendly management, safety concious"
good,I had the ability to travel and meet alot of great people. The job had alot of benefits for those who wanted to go and get them.
good,Waste Management is a great company to work for. It is impressive they are able to maintain a people first approach given the overall size of the company
good,Work is demanding and you will get dirty and be prepared for smelly conditions. Company equipment is dated and always in need of repair but is always safe. This company strives to provide a very very safe place to work and will not tolerate unsafe practices. Safety policies are no joke. Safety policies are followed to the letter and you never feel like you are in danger. This company tends to micromanage some things from corporate but this tends to be a trend with larger corporations.
good,"Un des emploies que j'ai énormément aimé, malheureusement le salaire pour le travail et les longues heurs sans pause est beaucoup trop bas. M Un arrêt de travail de trois mois en hiver. Sinon je serai encore là."
good,I liked WateManagement when I was there it was fun for me I loved the company energy. I wouldn't mind going back. I was young in didn't Kno dat I really wanted at da time but that was a great opportunity
good,"Bad hours,decent pay, good benefits,training okay.Hard work and long hour's.Overtimes a plus,Good medical insurance,dental and vision"
good,"Waste management is a nice job 2 start off with.the pay is nice and the environment is stable.but that job is 4 people who are afraid 2 be around containable garbage and doesnt have any problem Being around certain rodents (rats,owls,etc.).i have nothing against the job.but I'm the type of person who looks after my health in the long-term also!!"
good,"Overall a good company. Benefits are great.  Pay is very good.  However, the company is turning to total management through metrics.  There is some disconnect between what is preached and what is expected."
good,This is a very good place to work except the equipment stinks and you are expected to do more than your job management is very driver motivated If you are willing to work past your job
good,Good work great experience fast pace no one breathing down ur neck always work never slow some times it's hard to take a lunch you deal with a lot of people
good,Great company great employees for the most part. It was a 2 hour drive for me everyday to work I did not enjoy. I felt my job was great but my boss seemed to let 2 lazy self righteous employees dictate the environment for container repair. Besides that work was good
good,Don't feel the pay is equivalent. Emptying the recycling trolleys is not easy it takes a lot of energy and fitness to be able to carry out the days work this means healthy eating is a must remuneration rate doesn't cover cost when you have young children
good,Waste management is a good place to work for. The problem is management communication some of the rules are to get locked over because you lost a lot of good employees who did the job .It doesn’t matter how loyal you’re  to the job  you feel like you’re expendable .
good,"Steady work, pay is not very fair. Raises are nonexistent. Great benefits. Equipment is fairly decent. Great team members to work with. Lots of rules, harsh consequences if they are broken, can result loss of job."
good,Waste management was a good company to work for coming out of the Military usmc great opportunity to advance my career very safety conscious company work hard play hard.
good,you have to want to be able to work. long hours with constant lifting and running and active movements. A typical day at work is get there at 6am and work until maybe 5 to 7 pm on a normal day.
good,Nice pay and benefits but poor culture . Management is terrible and only concerned with numbers and productivity.  No set schedule on a daily basis and uncertain hours
good,Positive environment with trustworthy colleagues. Consideration for diverse perspectives. Best part is the people. Worst part is the lack of specific performance goals or performance coaching. Another part that needs improvement is the discrepancy of pay for women and shortage of women in leadership roles.
good,Worked long hours. But no opportunity to move up. Manager had his favorites and preferred to use then rather than give a new guy a shot at being able to move up on the company
good,"The work itself is pretty mundane, but it wasn't challenging. Often you'll have a lot of time to occupy. Coworkers are great for the most part. Company is competitive and offers decent benefits and pension."
good,Fun job. Fast paced. Most people are cool like to work together. The trucks suck and always break down severe lack of management. Great pay great benifits
good,"There will be good times, there will be difficult times. But no time that’s impossible to work through. Excellent choice of employment. Would recommend"
good,"Waste Management is a good place to work if you're single and have no bills.  Management is great and they work with you everyday to see what you need and how you're doing, but you will be micromanaged.  Safety is a huge priority and you will be tired at the end of the day, especially if you're in rear load."
good,"This was one of my first jobs, I learned to talk to customers on a daily basis. Answered a high volume of calls daily 80-100 developed excellent learning skills. My duties included general clerical tasks, such as drafting documents and answering telephones, as well as administrative jobs, including scheduling and project management."
good,"loved working here, however managers or supervisors very inconsiderate, they have no experience as drivers, so they do not comprehend any of the daily challenges working as a driver especially in residential."
good,"Accomplishments"
good,It was a very fast paced place to work at yes it was very dirty and it would get really hot or cold not enough protection was offered in my opinion cause several of us got staff infection
good,The company had great benefits and a good reputation.  It was a great company to work for while gaining experience to move up in ones career.  Extremely challenging and rewarding.
good,Spent many years at WM and loved most of it. I would go back in a heartbeat. The only negative is that the results driven culture occasionally offers short sided management tactics.
good,"Come into work at 5:30, wait to be assigned to a route with a specific truck and driver. Go out to your route and pick-up all curb side trash from road and empty all trash can . Work till 12:00 pm take an hour lunch, get back to work and continue working your assigned route until its finished. There wasn't no hard part of the job. Enjoyable part was so much overtime to receive."
good,"Salary and benefits were wonderful at Waste Management. My Customers were the most enjoyable part of my job. Being able to help them solve issues that they were having rather it be contract issues, billing issues or service issues. It was fulfilling at the end of the day to know that I was able to resolve their problem and change their outlook of the company in most cases."
good,"a lot of good people here.  many different areas to explore, profitability and margins are of huge importance.  Great place to cut out and work a plant.  management gives lots of room for learning"
good,"WM is a nice place to work. We have an excellent CEO and leadership team that delivers on their commitments to the company.  Depending on the department, opportunities for growth can be limited."
good,Some of the people that I work with are very nice and friendly and are willing to  help you when u need the help. And some of the  Managers are nice. Over all it's a nice place to work at
good,"Lack of leadership at times. Slow to get issues taken care of. Management has a lack of communication all away around. Management have lack communication with workers."
good,"Had a chance to grow and learn with Waste Management. Working for corporate was more of a challenge than working at the regional level. Felt more part of the company at the regional level."
good,"Fast paced, no recognition. Poor attitudes by co workers from being overworked and underpaid. Cut Throat Supervision. "
good,Takes care of the bills. good pay from any department. All of our top competitors pay more however for same roles. WM is more customer obsessed than Employee . 1 of the main reason reasons for leaving
good,Been working here for one month. Management is good and you get your hours if you looking for overtime. A lot of people complain but they haven’t left. Think they like to hear their selves talk
good,Good pay but was very unfair to their drivers. Would recommend but be cautious. The company will work you very long hours and advancement is almost rare.
good,"Good people to work with. They have a 9-80 program where you work 80 hours in 9 days then you can choose to have Friday or Monday off. In addition, they are flexible on the time you start your day as long as you are consistent, and it's within 7 AM to 9 AM."
good,A typical day would run  smooth. Management not all that friendly. The hardest part of the job is trying to finish your route in time. The most enjoyable part of the job was working for a good company.

You have a lot of freedom to plan your days/weeks as you see fit. The job will definitely teach you time management and organizational skills.

Variety of employees that I was paired up with as a temp worker, but enjoyed the changes in people and routes."
good,I worked for Deffenbaugh origionally. When waste took over they eliminated a lot of our jobs and moved them to their headquarters in chicago. This included essentially all positions but the drivers.
good,"WM is a good place to work and has a good corporate culture.  However, depending on your role, there is not much room for upward advancement.  Management seems to stay in place until retirement, leaving few opportunities for those that want to advance."

good,"I did enjoy my time in the office at WM and built relationships with my co-workers and worked on bridging gaps between departments.

good,"take about 70 calls a day "
good,"A typical day at work Includes picking up paper work, checking my truck, and servicing customers. I have learned management, operation, customer service, and communication skills. Management was fairly poor and did not work with their employees to solve issues. Co-workers were fun and everyone got along great when working as a team to get a job done. The hardest part of my job was long driving hours and dealing with weather on the job. The most enjoyable part of my job was social interaction with customers."
good,"From the time you logged into the phones until you left for the day you were kept busy, there no down times between phone calls. Working at Waste Management is a fast paced working environment and the people you work with try to help each other. There is a need for more help when calls need to be escalated, there needs to be more leads to assist the reps on the phones with the more complicated issues that cannot be resolved with the tools at hand or at the customers requests to speak with a supervisor they should be able to do so. But overall Waste Management does recognize their employees and treats their employees very well."
good,Very involved in development. Enjoyable place to work with good technology.Coworkers are trained well and management works with all of the workers and very accommodating.
good,It's okay place to work to make a weekly quick pay check. The guys are cool they need to just hire in the temps that been there for 8 - 10 years.
good,I love the people I work with and what the company stands for but they do not compensate their employees well and they are a company that does very well financially.
good,Corporate orientated.  Provided training for all duties. Employees were easy to work with and fun.  I learned a lot about corporations and customer accounts.
good,Waste Management is a great place to work with lots of hours and overtime and the staff is easy to get along with.  I am just looking for something with the ability to work from home.
good,In charge of doing vehicle inspection on trucks before and after work shifts. Driving class A residential dump trucks servicing customers residence or locations dispose of all solid waste
good,A typical day at Waste Management Definitely consists of Endurance. Spending a lot of time in the sun performing the job. So staying hydrated was mandatory. I learned how to use different equipment and how demonstrate good team work. The Co-Workers are very down to earth and eager to get the job done as well. The hardest part is working in the weather condition but nonetheless it wasn't such a hassle to get the job done.
good,"Typical day with this employer, as a call center was to answer incoming phone calls and to demonstrate the ability of out standing customer service skills, to identify the customers needs and concerns, to set up permanent and temporary accounts, to negotiate contracts, to up sell, manage accounts, in a fast paced environment, what I had learned from this position is to treat a customer how I would like to be treated, to have empathy when needed, to truly understand and know what the customer is in need of, let them know that I was there to take care of them to the best of my ability, to simply take ownership of that call, and with my co-workers I have learned the best way to manage the flow of the office was team work, the hardest part of this position was time flow, calls were timed and watched by Supervisors every minute of the day, had to request through email to floor support or supervisor for time to outbound call to a customer if they were having issues, and most times did not get a response back for a whole day, when customers needs needed to be met the same day, thought this was poor management, the thing I enjoyed the most is the people I worked with,as they were willing to help out in those tough times and I could always count on my piers."
good,"The most enjoyable part of job was the people. Particularly my direct report.  I have been blessed to have always had great supervisors."
good,"A typical day in  the life of a garbage man.  Generally starts early in the morning with clock in times ranging from 400-430 for the drivers.  After a briefing in the morning we do our pre trip on the trucks where we check air pressure, fluids, mechanical functionality of pumps and hydraulics, check lights and brakes for safe operation.  As a mentor it has made me a better driver as it has made me think more about the position and the reasons why we do things the way we do.  For the most part the bulk of the workers there are great with similar goals. I have bonded with a few drivers that seem to stick together when someone breaks down they call us and we come and clean up a route so its not laying the next day...Wow, Teamwork....something that is lost sometimes but is an important part of the business.  Hardest part of the job is just to persevere...your not always going to have a working truck or have a route that allows you to be off at a certain time.  This job enables you to work outside of an office but still be the manager of your own route.  This job allows you to see all the beautiful days of the year as well as all the bad ones as well.  I wouldn't have it any other way.  I love being out there as my own boss.  Its unreal the amount of people that see the garbage or recyclers as rockstars of the neighborhood.  Kids will comeout week after week standing in the rain or snow just for a glimpse of the garbage truck and a subtle blow of the air horn."
good,"A great place to work, it is one of the fastest growing company in India. The work environment of the company is good. People feel proud to be part of company as company provides full support to their employees in professional front. It has cross the branches in the world. So, I have a good opportunity to show my talent."
good,"Working here you will find many moving parts effecting the whole.  There are multiple departments interacting daily.  One should have the ability to multi-task and be prepared to negotiate.  Generally, the compensation is very good.  There are many and varied aspects to most jobs to keep them from being boring.  Older software is challenging at times.  Many long term co-workers with a helpful attitude overall."
good,"I started really early in the morning, Learned driving from the right side and using the smith system driving. Barely seen co-workers or management but when I everyone was very friendly. The hardest part of the job was rainy days were difficult to work in but not impossible. The most enjoyable part was doing the job because i like working hard."
good,pre/post trip about an hour at yard. head to route start your maps and get done to help fellow employees asap.
good,"A typical day would be clock in, visit with manager for a few minutes, fix a cup of tea, then get to work.  We had plenty of work to keep us busy, and before you knew it, it was break time.  Nice people to visit with on break, TV in break room, 3 microwaves, vending machines, free fountain soda, coffee, tea.  After break, back to work until lunch time.  We could get up and walk around in between, if needed.  Then lunch.  Really no where to go around there, so bring your own, or there were a few places that would deliver.  After lunch, clock back in and back to it.  Varied job responsibilities made for an enjoyable afternoon, and then break time.  Back to work, and time to go home!!!!!!  The bad thing about the job is all that is left are drivers, ops clerks and transfer station due to downsizing.  There are plenty of office jobs in Chicago or Phoenix if willing to relocate."
good,If you want to work at a place where your a number not an employee and where you know you are VERY expendable. This job is just for you

good,Really good place to work with great co-workers until much cheaper competition came our area and then there were many layoffs and the job became unstable.
good,"Great people that really care about their work and the customers they serve. Workload can be heavy at times, and hourly workers often work overtime.  Benefits are very good, but not a lot of time off.  Management and work culture can vary by location."
good,"My time at WM was a very good learning experience where I learned to grow and continue my education in a professional business environment. Assignments were challenging, and the hours could stretch into the evening hours, but at the end of the week all issues were resolved and I would leave knowing that my efforts were worth their time."
good,"Co-workers are an fun group of people. They are sociable, easy to get along with, and very helpful. It is a fairly difficult work environment with fair management."
good,"Early start with every day being a new day.  Great colleagues and management.  Met many friends, some the kind that will last forever."
good,"40 hour weeks"
good,"Everything about working at Wast Management was great, except management. We went through many different supervisors during a small period of time. Coworkers were great. You get used to getting up early and get your day going and coming home at a decent time."
good,The constant revolution of accounting made and kept the position interesting and challenging.
good,I never knew people could get so upset about garbage. I handle incoming calls from customers about there garbage service. Customer complaints and trouble shooting. Had to do it in a timely fashion. Inputed customer information.
good,I really enjoyed this job but after months of working I realized I wanted to advance my career so I quit and attended a truck driving school to obtain a Class A CDL.

good,long hours. hazardous conditions. learned principle of hydraulic systems. stressful at times. co workers were very knowledgeable .hardest part of job was biological hazards. enjoyed the family type environment.
good,Love working outdoors and this job but looking for more opportunity to advance.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of phone answering, job entering and scheduling and then dispatching to drivers.  When the run sheets were finalized, they were printed and I collated and stapled them.  The hardest part of the job was when we were slow, it was hard to keep busy.  All the staff at the time were interesting and respectful-the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,Waste Managament is a good place to work. the Enviroment is supportive and the benefits are great.
good,"A typical day would start with a pretrip of the service truck then would work on any unfinished business that was left over from the prior day. Would normally get a service call between  9:00am and 10:00am  would drive to job site and check operation of the unit, most of the time it would be a hyd. issue like a busted hose which was common place for the self contain units, but sometimes there would be an electrical issue that would require trouble shooting the electrical system. Sometimes it would require two techs to repair the problem. On installs it would take up most of the day which was a break from running calls all day. This sometimes required some welding fabrication. At the end of the day I would try to finish up the last job then head back too the shop and complete any left over paper work then posttrip the service truck..."
good,"Worked as head of the receivables department, handling all cancelled accounts, and write offs.  Represented company in small claims court in law suits process to assist in recovery for overdue amounts as well as to enforce breech of contract for liquidated damages.  Process all releases and processed Claim of Liens as to protect company's interest."

good,"Waste management was a decent company to work for, they offer great benefits an vacation time. The company has great opertunity to advance. However the employees are over managed, Employees are not given the chance to add new an fresh business practices."
good,"We would start by coming in the morning and find out that a driver had called in sick, and knowing that there are'nt any extra drivers to cover their route, then we have to manage and re-route everyone else"
good,"The good- Excellent benefits, in fact, none better. In Tucson we were union. You paid zero for health insurance, even if you had 6 wives and 40 kids. You also did not pay a single deductible for hospital, doctor visits, or prescriptions . Life insurance was also company paid 100% for $250k. You could add more for very little. Dental insurance wasn't quite as great, $1500.00 per year was free, but still decent. Decent vacation and sick leave."
good,"I worked for the VP of HR and the HR Manager for Atlanta Metro. I also covered for the Executive Assistant to the Regional VP in her absence. I worked very independently, following up on tasks assigned by the either manager.

good,"It’s a difficult job you’re dealing with trash first of all and You have to work in all climate conditioning Hot, Cold, Rain Storms but  pays good and good benefits and mostly new equipment not so good management"
good,Waste management is a great place to work and the pay and benefits are also very good for the area. The only downside the company has is that it’s hard to move to a day shift as there are not that many techs that work there so someone has to leave for that to happen. And you get paid for all tour over time you work but you work it a lot so it’s hard to have much of a work/family/friends balance. Also you work a lot of the holidays and you really don’t get much for time off. Other then that great job and great people to work with.
good,They recognize job experience and promote based on that experience.  Ask your guidance on certain jobs they haven't done.  I would return to this company if asked to.
good,"There is sense of empowerment because you are given the accolades when you do great and corrective action when your performance is to the contrary. "
good,"it doesnt change much, you go in and do the same thing everyday, you build a routine. Management usually leaves you alone as long as you are doing your job efficiently"
good,"Great opportunity with very helpful environment, nice colleagues, always try to help or teach you. Unfortunately, is fast changing business and lots of colleagues move to different company or seek more relaxed jobs. Great experience with Nuclear sites like LLWR, really enjoying that experience and appreciated working collaboratively with them. Their is a lack of management, thus many colleagues left and some including me were made redundant."
good,"Was a very good place to work, management was great!  There was no respect from the clients in the commercial part of the job they were the worst. Residential is the way to go."
good,The job helped me in a lot of areas and taught me a lot. No room for advancement so it was time to leave. Overall I was happy with the compensation for my work but wanted more training and higher compensation.
good,Waste Management it's a alright company it pays good money and have good benefits the people there are so respectful there we go out their way to help each other

good,"Really nice work environnement. Love working here, benefits are really good. Learned to work on my own, and diagnose problems easily, but the tools are limited."
good,Good company to work for in the right position. The management team was great I worked for. The employees were good to work with. They did a lot of events that took care and rewarded their employees.
good,"WM has great growth potential. There are different jobs, but it all depends on how engaged an individual is and how much a person can grow in a team and help to develop the team."
good,I have more positive things to say about waste management but there was one person who took the employee harrassment to the next level.  I will explain in person.
good,Got to see lots of different parts of LA while working as an outside rep. Helped to integrate recycling into small businesses and multi-family homes. Nice benefits and stuff.
good,"This company offeres a really good benefits package. They provide 1 free pair of boots per yea, have stock options, 401k, medicatl eye and dental. Very safety oriented company with a safety meeting every week  covering many topics. Its a steady job with no rainouts and consistant hours week to week."

good,"Great place to work if you're not afraid to work, you're expected to drive and throw trash and get the routes up, if you just want to drive this is not the place for you. Great benefits and exercise if you do your job right you'll stay in shape and get paid for it."
good,"Started day with assessing driver availability. Determined how many driver replacement needed and then challenge would begin. communication and planning along with analytics would be executed to make sure routes would be completed for the day. "
good,"Pay was great, benefits also great. Only downfall is getting up so early at 3 am. You get used to it though.  Management could be better. Where I was at there was favoritism."
good,This job is fast pace stressful most times but equally distributed amongst the work force it is what they say it is during your interview the management may at times seem to be rigid but it's the workload they have to manage and shuffle drivers in order to get the job done but they are true professionals when it comes to talking to you it's never disrepectful and only about the job remember it's fast pace until you learn your route and get good equipment to drive
good,"Working at Waste Management isn't going to be for everyone it's very early morning and long day's. You are surrounded by trash you live and breathe it. The benefits are very good depending on which plan you choose. It is a very fast paced job, so time does fly by. The pay could be better for sure, but it is steady work year round."
good,"Truly enjoyed the work experience . Management was fair( for the most part). Plenty of work hours.Great Benefits and paid vacation.Daily safety meetings,and classroom refresher course (s). Great Company."
good,Awesome place to good benefit just have to get accommodated with the hour but it's a great place to work. I learned at deal of train and a lot about safety
good,I loved working here.  The only reason that I left the position was because I was injured and could no longer perform the job that was required of me at that point in time.
good,Great work environment. Management was easy to work with and encouraging to staff. Only left for better working hours. I was working 2nd shift and that did not work for my family.
good,Besides working a lot of hours per week it was a great place to work. Averaged about 60-70 hours per week. The benefits at waste are unbelievable. They paid for your boots and threw bbqs to show their appreciation for their employees
good,"You can make this company a career choice. Great atmosphere, strong leadership, and direction-ally focused. There is always room to advance and have a great quality of life."
good,Waste Management was a good place to work during early part of career but with management change got worse. Typical day was ten hours or more depending on customers
good,"Not enough flexible hours"
good,Everyone at this job is friendly and helpful. No one hesitates to help you out if you need it. The managers keep to themselves for the most part but they are there if you need them.
good,This was a great place to work I enjoyed working here it was just that it wasn’t enough hours to be made in the week and the only way that you work 40 hours a weekI had to leave because I could make enough money working there
good,"The management was good, the job was easy but the graveyard shift was a killer. I would recommend this job and would also go back if there's a day shift available."
good,all in all this is a good place to work management actually treats you right (your not just a number) they take safety seriously and they work well as a team
good,"WM is a good place to start a career at. It didn't have the greatest advancement opportunities, but did have competitive pay. I would recommend to workers who are new to the professional world."
good,I really enjoyed working for Waste Management. There were many ways to advance. They worked well with you when you had to be off. Good team environment.Learned a lot about the environment and chemicals and waste. The job was challenging at times. Had to be able to move full 55 gallon drums and lift have objects.
good,I enjoyed my time with WM. The training was extensive and educational and I hope to be back with the company some day. The required schedule that was changed abruptly without much notice forced me to resign. WM has a lot to offer and I hoped to retire with them one day.
good,"In position of outside sales I worked with home builders, general contractors selling roll off containers and portable toilets.  The company offered a positive work environment with team members supporting each other to gain end results."
good,Happy for the time I've had working there good people. Good place to work. I've received a lot of training and experience. Safety is always top priority
good,"Waste Management was a very good opportunity, it was a very good overall job but there was just no advancement for me to move up in the company career wise."
good,Always busy and you definitely learn something new everyday. There was never any consistancy as there was always changes but over all a great place to work.
good,"Room for advancement in management, especially if you're willing to relocate to another state. Union protects good workers, but also protects people that should be let go."
good,"days were long but everyday would be different there is no specific type of day. the labor wasn't too hard, you worked in all types of conditions. you also got paid for drive time."
good,"Good company overall. I do not recommend working for them in the southern United States. At times they can complicate picking up trash. Some areas treat there employees good, some areas treat them poorly."
good,"The environment was professional. Like most call center jobs, some customers were difficult to speak with. Management was supportive and allowed agents a fair measure of autonomy in resolving customer issues."
good,It was a smaller shop and was kept clean. The shop equipment was good.  You were treated very fair and you worked hard and I enjoyed my time there. I would go back.
good,A good place to work with great benifits. Management is great too. Sometimes we get under 40 hours due to machines going down though.  Or lack of material.
good,"Great drivers, and management. Steady work, new equipment, knowledgeable staff. Decent pay and benefits. Its a great job to have living in and around the Edmonton area."
good,Waste management is the leader  in the waste industry for more than one reason. They take safety seriously and they treat employees with dignity and respect.There are good and bad employees in all companies.Most of WM employees are good.
good,The benefits and compensation was good. The management was good. My coworkers were friendly and helpful. The equipment was a bit outdated.  Overall waste management was a great company to work for.
good,"You will learn a lot about the trucking/trash industry here. If you don't do your job, you be thrown under the bus! Management doesn't want to hear about ongoing, detrimental truck issues and downtime. Some of the expectation are impossible to meet on a daily basis as a route manager."
good,Started 8 am everyday. Enjoyed the team environment. I learned how to lead a team and out proform quota's every month. I enjoyed the management vision and goals set. Hardest part was only 8 hours in a day to perform job. Enjoyed incentives and company functions.
good,I enjoy working at Waste Management.  Assisting customers with a variety of issues daily made the day go by quickly.  The company is  very good with life issues and assisting with job issues.  Organizing is a must.  There is a very friendly atmosphere at this company.
good,"I don't have any complaints. It's a fast paced environment. They are very strict on safety, so safety is very very important. If you're not afraid to get your hands dirty this job won't be a problem"
good,"My time at WM will definitely be missed. If you are dedicated, hard working, and looking for new challenges...this is the place to be. Days can be very long at times, but I started out as an ops specialist and within 4yrs I was promoted to route supervisor under the tutelage of a great boss who wanted to see me succeed."
good,Answer all calls that come into the call center.  Troubleshoot and enter new service requests.  Billing and payments.  Long hours fun place to work at
good,Drove a commercial front loader for 3 years.  Woke up at 2am to go to work.  12 to 14 hour days.  Pay was decent due to the overtime.  Dangerous job.  But I actually enjoyed it.

The management team was almost always available for assisting with questions when new issues or concerns would arise and held weekly meetings to address new policies and procedures.  My co-workers were friendly and helpful when learning new tasks. I spent more time with my co-workers than my own family and friends so I made a lot of life long friends. The hardest part of the job was having steady work. Certain times were busier than others depending on the season and customer base so it could be challenging to obtain new customers.

I started working for Waste Management when I was 18, I didn’t know much about how to deal with encounters at work, but they were willing to train me along the way with the many challenges that I face within the first year or two of me working there. I have learned a lot from this company and the training that they put me through molded me into a better person at work and in life as well. I believe complying with all rules and regulations of the company and I believe in the proper chain of command in the workplace. I experienced my most success working for Waste Management. We implemented proper training monthly, mapped out our problems as well as target goals. We received praise on our accomplishments and it shaped us into smart workers and not hard workers. It took us all a while to get there, but with the help of HR, management as well as employees was able to work together and achieve success.

good,Working conditions can be rough. Not all trucks have ac so it make for a really hot day. The earlier you star the better for you so you don’t have to deal with the heat.

good,I really like working there. The only thing I didn’t like was that they didn’t offer part time. I really needed to work less than 40 hours a week and I had to quit because they couldn’t give me less hours. Benefits and work environment are good. Made good friends.

good,"A typical day at work includes working together, safety, awareness, hydration, etc. I've learned a lot about teamwork and understanding.

The most enjoyable part of the day is when everyone works together and things are done timely and the right way."

good,"Everyday I get to work at 6 am. Receive my paperwork from the day prior, i get that filed into where it needs to be. Then my customers start flowing in to receive their load of fly ash. I make sure they have their proper load, give them their papers and send them on their way. Every few trucks that go through i take a sample of the ash to run it through safety tests. It checks the chemical balance to ensure proper concrete production."
good,Waste Management was always a fun place to work at. Our training's were interesting and informative (and they fed you). If they were not relocating I would not have left.

good,what I learned is how to get along with others and teamwork the most enjoyable part of the job is when it comes to helping each other and the hardest part of the job is being by yourself on your first day.

good,Typical day at work was quality control of the bales and made sure the facility didn't get shut down every 20 minutes. Management was good made sure everyone was hydrated and on task. The hardest part was dealing with the heat. that was the most important thing I learned how to work hard in AZ heat. The most enjoyable was Thursdays when that UPS truck would pull out PAYDAY.
good,"Waste Management is a good company to work for. A typical day is usually around 10-12 hours worth of driving and loading. While working with Waste Management, it has taught me that organization is a must when it comes dealing with different vendors who both load and unload the same products. Though the same product is being shipped, no two companies are alike in the procedures while doing so. I really enjoy what I do at Waste Management and I do not have any bad things to say about the company."

good,"Working for Waste Management is something that I do love. With the position I am in you are on the phone all day. We are a call center. We assist customers with every day trash needs whether it is for extra trash pickup, missed service, billing questions or sales. Waste Management rents dumpsters to customers and the price depends on the area so you have to determine where the customer is located in order to quote. A typical day at work consists of incoming calls from about 90 customers on average. There are 25 other representatives within the department I am in which is handling commercial customers. We also have a residental team, dispatch, operations, etc. Each department consists of multiple representatives that all have to work together to allow the work day to flow. The hardest part of the job is the back to back phone calls. You have to precisely enter in information and if you miss one detail it could possibly mess up an entire trash stop. The most enjoyable part of my day is that I talk to multiple different customers. Our call center handles Michigan, Ohio and Indiana so you never know who you'll be speaking with and I like that variety."

The job involved processing of applications for new waste stream approvals, reviewing analytical data, and working with the sales staff.  I learned how to interface with different company departments, and management was very professional and open to discussing problems or new ideas.  The co-workers were very team oriented, as well as courteous and professional. The hardest part of the job was accomplishing the necessary job functions with limited resources.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to satisfy the customers.  Overall a great company to work for."
good,"Waste Management isnt just a driving job, its a get out of your truck and a dirty job as well.  Management at Waste Management is very fair, they are very personable and helpful but they have a job to do, Keep you Safe and make sure production is maintained.  The benefits are excellent and are tailored to individuals and families.  The hardest part of the job are the early mornings, the varying weather, and the smell of peoples waste.

good,"This company offers a excellent safety run business.The Management have always been helpful.Benefits ,rrsp and ect are top notch."
good,I prepared my station for a fast paced job and was always ready to start accepting customers at exactly 5 am. I greeted every customer with a smile and a pleasant attitude. I learned how to manage customers with compassion and courtesy at all times because they all had things going on in their life that a smile could go a long way. I worked my shifts alone except during shift change which demanded that I stayed on task constantly. My district manager was a easy going person as long as I kept my job professional and on task. The hardest part of the job was keeping all customers satisfied without defaulting policy. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people and being able to resolve any issues they had and being appreciated for that. I only had contact with co-workers over the radio and they were nice to work with.

good,"Overall this is a very strong employer, and given the industry, very stable.  I would still be working there except my department relocated.  The pay was good, but due to a lot of over time.  My manager was very chill, but is no longer there. The issue is there was some serious bullying.  Had I known upper management was on site, which I found in my exit interview it'd made it better."

I was offered a position within a week and a half. The training was only about 4 weeks before we put on the floor. All in all, it was a great learning experience. After a few months or years, there is opportunity for growth based on your work ethic."
good,"With ny time at Waste Management, I have had the pleasure of meeting people who have helped shape my life.  I have learned more about how to act in a workplace, while maintaining contact with customers.   To this day, I still am in contact with customers that I assisted with keying their accounts."

good,"I would work with clients and vendors on a daily basis. Issue checks, create invoices, make prepayments with company credit card for services."
good,Work starts very early in the morning and can be long shifts depending on the route you have. I learned a lot about how to properly operate both residential and commercial waste collection vehicles. Management is highly focused on employee safety and productivity. The co-workers are always willing to help you out if you need any help. The hardest part would have to be getting new routes organized and learning new areas. the most enjoyable part is being out of the office and seeing different places.
good,Productive and people environment. I learned a lot about people management and punctuality skills.  The hardest part of the job was managing routes when unexpected call offs occurred.  The most enjoyable part of the job was to see staff feel rewarded for their efforts at the end of the work day.

good,Great management with all of the tools needed to succeed. If you have good work ethics and time management skills then outside sales with Waste Management is a good fit. Good salary with a nice earning potential. Co-workers are friendly and help is there if needed. The hardest part of the job is the product itself. Everyone has trash and most companies have something lined up already. Constant and repetitive prospecting is a must in order to succeed. The salary and benefits are good and the commission with pay off with hard work.

The employees are all great teammates and great when having questions regarding your position or anything issues that may come up regarding the job duties."
good,Great place to work. Good work/life balance and very good compensation package. The focus on employee engagement was absolutely awesome. Productivity improvements focused around very specific employee actions or behaviors. There was always a coaching opportunity versus a disciplinary plan.

good,"Good place to work, pleasant people, good IT support, good chance to move up in career, supportive management, great benefits and discount options, ability to work from home on occasion"
good,"They were fair and had good benefits. The supervisors were fair for the most part. They lacked any uniform training program, at least at the location I worked at."
good,"Waste is a good place to work. Sometimes things can get out of control, but generally ok. If they had a yard closer to me, I would go back to them. They did not take into consideration how far I lived from the yard. Made for some long days."
good,"Management was mostly male based, and biased upon male employees versus female employees in 1990. This may have changed since I was an AS400 Systems Engineer. Good company to work for."

good,Good fast pace job!Professional cool atmosphere!Very hands on!!
good,"A typical day at Waste Management is the typical day of a trash man. Hardest part of the job is during the summertime, most enjoyable part would have to be the winter. "
good,I leard a lot and wanted to have a long career with them but got laid off....
good,"This is a great place to work with only one exception, There is a camera in your face all day long. some people don't mind that. this camera goes off when the vehicle turns sharply or hits a bump or curve and then records for 4 seconds also taking the previous 10 seconds as well. As long as you have done everything you are suppose to there is no problem but if you allowed the vehicle to exceed the speed limit or you had been eating or drinking in the vehicle or generally not paying attention then it's recorded and you receive points for your actions. This isn't a problem for some but if you accidentally speed up and the camera goes off they don't care about how long you where going the speed limit. you will be penalized. Other then that it's a great place to work."
good,"Responsible for identifying hazardous waste chemicals, I learned how to operate heavy equipment, the company culture was family oriented.  The hardest part of the job was making profiles for the management team and the best part of the job was actual identifications of the waste chemicals."
good,"It can be stressful at times, but everyone there wants you to succeed. Your supervisor will set you up for success and will help you reach your goals."

good,"I love working for Waste Management.  It's a very good company to work for.  We have many safety rules and guidelines to go by.  I work with 4 locations and I have a very good relationship with  everyone. My manager, mechanics and office people work well together and communicate. "

good,Waste Management is a great company to work for. The employee benefits are reasonable.
good,As a CSR at Waste Management I was quickly accepted into the small group which surprised me. I have worked at small companies before and sometimes it's hard to be accepted when you're the new person in a group that has worked together for years. The morale is high and people really help each other out. This can be quite a stressful job at times and it really helps to have other to lean on.
good,Waste Management was a great place to work as far as Management and all but 2 employees were concerned. One bad apple was a pedofile learning where you live. One employee was a drink that steps out on his wife and tried to hold my job over my head so I walked.
good,"busy every day, working morning 6 to 6, Monday to Friday, no work holiday, 2 shift, 80 employee ,uniforms is free, every holiday pay double,good benefit, the culture is good ."

good,"Productive and the employees as well as the customers make it a fun work place. coffe machines, fridge, microwaves. We have about a 50"" tv in the break room through Direct TV."
good,This company is a very good company it's just the management that makes this company bad to work at otherwise than that this company I would recommend anyone to seek employment to
good,"Typical day always multi tasking as job required."
good,Nothing good to say about the company. My co-workers were great for the most part. One of the mechanics thinks he knows everything and is the biggest drama queen and will run to management to get u written up
good,"A very micromanaged culture with very high expectations. Sales Representative goals and expectations were sometimes unachievable. However, Waste Management was a great company to work for. I learned a tremendous amount of knowledge about B@B sales and networking. It was a great experience."
good,"Waste management can be a wonderful place to work.  In my position, it requires relentless hours of effort to be successful.  The work/life balance can be complicated if you have a family.  I would definitely recommend this position to anyone who does not have family obligations.  The compensation can be outstanding if you have the flexibility the job requires to be successful.  It is a very competitive industry."
good,Waste Management was a great place to work. Management Team really care about there employees. The were lockers available to store your items. The company is strict about the company policy and procedures.
good,"Waste is a good job intell you go on workers comp! They say they care about there employees, but i was let go! for being late! While there where more people than me late1"
good,"The company as a whole is a great place to work."
good,"Not a good work environment not very professional had some terrible experiences due to racism "
good,Poor management. No respect from any kind of Management. They don't answer their phones when you break down or an accident or a problem on route. Example: One person I work with got stuck on a dirt road didn't get back to work until 3 a.m. all because no Management can't call him back. I hate to see if it was a life or death matter.
good,"Phones were also non-stop and back to back phone calls, multi-task was a priority in this department, and co-workers were great.  I enjoyed my job and the name of the company was respected by other industries."
good,"It's a fast paced job and a lot is demanded of you, if you're the type of person that has a scheduled life, this isn't the job for you as the hours are flexible but the company does obey federal driving laws. There's always trash to be collected and that means job security but there's only room for lateral growth not vertical growth in my opinion."
good,"Small terminal. Dog eat dog. Management will through you under the bus to save themselves, even if they have never driven or been on the back of rear loader. Too lazy to survey new areas and accounts, placing drivers in dangerous situation. No opportunity to advance at the terminal like others. Dont want to metion waste management university for opportunities to excel past being just a driver."
good,"Great corporate company benefits are great, commissions structured for employees to reach payouts, 401k & ESPP are great. Need my leaders from within WM"
good,It was ok until it caught on fire. Real dirty and the Job didn't last long. And had alot  of rats and bird's flying around inside the plant. And machines stayed down
good,"i love my job at wm but working under people who have no clue about your job nor do they want to learn makes it very hard and stressful to work there.  I am willing to do my job and help others but i cannot continue to cover for management in the office who doesn't know and refuses to learn and do their job.  "
good,This job is okay if you don't mind smelling trash and going home smelling sour. They prepare you to stand on your feet the entire shift so that's not a surprise. Women have no place to advance here but the men are very respectful
good,"At waste management the people are really nice and helpful "
good,"I was a contractor ,I enjoyed it,I made problems go away ,they liked it.I wish the economy was still strong,I would still be there"
good,Wastes management to me was the best job I've had in my exciting driving career. Amazing management staff as well as employees with interesting and in some cases very helpful personalities makes the work day run smoothly
good,The company has a whole is a great company.   Some locations have different environments.   The company has change my views between the small and large businesses.  Some will take ideas and use them for their own and not give takes or praise.

I enjoyed working with all of my team members and overall everyone got along so that makes it an easy day. If anyone had a quick question anyone on our team was happy to assist. If the call needed to be escalated to a supervisor, that was a little harder, supervisors were often busy and sometimes hard to track down. I learned how to be quick witted and think outside the box. If a customer called in needed to dispose of something you had to ask detailed questions to find the right way for that customer to have it disposed of properly. the hardest part about the job was explaining to a customer that we are out of containers and we don't know when they would be back in stock.

good,Waste Manage was a great place to work for. The employees worked together and there was always something to do. The hardest part of the job back then were the long hours.
good,"I enjoyed working at Waste Management.  Co workers were fantastic, benefits were superior, and the pay was decent.  Upper management did not have a clue about the company which typically happens at larger corporations.  Commissions were fantastic when I first started on the business side, but then structures changed every year making it harder to attain.  Everything was scripted which made the customer experience not enjoyable."

I have been a contractor for almost three years and just would love to have a permament job.
good,My review is based upon my experiences there. The local management does not run the location how it should be ran. The employees were promised raises but instead of raises they would give out an ice cream bar occasionally on Fridays. They require you to work six days a week and the only days that you get off are Christmas Day and New Years Day.

good,"This is a good company. They are very friendly they just dont pay the employees enough money."
good,I was helping them picking up trash and it was helpful. I got to help them pick up trash and socialize with them. It was a very beneficial experience and I wish to find a job that will pay and give me the same type of opportunities to socialize.
good,"Hard to work there no one spoke English but good pay and long hours overtime. Started early, out doors fast paced. But a messy job but get use to it because of the hours and pay."
good,"I enjoyed working there very much, but the management there was always secretly discussing changes, etc without your input if it involved yourself.  Things were always done behind your back and the communication was horrible!  The people I worked with were great!  Had a lot of fun on the job and you could communicate with them with respect.  The benefits were great and so was the paid time off."
good,"I found the work here quick and easy to learn. Employees were friendly and pleasant. A typical day here was loading the belt with recycle and sorting off the conveyer belt. Most enjoyable part I would way was having friendly co workers, make the job more pleasant and go  more quickly."

good,Worked there for leaf vac program. they tell you you may have a chance to stay on through winter but they lay everyone off with a possibility to be called back for yard waste.
good,"It is a much safer working enviorment then my previous place of employment, but there is no time allowed for rest or breaks. Your every move is monitored, creating the stress that you feel. The insurance is the one thing that keeps drivers there. My 2 hour comute "
good,"Safety reviews daily,  dos and don'ts while servicing the customer, operating the trucks as well as practicing road safety. Customer service oriented. Management is laid back. Culture in the workplace is stressful having camera popping on every time you hit a bump in the road or hit brakes to hard. Sitting day in day out in order to meet quota. A thirty minute lunch period is the high point of the day."
good,I left Waste Management because I got married and both my Husband and myself moved to Florida more his choice then mine..I thought I would retire from this company but that did not happen..I liked this Job a lot it kept me in shape and overall wasn't a bad company to work for.I had no complaints at all.I don't know how it is today but back in 1996 it was one of the better company's if you wanted to work.I am a really great worker and still am.

good,"Three tours with Waste Management, all on Different levels."
good,"I loved getting up going to work with my co-workers.Everyday was a task. The hardest part of this job was never knowing what type of weather you will be dealing with. Rain, sleet, snow, hot, or cold. None of that mattered when it came to working for the city. I learned how to work in an environment no matter what the weather was like. The pay was okay I couldn't complain but it was enough to provide for me and my family. It was a blessing to me this job came right on time. I thank them for the opportunity that was given to me working for this company."
good,"While the pay in IT at WM is very good and also has a great bonus program, you have to work for it (not a bad thing) and there is very little career progression.  You tend to get pigeon-holed in your duties and it can be hard to develop a deeper skill set.  WM IT runs very lean as far as staffing and everything seems to be in fire-drill mode.  Management has gotten much better over the years but the churn of managers in some areas is great.  Some people have had over 10 different direct managers in just over 10 years.  I understand do more with less, work smarter not harder, but there does come a point where this is silly."
good,This industry is tougher than most understand.  If you are able to keep up and continue to drive for success the company will eventually provide you a path.  The key to success starts with you.
good,"Typical day started at 4:30am or 5:00am and went till about 6:30pm which had a constant focus on operational performance and safety. WM is truly focused on safety and I worked hard to support this core value and company culture. The driver safety training I received and provided to new drivers was valuable and results driven. "
good,Each day is different than the one before. I enjoy working with my co-workers. We all get along well and work together with the common goal of finishing the route in good standings and in a timely manner. Some days are harder and longer than others. It's amazing to see what people throw away.
good,"I had the best supervisor. Everyday began the same sign on systems and phone taking calls back to back from 8 am to 5 pm. Most co-workers had a great job ethic however there were ""super stars"" who had great metrics or stats but the did not do the work which made my job harder."
good,I was a residential driver for this company and truly enjoyed the position.  I was laid off or I would still be there.
good,"A work day started at 7 a.m. and ended at 3:30 p.m. I learned the different types of plastics and sorting arrangement. The management was very loyal and understanding and had a sense of humor which I could relate to. My co- workers really made the job ,they were very helpful when I was new. I could ask them questions about the job and they would give me correct answers. T he hardest part of the job was working in the elements. When it got cold or to hot that affected the employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was it was hands on and it allowed me to work at a fast pace which made my work day go by quickly."
good,"Busy all day long no shortage of "
good,"I was a compactor field tech.required welding,change out bad hydraulic parts,and electrical parts all over the Denver metro area"

good,"I had two weeks training at company facility in Ft Myers FLA  all expenses paid . You are given all the tools to suceed.  Good pay and benifits, but you "
good,"The culture is very simple, do your job and everything will be ok. Waste Management is a great place to work overall and as long as you do what is required of you, management does not micormanage and will provide a comfortable work environment."
good,"Great Company but management Sucks. "

good,Great company and great benefits hours were very manageable and other coworkers where mere easy to get along with. Routes are easy to pick up and learn for calmer days.
good,"Waste Management is a nice place to work. Garbage/Trash is a 24/7 operation. Very safety oriented! Learning is an on-going process & they make the resources available to you. Mostly on-line. Predominately male dominated environment. the hardest part of any job in a ""waste industry"" is odor! Fellow employees are the best part."
good,"Waste Management is a great place to work, with lots of amazingly hard-working people.  The company provides good benefits to all full-time employees."

good,"come into the call center with over 100 agents"
good,I work in a fast paced company with a lot of paper trail.  It's a well oiled machine and the people are great that I work with. The hardest part of the job is there really isn't as of yet.  I'm up for new challenges so we'll see what's next.  I look forward to it.  The most enjoyable part of my job is that it still exists.  Management is friendly and casual but yet very professional.  Dress is casual so that's fun too.

good,"Strong Upper Management and a tremendous job skill, learning environment."
good,"Great company to work for."
good,I would conduct a review from following day going over safety issues and productivity. Then I would conduct observations on certain drivers and investigate customer issues.

good,it was great working for this company.. management was fair easy to get along with..
good,"Stable full-time position at a very established company, yet very little room for growth or advancement"
good,On a daily bases - called or met with clients/customers to address their needs in operational support and technical support for compliance with environmental laws. Was asked to research for possible offsite management waste options and to stay within regulatory standard. This was educational and expanded my management strengths to retain customer loyalty. The supportive co-workers were always ready to listen to new service/vendor options to review for compliance within company policies. The hardest part was not enough hours in the day and some internal supportive systems were slow to respond to immediate customer needs. I loved what I sold and enjoyed my customer/clients - 28 years total.
good,"I got to work, about two to three every morning. I ran a route that was in red flag. I got the route down from 60hour to 52 hour a week. I ask can i work on weekends. I work everyweekend , I meat alot good guys. It was a fun people place alots of work, an i love to work."
good,Overall this is a fantastic company to work for. I worked alone in but there are other coworkers around that can help if you have questions. There are all hours available to work since there are always drivers working. The management is good and caring. The hardest part of the job was routing all the jobs in the most proficient way possible.
good,Its a good place to work. If you don't mind getting dirty  i mean you have to be willing to go through trash  on a daily basis  and you work for the city   your job means something to the community
good,I liked working for waste management I just needed a place where I could grow with the company. I need a place where there is an open door policy and better pau
good,"In the role of waste management officer, you'll organise and manage waste disposal, collection and recycling facilities. You may also be responsible for waste treatment and street cleaning operations. Some posts combine waste management and recycling functions, while others split them into separate jobs."
good,"I spent eight years there, and the company treated me good. I had a wonderful boss and no regrets at all for my experiences there. I only left because I have other career interest, I'm 47 now and I have 19 more years until retirement. Waste Management was very fair and the people I worked with are friendly and fun to be around."
good,"Waste Management is one of the best companies in the industry with competitive pay and great benefits including a 401k, paid time offand medical benefits."
good,"I have been employee at waste management, that is the best company i never knew before and after, but the problem was not WM itself, that was the management where I have been at WM "
good,I really enjoy working at the landfill it's a lot of walking picking up paper weed eating putting up fences to control blown trash I've been there over a year but it's time to find another job now that I've found out they're not gonna hire me I've wasted a whole year thinking I was gonna get hired fulltime
good,We would start at 7 in the morning get all of our equipment that we would be using for the day. Then have a meeting assigning teams for each section for the work day. Throughout the day we would have check-ins with our supervisor. At the end of the day we would gather all the equipment clean it and have a brief meeting about what all got done and we still have to do tomorrow.
good,The people you work with are great. Running the equipment was great the training was awsome boss was a little hard on us but that's normal I guess and the pay was great
good,The job was pretty easy to do.  I enjoyed my co workers there we were like family.  We changed Supervisors a couple of times which didn't pan out well
good,Work environment was health which was great! Many of my co-workers had great work ethic which something I value. Also my manger was very earnest and always informative.
good,This was a great place to work in the beginning.  Love my boss and fellow co workers.  For me it changed when my boss left the company.  Management was not good once he was gone.
good,"Everyone one at this place were nice. Off on the weekends. Monday thru Friday gig. Some days are better than others, but all and all, it was a fun place to work. You have to be on time on the dime. Cannot be a minute late. Too bad is was a temp job."
good,"great place to work if u want to i enjoyed the challenge that everyday you had to perform at a top level,great co workers,sometimes the weather will test you but its a great reward."
good,"Nothing special, but Company workplace environment is very good and self motivated,"
good,Waste Management was a good place to work. I like a fast-paced environment so this is the place for it. I learned to be flexible although it was a temporary job.
good,"I assisted customer's with their waste service. In a typical day could assist anywhere from 70 to 85 customer's per phone. I would answer questions of their service, start new service or cancel. They would want to add on services or remove certain services, and by the time I left 8 years later we took calls for 8 states. the hardest part of the job was the complaints I took, our service went way down hill and people were calling in everyday with complaints which I never blamed them. I would too, therefore I choose to leave the job I once loved. Management in our office was great to us but could only do so much and the pay was excellent. You have to have a great deal of patience to hold a Call center position."
good,"Great company to work for, lots of chances to advance, good atmosphere and lots of teamwork. Constant change so you are learning new things daily.  Never a dull moment at WM."
good,This is a company that strives for a clean environment. Great management team and wonderful employees.  A pat on the back is commonplace.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to start their career with a well rounded company.
good,"You learn everyday, and you are able to use these resources to advance your career, without regret or ill will...  You will love those that work here as its a close knit company that truly values their employees, and their dedication to the company."
good,This was the best job I had until the company decided to stop operations in sacramento. I was provided an opportunity to relocate but it wasn't possible at the time.
good,Waste and recycling is an exciting industry that actually makes an impact on the environment.  Many companies maintain or work to reduce the carbon footprint.  The waste and recycling industry actually works to improve and sustain a better world.
good,"Waste Management is one of the better companies O have worked for. They are on the cutting edge of technology and all other Waste Companies follow their lead. If you are fortunate enough to be hired on, do not leave, you are at the best place to work."
good,"very hard outside work, exposed to the elements of nature. the hardest part of the job is keeping new shoes on hand. the most enjoyable part of the job is the great outdoors, the worst part of the job is the great outdoors."
good,Meticulous work and call volumes. Not a lot of job opportunities.
good,"Cash Applications"
good,Every morning I would open the gates for inbound and outbound trucks. log into computer check in inbound and outbound vehicles. I did different office duties. write memos translate memos make phone calls set up appointments for pickups etc. I had a variety  of tasks each day kept busy all day. Management and co-workers were great to work with. Hardest part of my job was to deal with rude people. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people each day.
good,Great place to work. Freedom to do your job. Great management
good,I worked here for over 8 years and loved it up until I got laid off. Things did change a lot while I was there from the start to the end but I was good at my job and was proud to be a part of the team.
good,"I work night shift so a typical work day is 8 !/2 hours. In that time I haul glass, maintain loading dock area, maintain parking lot, push material off the back of trucks and push material to the plant to be ran threw the plant. I've learned night shift is not for me. Management and co workers work well together to get the job done. The hardest part of the job is being away from my family on 3rd shift. The most enjoyable part of the job is work towards a goal every night. Getting to work and seeing what needs to be done then at the end of the night the feeling of accomplishment."
good,At my site they were willing to work around my school hours. Very friendly managers there. Only thing I didnt enjoy is they hired managers based off what degree in school they had. This unfortunately brought a lot of managers with no backbone.
good,"the job is harder than it looks but it pays good money, you work every day, regardless of bad weather or holidays, and work overtime almost every day."
good,"managers are professional and helpful"
good,"Landfill is closing in on year. I love working here it is a great job. I do multiple different things all day and always something new. "
good,"I would go with the truck driver out to the field to our daily routes picking up the roll off trash cans form the apt, association mgmt, or business. I would also sometime stay in the shop separating trash cans by color removing the wheels and lids and replacing them with new ones. The most enjoyable part of my job was team work and getting our route done in time"
good,I really enjoy the company and the people. I miss working outside and with others.
good,"Fast paced, You have the opportunity to learn as much as you want"
good,a safety minded employer with conscientious
good,Waste Management did away with the Recycle department. Worked very hard to get the department rolling.
good,Overall the job as residential driver on the routes was ok. Some days were longer than others I was productive on my routes customer service was outstanding. The supervisors did give you praise for a job well done.
good,excellent place to work along with great benefits. Good salary.
good,"The job is challenging but satisfying to know that"
good,The other employees are really nice and willing to help. Showed me how to properly handle and operate equipment. Give the the opportunity to help others by disposing of the garbage and recycle items.
good,Long long long long long hours. The day never seams to end. The company says their top priority is safety but that isn't the truth.  They top focus is getting the jobs done as fast as possible.
good,Waste Management is a great place to work and truly focussed on customer service and safety.  They have great benefits and take care of their employees.

good,"Great to wrk with.Chgo Plant caught on fire a wrkr had flicked a cig budd in a pile of rubbish,partial plant closed,layoff.Wrkd as a Recycling Sorter."
good,It was very out going my experience is basically my all around practices of the job up coming work habits it brings more ways to get into things that's if you are hard working it makes payday very exciting because we work weekly and day by day and when the end of the week gets there that's that so it's a very learning curb
good,If you like fast pace hard work this is the perfect place for you. With right now guaranteed over time working 4 12hour days. Definitely worth all the hard work.
good,Love working for Waste Management!!  Sad that the job is ending.  Excellent pay and benefits. Expectations were clear and reasonable.  Would recommend this company to anyone looking for a great place to work.  courelocate or

good,Great place to work offers advancement training was excellent culture is very good you feel part of the team and feel secure in your position they are fair and reasonable
good,The day can start as early as 4am and you can easily work 10hrs on a easy day. but most likly you will pull 11 to 12 hrs. you either drive a route so spread out it takes 5 mins between each stop or with city contract jobs house to house. with stop go stop go for 10+ hrs it can get mentally draining. otherwise the company is in my opinion Great and I can tell they are going thru a cultural transition for the better. they seem to really take care of their people.
good,The management treated all worker the same. He would have meetings and asked all to participate or give feedback. Team members gathered together to solve any problems that may arrive.

good,Work was good.I learned working with people can help me become a better person.Management was great. there was nothing hard about my job. I enjoy working for the company and it was a great part of my life.
good,"It’s a fast paste but also stressful; it requires strength and motivation. Some people can’t handle the extreme conditions of the garbage business, it takes a loyalty and ambitions to work there."
good,Fair work hours weren't as great. Good team of management. The pay wasn't enough more than half the times. But they fairly train each and every employee.
good,"I had outstanding management.  There is great opportunity to learn.  There isn't much of a culture, but the pay, benefits, and management will make that irrelevant."
good,"I was covering during for a maternity leave and coworkers and management were great, I made new friends that I still follow on Facebook. Very relaxed and flexible workplace culture,"

good,"The overall company is very strong and fair, but depending on where you are located management bias does affect the overall mood with certain people allowed forgiveness of policy.  There is a tight rope for some while others meander at will.  Consistency does not exist."
good,Great opportunity to work with a team consisting of billing and customer service for a set account base. Varied responsibilities provide a fun challenge while allowing you to increase your skills.

good,"Great Opportunity with Large company to expand my skills"
good,This job was strictly data entry.  We didn't have to be on the phone.  A very quiet workplace.  When everyone is typing it sounds like little mice scampering across the floor.  We all had headsets on and were able to listen to music or books on tape.  We had a group of 15 people. The longest time employee in dept. was 20 years down to my short stint of 5 months.

good,waste management was a pretty laborous job but the people you worked with on the trucks made it competitive therefore interesting. no one day is the same.I originally went to advance to driving for the company being that i have my cdl permits but it didnt seem to be priority for them and a better opportunity had surfaced so i pursued and was succesful.
good,Waste management was an incredible experience. It was an inn credibly challenging atmosphere and environment to working and learned and made extreme growth from that.

Was an amazing opportunity. The environment was fun and a great fun workplace. Loved every minute. Great managers too! "
good,"Great company with wonderful people and benefits you cant find anywhere else. Unfortunately, I had to resign not that long after starting as I had some medical issues. The only bad thing I have to say is I did not enjoy being a customer service representative because it was all call center work. However I have nothing bad to say about the company."
good,I was on the back of the truck slinging garbage. 
good,"Typical day at work is 12 to 13 hours "
good,I got hired onto waste management through a temp agency because I was a fast and hard worker. I worked on the sorting line for 9 months and then I was given my forklift ticket and got to run the compactor and dump the bins
good,"I loved working there. However, I was forced out of my position due to restructuring and the call center being moved out of Green Bay. The staff I worked with was amazing. Our General Manager was a force to be reckoned with, yet he was ALWAYS supportive of his staff. A true humanitarian. Unfortunately, he too, was forced out of his position."

good,"As Lead Instructor at the only training facility in the US for Waste Management, it was an extremely good job with rotating duties between all six instructors. A s the Lead this would also include scheduling and training the other instructors. One week in the classroom, four weeks on the course and one week as a floater. I would facilitate morning meetings, consisting of over views of the trainees, previous day's activities and any special needs areas for struggling trainees."
good,Great place to work. Friendly people and management as well as good pay and benefits. Allows you to have a life outside of work which really helps a lot
good,"They just need more help and hire people who know how to operate the equipment. There were workers who would miss work on weekends and make it harder for the few who did work. "
good,"I worked for them for 2 years and 7 months. The benefits are unbeatable and pay is good. I only left the company because HR sucks at handling issues with management.  L & K in Louisburg, Kansas is ran by a small minded management who don't  help you advance like they should. They will either make you quit or fire you if you don't jump on the mom and pop band wagon."
good,I liked working at waste management and would still be working there if I hadn't relocated last year. they had great benefits. they care about there employee's. perfect hours of operations. The worst thing about working there is learning there system but that is something that you will catch on to with practice. I also liked there rate of pay. and there management team. I would defiantly recommend  this job to others.
good,Waste management was a great job I liked the job and liked the pay as well  my checks were great. Some days I would do 12 hour shifts from 6 am to 6 pm I worked Monday thru Friday and hade my weekends to chill I liked the job wish I can go back.
good,"My day started from the time I logged in to the time I logged off of answering phones and meeting my customers with a cheerful hello. My co-workers were most helpful when help was required. My manager was one of the best I have ever had.  The hardest part of my job was to listen to callers who were so upset they cursed at you, but being a professional you would defuse the situation.  Overall, this was a great company to work for many fun, team motivating competitions to be involved in."
good,Having an internship at waste management was a nice and rewarding experience. I had an amazing supervisor who was understanding and always willing to help.
good,"Started with company in California moving up to supervisor then moved to Oklahoma to work for 6 years. Work in Commercial refuse is hard up early, decent hours. Get along with crew good exchange of ideas about service managers willing to listen to drivers.Hardest part getting up early to work but after starting day enjoyed being own captain of truck.

good,"great place to work. The people were great, very helpful."
good,"I loved working at Waste Management. The people and atmosphere were amazing. The pay and benefits were attractive as well. The one downfall is that it seems like management and supervisors are just skating by. If you found a problem and offered up a solution (i.e. different segments of WM fighting over the sale, Inside Sales, Outside Sales, National Team) - they were upset with YOU because you weren't focusing on the task they wanted you to be doing, even though fixing these issues would be better for the prospective customer and future representatives that were in a similar position as mine (prospecting)."
good,"you go till your route is done, this could be 5 hours, 6 hours, or even 10 hours."

After working in Customer service for 5 years, I was promoted to inside sales, dealing with construction, business owners and portable outdoor facilities.  I learned how to provide business owners with removing their trash and dealt with roll-offs for construction sites.  I made sure trash bins were delivered and worked on what type of service they needed for their business.  Then most important I made sure that I completed legal contracts for that service.  Customers knew they could count on me to get the right service to help with what they needed.  Co-workers were great people and we enjoyed our time at work.  Dealing with homeowners was the hardest part of the job, they wanted the trash picked up from their house no matter what it took.  Sales was the most enjoyable part of my job.  I was really motivated to make the sale because I knew my reward would be my commission check each month."
good,"Stayed busy all day"
good,I have learned that being a recycle or garbage collector is a very demanding job.  Waste Management does there best to keep you driving safely with the demands of the job being time away from home or getting every can picked up daily.

I am able to work well as a team but i am also able to work alone without supervision. The hardest part of my job was leaving at the end of my work day if I had not gotten everything completed. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing I was doing a very good job. I did everything that was expected of me. I had a very good attendance record. In the 8 years I worked at the company i did not take any unscheduled days off. And I never called off sick."
good,Tight company with great advancement according to your own drive
good,Overall Waste Management Inc. is a great place to work. Co-workers are very supportive of each other and function as a team. The most important thing I have learned while working for Waste Management is how to maintain a positive upbeat attitude.
good,"Waste Management has been my favorite place to work for in my 20 year career there as a National Billing Representative. I dealt with more than 15 national account customers and adhered to billing deadlines. I really enjoyed all of my co-workers and sent them e-mails for all or most of their birthdays. I organized the birthday luncheons and other social occasions. It was a great way to know my co-workers and have a little fun at the same time. The hardest part of the job was meeting some of the deadlines but with the Sox audit process, it made it much easier. Some of the invoice presentations could also be tricky but for the most part we had standard template macros. The most enjoyable part of the job was the daily intereactions with my customers and getting results in a timely manner. I have never wanted to work for any other company but because of the move to Windsor CT for most of the billing and customer service positions, it has now forced me to look for a new career. Waste Management has meant everything to me and I hope that I can continue my career there in some fashion."

good,"The ladies I worked with in the office were my absolute favorite part of my job. They always knew how to put a smile on anyone's faces.

good,"Great starting pay , was a great company to work for, had some very good coworkers on the team. All and all I had fun working for waste management.Yes I would  recommend  the job to anyone."
good,"Time management is a must.  From the moment you clock in to the time you clock out, everything is about timing.  Getting your computer booted to start your day, and keeping tabs on your open programs is a multitask adventure in itself.  Lateness is not acceptable, even though, you are excused for some exceptions.  "
good,"If you haven't worked in the industry, this is a perfect place to start. This job gives you so many opportunities to learn about many different aspects of the given industry. Hydraulics is the thing you will learn about most where you won't learn anywhere else."
good,"I've worked on and off with Waste Management on contracts and as a consultant.  Each team I've worked with offered new experiences and opportunities to learn.  The work/life balance offered to the employees works well for the company.  As with any company, politics are visible; however, fairness is no stranger to most managers within the organization.  The incentive bonuses are definitely a plus."

good,They are on top of the mayor affecting issues that are today's main draw backs in the entire industry and they are always implementing ways to counter those problems. They conduct weekly meetings to address these problems and remind us of the potential deadly problems we were to encounter on the job . They will tape your daily performance during the time you're at the job and use it to make you aware if any deviation of the rules.
good,"The company provides an individual with many challenging opportunities."
good,"Great place to work. Typical day at Waste Management was good speak with customers on daily bases. Work culture was very nice. Management was the best, they would work with you on any problems that occur. The hardest part for me was to drive 80 miles one way. Team meeting was enjoyable most of the time.

good,"I would like to start by stating that Waste Management is a great opportunity for employment. A typical day includes: organizing work orders, assigning work orders to drivers, dispatching orders in such a way to manage fuel efficiency, truck weight, and time. The best part of the job is putting the puzzle together. You never know what is going to happen. The work environment is great! The employees are open minded and very respectful of their colleagues. Management works great with the employees because they care about their employees. The most challenging part of the job is holding people accountable for their actions. There is not system in place to gauge employees work in the dispatch department, which often causes problems between the employees. Waste Management provides excellent benefits and is the #1 leading company in the waste industry."
good,"My job at Waste Management was in a word amazing! I was very suited for the position. Unfortunately I got caught in a restructure due to business changes. I was the last one in so the first one out. A typical day started with payroll verification entry and processing. Reporting though out the day, driver check in, re sequencing of runs, customer service and sales liaison, balancing and reporting."
good,"Waste Management is a great company to work for. The people working there are honest and transparent. The management style is good, however, sometimes managers are overloaded with to many people to manage under them.  Co-workers are helpful and will assist if help is needed. The hardest part of the job is dealing with all of the re-tape associated with billing errors to resolution. Over all, WM is a flexible company to work for that cares about it's people."
good,"Great place to work at, co-workers are very friendly and helpful. Management is very well organized. Not to many opportunities to go up and be promoted."
good,"Worked with some of the most professional, knowledgeable, dedicated and interesting individuals in the waste industry."
good,Great company to be a part of with amazing co-workers. Weekly meeting to present our numbers and be able to grow and develop as a team. Most challenging part of my job was trying to manage over 100 drivers and their different daily needs as well as customers but it was what i enjoyed the most. Multitasking was essential as well as keeping everything organized.
good,honestly i enjoyed waste management even though i was a helper i felt like the job would of been even more enjoyable if i was an actually employee there.
good,We picked up recycle from various areas in Indian River county. It was my best job and the company takes care of you. It felt good to be apart of a fortune 500 company.

good,"WM has a good corporate culture that celebrates innovation, and promotes safety for their workers."
good,"I drove a leaf vacuum truck on a daily assigned route while a helper vacuumed up leaf piles. I learned team work and how to work within a strict timeline. The manager gave compliments to employees when warranted, which I have not often seen done. The hardest part of the job was driving the truck while watching the helper as well as watching for other vehicles on the road, mailboxes, low hanging wires and other hazards. I loved the pay and that time flew by so quickly because we were continually on the go and busy."
good,I was paid better than average to work with persons I had positive working relationships with. I was a good job
good,"Large Company with large company issues, great salary and benefits"

My co-workers were all very helpful and the culture was great. I learned a lot about time management, and how to be more productive. Management always had an open door policy and was always there to talk to."

good,"Dumping local waste  materials. I learned how to drive different trucks. Management don't have there drivers back, nor do they stand by them. I got along well with my co-workers. There was no hard parts. Finishing your assignment early was the best part."
good,"Working in a team environment to individually manage eight franchise agreements throughout various jurisdictions.  I work closely with each city to ensure all needs and contract requirements are met.  As far as co-workers, we are all very busy with our independent projects, but always find time to work as a team and come together when needed to execute a quality product.  We also focus on expanding our business by adding new services and working on contract retention, as well as bidding on new contracts.  The most difficult part of my job is our small local team- at times we have to rely on assistance from our regional office which is almost two hours away.  I enjoy the professional development, political relationships, and the high standard of customer service that comes with my job."
good,A day in the life of trash is always interesting.  There are so many different challengesin the trash business.  I have well enjoyed Waste Management during the 11 years as part of their organization.  Since I have been employed with WM  I know both  the trash and recycling of waste.  I have fun and exciting co workers that makes the job very enjoyable.  They are very engaged and always supporting.  The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting and exceeding the customers expectations.  I love retention the most because that is where I feel I have to go above and beyond to get the job done and fix the problem or concern.
good,"great job,nice pay good comunication with managementalso great hours."
good,"The vision, values and culture offered a lot of growth and bonus structure to service clients well, effectively manage existing accounts, and grow within the culture"
good,"My work day started at 6:30 am and I was the first one in the office, besides the drivers whom had their own room.  I weighed in trucks daily, I dealt with cash customers needing to dump their personal trash, all clerical duties, many different types of reports using computer skills I've acquired throughout the years and use of CB radio and surveillance cameras. The people I worked with were some of the best people I've ever met.  Each driver who worked for the company and the outside people needing to empty their trash, were always so nice to me.  There was no hard part of the job.  Unfortunately it was only a temporary job and they were bought out by a different company, they didn't want to let me go and gave me a good bye party when I did have to leave."
good,a typical day at work would consist of reviewing accounts and verifying information. 
good,"A day at work began as returning unwanted items to the shelves. I was moved around in the story alot because I learned how to work in electronic, homelines, garden center, as well as cashiering. I learned good customer service skills and got along with my coworkers very good. The hardest part of the job was knowing how much was expected of me and fulfilling it. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to be considered for a supervisor position. It was great to see that my managers saw potential in me."
good,"*Manage scale house operations regarding special waste loads, ensuring compliance is maintained and policy is enforced daily."

good,Busy customer and executive business relationships.
good,"A typical day at work involved a lot of interaction with the customers and drivers, there was also alot of paperwork each day to track pickups, trash destination and hours. Paperwork had to be done quickly and consistantly while fielding calls from customers and assigning up to 105 loads a day to the nearest of 15 drivers with the proper equipment. Our area covered from Winamac north of Logansport to Elwood, South of Tipton, and from Farmland west of Muncie to Flora west of Russiaville. I learned to multi task and remain calm and polite when under stress. I learned there are good managers and some who were not up to the task, after seeing some come up the ranks and then return to driving. I enjoyed spending time with my co-workers, after such a long time they become your second family. I enjoyed being part of a great team, where the drivers would jump in with suggestions on how to service the customers more efficiently. The hardest part of the job was having to be the bad guy on a 100 plus degree day and keep the drivers on overtime to get all the loads in. The most enjoyable part of the job is enjoying the feeling of providing the highest quality of service to the customer in a safe and timely manner. Seeing the smiles on customer and drivers faces when a day goes really well."

Sustainability and environmental stewardship are growing concerns for companies and individuals and Waste Management strives to provide the services and education that people are requiring and asking for to preserve our resources and our planet."
good,Waste management was a fun and GREAT job.  I really enjoyed working with you all and I wish I could've stayed.  I thoughtI I was doing a excellent job though I was told NUMEROUS of times. Elite in Hammond put me on another assignment that was down three surety from where I live in gary. But I did not have a problem with driving to Chicago to Waste Management
good,The day starts by having management have a five minute huddle to talk about current issues at the workplace. Maintaining the workforce and safety culture.
good,Customer service position was busy but work was enjoyable. Co-workers fantastic. Everyone chipped in to help one another. Management was fair and stepped in to help when asked
good,Ability to truly see what your made of. The best team working enviornment I've ever been a part of. Grueling manual labor like you've never seen before but you get a chance to see if your the best or just don't have what it takes. It requires something special inside you to compete at this pace in this career.
good,"It was years ago but was my favorite job. Close to home, co-workers were nice, customers even irate ones were great to work for. They offered great benifits and gave you a turkey for Thanks Giving Day."
good,Really great company to work for if you can handle running refuse routes. I dislike residential routes and moving to commercial routes is almost impossible depending on the site you apply for. Waste Management goes off of senority.
good,"I really wish that I can go back to work for Waste Management! They kept me in shape, but working in bad weather was something that I had to really get used to. I love the hours I work and I was off on weekends and paid holidays."

good,"I love walking into work and being greeted by name not only from my co-workers, but also my supervisor who is in the break room with us."
good,This place is a great job for someone who enjoys what they do. If you want to advance all you have to do is apply after 6 mounts at your current position. Raises here are the same as all the other trash haulers. Average 3% every April. But the pay is great and the job is fun. Not a good place to work if you have small kids because you will never see them.
good,"the biggest thing you will have to deal with is weather . your going to be the back of a trash trust while it is driving ,waiting to hop off at every single trash can to dump and replace ."
good,Enjoyed every minute of it but lost job due to realignment.  Management and HR very friendly and caring.  Benefits are outstanding.

good,Excellent pay.Great job if you enjoy getting dirty.Benefits was excellent.Hours could be better and management could have been better.Overall its a good job.
good,A typical day a WM in Columbia was an office setting. My co workers were awesome. Everyone would step up and help each other when needed. It was more of a family feeling. Our manager was the best. She was always willing to teach you new things. She kept our minds busy. The job was not hard once you had a day to day system. Each day brought new challenges.
good,It's a very good company.  Overall things are well the pay is not what it should be for a company this size and what we actually do.  They are not in touch with what is required to complete the job.
good,I've been here for 12 years now I love the benefits I love the environment management could be a little better though. We are constantly getting new contracts in new work truck and normally we get an annual raise
good,"I am currently in recycling which I believe is of great service for the community and the earth as a whole.  Employee safety is a Waste Management concern, which makes me proud to be apart of."
good,I only worked for Waste Management 6 months because I moved but I loved working for the company. Everyone supported one another and management truly cared about their employees. Pay and benefits were the best I've had.  I would work there again in a heartbeat.
good,It was a 4 days a week contract.This job is not as easy as it looks.Co-workers are great to work with.Overtime if you choose to do some.

good,"In Houston, TX downtown if you live anywhere else takes almost an hour to get there.."
good,Typical day at work would consist of coming in opening all my computer programs that I deal with everyday and talk to customers/generators and help them profile their waste streams and  handle everything that the customers need. Enjoy everyone I work with. Great plant to work at.
good,I get to use heavy equipment in a work environment that few people get to enjoy!  I love to work outdoors and this job has plenty of that.  I also love to assist with the paperwork that most people would try to ignore.
good,"i basicly wore 3 hats i learned how to use a cash register,how to help people with their question about recycleing. .always busy if its slow i found something to do without the boss having to tell me to  do it.i got along with most of my coworkers,most of the time it was language was the biggest part but i would stop to figure out how to understand what they are saying by writing to best that i could find someone to help.the hardest part was the at first that i didnt think that i could do the job but tried it and thinking that i can do this YES i did it!!the most enjoyable part was the customers the enjoyed coming to our recycling center knowing that we would help them treat them wit respect and most of all HONEST in what we do and tell them. ."
good,"This company has provided me with the knowledge and foundation to manage and motivate teams, build strong internal and external relationships, deep dive for system and process resolutions, and work effectively to produce results. "
good,"A great place to work new challenges every day,good benifits and pay would recomend employment to anyone looking for a long lasting employer"
good,"I worked for the company for 10 years, but unfortunately slowing economy called for cut backs.  I supervised 7 amazing people that we all worked well together and became a family.  My manager understood family and the company in a whole is very family orientated.  I enjoyed running the heavy equipment and performing monthly reports along with the being in charge of the safety inspections,  we would struggle and work long hours when equipment broke down or holidays fell during the week but together we fought to get through and accomplished the goal in the end,"
good,The management team showed appreciation for my work weekly. I was compensated for doing my job. They created a safe work environment. I was shown how to handle stressful situations and deal with problems on a call to call basis. I mastered multi tasking during my time there. I also exceled at staying calm under pressure and giving the best customer service no matter the circumstance.

good,"Very professional, fast paced and productive environment"
good,i was there for 14 years and enjoyed working there for 13 of them until my boss pasted away. the new manager was not the greatest to work for
good,"I started with the company in 2005, as a front line Manager, and progressed over the 7 years I was employed, to District Manager. The company sold up and left town back in 2012, but my time, overall was one of the best - very stressful at times, but the support network was second to none, and the structure and systems were light years ahead of the competition. There were tough times, but I can honestly say I have nothing negative to say about this employer - fantastic family atmosphere & great safety culture. In my last 2 to 3 years at the District, I had the honour to work with a great team, and fantastic group of professional drivers & support employees & staff. I believe one of my lowest seniority employees had 10 years seniority - that speaks for itself. From the bottom to the top, your opinion counted, and regular employee surveys were carried out by external (confidential) bodies, and all findings acted upon. Where else can you find that? Also, they continually asked their customers (with surveys) what they thought about WM. If you get the call, it will be the best decision you can make ...."
good,"Waste Management was unfortunetly a contract based position, but such a great company to work for. Everyone is so nice and welcoming, and incredibly appreciative of the work I do. It is a shame it was only for a short period of time, I would have really enjoyed to stay as an employee."
good,"when i first started to work at a mrf i thought it was hard feeding material on to the conveyor belt because of the heavy equipment,but after a few hours of learning how to drive the machine and how the recycling process works it becomes really fun."

good,"There is no typical day at work, everyday is different."
good,I enjoyed working for this company and so did my uncle. I was trained here when time for reviews I was given a lot of positive feedback. I will always respect my peers at this job. advancement could be better but my overall review for this company would be Yes to any one applying.
good,"This company was a joy to work for and offered great growth potential and compensation. As a requirement for new hires, I sat in on all departments for a time. This enabled me to get a greater understanding behind their operating system. From riding on trash trucks, to shadowing in the sales and customer service departments, to the maintenance shop and transfer area, all helped me gain a healthy respect for all employees and how their jobs fit into the overall picture. The management was very supportive and offered me new challenges into different departments and responsibilities. As I quickly learned, I quickly advanced. I worked solidly in all accounting aspects including daily entry (payables and receivable), closes, budgeting and deposits for a multimillion dollar corporation. The benefits were superb. I would have stayed however when my salary was capped and without an actual accounting degree, I could not further my self or my compensation. From the top level to the bottom, this was a wonderful work experience full of great employees and management."
good,"We threw away trash, and everybody was always polite and friendly. I made friends quick, and it is a great work place."
good,great co workers baf management long hours bad management bad equipment bad maintemance

My day would start with helping my community and working with clients to keep them safe and satisfied. I would drive to any points in my map to do my job.

I worked in harsh weather conditions and did not complain, it was my job to keep my clients happy and safe and my management in good standings."
good,"Its hard to wake up at 2 A.M every day to be to work so early, you never really get used to it. Management is very nice and work with you on issues you might have on the job site. I normally work 53 hrs a week and its very well compensated."

Overall WM was a great place to work - if the division here in Jacksonville, FL was larger, and there were more opportunities in Operations - I would have stayed and moved into an Operations role.  The people in Operations had been there for years, and an opening would not have come along anytime soon, so I decided to try something else.  I would highly recommend working at WM."

good,worked 6 days a week doing miscellaneous jobs as needed with machinery. The first shift started at 3:30 am with 2 men until 7am then the rest of our crew came in . Lunch was for a hour you took that in shifts as the trash never stopped coming. at the end of the day you was required to cover the trash with dirt and where you started the next morning we would place a tarp over it to prevent smell and wind from blowing the trash away.

good,Residential and commercial rubbish removal by subscription. I was taught computer systems and account management protocol. I oversaw the day to day operation of scheduling and equipment condition. The most difficult part of the job was the length of the day which often ran between ten and twelve hours.
good,"I worked there two years as a Project Manager and would work there again.  The problem is that there are not many Project Manager jobs with WM.  And, they will not pay to relocate."
good,"The Job was okay, I don't really have much to say beside the fact that there were a lot of favoritism going on there when I was working at that place. The shift lead thought they were God, they expect women to date them just so you can have any ""respect"" in there. But I don't know for now since I left that job long ago"

good,I enjoyed my time at WM. I felt like I needed to move on to be able to advance my career via studies through college courses. I find now that I just want to continue working and getting an education at the same time. My typical day was data entry work. I am interested in doing more than data entry work and want to advance my opportunities. Management talks the talk about career choices and advancements but it does not apply to everyone. I am searching for a great opportunity to learn and grown with a company.

good,"I enjoyed my work life at Waste Management. They offer a good work environment, competitive pay and excellent benefit plan."

good,Worked with a dynamic group of women in fast paced workplace.  Helped customers with very different waste projects.  Learned the ins and outs of Landfill Regulations in the state of Louisiana.  Closing office due to corporate downsizing aka centralizing TSC to one location.
good,This is the best job ever! it is an cool environment and it has open door policy for suggest. Staff is treated like humans. The job offer so much for an person who likes to advance with hardwork.
good,I've never been treated so well by a company. You are not just a number. the kind of work you can be proud of. the hours are amazing
good,Typical day at work is doing your assigned duties with minimum supervisor support. Team-work; employees doesn't mind helping one another with work details.
good,"I started on as a temp but they hired me on fill time right now. I worked in their call canter for hours and I loved working one on one over the phones to settle disputed bills or setting up new accounts, taking paymnets etc."

good,"Job was very flexible, with supervisors and managers that were cooperative. Pressure was stable, while everyone worked hard, and no one created trouble for other coworkers"
good,it was a good way to see and me new people and become a part of such large company.I learned a lot of safety rules and tips.they provide us with food and drinks and make you're dressed for the job
good,"A work day would normally start at either 5, or 6 am.  Each day would start with a group huddle, and discuss a safety topic, and another employee driven topic if needed.  I learned a lot at this job about different rules and regulations, and how it can affect a job being done, why they are in place.  Management was always available for helping with problem solving and open to clear communication.  Working with others at Waste Management is always fun.  Every day you could have a conversation either before or after your scheduled work with a different person.  I think the toughest part of being a driver for WM is working during poor weather, especially during the winter months.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a diverse group of people as well as the pride in knowing every day that you are safely operating a commercial vehicle and keeping yourself, your co-workers, and the general public safe whenever you are out on route."
good,Great environment to work at! Management is there big on promoting with in. Also the employees are great the love working and have nothing but good things to say about company.
good,"Typical day was phones ringing and drivers coming in and out, having patients and prioritizing workload was a learning experience everyday. Management was very involved and willing to help out, co workers were all team players and fun to be around. the hardest part of this job was handling upset customers, the most enjoyable part of this job was talking to so many different people on a daily basis and building a good work relationship with them."

good,"great work environment"
good,"it was really interesting to work there, learned a lot of stuff that has helped in the real world. gained life long friends that are always here to help me. Good references"
good,"This is a job that always has something for the workers to do. This is an important fact when it comes to never getting lazy and continuously working your hardest to get the job done. Work is very heavy duty. The machines are dangerous, so the key to the job is to always stay alert. It involves a lot of multitasking and attention to detail. The environment may be hot and dirty, but it is a company that could be a potentially great place to retire from."
good,A typical day at work for me is. To get dressed in the safty equipment. Also so do the warm up we have to do mandtory to get your day started off. I have leaned to be on time and to work hard. And to also respect your co-workers because you will probly be around them more then your own family. Also u will not want to fuss and cuss at the work place.The hardest part of the job was nothing I loved the job. Even though we stand on our feet for 10 hours a day it was a nice and good paying job. The most enjoyable part of  the job was working with my co-workers they just make the job more fun and also they make the day go by a lot fatser.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is producing quality parts. The work day was very productive.  I got along with all my co workers.
good,"I love working here, the customers are great and so are my co workers. The have great benefits. I just really enjoy working here"

good,"TYPICAL day of work is always appreciated and brings a sense of accomplishment. MANAGEMENT along with my co-workers are very easy to work with and they set a very good example of what hard work is and the satisfaction a job well done brings. HARDEST part of my job is not having the training to apply for a different position in the company, which is garbage truck driver. MOST enjoyable part is learning from co-workers."

good,I thoroughly enjoyed this temporary assignment because I liked the paralegal manager and others who worked on this project with me.
good,"Waste Management is one of the best companies one can work for, I keep in touch from people that still work there and i just wish i was back there, is what one can call a well oiled machine."
good,It really is a great place to work no one is breathing down your next. Able to work on your on pace and time table. You are on call 24/7 so it is very hard to plan anything with your family.
good,I will start off by saying this place gave me a chance when I just got my CDL license and when nobody else wanted to give me a chance because of no experience. I started out as a laborer and moved into a driving position with them. Job is very physically demanding and you should like being outside in all types of weather. Me personally I liked the schedule of going in at 3am and getting off around noon. Only place I have been where we all got along even if we had a problem with each other we handled it in the right way. Management was fantastic and actually acted like they cared about you. Very sad they had to relocate or I would of spent the rest of my life there.
good,I've worked for Waste Management for about 3 1/2 years and I've enjoyed every bit of it. They are so caring towards their employees and their benefits were amazing. The company I worked for was their sister company which was Waste Management Healthcare but then became Waste Management Sustainability. I have learned so much from this company and my work ethic has been greatly improved due to working here. I would love to further my career here if I am given the chance to.
good,I loved working with the mesa site. They were a positive group of people dedicated to their jobs. Good benefits and salary.

good,A typical day of work I run the tipping floor that is where trucks dump all material i load and unload trucks with a front loader forklift or skid steer. I have learned to master operating heavy equipment i am very good at at my job . I have some good co workers we are kinda like a family away from at times it can seem like we spend more at work then home it is good to have good co workers . I would have to say the hardest part of my job is when machines break down the best part is being the best at what i do and having people depend on me and always being to produce results.
good,"typical day would be taking around 80-100 calls a day, being professionally courteous and also being able to offer services an sales of products, compensation and bonuses drive work"
good,"First thing was to check to see if my AP person needed help with AP keying in PeopleSoft AP System. Invoices from field had a 24 hr. turn around. I may key couple hours to help her get caught up. Check e-mail and phone calls answer any question that came in. I would prepare to add assets in the PeopleSoft Asset Management System. Verify I had proof of delivery from field. Code with asset information needed to add. Verify that the cost in the PeopleSoft GL System was correct. Pull cost from PeopleSoft Project Cost System and add the asset. "
good,"A typical day in waste management consisted of arriving everyday promptly at 6 am, and providing customers with as much information about the services we are providing them. I learned where all of the trash and recycling that we use goes. I also learned the process for which it was done. My co-workers were great! They were very energetic and loving. The hardest part of the job was keeping track of the information about the services, seeing as it changed in real time. The most enjoyable part of my day was at the end when my job was completed and I had served my purpose in the company for that day."
good,"Good money, but worked in trash so no the best smelling job i ever had for sure. Job was close to home and lots of overtime. Was glad to be away from trash."
