rating,review
bad,Working for this place I got putt on public display after and incident and it became a hostel work place  for me and when I worked there it’s was stressful and I started getting sick I reported that one of my fellow co workers touch my backside and nothing was done and after I did that I was separated from the company in retaliation and I have not been the same sense the incident happen while this whiperson still works for them I had to find another job
bad,"I went to HR for my subordinates screaming and cursing at me then I was the one written up  "
bad,MGM touts that they are big on promoting from within.  That's a joke in my experience.  I have applied for multiple positions which I was highly qualified for and found they've hired from outside.  Liars!
bad,Management doesn’t care about their Employees. They are deceitful and shows favoritism to certain situations. Very disappointing for a company this large. I wouldn’t recommend anyone working in the Security Dept. Very bad experience for me
bad,I wouldn’t recommend working at MGM resorts to anybody. Management treats their employees terrible. It shows in their ability to retain employees at the present time.
bad,At first mgm made it seem like it was fun to work at the contact center but once management wasn’t in the same page it became very stressful. After a while i was unhappy with the company.
bad,They don’t care about the employees only making a profit or abort conditions do not stand by their word low pay rate when promised high pay rate  and quick to write you up and terminate you for any little reason I work security for most underpaid departments  and un appreciated.
bad,MGM managers needs more training they are disrespectful toward people. The food make. You sick manager sit in the office talk about the worker's like a dog. The have poor training .
bad,very dangerous job dealing with drunks and people who carry guns that you'll never even see until they blast you in the head securities the worst terrible job very very dangerous you could be killed at any moment and they could care less about you terrible place to work terrible just terrible don't work there as a security guard
bad,"Avoid working in this place. It's like having a dysfunctional spouse. They threaten & cause stress while teaching the goodness of being a kind servant supervisor. These people will lies, cheat, & steal your life away if that had their way."
bad,"I worked for the conventions external network teams."
bad,"Harassment , 5 employees-co workers,  in the same day left work place in one day, they could not stay any longer with poor management and management above not helping at all."
bad,As a salaried Chef I don't recommend working for this company at all ! I constantly had to work 12+hrs daily due to being short staffed. MGM 2020 has cut so many hard working Employees just so they can make more and more money company wide. I was literally let go while coming in on my day off to work. I was a salaried employee so I don't get paid extra for all the extra hours I put in. The turn over rate here is horrible. Chefs do not allow you to grow and treat you like dirt. Be prepared to work longer then your own manager.
bad,Would not recommend - even Director of HR is corrupt. Was told BY the HR Director that I needed to see professional help. Constantly belittled. Poor leadership.
bad,"I worked for 1 year and I had to leave for better opportunities. No promotion or available spots. "
bad,"cleaning up to 20 rooms, Managment was unpleseant. The money was good but the company cares about money more than the employees. Over all good experence to know that i would not be interrested in working for the MGM in the future."
bad,"My typical work day started with a staff meeting,and getting my paperwork ready for the work day, i learned to be more supportive of staff with training. my management was the supportive and lovely. the work place culture was upstanding and one of the best jobs i have ever worked at. the hardest part of my job was keeping up with the wonderful work place. the best part of my job was making a positive impact on my work place environment and people i wored with."
bad,"Not only do they e x p l o i t  their employees they have NO consideration whatsoever for the lives of them although they claim so highly that they do. They claim to value education and the advancement of their employees, but that is NOT TRUE! BEWARE: They will sell you all the glory of the company, but in reality it's NOT all it's cracked up to be. My advice: JOIN THE UNION that is actively recruiting workers if you decide to work there."
bad,"I experienced that if you do not have any college degree even if you have a lot of experience in working, you will not go very far. The environment is not for the average person. The Diversity does not reflect on what they do on a daily basis. I have a partner that is going blind and they did not accommodate his need when he was hired. We had to go and seek help outside of the workplace for his needs. They hire housekeepers and fire them every six months. To have the government tax breaks every year. They have also hired recently graduated from college as executive positions at a very low pay."
bad,"I worked for a off-shoot of MGM Corporate, it was one of the best jobs I have ever had for the diversity of work and fun projects, the problem was No real support from your management team and HR team, I could have saved 10 people in a fire, and then HR or my boss would tell me how wrong I did it and probably suspend me, NOT look at who or why the fire started (this is just a example) !! Don't trust your management partners or employees, the whole culture is trained to  through you under the bus! the only thing that is important to management is MGM!!"
bad,"It’s hard to get in but not worth it. You can be the best worker and they still choose everybody who’s messing up, over you. Everybody snitching while they are doing wrong."
bad,They were a culture that promoted bullying and harassment. There was no promotion of growth within the company. They focused on scare tactics instead of positivity.
bad,The last department anyone will like to work on this property the director and executive only looking for saving money putting at risk the customer safety and the employee didt have the proper tools for work And all the Chemistry mixed whit water
bad,The pay is extremely low compared to the workload. I constantly felt as if we were rudely interrupted by management and everyone felt as if they were on the chopping block. It was horrible.
bad,The atmosphere at MGM is that your job is always under threat.  That you are just a number and that you are utterly replacable.  Management has little to no respect for employees and HR gets rid of anyone who brings forth a valid complaint instead of dealing with issues.  Management also willingly slanders former employees who call out theft rings and mistreatment of employees.
bad,"Words from their own employees mouths :"
bad,"I wouldn't recommend this job only because of you we're to get mess up on a call,  make it late call in sock to any times,   of would you get suspended for a day with no pay the next step would be suspended and under investigation in which the 3 options they give is bull and they will fired with out giving you a chance"
bad,"Dont work here! the management is the worst youve ever seen. very imature and mean people. gossiping and talking about dating life, dont help you act like they are busy. they have friends that they help but if you arent friend they will make you suffer."
bad,"Pros-vendor relationships, co-workers, free lunches, departmental relationships, planning events"
bad,"Mandalay Bay is notorious for being the worst, meanest place to work on the Las Vegas strip. Coworkers rat on each other, start false rumors, call themselves your family while knowingly stab you in the back on a daily basis.Everyone trying to one up each other including the Terrible management. So many captains fighting for a promo they'll cut anyone's throat to get it. Management laughs and thinks it's all a game. Union sides with management. Most negatively talked about banquet department in all LV. Yes there are a few kiss butts that love it but they are truely mean spirited people. Most everyone does there job and does it well but there are tons of superior bragers. They take credit for your work. Truely under appreciated workers."
bad,by far one of the worst management i have came across. the HR have this policies that are really hard to deal with. if any one got hired at MGM expect this.
bad,They are a horrible company. As a cashier I would get threatened that I will get fired for not meeting the 15 rewards sign ups a day and 5 Sears credit cards BS!!!! You cannot force people to sign up for anything they these people are ridiculous.
bad,"A typical day consists of continual berating, suspicion of everything done, being treated as sub-human and incapable of performing any work correctly is the daily norm."
bad,"They were unprofessional, and set their staff up for failure in my department. I did not agree with the way they handle things, and favoritism in the work place."
bad,"This company under the MGM umbrella is a joke."
bad,On a daily basis of assisting guest with luggage and other needs.
bad,I arrive at work go in for a meeting to find out what or who to expect that day. As I work in a very high limit area and we have to be prepared for the guest and know every thing before they arrive. I work with a very diverse work force. I have learned about all cultures and really enjoy the people. The hardest part would be when a credit problem arises and I have to manage the guest who wants more money and can't get it and I am not aware of the why I just have to explain the reality of the situation and make sure they are happy at the end of it all.
bad,A sweatshop environment with completely incompetent keystone cop leadership that resembles something out of a cartoon.
bad,"MGM was very fair to their workers when they first took over.. Now that they control 40% of the strip, they treat the employees very bad.. Not recomended to work there, find employment elsewhere.."
bad,Wouldn’t recommend to anybody management is beyond horrible and they do not care about their employees at all they speak to new employees as if their not human beings management is very petty and goes tick for tack with each other which can be very irritating for the employees. You’ll have one manager telling you to do one thing and another telling you something different. They constantly threaten to take your job away if you mess up during training. The job itself isn’t hard but the people there makes it very draining and stressful. They have a very high turnover rate and majority of the employees that’s there has been there 20 yrs or better and they all are just there for the check or to find the next person to sleep with. The pay is ok but it’s not worth the draining work they expect you to do.
bad,"MGM Resorts is a cut-throat company that only cares about the bottom line. They emphasize the exploitation of young fresh (often inexperienced talent) and dump staff once they get too expensive (though salaries are well below industry standards). Best use of one's time at this company is to get in, get the experience, and get out before you get jaded and they eventually dump you for someone younger and cheaper. I chose to leave based on the writing on the wall, and have been proven right again and again."
bad,Toxic environment! management is clueless how to run a flight department. Expect to work everyday you are available for your 14 on 7 off schedule. Revolving door at the Flight Department.
bad,"Often punished for small things like not standing up properly in front of guests (slouching). The girls bullied and told on each other constantly, so poor communication. Very high turnover rate. They DO NOT under any circumstance work with your schedule. Regardless if your a college student, mother, etc. They do not care. Very enabling culture for bad behavior between coworkers due to poor management. Guests are allowed to treat you like garbage because they pay lots of money for services. Had me working late nights by myself with no security guard, often felt unsafe from certain guests. I've never left a bad review for a job, even difficult ones, but boy this one takes the cake. Great summer job if you just need money and hours."
bad,"While attending a three week training seminar, in preparation for the opening, the narrative was ""you've all been hand-picked for this life-transforming job.  You will have the tools and training necessary to perform your job and management will be there for support.""  6 months in and nothing could be further from the truth.  Those of us who were ""hand-picked"" have our seniority ignored.  Management is less interested in support and more focused on belittling their workers.  No one will work with your schedule, but management will hold it against you if you can't cover a shift.  Managers are constantly losing emotional control, but want their workers to stay cool.  They can be unhappy, but when you are it's a problem.  My life changed for the worse when I started here.  More stress, more sleepy and more moody.  I never fully bought the dream they sold, but the nightmare is very apparent."
bad,"I worked at Mandalay Bay Hotel last year as a Pool Attendant just to get my foot in the door and start building a career with MGM Resorts. In the beginning of the season everything went great, it felt like an awesome place to work. Then the Director of Pool Operations, who was a strong disciplined woman that showed a lot of respect to her employees who did their jobs, received a promotion and was transferred to a new department. That's when everything at the pool changed. Once summer began it started getting very busy where you would have 8,000 - 12,000 guests a day showing up to the pool. It would get very hot and there was always so much to clean for only $8.25 / hour. You would spend all day cleaning that eventually it became very difficult to focus on guest services to earn tips. "
bad,"I came into this position with high hopes and full of ambition. At first I was praised beyond belief and then overnight everything changed. This is not a place where professionalism is key. They sold the atmosphere as a 'team', only to micromanage and make you do the work of your own manager. There was little to no communication from the management down, but you were expected to know what they want. It is a hostile work environment where mean girls with mediocre skills prevail. There are regular outbursts and continuous negativity. They will find a way to bring you down, despite how much they tell you how well you are doing. To be allowed to attend a meeting relevant to your job is considered a ""privilege."" This was a very dissapointing experience and I would NEVER recommend this position to anyone that has a mind of their own and a truly professional demeanor. It will not be appreciated."
bad,"The job security at MGM Beach Resort is very poor. You can be thrown out of the company any time without any reasons explained. One should really discuss with the ex-staff before joining the team. One should join MGM only with a appointment letter, as they don't have a policy of appointment letters for many categories. Service charges are promised, but  not given on time, The first 3 months we don't get service charges, and when one resigns, they lose the previous pending services charges also."
bad,They suck. Management very biased in their treatment of workers. In department i worked several employees were hostile. Basically there was no supervision. Most enjoyable part of job was when you were leaving.
bad,"Baby boomers are the companies senior leaders. As a younger generation female with fresh ideas, I was irrelevant and easily replaced. My last year there, was the most unsuccessful and stressful time of my life."
bad,"They cut the employees with the most knowledge and highest pay to save cash and overwork newer employees trying to get ahead.   Burn out, illness and suicide is now common for active and ex employees in Las Vegas.  I personally knew two employees that committed suicide.  It is not an joke.  The culture is not what they preach."
bad,Poor management and work place.  The only positive thing about working there is the benefits. Would never recommend this company to anyone for employment.
bad,"You start part time on call with no guarantee of hours at all, no one can survive like that and the seniority policy makes it impossible for you to get any work"
bad,Delayed in clock in and payments.The hallways are a long way to get to the lunch line so by the time its lunch time the break is over with.Cold night with no heater standing up allnight outside
bad,Good to learn about excellent customer service taught by Forbes employees. Forbes done an outstanding job within the teaching us the best way to bring in all clients around the world.
bad,"Bellagio poker room has the most dishonest,discusting crooked supervisors & management & a reputation as the most hostile workplace of a poker room to work in the country.Dealer protection is non-existant because of players constantly tipping supervisors to get away with behavior of unruly children,Cussing,berating,and sometimes spitting on dealers,Supervisors steal tips from game attendants and dealers get poor rotations unless you pay them. This poker room has criminal elements the gaming commission is oblivious too.Some management needs to be arrested for years of extortion from fellow workers and players"
bad,"Avoid this place: The pay compared to what the job requires of you is Corporate Wage Theft at its greatest. If you dont heed my words and go forward, expect the opposite of what you are told in orientation. The Management is the worst I have ever experienced anywhere. The EDR is sickening (literally). You are better off working for a Local Private Security Company than being exploited by these people. Save yourself a lot of aggravation. Everyone of my coworkers that I speak with is constantly looking for another job and its a revolving door of people coming and going. You have been warned."
bad,"administered daily and advanced security measures throughout the property to ensure excellent standards. monitored and patrolled assigned areas to provide a safe enviroment for guests, employees, the company and its property while maintaining professional rapport with local law enforcement officials."
bad,Major company restructuring resulted in many layoffs but company is still hiring often in the same departments. No job security. It's hard to trust this company. Beware!!!
bad,"The MGM is a great place to work if your are full time and have job security. With the recent restructuring of the MGM, no position is secure. They use a lot of contract/temp agencies but do not have many permanent positions for them."
bad,"I cocktail for MGM I've been here for 5 years now and I hate it. The management is joke no one is on the same page. I'm on the extra board and they took our days off away so we are on call 24/7. I cant plan or do anything because I have to be by my phone worried all day. Everyone who works there is miserable. I would think twice before leaving a job to work here. When I first started it wasn't like this at all, it gets worse every year."
bad,"Smoke and mirrors, everything is fake especially the management and Chef's. Totally reliant on tourist traffic, serve horrible food and have to buy bad products because of company spec and it does not matter cause a whole new group will be thru tomorrow"
bad,"In working at a casino you have to be able to deal with members of management who came from working at one of the automotive plants and the disrespectful manner in which they speak and treat you. Working for this particular casino has shown me a very bad side to gambling and those who can become easily addicted to it. "
bad,"Good union benefits but you are treated as a number. Horrible culture, a lot of nastiness from management. Easy to get into management very hard to get promoted. That and the fact that they can’t boss people around like they can at a non-union creates a lot of animosity. Customers also have a sense of entitlement when they lose money that creates a bad energy throughout the building."
bad,"My experience with MGMRI has been confirmed by so many co-workers, Mandalay Resort Group was a way better proprietor/employer. Mandalay Resort Group treated their employees way better and demonstrated they were greatly more appreciative of employees, patrons and guests. MGMRI has removed the philosophy of value in every way."
bad,"There are a lot of politics at MGM Resorts international FSSC.  The FSSC makes you a number in a system no personal feel.  Moreover, if you don't suck up to the right people you will have a hard time advancing."
bad,Easy job however a very stressful environment with a poor customer base. If you can handle being threatened and cussed at constantly then it makes the job much easier.
bad,This place is infamously known as the plantation. Management treats you like you are worthless and will not stick up for you at all. I tried countless times to switch to other departments and each time I am rejected. The management keeps hold of you and wont let you advance. No holiday pay or night time differential. For the company such as MGM you would think they would treat their employees great but that is not the case at all. Be wary working for this place. The pay is decent but sometimes it feels it is not worth it. There is no training here. You are thrown into situations and expected to know what to do.
bad,"its a job, where their is a lot of oppertunites, for growth and advancement"
bad,"Lackluster environment? Check."
bad,MGM is implementing their 2020 initiative and displacing 30% of the employees with no regard to the lives of the employees that are left working or losing their shifts. It has become a very stressful place of employment and many are looking to make a career change.
bad,if you were thirsty or weren't feeling good the management did not really care. They cared more about the guest than they did about their own employees. They also treated the lifeguards better than the pool attendants. they were let off with a lot of things that were suppose ti be followed but were not .
bad,"Overall one of the main reasons I left was the lack of respect and treatment that upper and mid level management showed towards it's line employees, very stressful."
bad,"Competitive Pay Plan"
bad,"A typical day at work at MGM Mirage was typing English and Arabic correspondence, reports, emails, replenishing kitchen supplies, etc.  I do not believe I learned much at that job except for what was involved in the day to day work for a General Manager which I had not experienced before. I do not believe that this type of work is suitable for me as I felt it was more clerical than administrative.  Although the rest of the employees were very nice, my supervisor was not and it appeared that whatever I did was not good enough for him. The workplace culture was friendly and open although I always experienced tensions.  The hardest part was dealing with my supervisor.  The only satisfaction I got from that job was designing and executing a complex multi-sectional filing system.  It involved correspondence, architectural maps and various types of media which I was able to organize in an easily accessible and referenced format.  I do not believe there was any other redeeming factor I can mention about working there.  I ended up resigning after a few months of work."
bad,"Pay and benefits are good because of union but you will have no life, the hours suck, forget about ever not working on a holiday or getting a full week of vacation time. One of the most hostile working environments, ever!"
bad,I worked at mgm for 18yrs and very good at customer service.I also enjoyed coworkers but upper management the ones you can't see all the way to the top are very cut throat and entrusting.
bad,Some of the managers there are just getting out of school and don't actually have any practice or real work experience so they try to tell you how to do  at your job and ask you how to do theirs they try to step on others to make themselves look better as they try to climb their way up the corporate ladder
bad,"I had fun working here. It was easy, laid back and I made decent money."
bad,"Accounting is running the place,"
bad,I hate MGM because I loved my job there but unfortunately they made me work hours I really couldn't work do to my child. They didn't care at all. How could a company be so heartless!
bad,"I felt like i had no support and had to watch my back.  They provide instructions basically telling you how to design, in their way.  I also did I.T. work to help the department I.T. guy which took on additional role and they gave me some if not all the I.T. work.  I also had a scheduled maintenance to do and it had to be done from what I was told.  It looked bad, especially when I couldn't meet last minute design changes for meetings that very same morning.  I felt very uncomfortable at work especially with my manager, which set me up for failure from the beginning."
bad,I provide Health and Wellness knowledge to the corporate employees of MGM Resorts International. I present different health topics each month and create health promotion programs surrounding the topics.
bad,"Working hard solving problems and helping where needed.  Learned how to handle difficult issues calmly and getting the job done right."
bad,"Every day is challenging, but enjoyable here we all work together as synced unit to provide 4Star service to all the guests love my job..."
bad,"No concern for your personal life, you are replaceable at all times. Do as we say, not as we do. The company leads you to believe they care about their employees however they do not at all."
bad,The organizational culture was very fragmented and the tools and leadership theory was dated. The organization used legacy software and hardware that made learning and maintaining systems difficult. Management team was not readily visible nor where they engaged. The organization did not connect with its employees nor did they provide a positive working environment.
bad,"MGM 2020 laid off thousands of employees. Would love to continue to work here but I can't afford it. It isn't managements fault, just the way to cookie crumbles."
bad,"Fun workplace,easy to become a team!... Unfortunately, management seems to only care about customer satisfaction and making money and could care less about how many people are unhappy with their job and then they (management) also acts surprised when everyone starts quitting on the spot."
bad,"MGM Springfield have Employees in mind for various jobs and when someone else apply for jobs. They don't hire you and, they give you the run around that they are still looking at your application. When they have in mind someone else. It sucks to work there. It does not seems like you can get ahead. And more Outsiders are coming in and fill open position's when, it could of filled with in-house Employees first."
bad,It's not how it used to be before they are to greedy now and all they care about are the sales and the money. They used to value the workers but now the y will replace you for someone willing to work cheaper than their worth
bad,"I do not recommend working for MGM is you value a dynamic, friendly, relationship and team focused workplace. Do work for MGM if you want to lack succession planning, realistic leadership training and related forward thinking management goals."
bad,"Corporate departments were treated terribly by property teams, leadership and the c-suite. We were assigned senior vice presidents and vice presidents based on relationships rather than skill set. Due to poor leadership, people from the properties were always the top candidates when there were promotion opportunities."
bad,"Many of the years I spent at the MGM Grand were happy and productive.  After our new CEO and his staff came on board, morale plummeted and old-timers were either forced out or found employment elsewhere.  Training is minimal at best and, at least in my department, employees are in fear for their jobs.I don't know if it is this way at all of the MGM Resorts International properties, but the MGM Grand is no longer a fun place to work."
bad,No respect whatsoever between management and dealers.Crooks and hatred everywhere.Favoritism on dealer rotation to whoever sleeps with who or pays the most. Floorpeople cheat chiprunners out of tips.On-call dealers are second rate citizens
bad,Although the first few years were good the last 5+ years were tough. Having grown up in the hospitality industry working for a company that truly is more focused on the bottom line versus employees and most importantly the guests is challenging to say the least.
bad,Not a place you want to work. The pay is good. You must be prepared to work all holidays and weekends. You must be prepared to work nights also.  In my opinion they infringe on your privacy by requiring you to present tax returns and debt letters.
bad,"It feels like the company tells you what you want to hear in order to make you feel appreciated and valued but the moment they're able to get rid of you to save money, you're gone. I have heard by so many people that you're not a real person to them, you're just a number. That's truly how it feels. Every person I know that has left this company says they felt free."
bad,"Terrible culture in HR-lots of direction on what should be done, but no leaders exhibit these characteristics. No loyalty to employees who have given MGM their all for decades."
bad,the turn over  rate is too big there is no workplace satisfaction..large level of stress on security to perform or else.. management style very abrasive. not safe for security officers not allow to properly do their job
bad,"The company does not care about it's employees, the managers don't do their jobs. Not much room for advancement. Discounts are hard to come by. Drama within the work place."
bad,"Working in Security you will not be experiencing the luxury atmosphere illusion this place radiates for outsiders. You will be dealing with the dirty underbelly of the beast that includes many fights in which you may be physically injured, as well as dealing with  a whole host of other nasty situations that the general public never sees. And for having to deal with all this plus assist in all support functions of the Casino Gaming floor you will be a non-union, part time employee working over 40 hours in which you will receive NO Benefits and be paid the least of any employees in the place."
bad,This company will not hire anybody over 45 yrs. Was told that the areas are big and it would take me a long time to walk them?
bad,"Great place for the environment. Mangers will hold you back if you are competition to them. Great company but be prepared to work for your success, it is not given."
bad,"Worked there for many years. I started off with job satisfaction, but over the years with changes in department structure and management, the morale went down hill. Department was under staffed for the workload. Went in to work every day feeling beat down. Leaving was the best thing for me."
bad,"It’s a dead end job no career advancement. Would not recommend anybody to work for MGM "
bad,"Promised the world...great disappointment!"
bad,The management is horrible .No one ever knows what is going on  when you ask a question to management they talk in circles and never give you an answer.The one plus is the free dry cleaning you'll always have a clean uniform.
bad,"Management did not get along. Was hurt on the job and told all that was supervising me, they covered it up. Never had a chance ,"
bad,Very hard to  move up unless you know someone. Training is lacking and no one will take responsibility for Employee Dissatisfaction. There is a lot of negativity and not much positivity. Also you are not trained in the Moment if you are not doing something right.
bad,"Managers feel they are above other employees - managers only seem to care about themselves - preach guest service, but don't practice it."
bad,"Os salários de acordo coma actualidade não eram justos."
bad,"It's a good company, but the value of employees has gone down and the feeling of security has been pretty much diminished. I loved my job, the people and team I worked with were amazing. Even with the chaos guests were fun to interact with. But my management did not allow me to grow and continuously berated me and treated me like I was not good enough to be in my position. I did not leave this job because I hated my job, I left because my leadership was not worth staying for. My hope is for any applicant to have hope in this company and your career, may you find a team and a leader who invests in you as you choose to invest in MGMRI."
bad,"Lots of discriminations, no job security, poor training, and lack of cooperation from management when dealing with bullying. Work life balance is somewhat poor and the culture is toxic due to employee bad mouthing."
bad,Management is petty. They play favorites... one person would get fired for doing doing something another person does all the time. They don’t care about a servers income and will changes things on the floor (like section sizes$ on a whim.
bad,"MGM is a strong employer with good salaries. However, middle management is improperly placed and nepotism is the only way to get advancement opportunities.  Additionally, finding jobs outside of MGM is difficult because of the strong salaries."
bad,"House keeping. Six dollars per room cleaned after 90 days at $10 per hour. Supervisors bully you to work fast. I personally did not enjoy this job. Promises were broken everyday and I was allergic to chemicals used, hands blistered. Employee cafeteria was ok."
bad,I was in a position that was not a stressful job but the management and the enviroment made it stressful.  There were any number of people in my department off on medical during my employment.  Management does not concern themselves with the employees or their situations.  They are very disconserting with an expection of (almost) robotic compliance without consideration for the human aspect of an individual.
bad,"Management uses fear and intimidation tactics.  You do what your told or else.   "
bad,its a ok place to work its a job not a career. Managers are not always great. I did not mind the hours or the job. I enjoyed most of the people i had to work with. It was hard stand for 8 to 10 hours a day
bad,This job is very unprofessional they do not treat the employee with respect. this MGM resort need a lot more structure. The job let employee break into lockers you report the people who stealing the guest report who stealing and they do nothing about it
bad,"With over twenty five years of loyal service, The Luxor closed poker room with very little notice. No severance package, no insurance extension. Their job placement was halfhearted, no other property would hire full time positions. They simply wanted you to do the same job without benefits. This left me questioning my continued employment in the industry. "
bad,"Spa director is one of the worst managers I've ever worked for.  Horrible at scheduling, think they own you, start and spread gossip, paycheck misscalculations resulting in employees quitting, unbalanced booking , need I go on??  Oh yeah Dirtiest spa I've ever worked for also and spa director could care less."
bad,"It would have been a lot better environment if everyone wasn't so clickish.  The management was eh at best.  The food totally sucked on grave, I wouldn't feed it to a starving dog."
bad,Dias de trabalho normal sem muitas novidades. Quanto a gerência precisa de uma reciclagem.
bad,"worked graveyard shift from 9pm to 6am  on a normal day. when busy , worked 12 to 15 hours a day then they wanted me to go to training during the day and even took my two days off to go with no compensation for hours worked. would not even change with day stewards even once who went to training on work hours."
bad,Great place to visit but you really wouldn't want to work there unless you are a local. I was a transplant and it didn't work out for me. The locals have the advantage.
bad,This is the true definition of everything negative you hear about a Corp office. Management throws you under the bus. The company as a whole takes care of the executives but no one below that.
bad,"This industry is 24 hours 7 days a week.  Many holidays missed and not having weekends off is a normal schedule at MGM.  There is not much consideration given for personal or individual needs.  They function like a machine with people as robots and if you have human needs or concerns it can go unaddressed for long periods of time or not at all.  "
bad,"The current round of firings and demotions is demoralizing and scary. This will not offer the guests a better experience but will effectively make it worse. All of this to increase the stock value is shameful. I used to think this was a great company to work for. Now I don't think it is. The callousness that people were let go and demoted but told they would have to maintain their current job duties is reprehensible. You hope that your employer, no matter how big, would truly care about you and your well being, but they don't they care about their stock holders and their pockets. It's sad and shameful."
bad,"You clock in, take countless call and they want you to go by a ""script"" You have to say certain things a certain way and if you don't you fail the call. I hate sounding like a robot so I said things the way I wanted to and I handled the call bases on the vibe and how it was going. They only care about numbers and sales sales sales. If you are sick that sucks, oh someone died in your family tough luck. Show up or get fired."
bad,Overworked and underpaid. 12+ hour days and schedule constantly changing. HR will not have your back if there is a conflict with employees. They will work you to death.
bad,"You would think employees would be treated better in a big will known company.  Position was only part-time but you were scheduled right under the 40 that would make you full-time.  Being part-time, you received no benefits & no set schedules - you never knew when you would work until the 2-3 week schedule was posted."
bad,"Exodus happening within IT at MGM.   Half of IT leaders have left in first half of 2018.   Poor culture, tons of technical debt (years of under-investment).  Mgmt has no idea how to fix it."
bad,The casino industry is extremely stressful requiring intensity. MGM I did not feel like looked after the well being of their employees when it came to the work place environment.
bad,"Little Pay To Low Pay Despite Competitive Market"
bad,"Well guests were rude, management was not very good, job continually changing every 6 months. Schedules became worse, remodels were always getting pushed back. When I was hired it was a simple job and by the time I quit the job was very complicated. I got the same pay for simple as I did for complicated."
bad,"It's as if they want to develop a culture of dignity and respect, but there isn't a week that goes by without someone getting screamed at. Management is squeezed on both ends and everyone is working too many hours, which you kind of sign up for, but in exchange for some respect, right?"
bad,"Production of transcription and high level customer service.  Regimented schedule, customer first, multiple database Knowledge, fast pace environment."
bad,"Nao gostei do produto de vendas"
bad,"Work was hard depending on what area you are in, and if you have kids, the schedule can take a toll on family life. The compensation and benefits are great"
bad,"I've been on the extra board for seven years.  I have not been able to transfer to other departments for full-time work or advance my career with the amazing programs they offer, like Aspire or tuition reimbursement, because I am not a full-time employee.  MGM has awesome benefits for full-time employees."
bad,Management was extremely bad-not good for seniors that are not pets
bad,"I've never worked for a company that belittled their employees as much as  the MGM property that I worked at. The managers were never on your side and never cared about what you had to say. Pay was good but not in the summer. Hired on as part time, was doing 40-45 hours a week because everyone kept quitting. Never had time for myself. The place was a really great place with amazing co workers. Management was just highly  unqualified and treated us poorly in my opinion."
bad,"Even thought there is a sense of community in that casino industry, in my particular office, there is nearly none. It is a difficult environment to be an individual and even harder to advance past the entry-level position, many times due to management."
bad,"in 2019, there were massive layoffs, major restructure, many demotions across all levels, salary cuts.  Many people who were with the company for over 10 years were replaced with new hires."
bad,Where it's good pay and good benefits it's hard work and management lousy play favorites and they're always trying to suspend you the point system will trip you up in a matter of seconds
bad,It’s a great company just part time employees hours may vary. Benefits for full time seem to be good but a lot of changes have occurred since this year came around. The changes are honestly not the best for employees who would want to grow within the company.
bad,"Lower management was usually ok but mid to upper sucks. They love to do things that don't make sense and would likely be the opposite of whatever you would think is best for you to do your job and with out consulting anybody. Managers will get scared of good employees and hold you back in fear of their own jobs. They expect you to do a job but wont let you have the tools you need to do it. And lastly don't have something happen where you get hurt  need surgery and some time to get better, even if on a preapproved medical leave they will fire you leaving you and your family screwed like me."
bad,"Great company if you have no self drive or content with the staus quo. Management is a joke unless you are buddies and text each other or ""walk after work"" otherwise you will be ostracized. No development. No guidance. No communication. Garbage management. Point blank."
bad,"It was fun, but management was NEVER on the same page. Which made my time there SUCK. There was no opportunity for advancement, not even for people who had been there before most of the managers, at least for the fountain workers trying to get their foot in the door to move up."
bad,"Many things are seniority driven, most management are very uneducated or prepared to handle their responsibility.  Most positions determined by being the right place at the right time and not who would best perform the job."
bad,"everyday is busy, with little to no help, management turns a blind eye, if you can learn here do so and move on to a new job as fast as you can. It is very rare to get a promotion here."
bad,"They have a foundation that they want employee to put money into to help people and other employee but when their worker need help they do not give it . Have problem getting your vacation have a point system that get people fired other place in have 14 point they give Detroit 10 point for Detroit just a unpleasant place to work ,but you need money .  The food was good at the old building i don't what they feeding the employee now . Food is not fresh need to be investigation but they would pay them off like they always do everything else..."
bad,"Horribly ran. High turn over. No care for employees or their personal lives. No reward for good work or maximum effort"
bad,"empresa onde os funcionariops nao sao reconhecidos pela gestao atual , onde funcionario raramente tem a oportunidade de crescer profissionalmente"
bad,"Lots of tasks to complete, fast paced."
bad,"Nearly every employee is difficult to work with.  When trying to optimize the guest experience, fellow employees are constantly reluctant to help accomplish the task.  MGM would do good to refresh the employee pool."
bad,"I was working two jobs at one point. One first for A gaming company and in office services so i could make an honest living. The management forced me into a corner and forced to choose between my other job and my job at the Bellagio. I reported them to human resources for unfair treatment and unfairness when trying to make a living for myself. Having both jobs were great, i was able to afford a new car, a new place to live, and help my grandmother with her expenses. But putting me in a corner like that and instead off offering me a full time position at the company they wanted me to quit my other job and stay on part time at the bellagio. I laughed in their face and asked if they were joking. They told me no. Well after i reported them to human resources who did absolutely nothing, i ended up leaving and working at the other part time job who valued me more and after 9 months gave me a full-time position. about 75% of the people who work there are bitter because of how they are treated, and everyone seems to not want to take any blame for something they did wrong."
bad,I worked liked a dog for 13 years and seldom had a (Thank you.)
bad,"Only worked there one week,hrad to tell.did not like job.That is it"
bad,"My job started out in our rewards program but after about half a year, it closed down and merged into our cage cashier department along with our credit department. So count that. Three separate job titles all rolled up into one for barely any pay increase. Work and responsibilities are unfair for the pay and things are constantly breaking down and people are constantly leaving. Customers are the worse as well to the point where you can even get sick or be verbally abused by them. Admittedly their benefits and insurance are fantastic and we get free ice cream (when the machine actually works) but its not nearly enough to feel equal to the day to day slog."
bad,Hard work and dedication is not rewarded. The only benefit I received from this company is that it is a good name to have on a future resume. You can show up to work every single day and never call out but you’ll never be rewarded or compensated for the dedication.
bad,On your feet for the entire shift. The work is fairly easy. Most employees get to move around the casino as they work. Sometimes employees are able to be in the middle of the casino action. It makes the time go by faster.
bad,"While mostly a solid company to work for, I would not suggest working as a security officer for the MGM. While labeled as part time, I was still working full time hours and not being paid the same amount as the listed full time employees."
bad,"Abuse by upper management. Many people not hired based on their experience or ability but because of who they know, and they are given high level positions without the ability to do the job. Not all departments offer the opportunity to advance because of the departmental structure. Management can tend to be cutthroat and negative about other departments; Exec Directors should not berate other departments or company programs to employees; it leads to bad work environment. No clear path to resolve this.The company overall has great things in place, but top brass miss the actual goings on."
bad,"- Manage activity of personal and commercial policy including file audits, file logs and handling policies"
bad,"Management does not care about your opinions or input they put the guest first and will side with them.  They want money, money, money."
bad,A typical days consists of sitting at a desk with documents waiting to validated and data entry entered into the system.
bad,managment can get better a lot better. i have worked hear for a year and have been talked up everyday to other managers and promised more but never have had a chance to prove i can do it.
bad,"no job security, its a new place and the are trying to iron out the kinks looking for a position where I can advance and better provide for my family."
bad,"Most management didn't give a hoot about there job, didn't come down hard enough on employees. Lots of people that work there don't do there jobs."
bad,"In the last 6 year notting is getting better, is going from better to worst. Staring with the Director of Banquet, is not focus on The Banquet Deparmet, is every where in the hotel, but not in banquets, the Captain non of then have a comen sense of anythink, one is a fat guy how always is setting in from of the computer taking care of his own business not thing to do with banquet, he don't have any idea of banquets, be he is been protected by The Director of Banquet, no one care about any one in the banquet department except for the kiss @# waiter. That the new generation of management are distroing  the good reputation of one of the best casinos in Las Vegas...."
bad,loved the actual people i worked with but the hours were horrible and not having benefits really sucked
bad,"I used to like my job, but management is terrible. While the cashiers work their little hearts out, the managers sit in the back office and watch netflix. Pay is okay, but sometimes I wish I'd get paid when I do my supervisors job."
bad,You could be an on call employee for over two years before reaching full time. There are many changes going on with MGM and most of the management won't have your back with a guest issue.
bad,"MGM Resorts International is a tough company.  They are very strict as they are Corporate, they don't care about their employees. The management team doesn't care about you, instead of helping you they tell you to go to the SOP."
bad,"The benefits and the pay were really great. However, the work environment was very unprofessional. Management is unprofessional. Management never knew how to properly handle disputes. They would gossip about their employers just as much as the co-workers would, not only that but they would talk to workers on your same levels as much as they would each other. They never acknowledged their great workers but would nitpick over small errors. My advice to anyone looking to get into the casino industry is: DO NOT BEFRIEND ANYONE. They've all been there for a long time so they're pretty much care free. GOOD LUCK!!"
bad,"as the groups started to form, there are some groups that could get more staff, and others that have too much required in that group."
bad,"•	Supplying and cleaning bathrooms"
bad,"clinical research Associate"
bad,"Management was unfair."
bad,"MGM Resorts has no care about their line employees, be it family, schedules, and or health. They don't take pride in their properties and reinvest when it is clearly necessary in their product. The most important concern to the company is the bottom line return. In an attempt to increase their return they choose to purchase as many inconsequential businesses when the correct path would be to take pride and better preserve their original investment properties."
bad,Due to productivity caused for me to look for another job. The managers and staff worked well together. The money factor needed more to support cost of living.
bad,"The reorganization of the company was used to let go of leaders they felt needed improvement but would not want to invest the time in those. Shocker. We had high expectations and standards from this company and always kept the best interest of the business in mind but when this was done, it changed the perspective of many. Great benefits though!"
bad,I worked at the corporate office.  The overall MGM Resorts is a great company but the management at the corporate office is sorely lacking.   Uncooperative supervisors who provide inadequate training and hostile environment and gets mad when you asked questions and/or guidance.  Lots of favoritism.
bad,"This job had no job security, and the employees were always overworked.  Pay was very good as a beginner in the industry though, just no respect from managers"
bad,There is always a lot of turnover at hotels and that is definitely the case here. No one stays very long because they do not treat you fairly and watch every move you make.
bad,La distance de mon lieu de travail et trop éloigné de mon domicile.
bad,Extremely silo-ed organization with little to no appetite for change.  Great assets with tremendous untapped potential on both the operations and development fronts.
bad,"This review is directed only toward how MGM took over nightclub venue and totally dropped the ball. All any worker heard about was too many hours, profit/loss statements, and employees never supplied with correct materials including running out of the most basic of supplies. The managers not only weren't familiar with subordinate's duties but would also ask subordinate's how to manage. I do not believe the entire company is like this but what a disappointment when you NEED something NOW and have to cut through 30 layers of red tape to even get the ball rolling meanwhile they have already altered your clock-in times so if everything ran perfectly your're running like mad to be done by opening of club that your transition from opening side work to opening of venue feels rushed, uneasy, and no matter how adamant you are about getting bar reset after shift to avoid another disaster like day before the cycle repeats itself with most product 86'd."
bad,My typical day at work consist of my house keeping duties. The managers gave great assistance and I got along with all my co-workers
bad,Very favoritism company while I’m working in the restaurant. Not really get used to enjoy it. Stressful job. I rather get other job like local restaurant is better.
bad,"The job is what you make of it & I would always show up with a working attitude. Although it’s hard to ignore that your bosses hit on underage employees, & everyone clocks in like if it was the bell for high school. Very unprofessional mindsets in this job but just focus on making the guest happy & it evens out."
good,"Of course there are different departments with different managers, but overall the carelessness towards the employees is evident. Doctors notes mean nothing, nor can you be approved for an FMLA if you havent been there for over a year. So god forbid you get pregnant, or have a family death/ emergency you have to tend to because you will not be excused . The management is horrible."
good,"-3secbreak btwn "
good,"MGM is very concerned with their employees always being able to work for them.   for most positions they have 3 shifts and it is done via seniority so if you join late and the rest of the team/unit have been there you fall into the Grave shift staff automatically.  "
good,"My job was not hard at all i have had experience lifeguarding with another company, it was hard to balance my life and work at the same time since it was so hard to find others to take my shift. You needed to find someone who didnt work more than 5 days a week ! But mostly EVERYONE did, no one wanted to take it or already worked that day, vacation days got denied EASILY ! All supervisors and team DO NOT POST SHIFT ALL TOGETHER ! This company cares for customer service more than their workers. Our break room was cluttered small and a mess no where NEAR decent !!! We did not have any ac, busted lockers, dirty and ripped furniture, furniture for concerts and lost floaters would be placed there."
good,MGM International Resorts is a company that does not value it's employees.  After 20 years they just let me go because of someone's family member wanted my job.  They also make it political and try to sway your opintions.
good,"Its almost as a trap once you work here. They over work you doubling your job duties with no help. The managers as well as supervisors show little respect to us workers, we get treated as children."
good,"o dia muito produtivo,aprendi muito com pessoal de area de produção,muito bem a convivencia com os colegas, a parte mais dificil era querer aprender mais e não ter exito quanto aos gerente de querer abraçar outras area, a parte mais agradavel foi o apredisagem sobre o que a empresa faz na area de exquadrias, muito interesante a produção."
good,bad management bad hours no time off no say so..customer reaction is bad favortism too many change of command cant change your shift no pay raises no pay
good,Could be a nice place to work but their point system was so unfair; it was like being in prison; everything you did u got 1/2 or 1 point and/or a verbal warning; this made your day very unpleasant; Management has very bad attitudes
good,"Lots of favoritism towards employees who had worked there longer from Managers;"
good,"You can work at MGM, but you can't have a life there, or earn enough to keep a two bedroom apartment. All that glamour for nothing. Probation is 6 months and you don't get 100% of your salary until after probation period. Good luck surviving on $400 a week"
good,"Very Hostile , Very Competitive.   Too many cliques.  Very shady behavior. Human Resources is ok, not very helpful. Huge turnovers and lack no job security."
good,The think it is easy to get into a entry level role at MGM resorts international. But as for advancement within my career I have found to be difficult
good,Very upbeat fast pace work environment... Fun place to work but depending on department you work you have to watch your back with other employees had several issues of others stealing top money from tables
good,"So glad I left. Over worked, under paid. This doesn't even begin to describe it."
good,"This company has the potential to be a great company to work for, but it is filled with the worst kind of office politics. The work is very manual and"
good,"From the time you clock in to the time you clock out its a stressful environment created by the management. You are expected to perform your duties at 100% but only with 50% resources available. "
good,"mani focus was upholding standards to the menu,no changes to be made,scheduling and employee management mostly."
good,"Executive management plays favorites with their friends, and this practice is very pronounced. This type of action makes it very difficult to progress. They also play the diversity game. They don't take the best candidate. They take their friends mixed in with the specific diversity criteria they need to fill to make their quota. This act keeps them diversity champions. But its not the best candidate for the job."
good,"Overall I love the idea of Mgm Grand Detroit and the many different features it has to enjoy. However management is horrible. Being an ex employee of housekeeping, I must say the way they handle situations were awful. I left Mgm for that reason. They showed little to no appreciation for the people who worked extremely hard while management ate snacks and laughed everyday in the office. Our linen closets were never full for us to do our jobs and I always felt highly disrespected when asked about issues that were never fixed."
good,There's a lot of pressure for perfection. And higher ups make us and treat us like dirt and not family. They're only concern about their wallets and not the people who feed their wallets. Modern day slavery.
good,Was a great place not sure now. A lot of changes and insecurity about jobs. No work/home balance at one time they had a good balance. We set up all kinds of events on/off properties.
good,This job offers plenty of hours and i would recommend to some one who doesn't have many responsibility because this job even tho its fun and a great learning experience it will consume all your free time
good,Management training needs to be improved to ensure a successful transition and adoption of the true culture. Starting off as a team member and then growing with the call center is the best route to go in.
good,A typical day at MGM Grand was okay. You meet new people everyday and you learn something new everyday. Management at The Signature at MGM Grand was awesome. The hardest part of the job was trying to get the tables from the towers back down to the kitchen. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the different cultured people from around the world that were guests. Coworkers treated  you as a new person and when they open up to you they were good people. I hated working on-call. I never got hours.
good,"This is a place of employment that I would not recommend as forever.  Perhaps if you just want to get into the hospitality field and have something that gives you a work history with the industry.. I say go for it.  Just be very wary of the politics.. and yes we all know their is always politics in the workplace but this company takes it to extreme where people are not appreciated and overlooked if you don't know someone that is of importance or if you do a great job but management just doesn't have a liking to you for reasons that has nothing to do with your work ethic.  However with everything, you never know until you try even once.  Just be cognitive of issues that can or will arise and really determine for yourself if you can find happiness in a workplace that does not care to turn your frown upside down.  I understand doing that for yourself but if you were happy and then you enter the workplace and it turns into a frown, then perhaps their is something wrong.  Just a word of caution."
good,"Accounting requires long hours and working weekends. Cannot schedule time off around month-end process, which is at least 2-3 weeks per month. Workload is a bit unreasonable."
good,"Always an evolving culture, plenty of room for growth and pretty secure once you pass probation. Management is not always willing to listen to line level employees."
good,"Overall, you just need to know how to play office politics. If you don't play the game, you are targeted. I spent years trying to ignore the obvious, thinking I could be the one to make a difference by working my way up from the bottom. But it doesn't matter how hard you work or how long you work for them. From my own personal experience and witnessing others experiencing the same, I have found that management (across multiple divisions) has been crooked. They don't promote or hire based on skill, experience, or education. It's all about who you know. "
good,"Front desk has nearly 150 agents. There are around 5000 rooms. 24 hour operation, 365 days per year. Can be especially busy during fight weekend.Not many 24 hour food options."
good,"Very limited chance of advancement,  management don't care about you,  only raise is a 2.5% cost of living increase ,and no holiday pay.  Oh but we do get 14 days to call in sick,  and 3 weeks vacation pay.  Oh yeah no training,  they just throw you on the floor,  then write you up when you make a mistake."
good,"Corporate has many dedicated employees who work together well. "
good,Worked for corporate.  Too much politics.  Free lunches.  Employee perks.
good,Wish I could have some holidays to spend with family but not possible.. you must work every holiday if you part time and if you ask for atleast one holiday off it will not be granted
good,"No one in Management is on the same page. Its ridiculous really, just like High School. Other than that I love my job, the fast pace environment is great but they do have slow days also."
good,"My Housekeeping leaders were always transparent, clear and supportive.  They listened and were willing to try new ideas.  During the great layoffs of MGM 2020, they were genuinely concerned for everyone, and for those who were laid off - they were caring and professional."
good,"MGM pays well, but they'll work you to death and not think twice about it. Most people never get the tools they need to do their jobs, lots of burnout within the company. MGM 2020 initiative made it worse."
good,I personally feel that MGM has a bunch of room for improvement when it comes to giving their employees proper respect and dignity. Although the pay can be very high the atmosphere gets quite toxic and in my particular dealings very non disciplined. The slightest amount of appreciation would of gone a long way.
good,"Not what they make it out to seem, benefits are good but thats about it. dont expect anything from hr or management until you've harassed them for months"
good,"Guests are the ones who make the job stressful. They talk to you like you are a child or as if you are worth less than. Must have thick skin or stern attitude. The pay is high 18+ but you'll be oncall forever! Because they dont want to give you benefits. Even if people get fired, they dont move oncalls to fulltime they just eliminate the position. The hours are horrible some times 6-40 hours a week...mostly 6-24 a week now because people aren't traveling alot anymore. The atmosphere at the front is fun, everyone is friendly. Some managers need extra job training. But the most annoying thing are all the rules and how often they change. It's very easy to get written up for simple things..making it very easy to get fired over something as simple as accidentally dropping you tip in your bank."
good,You can gain a lot of experience working for this company.  You are exposed to a multitude of talented and smart people from various and diverse backgrounds.  It was an experience I will never forget and I am better for it.
good,"The corporate entertainment division presently lacks consistent leadership and direction, which can make it a challenging environment to thrive in long-term."
good,A typical day at work is come in and set the room for current shift. We daily learn news ways on how to satisfy the guest. The most enjoyable part of job to me is guest satisfaction.
good,Although the management at least in my opinion is very lacking it is a great start. If you can get your foot in the door the shy os the limit afterwords. Just don't expect anything spectacular and you'll enjoy being here.
good,"Management is helpful but no job security"
good,"Was a steady extra, had to pay dues, never knew if you were going to work, never done a job like that before"
good,"I worked in the General Accounting area of MGM Resorts. I really enjoyed my work, the people who worked under me, and some of my coworkers. Towards the end of my experience, it became more of a political job. The more you worked, the more worked piled up. The more you adapted, the less you had to worry. Overall, it was one if the best accounting experiences I ever had, but it also made me HATE corporate America. HR was friends with upper management, people had access to compensation information that should not have, and worked NEVER ended. "
good,"I had alot of management skills and experience to offer the team, but upper management which was the director and his store managers had a click of people they liked working only with. It was sad to see this day in and day out. It was clock work, to see the groupees(these managers) walk together like they had nothing to do on the sales floor and go out to smoke 4 times a day. These groupees would have fun by trashing each others offices and one day they trashed our floor office. I told my manager that I wasn't happy seeing this behavior in our team and I wasn't going to clean that office and he had to clean it up. I realized how weak the management team was. I just worked with the staff and stayed focus on my work and then one day they're was a huge lay off and I was apart of it. The fire on top of Monte Carlo Hotel made it worse for our stability to stay in MGM as new employees."
good,"MGM did a lot for with community service, I really enjoy working to help the community. It's department was management top heavy with too many personalities to handle. Decisions would change constantly each month which resulted in instability and low morale. Fixed Assets was a revolving door with employees."
good,A decent place to work If you not looking to make a lot of money.... My boss was never around so as long as I did my job there was never an issue. Not much room for advancement unless you're a favorite.
good,The Company has many programs on paper but they never seem to be executed at the location level. Leadership has a hard time walking their talk. Training is non existent at all levels.
good,the insurance was great compared to where i work now. The workload was a lot but we had a great team. hardest part was that policies always changed. It wasnt to bad.
good,"They expect you to make MGM your highest or only priority.  Your personal life is non-existent.  They are a machine that only cares about what you can do for them, not what you contribute to the big picture.  On the surface they tell you it is all about the people, but when it comes down to it, it is all about the bottom line and what the optics are."
good,"Unfortunately, I was part of the MGM 2020 reorganization and was laid off.  I had apprehension about working for the company, because it had a bad reputation.  Now I can see why."
good,"I enjoyed helping others and making their dreams come true. I learned how to be resourceful, patient and a team player. The hardest part of my job was not getting paid enough. I loved my managers, but their ambitions and responsibilities were not balanced."
good,"No accountability, no training but expect you to know what you are doing. Leadership is easy to put blame on others. Higher Management does not know what is going on and does not care about the people that work for them. "
good,"IT is filled with people who have an entitlement mentality.  Almost everyone outside of management are great to work with and are great people, some in management as well."
good,I feel that there was not an opportunity to advance in the job position that I applied for and was on a on-call position. MGM Resorts International should offer more full-time and at least more part-time positions.
good,Besides the unstable hours and changes of mgrs every couple years. Mgm resorts is a great company to work for. Many great benefits. I hope to get back in the industry
good,"More concerned with quantity than quality. Inconsistent supervision, favoritism and noisy work area. Training is provided by co-workers with minimal policy exposure before given responsibility to do the job."
good,This company uses scare tactics to increase productivity and it drives down the moral. Nepotism and overtly favoritism is a common practice in promotions within the company.
good,MGM Resorts International is a company built on entertainment and conventions. A regular workday does not exist in a company that is ever changing and growing. The level of excitement is through the roof.
good,"I was new with no union pull, I knew it going in. My schedule was not set, I could only work when it was possible. I was told I would have the entire month of December off, I got some shifts but that is how it goes, you have to put in the time, some people had over 10 years invested and still had no set schedule, you have to be patient and flexible"
good,An amazing collection of resorts and venues offering world class experiences to guests.  Growing organization creates many opportunities for career advancement.  Relationships are still the key to long term success.
good,"i would walk in to something new and different everyday. sometimes it was a good thing sometimes it wasn't. we had a saying at strip steak, its strip steak and anything can happen at any given time."
good,If you have a personality keep it hidden. This is a very clique oriented company and if you don't fit the mold watch your back.
good,"Officina meccanica con macchine sia a controllo numerico che meccaniche."
good,"The job itself was very easy "
good,"Culture cliquish trained by fellow team member some gaps in the training some clerks performed tasks differently then later discovered the task was done in correctly.  Had to be retrained.  Communication was challenging things were not streamlined.  Management was fair however when management would vacation over 3 or 4 weeks, day to day operations would suffer. The Team Leadership often made  matters personal not very professional.  But the graveyard Team Lead was awesome. The hardest part of the job was communicating with floor bosses (markers), specifically things were done outside of the clerks job description as a plus and management presumed that you were not performing but the fact of the matter was that was the pit boss responsibility and the clerk was not authorized.  I enjoyed meeting new people and taking care of customers."
good,"Very productive place to work "
good,A good place to work. you can gain experience there. I worked there for two years. Advancement was not possible Pay increase was also not possible. I did like t people i worked with.
good,"Typical day was confusing because you always had someone stand right over you watching  your every move and you work all different shifts. I learn how to sweep floors and clean bathroom, and set up for concerts. Management was very firm. workplace culture was okay.  The hardest part of the job was trying to do your work and some watching you all the time the most fun was at lunch time."
good,"Once you're settled in, that's when they throw everything at you at once. You're expected to sink or swim and with the training and equipment you're provided with, it's near impossible. Bless all the sweet employees who truly know because they have been through it too and I wouldn't have lasted without their advice."
good,"Great working environment, but feel underutilized and taken advantage of. Supervisors are great but lack knowledge in autocad. Job is easy for anyone who knows basics to cad."
good,"it 24 hours.  its fun its hard.  many cultures.  fun people,  the turn a round is a lot.  the hours change management change sometimes good workers are passed over for promotions and given to wrong people."
good,"Preshift before work. Gave out supplies to employees, supervised employees on their work and offer advice on how to do the job. Learned how to deal with customers and employees. My manager was very helpful. I started as a cleaner then as lead and then as supervisor. Since we worked outside the weather was the hardest thing to deal with. Most enjoyable was the people I worked with. Helping the guests was with their problems was fulfilling. Rewarding our employees for their good work, such as doing bar-b-ques, potluck at work. plus telling them they are doing a good job."
good,MGM culture is great.  Hardest part of the job is some of the long time toxic employees. Makes it hard for the new managers. They want to see me fail.
good,"Graveyard was the hardest shift and the agents should get more support. The new on call status is horrible and unfair to the agents, i suggest putting it back to how it was or doing the schedules at least two weeks in advance instead of only a few days or they day of."
good,"Horrible training, Management doesn't take their position seriously. The turn over rate is outrageous. managers really needs to train on customer service"
good,"I am grateful that during my 7+ years in Casino Marketing taught me a lot of beneficial new skills. My customer service skills have improved as well. I also appreciate my 5 years experience work at a VIP Diamond check in agent for Bally's. I have met a lot of great people who I am still good friends with. The one thing I did not like about working for MGM was they do not like to promote from within. And I felt like there was a lot of favoritism, which wasn't right if you were a hard worker and devoted to your position."
good,"Supervisors displayed lack of caring for new employees. However, MGM is a great company, but need to better monitor supervisors. Would work for MGM again if given the chance, just not for NY NY."
good,"There are agents that slack off during thier shift and at  high peak times.  All Agents  get same rate of pay, there are others that do not do thier sahre of work.  Managers knows who these agents are and will not do anything about it.  This does lead to an unfair balance of work and brings down morale to the team.  There are also seems to an outbreak of favoritism."
good,"The Excalibur Hotel has almost 4000 rooms, and on a typical summer day, you will be faced with about 1500 reservations checking in. Even though check-in time is listed as 3pm, you will have a line in front of you by 8am every single day. It does not stop until about 3am. They are implementing online check-in, but the process at the Excalibur is not as streamlined as at other resorts, and guests still need to have face-to-face contact with an agent for things like special room requests, parking and additional guests. The error tolerance for agents is relatively high, and management does try to spend a few minutes each month with each front desk employee - but it's mostly to encourage you to collect more phone numbers, e-mail addresses, to sell more upgrades and amenities, and to sign people up for the gaming club (MLife). You are expected to collect a lot of information from guests in a short amount of time - along with explaining the resort fees, parking and basic hotel amenities and policies. Very little is available for entertainment or assistance for guests after midnight so if you work graveyard, you have more variety of things to do other than just run the check-in mill. The hotel and property are not aging well and the renovations performed are merely cosmetic, and their current budgeting initiative means broken things stay broken."
good,"The organization is working on its culture. Many leaders are developing their basic leadership skills. Performance management just started a few years ago. It has yet to be totally embraced. If you find a leader that can coach and develop you, it would be much more enriching."
good,"As a corporate employee who worked across all the properties I was able to see the cultures of each property up close. Some were better than others. The poor ones (most) seemed to suffer from poor leadership. In fact, there is a definite divide between managers and front-line employees. As a manager, the mandatory manager training reinforced that culture with statements like ""FMLA is the Friday, Monday Leave Act."" and ""Constantly watch out for employees who take advantage."" "
good,"Normal day is that we get very busy as I'm by myself for two properties. "
good,"It is enjoyable working with the guests at this high end resort and health benefits are commendable."
good,"Great assets in terms of entertainment, dining, nightlife, rooms and experiences. Solid venues to support sound customer experiences on properties. Long hours to support the role in the partnership marketing."
good,"I enjoyed the atmosphere, but the smoke and working hours are not good for people with families."
good,"Excelente empresa tanto a nivel laboral como economico."
good,"typical day was monotonous, large menu but usually got to play around with ideas. hard to schedule anything at home due to being on call, the pay was good and benefits are best in town,however waiting for a fulltime shift to open could be years or tomorrow,thats union for you"
good,This is a very busy restaurant which requires a lot of time management. I enjoyed the customers the most because they were mostly regulars and very friendly. I loved keeping busy though all while staying happy.
good,"For me it was very challenging, some days more than others. Communications between co-workers and/or management staff would sometimes be misunderstood."
good,"Working at the MGM has many benefits,which is always amazing but not having a team that actually cares about you as a person can become stressful. You have to be strong and a team player to get ahead! What "
good,"If you are looking to move up anywhere in the food and beverage here just warning management plays favorites and rewards ""lazy workers"". if your not  ""one of their boys"" then you aren't important to them"
good,"Union job"
good,Its hard to move from part time to full time. And if you want to transfer to a full time site its hard to do that too even if you have been with the company for the required 6 months
good,"Good benefits, decent pay, hard to move up, panel interview worthless. Recent layoffs process /protocols was cruel and  disrespectful to those that worked hard and gave all for so many years."
good,Little chance for skilled employees to advance.  Steady revolving door.  Low pay and management heavy.  Work holidays and weekends at times for some job titles.
good,"MGM is a entertainment company in a significant growth mode.  Management is moving in the right direction, consolidating major areas, specifically accounting/finance, in areas of collaborative centers of excellence."
good,"MGM Resorts continues to expand its assets by adding new properties, but does not add the resources to keep up with the expansion. The current employees are given more work from the new assets, but are not getting any new compensation or more resources. This causes longer hours for salary employees and no balance between life and work."
good,"a typical day at work involved constant searching for a dirty table and checking machines for it to be restocked.sometimes with help and most times not. I learned how to work with machines and use expensive equipment to clean dishes. the management is terrible because the managers are never to be found when you need them to be. The hardest part of the job is staying up when working overnight and finding things to do after having everything done. The most enjoyable part of the job is the free beverages and ice cream if the machine ever works. the other enjoyable part is the cheap food served buffet style, pay by the ounce. the average price is 3-6 dollars."
good,The company is constantly rolling out contests and activities to keep employees engaged and the workday fun.  Employees have free parking and free uniforms.
good,working for MGM is a fun and exciting experience. You get to meet customers from all over the world. MGM allows growth with the company and the mangers are quite nice.
good,"The people you work with most of the time are cool, but management not so much. They treat you as a number and breathe down your neck while your working. The attendance policy is a joke. If your a supervisor or up, it doesn't apply. Excellent guest service is hard to find and teamwork is hard to find as well."
good,very nice place to work when focus on trying to reach a goal. It's a joy to go to work being around fun loving co-workers. Mnangement can be a challenge depending on who you working with. The culture and invirment was great and wonderful. the hardest part is working with someone with no diretion. The most enjoyable part is working with someone who has a direction.
good,"This was a fair place to work.  Repetetive in job responsibility, the hiring process is a bit long.  Very nice people you will meet while working there and the employees where easy to get along with.  The management team could have had better attitudes with employees which could have improved moral on the floor."
good,"I left MGM for many reasons, the top reason being that they simply do not care about their seasoned staff. If you've been there a while, they look at you as if you are a problem and a waste of space (since you can accrue 4 weeks vacation in 7 years of work there). "
good,"Its a really good company, but everything will depend on which property and which department you end up. The culture is not company-wide, it is more segmented than that. I loved the first two departments I worked at, but promotions led me to a third department which had a very counterproductive culture as evidenced by the change in leadership."
good,The company is average to work for. Definitely care about profits more than employees but that is expected. There was 2 good things about the company that stood over everything else. Decent benefits and large company size that gives you for internal company movement opportunities.
good,You can be let go for any reason within the first 90 days of employment.  I showed up for my scheduled shift and was let go for no reason.  The hotel hires and fires people randomly it seems.
good,Anything not having to do with maintenance of systems is outsourced to a third party and no actual engineering or development is done.  It was not enjoyable having to work from 9 to 9 several times.
good,"Nice place to work at if you don't intend on moving up and just making money during the pool season. The manager does not recognize hard work and will not help you move up positions. Manager was biased towards certain people and only helped the ones she personally favored. Typical day was greeting guests, folding towels, assisting guests in finding seats, keeping the pool clean and moving bins around. The hardest part of the job are the customers since they can either be the friendliest or the most rude customers. I learned how to deal with different situations in a calm and thoughtful manner. The most enjoyable part were my coworkers. Everyone seemed to get along together once the icebreakers were done."
good,Job was stressful.  Fast Paced.  Worked closely with Oracle for critical application upgrades. Learned to hone database tuning skills for critical 3rd party hotel booking app. Management was supportive.
good,"Large corporation with more emphasis on the bottom line than quality of product or employee satisfaction. They do offer fair compensation,  a benefit program, and 401k."
good,"MGM was a decent place to work for. The work was not hard at all, just tedious. If there was any kind of issue where a manager needed to step in, there were never any available. The work hours were long and overtime was mandatory. "
good,You could create a report but have to go through six people to get it approved.  Then depending who you take to could take a long time to complete.
good,"A typical day at MGM can be very challenging each day brings a differant set of challenges,so you wear many differant hats."
good,"Creating great retail product daily"
good,You have your bad days and you have your good days working at the luxor I learned that it is more then just cashing people out its meeting everyone in the world and make them feel welcome when ever they stay at our hotel. My co workers are fun to work with when we all work together but like I said we have our days but we all love each other. I cant really say the hardest part of my job because Im always up for the challenge and I succeed eveytime they teach me something new. The most enjoyable part of my job is when are managers treat us like adults because they know we will get the job done no matter what happens.
good,"Always busy, never boring. Middle Management works as hard as you do. Upper Management is the problem. They do not listen to changes needed to be made in order to improve things at hotel as only bottom line is considered. It is a Union Position so you are protected in the job. Unfortunately, the bad seeds are protected as well."
good,"Insurance and Benefits are great,plus a free meal everyday.  Meeting people from all over the world is a great opportunity.  management changes often, that takes a little getting used to. There are not many jobs with the security  we have a MGM, for that I am thankful."
good,This company provoid accomodation and service charge . But salary is low
good,There is no typical day of being a nurse! In all its very rewarding
good,"-I learned to work as a team"
good,"I have had wonderful oppurtunities here. I would recommend getting a promotion and moving to a compnay that cares more about the people and the moral. You can only move up so far at this company then you hit the glass ceiling fast. Lots of older employees in the same positions. You will not move up unless you make friends with the ones in higher positions. My best advice if you want to move up: Agree with everything rather right or wrong. Even if you do not agree, fake it. If you want to succeed in this enviroment, proving the right way is not the way to go. Going with the motions and playing ""the ROLE"" is the way to go."
good,Focus on the company and individual experience while Staff
good,"I have worked here for a while and the longer I worked there I came to the conclusion that its a ok job and pays prettt well but they do not care about u or value how hard you work as a employee. You are always written up for the most petty non-since all the time, you are never wrote up for job performance."
good,"A day at luxor is a mixture of culture, insightful people, hard working individuals. I learned a lot in the field I worked in while there. Dealing with high volume of people, organization, speaking to people in ways they would prefer, responding to issues and dealing with guest that are ill and need medical attention. i performed actual cpr on two guest while being there."
good,"Good place to work, but not much room for advancement. Nothing bad to say about the company, but i do believe management needs more training on how to communicate with employees. I enjoy my work because i am good at it and i have been through good training. but i would like to advance and become the manager or vice president of a security firm."
good,Lots of stress...plenty of angry gamblers...need to find something that gives me weekends and holidays off with a normal work day (i.e. 9-5)
good,Eye Care medical plastic surgery etc ! Working for the company has been a great experience. I have worked there for 17 years I love what I do as a valet Cashier yes we can have more diversity in the company. Overall the company has brought me to learn how to provide good customer service.
good,Work with many people all who help each other out cause if there is no team work its hard to make the property run well and ensure the satisfactions of the guest or the residence.
good,It’s a good place to start and grow your career.you will so many new people and learn what it mean to be somewhere that can help you grow an a future career.
good,"Give food to customers, clean tables, bring things to storage. You learn how to be in the food business. The hardest part of the job is probably learning where everything is"
good,At the end of the day casinos do not pay as much for back of the house as non gaming companies. I left to work less hours and make more money. If I had been paid more I would have stayed.
good,Very heavy into office politics. Favoritism in management was common and is key to promotions and opportunities. Overall a very satisfying experience.
good,Good company to work for. I’ve always had good relationships with my supervisors and co workers only property in the area that still serve free hot meals to its employees
good,"I enjoy working for the company. It's a very relaxed environment and they employ a wonderful, talented staff of very diverse and well-rounded people from all over the world."
good,"Moderate wages, Good work life environment. Good benefits. Need better compensation for work completed. Would recommend. Lunch is provided for all employees"
good,"I worked at the MGM as a pool receptionist. I made $12/hr which is fairly low considering how well established the MGM Grand is. As a receptionist we would walk the customers down to their cabanas, we were not able to keep any tips. We had to turn them in and would split them with about 10 other receptionists at the end of the month. I would literally get $5 if even that much. If you're in HS then it will be okay I guess but i don't recommend to anyone who wants to make a decent wage. Aside there is always a bunch of drama among the life-guards."
good,They offer great benefits with the ability to cross train into other areas to develop your skills to a different level. They also offer generous time off.
good,"It’s a group interview so be alarmed because they don’t prepare you for that which I feel is very important. "
good,I worked at MGM Resorts International for 15 years and have gained so much experiences during my employment there.  Individuals with career-oriented driven will fit well in this company as it continue to grow.
good,"Good place to work and advance. Management rating is average in my department. Employer provides benefits such as Life, medical, dental and vision insurance. A generous number of days for Paid-Time-Off (vacation) for quality of life. The property has stable business and is a major player in the hotel and casino industry world-wide."
good,"MGM Resorts is phenomenal, great to have a resume. Hourly compensation is great but they’ve added more responsibilities on top of the existing. Meaning more work for same pay. They are penny pinching, there is a larger influx of guest complaints about this as well."
good,"All in all, it's a great company to work for, with many good people.   My particular job was on call 24-7-365 and that lost its luster after 8 years, especially with the constant negativity from gamblers.  Had many enjoyable experiences and provided a good salary.  Quality of life was sacrificed.   "
good,It was a nice place to work but they treated their employees poorly and pay should have been more. There is no career advancement opportunities within.
good,"I realize now, after being employed for so long how difficult it may be to apply for another job. The world now depends on computers, and not everyone has a computer, or completely knows about computers."
good,I've been with the company for several years & feel as if I need change & more of a challenge as well as change in entertainment. I want to meet new people & learn other new things.
good,So far a good job I don't know what the future holds for me there but its okay job. Weekends are the most busiest that's wwen I work. I'm still learning about the company.
good,"Computer Desktop Engineer"
good,"Working for MGM has been a great opportunity and  a wonderful learning experience for me.  I was able to collaborate with some hard working individuals who created a vibrant work environment where there was a open exchange of ideas.  However, as wonderful as an experience as it has been, I feel that I have reached the highest level I can with the current management in place. At this point I am looking for more of a challenge and looking to be cultivated by a new company that will take me to the next level."
good,The company is in a top tier resort corporation.  With multiple resorts througout the U.S. and overseas.  Providing gainful employement for tens of thousands of people.
good,A typical day work was busy over whelming.I learned how to work well under presure. Managment was OK. the work culture there was none. the hardest part of my day was Standing all day. the most enjoyable part of my day was lunch.
good,"This was a long time ago and I really don't have much to say. I am sure tings have changed dramatically there.  I am trying to look for a new job, not rate an old one"
good,"A typical day at work was very busy, politics ran ramped in the pits.  Knowledge, experience, or skills did not seem to be a priority with management.  The most enjoyable part of the job were the guests."
good,"Nice place to work, great people and good company to work for. It is a good company lots of different jobs to learn and most people are very supportive and understanding"
good,"Trabajar mgm  fue muy agradable ya que contaba con el respaldo de todos los jefes y la confianza de mis compañeros de trabajo "
good,Working as a housekeeper for the MGM Grand was a very fast past and demanding job. where we would have up to 12 to 16 rooms to clean and assist where stay over or check out. All rooms must be properly done and clean with in end of shift.
good,"Worked the night shift.  Schedule was not to my liking but training was the the problem as there was not really much.  You were put in the position and you sink or swim and ask a lot of questions.  Sometimes other associates would be snippy if you ask too many.  That would bug me."
good,"good place  fair pay, learned a lot of new things to use in life. Lots of places that they own so you can work in different departments. Great benefits."
good,My co-workers were the epitome of upper class customer service. Certain members of Managment and above were s pleasure to work for. I had been through multiple Management changes through the years.
good,"Lots of opportunity.  Prestigious.  Different job assignments and interaction with many people."
good,"It was a temporary position, overall I guess it wasn't to bad. it only lasted a year I did meet some rather interesting people to say the least, my manager was nice."
good,"Amazing Workplace culture, very in tuned with its employees! The work place atmosphere was very engaging and the continued education was beneficial more than one could imagine."
good,"Honestly, I like working with MGM. This company has a good work environment. Nice people to work around. Good pay. Part time actually give a very good amount of hours."
good,"I put a lot of pride and integrity into my job at MGM, which I do throughout my life. I am still emotionally getting over the loss of this job.  I am a single mother of two who is a student also so Im sure you can imagine how blessed I was to be able to have ONE stable job that allowed me to support my family and have time to go to school as well.  They have great benefits, set schedules and a great group of fellow employees."
good,"each day was fine to work"
good,"It was a fun experience, but our management was a bit bad because of its unfairness to everyone. They had favoritism, you just have to know how to be cooperative with coworkers. I made lots of friends."
good,"Great people to work with and learn from, supportive caring environment. Diverse workplace that encourages inclusion for everyone, constantly evolving environment. Encourages everyone to work together and learn from each other within property and to constantly learn and teach new techniques and more productive ways to work together and with our guests. I've learned better problem solving skills and to resolve conflict with understanding and tolerance rather than judgement and bias. A typical day on the pit floor would start with checking marker issuance paperwork from previous shifts was completed properly and insuring that our floor managers were up to speed and notified on any compliance issues for our guests, Keeping track of guest play and issuing player cards to our guests at the request of the floor managers. Filling table game credit in casino management system to ensure each table game has proper checks available to play for the shift. issuing customer credit for table game play for those qualified. Entering player gaming ratings into casino system."
good,What I learned is the grass is not always greener on the other side.  Management is like any other type of management.  You have your good managers and not so good managers.  We are a melting pot of cultures.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with different personalities.  Enjoyable part is you meet people from around the world
good,"great temporary job, while is school but if trying to advance might have to take a pay cut and then might get passed by for promotion so have to bounce around mgm resorts instead of staying at one property"
good,very professional staff and environment. Relaxed and balanced working experience. Patient satisfied with the agency services. Working for this agency was a great professional opportunity.
good,"Came into work and logged into my area and began assisting guests immediately as there was usually a line."
good,"Great place to learn"
good,"I was hired as part-time but was treated as on-call full-time without benefits. They eventually went over to a corporate scheduling system and wouldn't give me time off so I just quit. I had applied for a variety of line level jobs without success. With a BSc in Hotel Management I thought mobility would be easier. Not so with the union keeping things stagnant. It was paid well, though, and I worked with great people at each outlet."
good,Typical day at work changed from day to day. I learned a lot working here... They train often and keep you up to date on all your required trainings. Pretty well put together and cohesive work environment.
good,"I love and appreciate my job, but what makes it bad is the management of the company. They ruin the core value of MGM and the standard. There is favoritism and it makes the vibe really hard to stay there"
good,I like that I was always challenged with the work I was given and the work was interesting and different every day.  I like the management I was able to work under.
good,"Good company but the morale is low at our department, as we do more work and does not get a raise. It would be nice to have a little employee appreciation,"
good,No teamwork there since Union came in.  Not giving out Rewards to players like they used to so they have stopped coming.  Everything going downhill fast. Losing lots of good people.
good,"I learned a lot about the casino business during my time at the Luxor. I started near the bottom, and worked my way up to a middle-management position."
good,A workplace that is characterized by high levels of turnover and by the constant pressure to get things done very quickly and also efficiently.  It is a global organization.
good,It was fun during training but after traning you really dont get to work that many hours. you will only have one day out the week and thats on a sunday not cool at all..
good,"I work for MGM Grand Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, NV.  I have been an employee since opening day in 1993.  I started as a Guest Room Attendant and,  through training, was able to move out of Housekeeping and into General Reservations.  I would never have been able to learn the skills I needed to move had it not been for the in-house training program that they had at that time.  "
good,"I liked the job, however, I ran into difficulty by not being bilingual and it was frustrating. However, I did the best I could and worked through the language barriers."
good,Has great benefits plans. Equal opportunity employer. Places for advancement and relocation opportunities. Typical day was opening and closing procedures and responsible for guest and empolyee safety. Great co-workers other than manager. Manager of this job should not be in this position. She was unfair and unethical.
good,"We received training, Typical day is Preflight aircraft for flights and recover aircraft and work any squawks. Work and due inspection cards. Plan and execute any inspection from light and heavy maintenance.  Aircraft type are BBJ (737-700/800) and Gulfstream"
good,"Don't have much to say.. good benefits. decent pay. "
good,"Good company to work for, management was good and employees i worked with were great. Learned a lot of new things as far as report writing and surveillance."
good,"As a company, MGM Mirage (now MGM Resorts International) is a good employer.  There are opportunities at many casinos, but it is not without headaches and politics from time to time.  That is expected of large companies."
good,Having a full-time shift with core hours is a major plus in order to handle schedules and appointments. Also the free meals are a plus.
good,"A day at M,G.M Grand Casino would consist of opening table games checking the bankrolls. signing in the dealers to a specific table. Monitoring the customers rate of play. As to how much they bet per hand and for what length of time."
good,"Fast paced work with many details to master. Glass ceilings everywhere. Hotels and casinos never close, therefore, you have to be open to work every holiday."
good,"Professional company that has taught me a lot about conflict management and resolution.  Great family company."
good,"MGM Resorts is one of those companies that's trying to trudge along the slumping Las Vegas economy. They have multiple properties in development and are trying to grow. The executive team has some great ideas and are working to make the company a better place to work, as well as improve the CSR image of the company and culture."
good,"worked as server/night shift supervisor for approx. 1.5 yrs.  Left due to injury.  It is a family run restaurant with a Canadian menu.  Live music 5 nights a week and dancing.  Greeting and Serving customers, cleaning tables, stocking, cleaning."
good,"This corporation is a giant s*** show. From the executives to lower end management. The corporate waste and lack of creative initiative and direction is disturbing."
good,"The center had alot of daily activities for the associates. Different restaurants came to the brake room daily, different games and contests to be apart of"
good,I enjoy my time within this company. The work is fulfilling.  You have the freedom to diversify your resume while staying within your field.
good,"full of drama, however, the manager will work with you regarding your schedule. The pay is ok for a gas station job but you are also driving 30 minutes outside of Vegas. Benefits are really good too."
good,"busy, how to serve people, okay, fine,-in Detroit michigan"
good,"it is ok for working environment place, hard working, a typical place for work, management is confuse alot activities"
good,italian food and drinks importer. currently removed into financial company
good,Even though it was a fun place to..it became challenging to juggle a work life and family..Always having to work night and weekends and holidays..made it difficult to enjoy a standard life..I learned that diversity in the workplace and being around all types of people and their beliefs..
good,"Auditing, reconciling, GL, communication, JE's, Paid Outlet vendors, Organizied"
good,"I learned a lot of new skills of cooking and very interesting new dishes which I use at home with my family.  "
good,On-call position. Union job.first come first serve system.
good,Worked in the Home Entertainment division managing multiple US and Canadian accounts.  Learned account management and scan based model.  Launched new business and new merchandising partners.
good,Received practically no hours and poor compensation. Great if you work full time. The company itself is amazing. But not if you are On Call.
good,I liked the money and the guest interaction. That was about it.
good,i wasnt here long but i had fun and met a lot of interesting people. 
good,"Impossible at this time to advance within this property, no matter how good you are."
good,i have been here 5 years and the pay is good but there is alot of nit picking and favortism in the company
good,A typical day a the hotel was looking to see what kitchen you were assigned to. Then after your figure out what kitchen you are in you start the work. There was so many dishes and task you had to complete before your shift was over. Most kitchens was constantly going a very busy place. In order for you to have the kitchen completely cleaned and the dishes washed and put away you had to move very fast. The management i dont have too much to say just that im glad they gave me the opportunity. The hardest part was doing the job in the time they told us to do it. The most enjoyable part was knowing that im learning how the kitchen workers work and the process behind the scences of the resturants.
good,"Don't expect to ever see the directors or your bosses unless you do something wrong. Also, expect to have you job description to change week to week."
good,"Good company , workers are friendly. Lots of parking space for employee. Well organize."
good,A great place to find opportunities to advance and enhance a professional career. There are multiple properties that offer various levels of employment.
good,My only problem with the company was the horrible management. They ruined everything for us. Destroyed the morale and chased away our regular customers which caused reduced hours down to about 10 hours a week and the loss of benefits. Etc.
good,"You can't feel safe in an industry that is so dependent on the economic winds. You are just a number here. That said, kiss the right butt and you should be ok."
good,"It was a beautiful unionized organization. The Supervisors are awesome"
good,"MGM food and beverage management positions are highly corporate. Depending on the property you work at, the leadership and management styles of the department vary. The salary is not very high for what is required of the position. It's a great way to learn how to climb the corporate ladder if that's what you want to do."
good,"The amount of work and what sort of task will vary, depending on which location. For example, at the Luxor, you're required to clean 13-16 a day, but at the Cosmopolitian you clean less rooms because they are bigger and have kitchens. It's all about staying organized, and focused. Work smarter not harder, it's more simple than some supervisors try and make it seem. Do your best and be prepared to sacrifice your personal time at home for the first few months if you're new. It's on call for that time. Warning: you might get called in to work from 9am-5pm some days then 1am-9am in the same week"
good,Great environment to work in for a second job.  Coworkers were lively and it was excellent working all of the concerts and events that happened in the Grand Garden Arena.
good,I worked at mgm for some years. It was a ok place to work at first but then they started focusing on five stars and it started to get pretty bad there. And I had no room for advancement. A job at the casino isn't for everyone.
good,"Not a terrible job but nothing challenging. The calls are extremely repetitive and you will find yourself answering the same questions dozens of times a day. The work is highly socially isolating; you may not talk to your colleagues all day and there is very little managerial interaction or supervision. The pay is relatively comfortable considering the no-skill/low-skill nature of the job. If you don't mind working alone and doing consistent, undemanding work then it may well be a satisfactory job. Otherwise you might want to seek an employer that offers more dynamic tasks to their agents."
good,"Entreprise familiale, ambiance conviviale, salaires qui peuvent être intéressants et motivants, travail enrichissant"
good,"A typical day at work consists of collecting materials in order to work throughout the day such as disinfectant and mops and brooms for example. The environment usually is fast paced but consistent, the hardest part of my job would be that its never ending but I complete my tasks accordingly. In addition, the most enjoyable part of my job would be working with my team and helping the guest to the best of my abilities."
good,MGM resorts destroyed what Bellagio once was...a beautiful place. So many people hate working there and are unhappy. Cocktails have gone done and management is a bunch of amateurs. Sad to see what has become of a once great place.
good,Just hard to advance sometimes. Management isn’t always the best or understanding. I think they need more training and help out when needed instead of being lazy
good,"Easy job, low pay.                   nice environment,"
good,"Responsibilities included the management of union cooks, ordering food, assignment of prep lists to line cooks, sauce preparation, maintaining food and labor budgets, opening and closing responsibilities, maintenance of temperature logs, organization of walk-ins,"
good,"Slow-paced environment and good place to work!"
good,Rather not elaborate on the company. I would rather allow other fellow candidates to experience the company on their own views not from someone else's experience. Thank you.
good,"This company is a fun place at times but a stressful environment. Focused on guest service which is a plus, room for advancement which is also a plus."
good,"I use to work for Circus Circus, the team I worked for was amazing the Manager the co workers but Circus the corporate do let the people grow."
good,"a very busy envoirment with hugh production pressdidn't mix wellure and it was expected everyday. my staff was great, my supevisors were very good thru the first 2 years after that one changed and he was, well he and I were like oil and water,"
good,"The hours for the management team can be long,"
good,poorly run by management.  claim to be union yet isn't run union whatsoever.  fun atmosphere and great coworkers.  food is ok.
good,"Even though there has been a steady decline in the morale of employees at this location, due to inept management and indifference to their employees, dealing with customers on a day to day basis is what makes this job fun and interesting."
good,"The job at MGM Grand is pretty easy. I learned that working in a usually fast paced environment makes the day go by fast. My co-workers are often helpful. Most enjoyable part of the job is when they let us eat, which is normally only during Christmas holiday. Management is pretty good."
good,Normal day consisted of making sure the shelves were stocked and the cooler was filled constantly. Other employees were easy to work with and the register was easy to work.
good,"Working in the Legal Collection Department was interesting and fulfilling work.  I was very proud to say that worked at the MGM.  I felt secure in my position, but history has shown that no job guarantees job security.  It all comes down to the bottom dollar.  If it can be outsourced cheaper, even a company like MGM will do it with no advance warning or considered impact to their employees.  Advancement opportunities are there with excellent education opportunities, depending on where you currently are in the company.  I was denied education opportunities in accounting because my manager felt it was not job related."
good,"my co workers were some of the most amazing people I have ever met. "
good,"MGM is a huge company with plenty of jobs available.  Growth is encouraged for the most part if you show interest and put in at least 2 years before taking the next step.  Favoritism is alive and well here, but if you are willing to stick it out, your job is secure.  Some employees are friendly, but of course there are those who are not so nice because of title or ego...usually both.  Play their game, and you will be golden...otherwise you are just another number unfortunately. Nothing stellar, just mediocre, pay grade is the lowest on the strip and I have worked at other luxury hotels...aim higher if you can."
good,Hardest part of job was being layed off unexpectedly. Co-workers were like family and we all had fun working together and had good team work
good,Was a great job right out of college.  Fast paced and learned a great deal in two years.  Maintaining work/life balance was very difficult.
good,"Descent place of work, long hours, management could have been more professional, great benefits as well as great pay."
good,"One of the most rewarding and enjoyable parts of my job was to see the happiness on guests faces when you were able to help them with their reqeusts and when they hit jackpots. The hardest part of the job was realizing that no matter how hard you try some guests will not be happy. I loved working with my co-workers. After such a long time we became family. From some of my managers I learned to treat the guests with respect and to never judge a guest by their appearance or how they are acting. Part of my nights at work were doing paperwork to stay compliant with gaming regulations. The rest of my night I walked on the casino floor greating guests and handling any complaints and requests. I assisted with minor repairs on the slot machines and the ATM machines. I trained new employees and worked in the players club booth assisting guests with their comps and check outs and any questions or concerns they had. I enjoy meeting new guests and welcoming back the repeat guests. I always kept in touch with the guests after their departure to offer my assistance with any future visits and to make sure they were happy with the level of service they received with at the Luxor. Working the grave shift for 10 years you are the go to person for everything and anything the guest requests, as there is no host on duty to help so being a host, players club rep, slot supervisor, problem solver was just a few of the many hats we wore during the night. "
good,A great way to develop new opportunities And explore new crafts to make the customers beyond satisfied. The hard part is making sure that the guests don’t intimidate you and throw you off! It’s always great to make sure that you have your own supplies and be ready for anything that may approach you!
good,"High Turnover rate in Security Department . All shifts are not on the same page. You have some Managers that really make you feel like family and some that doesn't. Medical equipment is never stocked. Unprofessional employees no career growth."
good,"As a security officer, you interact with almost all of personnel that come onto property may it be a happy employee to a homeless person. Hardest part of the job are the customers as it can vary to from a college kid to the rich and famous. Most enjoyable are the events that take place."
good,It was a fair work environment the supervisors were a bit overbearing as far not willing to give feedback on certain work related issues but the district manager was very professional and was always willing to help when the opportunity presents itself.
good,"Nice company to work, Corporate culture, Work-private balance"
good,"Overall, great employees...some of the management is not that great to work for.  A lot of favoritism.  Sometimes the schedules got a little out of hand."
good,I have worked here for 10 years going on 11 and I have seen alot of different changes and all from good to bad but overall its a goof company to work for if you want to start out and get your fert in the door
good,Good place for experience. Always chance to learn something new if you ready to put 10-12 hours every day. Hard to balance your life. Almost no time for something else. Great health insurance!
good,"Good Place to work. Although I was on a temporary contract at MGM, met some great management & teammates. worked on Data Governance projects and had exposure to various teams and  Business entities"
good,"The supervisors and upper management do not seem to care about the learning experience, just the numbers... If there were associates struggling but doing the very best at their position, the effort put forth did not seem to be taken into consideration"
good,The work is very fluent in the fact that once you are there for a month you automatically know what to do because its pretty much the same thing every day and thats not a bad thing and also you get tips too wich is a big plus.
good,"As payroll assistant I verified time for many employees, both salaried and hourly; maintained time and attendance records; entered new-hires into system and made any  necessary adjustments. Prepared monthly and quarterly federal and multi-state tax returns."
good,It's an ok place to work. Needs better pay. Better hours. And needs better management. The lunch food could be better. And the work environment could be better
good,Great company to work for that believes in giving back to the community in which its employees live and work. Has a great diversity champion workshop that is offered to all managers and above. Not only is this two day workshop instrumental in the professional development of the employee but also in their personal life. That sets the tone for the culture of inclusivity.
good,had the best experience and the people are great no problem with this company. They give a  chance to move in to a better position.
good,"Regular ,ya que es un ambiente en el que se echan muchas horas"
good,MGM Dizzee World is a Sister concern of MGM Diamond Beach Resorts Pvt. Ltd.. MGM Dizzee World is an Amusement Park in Chennai.
good,"Great job opportunities and advancement. Great workmates food direction. Great training opportunities,  work tools at your every need. Manager summary of your job."
good,Its hard being on-call but once you get full-time it's rewarding. I still have yet to see full-time but that is because you have to continue to work hard and wait for an open opportunity.
good,"Don't get on the bad-side of management, it will eat you alive. However, if you go, do your job, and go home it's the perfect job that pays really well. Vacation and 401k benefits are a definite plus."
good,"Benefits, 401 K and flexible schedule were the best parts of the job. Retail management is compassionate and fair when life presents challenges and they are very willing to work with their staff."
good,"Overall a good experience.  Love the health benefits.  "
good,"The union was great if you knew how to help yourself using them when problems arose. Upper management was terrible, lower management was miserable. They were out to get their employees, rather than helping us by giving us tools for success. Working in such a large casino as Aria, you cannot simply go and get a bottle of champagne from the back room. And most of the time it wasn't there anyway which lead to 30-45 minute waits for the guest..unacceptable."
good,"My shift was 3-11 swings ,I learned the casino business is a fun place to work,management should listen to all employees equell,the hardest part of job was the plumbing part.the most enjoyable was the Insurance for my son"
good,customers of all kinds come in and have great conversation . Some bad days
good,too many employees not enough work or places to become full time unless your a gourmet cook
good,There is no growth in my department which is why I had to sadly leave. The people are amazing to work with and the support you get from them are amazing. Learned a lot about Team Leadership at MGM University.
good,"It was a great experience to be a gaming Surveillance Operator. I learned the inner workings of almost every aspect of the casino. Promotion was based on if a senior person above you left their position, so promotions weren't performance based."
good,as an emplyee i csn see both sides of the coun and to my eye u found this resort a grest place to work and visit and will tell people about this place
good,You get paid for your lunch which is nice. We had the option to do OT when it was permitted. The culture is not the greatest in some departments. Other departments are considerably better depending on management and/or roles/job titles. You can't beat the benefits which is always an incentive to stay in a work place as well as PTO/sick days. Getting the work done and helping guests have a great experience was the most enjoyable part of my job.
good,"I enjoyed working at the MGM Resorts. However, I had to relocated where I can be able to see my family. The property on which I worked for is called The mirage. This hotel is one of the best place to work in Las Vegas the Strip."
good,"Its a good job if youre looking for stability as a waitress. But it really becomes your life and its hard to get time off when you want it. Theres a lot of rules when it comes to taking time off because its all senority based and when youre part time your senority does not matter youll always be at the bottom. Also you have to be with the company for many years to actually make really good money. So when youre first hired you get the really bad areas that dont make a bunch of money. But the hourly is really good for being a server, plus they have awesome health benefits."
good,"Was a steady extra in 4 dining rooms, although I did not have a set schedule it was what I signed up for. Mediocre management but great staff. Company wise I have no complaints. I had a place to park, they fed me and did uniform laundry, not bad, I don't have that now and miss it terribly."
good,The values and training that MGM Resorts give their team is invaluable.  I enjoy working for MGM and would recommend this position.  I have grown with MGM for five years.
good,Great food. We served Japanese and chinese Cuisine and Chef Danny was a great Chef bringing his New York style of Sushi to Las Vegas.
good,"good benefit , free food, good insurance, bad training and mgt"
good,My experiences with the company so far has been a good one. I would recommended it to a friend. I do believe it is place that a person can developed there career.
good,Co workers make it fun! Diversity at it's highest level! The hardest part of job is the overstaffing resulting in a lot of standing around. Long walks to kitchen!!!
good,"MGM Resorts is a great company to work for and if you are looking to grow within this company will be your best bet. Great benefits, meals are provided, great work environment. As long as you have a positive attitude and wiliness to perform your work duties MGM is the work environment for you. The only negative is that it is a casino, its a compromise between having a balanced life at home. Don't expect a set schedule or weekends/holidays off. Casinos are the busiest during those days and full staff is needed."
good,It was ok working there just did not appreciate the way things are handled when it comes to employees!  I am just saying in the retail side of things their stock host is treated like the bottom of the pile which everywhere else I worked it's not like that!
good,Needs better supervision and team members who come to work to actually work. There's a lot of walking.Should ban smoking at least cigars. Enjoy the people I meet everyday.
good,"banquet server duties include customer interaction, prepping tables, polishing plates and silverware.  Deliver food accurate in a timely manner according to banquet event order."
good,"The work itself was relatively easy. You find different ways to say the same negative thing to guests. Managers are never around. People are lazy. The company really doesn't care about you, but the staff is nice!"
good,me pagan muy poco y además me cobran el alquiler .
good,Lots of turnover. Stressful and cut- throat environment to work in. Job security not guarrantee. Cannot be productive until all employees left for the day. Management expect you to work long hour.
good,Travail intéressant malgré des déplacements dans toute la France  
good,"Technology Organization lacks competent leadership.   "
good,It’s a good company it’s just not organized. It need better training and manager. Overall is a very good company to work for. It just need to get organized
good,"Managers rarely had their employees backs when it came to guest discrepancies, they flat out demanded you pretended to be manager and handle the situation which leads the guests to believe that they are not important enough or their problems are too minuscule to speak with management. 8/10 times you will be dealing with an angry guest, but that is honestly manageable and would be easier to handle if management actually did their job. If you are great kissing up to strangers and management then this is the job for you!"
good,"j'étais apprenti-métallier,première fois dans le monde professionnel."
good,Cleaning store folding clothes and restocking all snacks and drinks an replenish all clothes redecorate is needed. management was not how its suppose to be they do not know what the was doing and was not available and all time like they was suppose to been.
good,"Working for MGM Resorts International Contact Center was a different experience. It was fun and entertaining during the first two weeks of training, but when you were on your own, things changed. Although, I know that they are a four star and five star rated company, they expected a lot of their employees and did not compensate very much.  The great thing that they offered was a wonderful breakroom with a Company Kitchen and beverages of all sorts, Early Outs if business was slow, and frequent visit from from the stage performers from the MGM property shows on the strip. The hardest part of the position was the constant QA checks and their high standards for adherence.  Not that I personally had a problem, but they didn't want to change your personality but in turn they wanted to change your personality. They also did not offer benefit packages for employees that worked under 32 hours and you had to wait for 6 months before you were considered for benefits as long as you had averaged 32 hours per week in a quarter."
good,The work environment as a whole was nice. The company itself is great. However the seperate restaurants that were being run without MGM was the issue. Managemnet was not effective at their job and was not trained properly to help us. So it made the staff feel as though we were depending on our self's. But the company MGM was a great experience.
good,Simply no job security in the security field. Wish that staff would have your back more. Also EDR sucks for grave shift and it definitely wouldn't hurt to add more cameras in certain areas.
good,"Busy place and very long hours. "
good,I learned that balance in life and work is the most important key to having a successful career.
good,"I made sure that the people was able to accommodate the people. Whether it was personal, a piece of mint or perfume spray. Some just came to talk.."
good,"i liked it but, i was 8 months pregnant an they don't have lite duty."
good,Some lack communication. And many have favoritism not to mention sneaky people at work trying to grab your position. Management skills need more training and attention to their team. And have compassion for their team members.
good,"The hardest part of this job was dealing with rude and disrespectful guests, overall there were a couple of other team members that i loved working with"
good,"It’s a fun place to work at but it didn’t pay well for what we as employees had to deal with. The supervisors always made sure you left happy, but the environment made sure you were always on your toes"
good,"I really enjoy working with my fellow team members at MGM Detroit.  I truly enjoy meet new people everyday, and learning something about the guest.  Also MGM Detroit have giving me a great opportunity and I have learn so much from this company."
good,"You can see the core values of MGM Resorts International while working at MGM Grand Detroit, but I doubt it is the same environment.  The labor union, and most employees have ruined what could and should be a great thing.  The management team is lacking in skills and discipline.  There is very little teamwork, and most are out for themselves and don't care about what happens to other employees.  The skill level of co-workers is well below par, and their ability to keep their job is proof of managements ability and desire to affect change.  I would recommend working for MGM Resorts International, as long as it is not at MGM Grand Detroit."
good,Great Benefits and work experience.  Some upper management abused power and were unqualified.  Many hard-working employees with pride in the product and property.  Produced superior product.
good,Worked in the FSSC for MGM from 2014 to 2016.  Work/life balance was good.  Management was not.  The pay was garbage.  The health coverage was actually quite phenomenal.
good,"great place to work, if you have a manager that cares and helps develop there is great potential for advancement. personal accountability is extremely important."
good,"I was working on-call for over a year. The job was good. Managers and coworkers treated me well."
good,"Its overly micro managed and not marketed fully to its strength. The managers does not communicate with their employees and the talent of management is medium at best, lacking degrees and experience"
good,"Good experience.  You can learn alot and move around the casino alot.  Those are the pluses.   The minus is the union environment.  Very challenging, but, it does make you a better manager!"
good,"My typical department was relatively hard to work in because in such a large company, there are a lot of moving pieces and those pieces all have different goals and expectations."
good,"I worked there for 14 years. I loved the security, but it was hard on my family."
good,"golf, food , working conditions good. Overall, the facilities, staffing, service, work related, training were first rate. But for, the enormous cost of the commute to and from work the experience was positive."
good,"I love the family atmosphere, the place is beautiful. I worked with some very friendly and a team. We all worked together to accomplish our goals. I had a great time there."
good,Fun place to work. You have to be a people person to work in a casino period if your not this is not the job for you. Kind of a high turn over because of strict expectations you basically have no life working here especially if you full time but that’s the casino life for you
good,I have enjoyed working here over the years. I have learned how to manage difficult clientele.  I have also worked with very high-end clients.   I will take this experience into my next endeavors.
good,I enjoy working for this company I have worked for or alongside MGM resorts international for 5 years there aren't too many companies that can compete
good,"I was fry cook & any fast paced kitchen can be a very stressful environment. The pay rate was great, but the scheduling was a downfall because you start at the bottom as a fry cook & have to work your way up before you actually start getting decent hours every week. Every week though was different day’s off so it was difficult to balance work & family time. You can’t really plan to have a social life in the begging. Although I did have a lot of friendly co workers & they guided me a lot in the beginning, I ultimately left because I simply did not have a set schedule every week. I was on call but after 3 months I did start to get my 40 hours a week. Also not every day I worked the same kitchen & sometimes I wouldn’t work the same kitchen for weeks at a time. Ultimately it wasn’t a bad experience it’s just not what I thought it was going to be like."
good,"Nice exciting place to work. "
good,I loved working with MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL. I only left because I moved states. I'm currently over 50 miles from Las Vegas now so I cant work for the company until I relocate closer to properties.
good,"I was typically posted at 2 or 3 areas in a given shift to maintain flow of guests into the casino and hotel and ensure that they were at or above legal gambling age.  I learned radio codes and jargon, how to properly handle and transport casino chips and what to look for in determining someone's age on a photo ID."
good,No complaints have worked here for over three years very good place to work and the Benifits are really good. Treat employees fairly and do tons for the community
good,"Easy, fun job and workplace. Employees are friendly and helpful. I personally know a couple people that have been with the company for 20+ years. Extremely lucky to work for a great company."
good,"I love this company; however, management is hit or miss and it is difficult for HR to take you seriously if you do have a concern. Otherwise, it is an amazing place to learn and offers excellent benefits and perks."
good,"everyday was the same, learned ways to finish room quickly in the amout of time they gave. the hardest part of the job was learning my first time on how to make the beds. the most enjoyable part was break and getting to know my team members."
good,"Lots of fun, good people to work with. Management needs to be more active and participate and engage more with the employees. Management pushes SHOW training and other training but does not lead by example."
good,n/a the review was helofull and insightfull appreciate the MGM staff. .Injoyable working supervisors and co workers .Resonable edr and high quality inventory of product and produce. MGM has a high standard of production to withhold in ayearly mannar.
good,The people were pretty friendly and management was good.  There was much teamwork involvement.  There was much room for advancement and training for employees.
good,"Busy locations. Culture is one where they are happy to keep you in your position, but if you want to move departments or advance, you will be 86'd. People above you don't seem to know how to help you, just don't rock the boat."
good,Customer Service is everything.Management made sure that we were taught how to enter act with the guest on a very professional level. We worked as a team with different departments.
good,"Not something that everyone can handle.It’s all Of what you make it, do you want something that you can retire from this is probably not the job.A lot of things are great here, but a lot of things can be a lot better"
good,"There is a lot to love, but it can also be difficult with some of the leadership in place. It's the same everywhere, but that doesn't make it better. MGM has great benefits, good people, strong direction, and sometimes difficult leadership."
good,"Good job, no advancement. Management is ok. Decent benefits. Not a hard job. There is generally some teamwork involved. The work place culture and incentives could be better."
good,It was a good place to work. It wasn't any better or any worse than working for the casinos on the strip. The turnover rate was high so training was always terrible.
good,Typical day prep for 2 hours Organize materials and food products bake steam.Tranfer over to Edr ad work line and stations for 2 hours.Lunch time 1 hour break.After break check ovens rotate beef or items involved.
good,management does not communicate with each other. The day to day operations is pretty good. I have learn about the system and how everything works but they will not promote you if your not sucking up to the boss
good,"I enjoyed working there in the security department and the people were great. The only reason I left was due to not advancing within the department because they rather give supervisor positions to "" whoever looks good"" rather than the right man for the job."
good,"I worked as a lifeguard at the main pool for three seasons.  Considering my shoddy attendance, I had it coming that I wouldn't be considered seriously for a higher-paying position.  Every position is meant to be very flexible, from my understanding.  Training is succinct and up-to-date for all positions.  The attitude this company looks for during ALL customer interactions is upbeat and attentive; those who want a hand-out won't get it here."
good,Sometimes I wish I still worked there. Meeting people from all over the world and being a part of the entertainment industry was the most enjoyable experience ever.
good,"Stressful and strenuous work day, however it is fun and can pay off.  Typical pool cocktail position. The pool management is great however there is a huge disconnect between beverage services and pool management. Causes for a confusing and stressful day."
good,"its great, fun and full of copious amount of energy not only from the guest but fellow employees. You get free food. The best were the chicken tenders."
good,"A Typical day at work. "
good,I enjoy my coworkers and guests daily.  Management lacks in a few areas causing the food and beverage department to struggle at times. Always room for improvement.
good,My career at MGM Resorts international began with Project CityCenter which is now highlighted by their flagship hotel Aria Resort & Casino. The hotel and the company as a whole do great things in the community and for their employees.
good,"I liked working at the MGM the only thing I didn't like was the on call and the you had to be available all the time you couldn't really plan anything because you didn't know if you were going to get called in and I also didn't like that it takes for ever to get a transfer or even to become part time I was there for 3 years and didn't get the opportunity to transfer or get a schedule,"
good,"Great benefits, leading company, great culture... Very great leadership training program, free on-going training courses. Can transfer to any property after 6 months."
good,MGM has been great to help me get started with my career. They have helped my while I've been in school and helped me get in touch with the sales office on property. The director of slots and various other supervisors care about their employees. Sometime the casino can get to you because of the constant customer recovery for slot players and the app MyVegas.
good,Good management team overall and good benefits. Worked in bell department and enjoyed my co-workers. I would suggest this company to other people wanting to make a good living.
good,"typical day at work will be when there is nothing wild going on, most days there is something new to learn, either they change policy or we get new ones. Most days are a learning process, either new rules, change of rules or customers doing something new or wild and fun. On my shift management is good, and no drama, good environment to work; I like it. Get alone well with co-workers, most are friendly and helpful nice to work with. The hardest part of this job is the membership card sign ups, we must meet the quote for each month lot of competition between co-workers.The most enjoyable part are the customers they are funny and wild just as is suppose to be in Vegas every one comes here to have fun be wild and...yeah spend the money."
good,"To assign tasks to associates and to follow up.  Make sure journals and invoice are processed.  Maintain mdse is properly displayed and priced.  Answer and question and solve any issue that a guest has."
good,"Woking at MGM was a experience I'll never forget.  The team at MGM were not only my friends but became part of my family.  A typical day at work was very busy.  MGM is the largest hotel in the United States and you could feel that on a daily basis.  Ive learned many things at MGM but the thing that stands out the most is patients.  Our management team was always there to keep us involved and motivated.  I would have to say the hardest part of working at the MGM for me was when when it was slow and during Grand Garden Arena fight nights.  When it's slow I can get a bit anxious as i'm always looking for something to do.  During fight nights it seemed there was always a curve ball around the corner, however that's when I learned the most.  Being able to see and meet a wide scale of people from all over the world was a wonderful part of the job. Woking at the front desk and being our guests first interaction with any of the MGM staff allowed me to ensure that they were able to start their experience out the right foot."
good,Large companies sometimes have trouble making sure that supervisors and middle level leaders are enforcing the culture they desire. MGM has good intentions but lack in follow through.
good,"worked in buffet as cashier, a very pleasant working environment, fun coworkers and customers. handled high amounts of money and comps."
good,"Lots of walking around with not much to do but people watch.  Thought there would be more of an opportunity to learn and grow but has not turned out that way.  Management is willing to work with you in any situation and are very easy to work for.  Co-workers continually complain, morale isnt always great, for the most part however they're all good people.  The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to interact with people and help them with whatever they may need."
good,"•	Sold tickets to Cirque De Soleil shows, including all sister property shows of MGM, worked with variety of offered discounts, up sold to promotions."
good,"They promote total compensation package...so the pay is not the highest however many good benefits."
good,Customer Service job; great staff ; amazing guest ; fun place to work everyone works as a team communicates and looks to see others succeed.
good,"Good support from management"
good,"Blackline Reconciliations: land, building, equipment & depreciations; Processed weekly reports for CIP, full & partial retirements; Tract & request CER forms."
good,Great flexibility to try different areas and find your niche.
good,I answer calls and deal with any queries the policy holders have. I am a senior administrator which means I help the manager with stats for the team and anything they need me to do. since working my way up to the senior role I have learned how to manage a team when my manager is not around. This involves making sure the team stats are above board whilst making sure the team are in a good working environment.
good,"I have worked at 2 MGM properties for a total of 7 years, and I can say that they treat their employees well. They educate their staff and stay on top of everything."
good,"good place to work, good benefits."
good,One of the nicest resorts on the Strip!  Continues to expand and update to surpass the competition.
good,"I work part time so my time spent there is minimal. I enjoy being part of the company, everybody is friendly- the pay scale is good"
good,"Working in Casino Marketing was one of my favorite jobs with this company.  I worked with the casino hosts comping guests that had earned points that would comp room, food, show tickets and other expenses they had incurred."
good,Extremely well organized company with amazing benefits. Supervisors and co workers were all helpful and caring. 
good,It's fun but challenging. Company supports their managers by giving different types of classes from time to time. Employee profile you deal with is a little challenging.
good,"great opportunities for growth. as a poker dealer, you have the opporutnity to meet and network with many individuals. Being a worldwide vacation destination, you will come across many interesting people."
good,usually my day at work is a faily smooth day. the people are very professional and friendly.
good,Worked in the casino and with the casino finance department - great workplace!!
good,Employees are fairly satisfied with the overall expectations.
good,The benefis and pay are fairly commensurate to skill level. Employees should be compensated according to merit as opposed to seniority.
good,Learned self control in hard situtations
good,Exciting place to work with great benefits but terrible hours.
good,"paper files, cheap pay, people are friendly and nice to work with, free lunch everyday in the EDR, got to speak with guests from all over the world which was fun, interesting and rewarding."
good,"MGM grand is the most best company. "
good,I'll be on call for three.years looks like and if you refuse a shift they either fire you or put at the end of the call to work list. Pay is good. The coworkers alot do not speak good English but generally happy and are frieo unlike some housekeeping positions at other places in Vegas.
good,MGM is a great company to work for because of the flexibility and inclusion of perks that can suit everyone. The flexibility you have is the opportunity to switch properties and gain experience in different levels and avenues of the MGM organization. I really appreciate this perk and enjoyed my time working for the company.
good,Great  company to work for.  If you want to be busy and productive this is  the place.  People are very pleasant and always willing to help out. There is always room for advancement and job postings.
good,"MGM Call Center is the perfect place to work if you like or need to be stationary, need a set schedule with opportunity for overtime and/or like very specific job duties. There is little to no variation in daily work culture."
good,"Decent workplace, challenges you to think on command. Advancement opportunities within MGM. Multiple sources for furthering education and advancement through out the company"
good,"Great place to start a career, Friendly people, Great Employees. Structure on management has alot of opportunity but overall if my pay was better I'd stay"
good,"To be a successful table games dealer, you need the math skills, of course, but even more than that, you need to be able to bite your tongue.  You will deal with frustrating, childish, angry, nasty, and perplexing behavior.  You need to be able to let it all bounce off without effecting your ability to perform your job or keep your cool.  Don't get me wrong, it isn't like that all the time.  Quite often you are dealing with fun guests who have their heads on straight.  They are the easy ones, but you need to be able to handle the difficult ones in order to do well with this job."
good,Deaprtment has a lot of potiential but there needs to be work w/ overall management.  Indicviduals do not leave because of their job and colleagues.. they leave due to Management.
good,"Pays great , sometimes you get days sometimes you dont , you're on call so having a social life is basically done everything you do will be last minute planning"
good,"Good Company and Co-workers."
good,I enjoy working at MGM the people I came across were amazing and it’s a good experience. Typical day consist of serving alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages
good,Shared services is phone answering since 1/1/2014.  Constantly on phone.  All in all MGM is a good company.  That's why I have been with them 13 years.
good,"Would for company again if the opportunity arise.  Fast pace environment and work place culture friendly.  Management can be over bearing, depending on the manager.  High turn over in management."
good,"MGM gives a lot of benefits to their employees. They make sure employees are happy with their work. The only problem with working with MGM, they have  a lot of employees so there are office politics going around."
good,I was laid off with the 2009 consolidation. I do not have a lot of nice things to say to be honest. But the classes were a great opportunity and the fact that they took my work to make user manuals with was a great thing. I did love working GL until I was laid off.
good,This is a very stressful place to work but can be a fun place as well depending on what section you work in. You do get some discounts if you enjoy spending time on the Vegas Strip.
good,"Place is huge with thousands of employees, Unless you work side by side with someone you will only meet a fraction of the people that work there. Great benefits and food for the employees"
good,"The largest and most dynamic show that I have worked on.  Seeing the progression from one show to the next is invigorating.  There are still places where improvements can be had,but they are working themselves out progressively."
good,"Good place to work for, but, as an on-call banquet server, just not enough work because of being over staffed. There was not enough storage rooms and working area to do other things.  Hopefully, with the new conference center being built, things maybe different. HOWEVER, my guess is, they will employ more people to make it hard for the rest of us to win some work."
good,"Good employees to work with. "
good,"There are a lot of perks of the job. In order to explain to Guests what there is to experience, the staff gets to experience it first. 24 hour operation, 365 days per year."
good,"MGM Resorts offers the best quality hotels in each of their respective comparative sets. Although it is an honor to represent such a great brand, compensation is not on par with the rest of the city.The company promotes a great culture of diversity and inclusion, and the overall working environment is very positive."
good,"good benefits, nice people, free lunch, flexible with hours for appointments, vendors bring in food for the buyers to sample, not flexible on working hours, there is a set time for work"
good,The hotel overbooks almost every week which makes it very hard on all of the staff to stay positive.  High ranking leaders seem to not care much about their line level employees.  Create a lot of stress on them and demand perfection.
good,"A typical day starts with a property walk of all venues, greeting employees and guest. Setting up staffing levels for the day in all 26 venues managing over 600 beverage employees. Ensuring that venues and employees are in compliance, disciplinary actions and financials for all venues.  The most difficult part of the job is going home as everything is still going, it never ends in a city that never sleeps."
good,"Great Company with room for advancement, great learning tools."
good,Tried for several years to move up into a higher position and was told that economy was poor so I went back to get my Masters Degree in Special Education for grades K-12 in order to make sure I have a good career for the future. The job prospects are better in Texas where my son lives so I have relocated there to finish my degree and look for work at the local schools and university.
good,It has great opportunities for its employees. Great employer with great benefits.
good,One of the best jobs I've ever worked as I learned a lot and got to experience many lessons that will help further my career. Need to be detail oriented and focused.
good,Working for MGM as a lifeguard was a fun job that was perfect for summer. Spending two summers working for MGM showed me how to handle difficult questions and aid sober and intoxicated guests. It was a nice environment where everybody got along. The hardest part of the job was having to sit in the sun all day.
good,"I worked for MGMRI for over 6 years.  I have to say that I learned many things while there.  I learned the insides of the gaming industry in a way that came naturally to me and I was always encouraged to learn as much as possible.  I was caught in an unfortunate situation where the ideas of how my department was going to be run was changing.  "
good,"I must say working for the MGM was one of my more favorite places to work. very little drama and most co-workers were pleasant people. Management were ok, some more than others but never over bearing.  You always experienced different things every night so work was never dull. Patrons did get out of hand and had to be dealt with in either a verbal manner or being physically removed from property, but that is to be expected when alcohol,drugs, and fun are all together in a building."
good,"I move to Las Vegas, Nv from a little T town of 4 thousand.  I did not know what a casino looked like.  but no two look a like."
good,wow each day was different working in a casino you had your good days and bad
good,A typical day at work is when you can work at your own pace and don't have to rush. I've learned to work well with others to be a team member and player at all times. Management is very hard working and try to help you anyway they can. The co-workers are very friendly and they always greet you with a smile. The hardest part of the job is when you have a lot of check outs and you have to rush your rooms. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I can help make my guest or co-workers day enjoyable.
good,"I like it there mostly, all jobs have their ups and downs. We start by unloading the trucks, then we build the truss, put the lights on, hang the sound, set the stage, and have a show! Then we tear it all out and do it again the next day. Can be heavy work, dirty too. I like seeing the patrons having fun."
good,Benefits used to be better but are still good. wages are decent and there are many options for advancement
good,MGM Resorts International is a great place to work. MGM Resorts International offers employees good benefits as well. I currently work in the Government Affairs Department and have been with the company 7 1/2 years. I would like to pursue a different area other than government at this time.
good,"It was a good job. The only problem was management changed and then my job security changed also. MGM eliminated my job title, that 15 other people held also. Before the changes from the first 3 years from my time of hire at 2012 it was an awesome job, with what seemed to be growth and opportunity. Unfortunately, the culture changed in a bad direction after that."
good,"If u are in need if cool place to work, its here. Great benefits and pay, but seniority gets days off before you do. Free lunch if u have time and cool food bev mgt."
good,Many different positions to find work that suits you the best with many different full and part time jobs. There is a constant need for employees at all times of the day.
good,"I was working in the valet so I got to drive alot of cool cars. I spent alot of time helping people with there luggage and seeing new smiling faces."
good,"Employees all come together and formulate a plan, divide into teams and send each team to different restaurants located in the MGM casino By managemen"
good,"Superb customer service skills"
good,I worked at mgm resorts international as a construction data coordinator. I would recommend mgm resorts international to any career minded long term sekf motivated.job seeker.
good,"MGM is a good company with opportunities to learn and grow."
good,"Grateful for the overall experience of working with a largely known company as MGMRI, the cultures of each department vary per work style despite promoting ""one company, one culture"".  Alot of politics and after having worked here despite the benefits and perks, I don't think I would want to work in a company within the casino industry again."
good,"Though it was labor-intensive out in the heat all day, I did enjoy the work, and also the management. I learned much about time management and goal achievement, considering it was up to me to determine when (and how) things needed to be done. All-around it was a great learning experience, however, I am looking for a more fulfilling and challenging career path."
good,"MGM overall is a great company.  However, there is no room for advancement.  I worked on a small team where communication was good but MGM is a very large company and often times communication trickled down and was very effective."
good,"Excellent start for career in hotels and customer service"
good,"Fair pay, Good benefits. Looking for another job due to automation. Competitive work environment keeps employees on their toes. Have worked for company over 20 years, I am grateful for the experience."
good,For what it is was worth even with me not working there i see hands down why its 1st place  in the casinos here in detroit. I had an ok experience but it wasnt so bad. Family oriented is all i will say as far as my experience everything else is strict and some stuff unnecessary
good,"For an IT Engineer, it is often a case a high-risk, high accountability work, but for high reward (in the form of compensation & benefits) at MGM Resorts. Unfortunately, I took too many risks that lead to progressive discipline that inevitably lead to my separation from the company."
good,"Worked for the company 23 years 1st with Steve Wynn.  Then moved on when MGM took over.  My Job consisted of watching over the poker room operations.  Made decisions  on all the poker games.  Gave other supervisors their breaks.  Sat new guests at games, get them chips.  Completed all my training, title 31, health card, tam card. Attended many training courses on customer service, diversity, Health and safety.  The above company projects I did for customers got them dinner reservations, show reservations, getting them into clubs ahead of the waiting lines. so we can get them back to playing poker!"
good,"A typical day at work involves walking through your designated section to serve the guests drinks, it is typically a 6 - 8 hour day. I've learned a lot about server culture, restaurants, and the food service industry. Management is a bit unorganized so all dot your i's and cross your T's there are a lot of rules to follow. The hardest part of the job is paying attention to your bank and learning how to make a drink when there is no bartender. The most enjoyable part of the job is an unlimited room for growth and opportunity."
good,Good place to work. Drive time was over an hour from my home so that eventually got old. Enjoyed co workers and Management. Work pace was fast paced at times but interesting.Time clock was very strict also they do have a very strict attendance policy during the first 90 days of employment.
good,"I recommend lifeguarding to young teens who want a summer job. Especially in the casinos, they're going to hire approximately 10-30 guards depending on the pool. location, how busy they predict the deck to get that year, etc."
good,"There is a need for more middle management, yet the teams worked well and their employees were some of the best I've worked with."
good,Yes it’s a fun environment to work at. I work there l 10 years. I learned a lot working there. I made nice tips and met a lot of  people working there.
good,Fun place to work.  The pay is not enough for what the job entailed.  the job was very demanding for the pay.  Free lunches was a nice perk. Was your typical casino job.
good,"A large property that featured a separation of most hotel operations departments. As a result, there was at times a disconnect between the managerial strategy of department heads."
good,"MGM is a great company to work for if you don't have a life outside of work. It is difficult to work with a school schedule."
good,"Day to day deals with the constant heat, never ending guests, and exhaustion depending on the weather. Not enough equipment to aid lifeguards when sitting on stand. low durability umbrellas, hot pavement on stands, and becomes useless when the sun hits at a certain angle. workplace culture is at a high, diversity, reach out to different money making ideas are shown at MGMResorts."
good,"It's a great place to work. The people I work with are amazing people to be around. The majority of the day depends on the incoming and outgoing traffic, but either way you can make the best of both."
good,"Typical day was to start the day with a security briefing, than get a hand off from the security force leaving for the day."
good,"This is one of those jobs that you can't afford to procrastinate on.  The data is always coming through and many days were overwhelming, but the people were great, helpful, and pleasant to work around.  The cafeteria and recreational room really attest to the company's desire to take care of their employee's."
good,"Work at MGM was certainly exciting.  I mean, it is a casino after all.  The hardest part of the job as a cashier was the standing for long periods but they are generous on their breaks."
good,"I have enjoyed working for the company. The people are nice and easy to work with, great moral. Very understanding and works with your schedule. I recommend them to anyone."
good,"Lots of training, room for growth. Always expanding. "
good,"A normal day will probably consists of helping guest and walking around your section. May pay out jackpots, fix a machine or assist a guest with any concerns."
good,"It's a good place to work but it's a fast paced environment. Also, some of the roles that people have can be more explained or maybe give a thorough understanding what they do."
good,"Managed groups for the conference center, learned a lot and made a lot of career advancements.  Lots of achievements and great place to learn and advance in my career."
good,"It was fun working in there because u have your own time and my co-workers are my friends we clean cars fast we have our own task to do, and i do most the body and sometimes i vaccumm and clean inside only."
good,MGM Resorts Intl can be a very enjoyable place to work. 100's of pleasant hard-working employee's with whom I had contact everyday. Upper management has a tendency towards self-importance and can be unwilling to listen to lower level and mid-level Supervisors and Managers. Hardest part of the job while I was employed was the ever-changing expectations of Upper management and the sometimes unrealistic views of how efficiently certain tasks could be completed.
good,Tired of Casino. Want a different work environment. Beau Rivage has poor management and won’t give you your PTO time. They don’t want you take any days off.
good,MGM overall is a great company to work for.  Although the day to day can be stressful the job is rewarding. MGM offers excellent benefits and competitive wages.
good,"Working the Front Desk in a hotel with 4500 rooms, there is always a line from 7:00 AM to midnight. The conversations become repetitive as well as the complaints. The pay and benefits are good, but eventually are the only reasons people stay there over a year. Most days I just constantly check people into rooms with every five minute interaction and barely get a chance to make any small-talk with my colleagues outside of break. It's a great job for people who need to provide for families but I could never go home with pride that I did anything meaningful that a computer couldn't do. I often felt like an employee number rather than a person and I've never met the General Manager/ President of Luxor in my 2 years."
good,"Help set up and write procedures for Casino Cashier Operations."
good,Luxor is a wonderful place to work. It's not a super high end casino nor is it super low tier either. The wages are good. The people are great. The atmosphere is just fantastic. Not to demanding yet not to dead. Love working at the Luxor.
good,I loved it just chose the wrong position i wanted to meet and conversate with guest more and to show my full potential but im still very grateful i had the oppertunity to work for this company...
good,"Opportunity to move around kitchens in casino. Overall, a decent company to work for although not much opportunity for growth. Environment is fast paced"
good,"Each shift is has a meeting about daily and ongoing events  and any pertinent information. The tasks of check in/check out, making room keys, and answering questions is relatively easy. The most difficult part of the job is the ""unknown"" aspects of traveling - whether and traffic delays, late night arrivals, etc. That can make it tough on staffing throughout the day. There is an employee dining room and benefits are included for full time agents plus agents who regularly work 32 hours a week."
good,"Good company to work for, with good benefits, if you work for a smaller property it seems like a family even though there are a lot of employees.  Everyone is engaged."
good,"They motivated me to work hard everyday,  all coworkers were friendly and helpful and made sure I understood the process of cleaning the rooms. It was a memorable expierience, but there was no room to grow."
good,"Becoming a Grandette requires a lot of your time and you need to spend money to look good at all times. Yes, there are girls that don't care how they look and they make money. Put your best foot forward and you potentially can do well. A typical day at work is going to a pre shift meeting that is totally unnecessary. It takes time away from servicing guests so they are aggitated when you finally show up. Depending on what shift you're on it can be very slow but despite this you can get written up for standing around with nothing to do. This is a seniority house so if you're new you won't get to go home early or take a vacation like the high seniority girls can. I had the best days off, schedule, and went home whenever it was slow because of my seniority. Also there is a strict attendance policy.  Better hope there isn't a blizzard or the end of the world, you better show up and be on time. There's no leniency whatsoever so you need to have points to spare.  It was glamorous when I started back in the day but things went downhill. If you're young steer clear of this place. The money is addictive and many people find themselves staying longer than they intended despite being in college. It can take years to move up in seniority  so your days off may not agree with your personal or kids schedule. They do not care and don't accommodate. Very negative work environment dealing with people who gamble their last dime and the mean girl atmosphere. Also the smoke is terrible. The positives are great benefits and tips. This place has had better days. You're better off opening a new casino"
good,The company offers employees great benefits and a lot of opportunities to move within the company. Do not let yourself get fooled though; there are caps on how large of a pay increase current employees can receive which is less than what an outside person would make.
good,"Overall a good place to work. Not much more to say. Like any places of business, some days are better than other's. I like my job but need more income to help with bills."
good,this is the best property to start your career. Management are very c operative. I learned so many things during my work periods.Over all good experience to learn.
good,"good place to work fun crew good management learing alot . good jobs, nice stuff .Alot of good things about this place. like it alot so good"
good,MGM resorts is a changing company.  We will see what the future holds for this organization. The corporate culture is a little disjointed compared to the properties cultures.
good,Would still be there if not for bad fit with new manager.  Growing company becoming more corporate with each passing day.
good,Good company culture. Team members are more than co-workers. Management takes an interest in the team. Hardest part of the job is long hours at close.
good,"This was my first job with MGM Resorts, and I was able to learn the culture and what it takes to work in a Casino industry. The ability to work with many properties on a project at one time. Scheduling Directors for meeting and making travel plans for them also."
good,The hours were hard. I liked my co-workers. Management was ok except they all were not on the same page.
good,Good work team. Good relation with managers. Learning opportunity for customer service.
good,Very good company to work for and they really care about their employees. They help the community in many ways and provide the tools for employees to donate or volunteer.
good,"The call center for MGM Resorts International was a great place to work. It was fun and engaging. However, as there was a change in upper management, the work ethic and morale of the office declined exponentially."
good,"Great place to work, but corporate structure impedes it's attempt at being the apple of resort's on the Strip."
good,"Great organization and co-workers. But, compensation and benefits were just okay."
good,A Casino job is never boring and things are always changing. It's a place that teaches you to think fast and be able to make a decision quickly. The skills you learn in a Casino business will last a lifetime. The best part about the job is working with different types of people and meeting new people all the time.
good,Overall enjoyed my work experience there. The direct management staff was great.
good,"We set the tone for our guest. We greet them with a smile when they visit and assist them with anything they might need (I.E. Vehicles, questions, concerns etc.)."
good,"A typical day at MGM is full of deadlines, accuracy and multi tasking. My co-workers are wonderful to work with."
good,"I enjoyed working for MGM Grand Detroit. The casino has a friendly culture. One must be very organized to succeed in this environment. I supervise a small crew daily and make sure their preventative maintenance tasks are completed in a timely manner while ensuring quality work. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with such a diverse group of people. I have learned plenty about other cultures because of who I work with, and whom we deliver our service to. The hardest part of the job is the hours I had to keep. I haven't had a steady schedule on one shift in well over two years now. It's hard to work a schedule like that when you have a young family."
good,"- I learned a lot of customer service skills that will help me in the future"
good,"I was fairly compensated, loved my position and the team I worked with. We had an extremely talented group of technicians. We celebrated amazing guest service and the focus of our business everyday was entirely around the guest experience. They offered many options to grow as a leader and increase your knowledge in your field, in business acumen overall and many things you will take with you in further positions."
good,Great company and everyone was great to work around.  The benefits were nice because you get to experience a lot of great things.  I definitely learned a lot and walked away with some valuable work experience.  I do wish the discounts on hotels and shows were better for the employees.
good,"MGM is a good employer when paired well in reporting structure. The company offers promotions through work experience and education. They offer good benefits, work/life balance and community awareness."
good,"Varied activity and interaction with a myriad of different customers and guests in a typical work day. Not only hosting table game/gambling activities, but also interacting with guests on a personal level."
good,Love working for MGM but takes years to advance.. Even if you have everything sonority doesn't matter they can give it to someone under you. I started 6 months before the person they moved into bartender so I quit..
good,"I love working for MGM Resorts International. It is a great company that is always doing something special for the people who work for them. The benefits are great, HR is easy to deal with and is always helpful, and my coworkers are the best in the business. I love my job at MGM and would highly recommend working for this company."
good,"Management at Bellagio was unlike any management team I've ever been apart of. For the most part, we really care about the employees and doing a great job with our customers and the quality of our products and services. While I do agree being at the Bellagio should be the gold standard for customer service, the employees that were hired were not always the best."
good,The departments are a close knit groups. Lots of camaraderie among co-workers wanting to help each other. New hires receive good training. The pay and benefits are decent. There is a lot of opportunity to transfer to other department or other properties. Management and HR is not very good. There is no standard or accountability. Management doesn't like to deal with problems so they just don't and hope it works itself out. Employee concerns and frustrations are not taken seriously at all by HR or management.
good,"it was a simple and fun summer job, i love lifeguarding and learnt a lot. Would definitely consider working there again in the near future. greta summer job"
good,"I truly enjoyed the fact that even though everyone was always really busy and hard working, they would try to make fun activities and volunteer projects to ensure that people are also de-stressing and having a good time."
good,"Benefits are great, and my coworkers were amazing and productive. I would say Management is the area that’s lacking. We have managers/supv who don’t know what to do and have no initiative to find out answers asked by the team. It’s frustrating to say the least."
good,"With 80K + employees, the job/transfer availability is large. The company definitely promotes within. There are your normal office politics, especially in the corporate office environment. Overall, there is a lot of opportunity within the company. Although the pay is slightly less than competing companies pay, the experience available and opportunity for growth makes up for it."
good,..MGM offered a diverse work environment . Insurance rates were the best in the industry for the 18 years that I worked for them. Upper managment had minimum diversity
good,"Easy going Management, they try to create a laid back environment for the dealers. The company as a whole drives guest experience as a priority. The difficult part of the job is always working weekends and dealing with drunk players and all the smoke at times."
good,The company was organized but advancement was limited.  They did some good work with training but it didn't go much further than that or management training was started and then cancelled mid training.
good,MGM Gaming Resorts was a great place to work.  My co-workers where very friendly and were willing to work side by side with you.  Advancement was difficult due to co-workers staying with the company for years.
good,Focused on strategy and improvement. Extreme concern on shareholder value and stock price.Typically recognizes talent and rewards accordingly. Very political.
good,"able to meet like minded employees. once you understood the job it was easy. Most often managers had your back. stressful days were doable because the large staff/ Overall experience good, getting days off were honored"
good,The company is constantly keeping up to date and in touch with society’s “status-quo”. Overall the company as a whole has a reputable commitment to CSR and Diversity and Inclusion.
good,"By far the most enjoyable place I've worked.  Always busy, everyone friendly and fun. The employee dining room is awesome. The property is beautifully maintained and clean. Going to work wasnt a downer, never minded going. Like I mentioned, everyone is like family there, some days good others bad, but just growing pains....miss it..."
good,It was a fast paced enviorment.  I learned to work with various types of people from line workers to top of management.  How to conduct yourself in difficult situations and what resources to use.  Managing your time and balancing the needs of the business.  t=The hardest part was merging the different casinos to one culture.  Made lifetime friends and built my foundation for the future jobs.
good,"Good company"
good,great place to stay great good fast paced worked as a third party company last  summer and was way to hot I got paid very little but but good experience to have
good,I enjoyed my experience that I had at MGM. I learned a lot. I learned that patience is very important. Being a team member and being productive was always a must in order to have a successful work day with co workers.
good,It was a great place to work at. Hours were a bit demanding for a family life. Management is very friendly but company was understaffed at the time which required more demand on the part-time workers without the ability to attain benefits due to the work hours per week threshold.
good,I would recommend this company as a whole. Overall as a company MGM Resorts International cares and takes care of it's team members. There are however pros and cons to any job.
good,"Fun place to work at and good benefits. Fast pace call center environment where agent are are required to adhere to policies and procedures."
good,"Productive and a fun workplace place, withs a lot of friends and guest to talk with while doing your job. I get to take guest to new areas of the hotel and meet new people every day"
good,"Exciting, change every day , good training classes, meeting people from all over the world. Like all big companies same problems, little fish in a big fish bowl."
good,MGM Grand is a good place to work. The pay is good and there are many different opportunities. Working inside the Cage you meet a lot of different people and you have a lot of guest experience.
good,There have an exprience managment.becsuse there have good and exprience captain.very good behaviour in flour and kitchen stuff.but superviser is very angry.
good,I enjoyed having the personal responsibility for the completion of my duties. You are assigned an area and have an allotted time to complete the task.
good,Great place to work and an amazing company to be involved with. Work was long hours but fun at the same time. Lots of unique and fun events to be included and involved with.
good,"Pay for front desk is decent, job can get stressful if the hotel guests chose to make it that way for you. It can also get repetitive and boring after a while. Paid 1 hour lunch is a plus as well."
good,"East job to do, really fun "
good,Luego de estar en la empresa me siento más desvalorado. Menos persona que antes aunque con vehículo. Aprendí a conducir motocicleta.
good,"Fun and exciting, room for advancement, work stability great benefits. The hardest part of the job is the work flow sometimes, meeting and greeting the different customers offers an exciting atmosphere."
good,"No comments to provide at this time for this employer other than the executive Director and HR team was very professional, answered all questions."
good,"Answered the phone and kept detailed records, created schedules, coordinated with other departments - tons of corporate structure, slow to get things done, slow to grow"
good,"The work environment is professional but there is room to grow. I've learned a better way to clean the rooms. The hardest part of the job is not having enough time to clean some of the rooms, depending on the condition the room is left in by guests. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the guests themselves. Great place to work."
good,MGM Resorts is a great company to work for.  Upper Management is always supportive regarding employee growth.  Benefits are really good.
good,During my time at Luxor working in Guest  Relations a typical day at work was reviewing and responding to surveys from guests regarding their stay. If there were any negative experiences we would reach out to them and offer them an upgrade upon their return. All the surveys were tracked in a system that rated our customer service. The goal was to improve the score and to close the gaps where needed.
good,"A typical day at work would be with consistent flow with incoming and outgoing guest. I learned to be patient with guest and make sure that they're well taken care of while staying or visiting our hotel. Management does their best to make sure employees and guest are well taken care of especially when it comes to any problems that anyone may have. My co-workers are easy to work with and we all get along just fine with no conflict. The hardest part of the job is trying to keep busy even on slow days and being aware of vehicles that we park and pull, making sure we don't damage them. The most enjoyable part of the job is being active, you get to interact with guest and get a workout in between because our job consists of a lot of running."
good,Good place to work. Cool hours and you don't have to worry about uniforms.
good,"Pretty good Company, "
good,I loved my coworkers. It made work a lot easier. Listen to your leads and everything will get done easily.
good,enjoed my time working there but the job was being diminished
good,For the most part of the time its steady work. Not really motivating managers to help build a career.
good,I typically welcome all guest as an ambassador make sure guest and property is safe. i interact with all kinds of guest from all over the world and share experiences. I learned how to handle various situations and how to deescalate certain situations. the best part is making guest smile and making them feel comfortable as if they are at home. My coworkers and i stay on same page as to what our job description is and get the job done. Management oversees that everything is following accordingly in a way they are not taking away from the jobs excitement.
good,"Dealt 4 casino games.  Could become difficult while dealing with customers who always wanted to win. "
good,A company with great opportunities and always on the edge of change and innovation.
good,Fun and resourceful work place. Awesome trainig in customer service aspect.
good,In the beginning things seem new and exciting until you begin to recognize that you deal with some of the same people day after day in which they start to become mean and miserable. If you aren't good at dealing with the public then this definitley is NOT the place to work for you. If you are fairly sociable and able to deal with people from different cultures and many walks of life it is a decent job. You get to meet and deal with lots of people from many places and different walks of life. My only dislike about the place is dealing with the cigar and cigarette smoking. Being a non smoker makes that the difficult part for me.
good,"I only have Station Casinos to compare this MGM property to, however it was better in every way. Superior benefits, food, pay, and culture."
good,"Overall, you were an ambassador for the Company using customer service skills, daily operations and special events  You got to meet many people from diverse cultural backgrounds, and how to assist them in very positive memorable ways to make them want to return and recommend to other prospective customers.  The Company believed in sustainability, diversity, and encouraging cultural planning and innovation.  The hardest part of the job is a decision you or someone else made that could adversely affect a customer or employee. Meeting new people from all different cultures and learning about them."
good,A typical day at work is putting dirty linen to wash and dry and to cover other employees position. management is good. No hard part of the job. the workplace culture is diverse no discrimmination.
good,Allowed interns to network with top executives. This hospitality internship program allowed interns to get a hands on experience with the Hospitality industry.
good,Company committed to employees development and growth. Departments are very committed to help each other and see themselves as a single team. Recommend working with company.
good,There were many opportunities for advancements within the company and there was a heavy influence for learning and developing one's own skills within the workplace.
good,Large Casino Employer In Nevada. Job Security. Flexible Schedules. Average Pay Increase.Good company benefits.transfer opportunities.solid managers.good team environment
good,A typical day in VIP Services Department at MGM Grand Detroit consist of assisting casino guest with their player status and promotional offers. Overall good place to work.
good,"Interesting place to work. Accommodating managers and overall good environment. Somewhat high expectations, but not out of reach. Good place to build a nice professional reputation."
good,This workplace was very lovable. I enjoyed the fast pace and making sure the customers had everything they wanted and made sure that if it  was anything  that the consumers wanted they had it.
good,greatest crew on the strip but just couldn't balance work/life so I walked away! And it seems as tho I walked away at the right time considering the recent layoiffs
good,"I enjoyed working with my team at the beginning however management would start a suggestion box but wouldn't do anything about any staff suggestions. Leads either didnt care or were allowed to talk to us however they wanted because they were higher in management. Also alot of Favoritism one lead moved from being a pool food runner to lifeguard lead mostly from flirting with the supervisor everyday all summer. Same lead was a 22 year old girl just transfered as lead and was allowed to belittle and name call her ""staff"" lifeguards names which is unnecessary  when in that position.  Main  issue with management is they were great people but they didnt have a strict structure when working with staff who were mostly teenagers in high school. They wouldnt enforce rules but would get mad when lifeguards do. Would recommend lifeguarding if under the age of 22."
good,MGM is a great company to work for that really cares about their employees. There are many opportunities to move up on the company and many chances to learn new things.
good,Typical workday starts with analyzing incoming service calls for the workday. Paper work for the previous day is double checked and necessary part and supply orders are made. Service calls are the performed with the most urgent calls and customers taking precedence. Supplies are then delivered to individual customers. The remaining part of the day is to visit customers and check on their status as well as taking additional service calls as they are arrive.
good,"A great brand to learn and grow. Many opportunities for advancement in various departments. "
good,other than employees that spoke different languages in the work place it was a great place to work. I felt it was inappropriate and rude for others to speak different languages in an English speaking environment where not everyone could understand.
good,I worked there for 14 years or more so when I started I was a retail sales associate then changed to the spa at New York New York there I went from a Receptionist to a attendant and ended up working both everyday. Then I went to Luxor which is also owned by MGM Resorts International. There I worked as a Lead Cashier. Working at those places helped me learn how to talk and work with people. how to take care of customers and just work with a smile.
good,"MGM Resorts as an organization has many positives, benefits and growth opportunities. The only area that is a concern, which could also be a positive, is size"
good,MGM is a great company overall. I have learned a lot from working there. The work culture is very inviting and they treat their employee's very well and compensate greatly too.
good,Excellent environment to learn develop. Great management from the top down. Excellent possibilities to grow and learn. The company makes big efforts develop the culture of the company
good,MGM sets the standards on how to treat employees well and professionalism but some of the management has issues. From sexism to racism there were a lot of unprofessionalism events going on at MGM  Grand. The unions are slacking but the job was fun.
good,"Can be a really fun place to work. Some of the departments are great with great people and some are just not so it really depends where you work but for the most part, it is a great place to work."
good,Although MGM may be lacking in the management area the work environments great there are a lot of great people and me and me co workers work well together
good,great company and coworkers must be flexible.  i had awesome management that were easy to talk to.  i enjoyed the busy season and would have love to been able to cross train
good,"I have been a part of the Luxor family for quite sometime. My Department handles with everyday day to day ordeals. A typical day at my Department is when we try solve everyone's problems both, employees, co workers and guests, there is nothing Luxor Security can fix. I have learned to be more patient from my experience in this Department. Management here has been more than helpful with me, especially during my Leave of Absence due to medical and when it comes to my family, especially my children. Workplace culture in my Department is adaptable to any situation. We work hard we play hard. The hardest part of the job sometimes could be dealing with a difficult guest and the most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I can count on my fellow officers and that we all can go home safely to our families. We are all family."
good,"A really fun company to work for for the most part. At one point while i was working for the company, new management came in and everything started to go downhill in our department but the company as a whole is a great place to work."
good,"Productive fast paste, fun working experience, great work culture, most enjoyable part of job is being able to watch sports while working. hardest part of the job is when rush hour hits and we get slammed."
good,"My day starts off with plenty of emails. I talk to my manager about company updates. Regular training regarding my job and management training. I manage 7 supervisors and 135 employees. The hardest part of my job Is maintaining my communication with all employees, watching them as they work on the floor and making sure that I communicate with all Chefs and Managers maintaining the cleanest of the building. Most best part of my job is having a awesome boss. Making sure that every job gets done before the night is over."
good,Always busy which is good.  Can move from store to store getting  a variety in the work.  Learned customer relation skills with a large variety of customers and backgrounds.
good,"Working in luxury sales at the MGM Grand National Harbor location in Oxon Hill, Maryland was an immensely interesting, exciting, and unique experience."
good,Overall good experience but the hours and days off where not good. On the Weekend you are dealing with half drunken. Sometimes high patrons with very foul language as Smokers Everywhere and a very  diverse group of customers that sometimes speak no English.
good,"I would recommend mgm a great place to work. Good health benefits, free meals. They are there to help if need be. It's some really good people that works for Mgm."

good,I have worked for MGM for over 10 years.  Overall its a great place to work at.  Offers lots of training and diversity. The cons would be that it doesn't have great competitive salaries or a clear path for advancement.
good,"It was a good experience, looks good on your resume, learned a lot, free lunch was ok but it wasn't that good, I didn't like that I had to work the weekends and the holidays sometimes midnights but the pay was good and the benefits too"
good,"A typical day at work for me means a ten hour shift in the hot sun with   a very ""Las Vegas"" vibe around me. My coworkers definitely make  or break the outcome of my day. I love working with the other lifeguards, they will make the day fun and easy while keeping a professional mindset. My managers on the other hand, they can make it difficult to work by adding lots of unneeded stress and acting very unorganized and un professional. But I  will always keep a good attitude and continue to work hard through the pressure. My favorite part about my job is being able to  keep people safe and healthy all while having fun."
good,"I worked in the largest hotel in America with over 5000 rooms. As a Front Desk Manager, it was my responsibility to: manage the room inventory, supervisor the front desk agents, resolve guest issues/concerns, communicate with multiple departments, pre-shift team members with pertinent information, and complete special projects as assigned by upper management. "
good,This is a really awesome company with a lot of good benefits. Relatively easy to communicate with management. Somewhat accommodating.

good,I had great managers and it was a nice place to work and I learned a lot.As long as I did my job no one bothered me. The hardest part bout my job was making permanent that took 4 years
good,"I enjoy my time here, in and of it's self it's not a bad job. The co-workers and management are nice, it's a beautiful place. But the guests taking out bad days and the like on you just for simply asking a few questions is not the best enviroment for most."
good,"Create positions/job descriptions"
good,"This was a great place to work, the people were great and I enjoyed meeting people from all over the world.  It has taught me to be very independent in getting things done, because what i feel is great customer service isn't someone elses definition of great customer service.  But in doing so my managers recognize my hard work."
good,"Excellent Customer Service skills Clean Store"
good,A typical day at work was satisfying my customers. I learned to my my job easy and happy faces. I worked well with management and co-workers. The hardest part of my job was dealing with angry customers but the easiest part was making them smile again.
good,"we were on the phones for 7 hours, no time limit, we learned about new players cards which we were to answer because we were going to be able to use them for rooms, resturants, shows. We could talk only if there were no calls. we were not aloud food on the floor we could have water or other drinks as long as we had lids on them. we were paid an extra $6 a day for food because we were off property. The hardest part was not having lunch with someone. I loved the people I worked with that was my place for the great gossip. We were all learning to be a call center. We also made commission on upsales to hotel rooms. We also meet a lot of show people like Terry Fator who won on the 2nd season of Who's Got Tallent. I also got to see the hotels and be able to stay at the Hotels for free."
good,fun & fast paced workplace. Hotel has flaws that the Mandalay company refused to fix but now it's MGM so I'm not sure.
good,"A typical workday was writing creative proposal, working with a team of artists to design custom events, supervising event installs, and sometimes attending events to ensure everything ran smoothly. The hardest part of the job was coming up with a new Elvis theme party design, when I had already designed 6, but at the same time, that was an exciting challenge...to dream up a new look for something that had been done over and over again."
good,"The Beau really is a great place to work. President and COO George Corchis is always approachable, and one of most impressive and down to earth bosses I've ever encountered. His message of positivity and family is truly genuine and very respectable."
good,I worked 7am to 3pm which worked out great with 2 young children in school. I learned so much about accounting and auditing in my job and loved that we stayed so busy. Our manager was great; she had an open-door policy and was very understanding to everyone's specific needs. My co-workers were the best! We all became the best of friends and still get together even now. The hardest part of the job was leaving...being laid off. It was so shocking and we were all so disappointed. The most enjoyable part would have to be the friendships we all made and just going to work everyday knowing you had lots to do.

A typical day included leading a team while managing an area of the slot floor including the high volume high limit slot room and the M-Life players club. Unique to MGM Grand LV is it is all things to all people meaning there are penny slots to a max bet slot of $5,000/spin and everything in-between on the slot floor. "
good,"I learned much about customer service while working at the MGM.  I made great friends and the management was great.  Unfortunately, the towers were hit in 2001 and the majority of the staff was laid off due to lack of business, otherwise I'd still be happily working at the MGM."

good,MGM was a great company to work for I took an on call position and learned a lot. Unfortunately at the time the department I was in did not have any full time positions and needed a minimum 40 hour work weeks to support my family/household.
good,MGM grand resort is a very nice place to work I love working at Tap that sports bar ..I  am One of the hostess team there I  have been here for 18 years so I am considered the lead hostess because I have more knowledge than the other House team.

I got done with my training back in November and im on call (which is what I expected to start off with) but the fact that ive only worked 4 days since, is what really upsets me. I honestly expected more from them and if I would have know I wasn't going to get any hours i wouldn't be here writing this review."

good,"My typical day working in the Executive Office at MGM could be described as exciting. Being a receptionist and back up executive assistant afforded me the ability to work with some amazing executives. Also while working at the MGM, I was also able to work in the Grand Garden Arena. Because of the different budgets, I would work in the Arena as a second job. The hardest part of the job was leaving after 9-11."

In the 11 years I was a host, I learned how to effectively work with a diverse group of guests, team members, management and business partners.  The work culture was dynamic due to the training you received.  The hardest part of my job was getting to work.  My shift started at 8 am and I typically arrived at 7:30 am.  This alowed me to wind down from the 20 minuet drive to work.  The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the various guests visiting the property and the internal and external guests requesting assistance."

good,You work 8 hour shifts with an hour paid lunch. So its basically a 7 hour shift. There are 3 different shifts you can work. ITs a good place to work.
good,A typical day at work was a lot of fun.  We would start off with pre-shift meeting before going onto the floor. My supervisor would discuss our beverage scores with us My co-workers were very easy to work with. The hardest part of the job was to be around guests that were intoxicated. The most enjoyable part of the job was to interact with the guests and finding out where they lived and what they thought about our casino.
good,I was with MGM mirage for 20 yrs loved the company! Typical day was on the phone and you could not place yourself on hold.
good,"good benefits,good managements,get to more about hotel housekeeping"
good,MGM Resorts is big on retaining and training it's employees.
good,"Great company to work for. "
good,"It was a fast paced job that was dynamic, constantly changing and getting new responsibilities sometimes daily.  There was never a dull moment.  You were on the phone from the minute you logged on until you logged off.  Managers worked with you closely and you know where you stand.  You did get a choice of free buffet each day or a $7 meal allowance.  It was difficult to get vacations, many times they were blacked out."
good,This was a very nice place to work. The company had room for advancement and hired from within.
good,A typical day at work would be when a guest is never satisfied. Are guest is are first impression and last impression. The guest could have a complaint about they have not seen a waitress all day. Yet a waitress has came by them and try to serve them a beverage but they still have complaints. What I learned is how to do the best that I can at my job and to please the guest. My coworkers we are team players and we try to do the most that we can to help each other out. As for Management they do their work an  try to help us by all means. The hardest part of the job  is when you have a lot of guest and you try to make sure that you can take care of them because they are steady coming and going. The most enjoyable part of day when your not stress and everyone is happy and your also seeing famous people.
good,"Worked within fast-pace busy office answering phones, scheduling appointments using Microsoft Outlook to schedule meetings with future customers, vendors and internal department personnel.  Assured weekly deadlines were met using Excel macros shortcut  applications for accuracy and"

The most enjoyable part was making the guest happy...."
good,"• Responsible for receiving, delivering and transferring of all merchandise to and from the receiving warehouse. "
good,"Working for several MGM Properties on the Las Vegas Strip, I have developed an homage to this company.  MGM has great management of many employees, sometimes it is hard to recognize each and every employee because it employs so many great employees."
good,"Challenging enviornment, time management and multitasking are essential to be successful at MGM Grand."
good,Low stress level and management made an effort to make it a pleasant work environment.
good,"Good place to work, lots of room for advancement, good benefits."
good,"I learned to think on my feet and make quick reasonable decisions in a fast paced-24/7 environment. I had authority (comping privileges) to make things right for guests that encountered problems. Always the possibility to meet or encounter ""celebrity"" guests. There was a great team of employees throughout the property that would be there to assist one another at any time! Luxor Hotel/Casino is built like a pyramid, it is a very unique building to go to work in everyday!"
good,Its a very nice experienced were you worked hand in hand with fellow employees in order to satisfy
good,"Work with entire employees with insurance issues,answering all questions and answers over the phone, and communicating well with fellow workers."
good,On average the days are always great being able to satisfy customers with their wants. Staff was always great!
good,I had the best working environment and experience I could have had for the last 10 years. I only wish it hadn't ended like it did. I really felt like we gave the company everything we had and the outsourcing felt wrong. I learned many things along the way and had some great trips and met great people. Casinos are a fast moving industry and the pace is break-neck.
good,Its A great place to learn Customer Service and working in a fast pace environment.
good,• Greeting and registering guest
good,My job as kitchen Steward  cleaning of pots and  pans cleaning  are of work. Working great with other team work. It Ws a. Nice experience  working at MGM Springfield
good,I’m very blessed with the position I currently have. I have worked my way up the company and I’ve earned everything that has been given to me from the company.
good,I work 8 hours shifts and average 4-5 massages per day. Just recently They changed their policy and have allowed me to do facials when needed. I think that sometimes it is difficult to work 40 per week doing massage. The amount of treatments can be taxing on ones body. I have a full time postion with great benefits!
good,I loved working here.  Hands down a great place to work.  Excellent pay. Wonderful atmosphere. Loss this job because position was eliminated.   Still would recommend to anyone.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of a lot of computer work and printing info. I've learned new computer skills, as well as how to work closely with management. Workplace was always exciting and with great welcoming employees from all departments. Hardest part on the job was trying to redirect clients to the right department with such a big place, overall the work was pretty exciting we outstanding clients from all over the place."
good,"I was accepted into the Management Associate Program. It was such an amazing experience, and you are treated well! After you graduate though, be prepared to stress over actually finding a job. When the program is suppose to guarantee you a job in the field you studied all year long. It's not fair to someone like me who fell in love with my job and suddenly had it snatched away once I graduated, and I was placed in a call center because that is really all they had. My bosses were great though and very supportive. MGM has a lot of restructuring they need to do before continuing the HIP/MAP programs."
good,I loved the environment and the employees. The only thing is the work life balance with the company. They treat you as a number and don't consider your hard work an family needs as well as the company needs.
good,MGM has some great perks to help with compensation however Vegas is very expensive so the perks don’t pay the bills.  They do like to promote from within usually and most Managers are willing to help you achieve your goals.  It’s a big company but it is a family atmosphere.
good,This company is a good place to work. Management treated you like they actually care. Benefits we're really good and had add ons thru the company. COO is really nice and trys to take the time to check in on the employees to insure they are ok and happy.
good,Its a nice play to grow professionally and as a person a lot of opportuity union jobs and different departments customer service is their priority overall a nice work environment.

good,Overall I loved working for MGM. The people there were like family. Management in some areas could definitely be improved but overall a great company to work for.
good,MGM is a great place to work. It has unlimited opportunities for growth within the company.  Working with the public is fun & adventurous from day to day.
good,"This company has given me the training and development needed to be the effective leader that I am today. Sure, there are hiccups, but I have been blessed with the growth opportunities presented to me."
good,Overall a great company to work for I enjoyed the guests and liked enhancing the guests experience the hours we're amiable the employees were amiable the managers were amiable the benefits for very good
good,"Loved working there. I enjoyed the employees as well as the guests. However, there was a lot of standing on your feet. A lot of dealing with intoxicated guests.  Great company to work for."
good,MGM Resorts International is a top company in the tourism and entertainment industry. The people were easy to get along with and aren't afraid to teach and help you. There is flexibility to move to different positions within the company whether at property or corporate.
good,"At times, my job was very stressful and even dangerous. But, I enjoyed my job most days. I received very good benefits and utilized them in my health care. I would still work there had relocating back home not been an option. I was hoping one day for management level employment. I hope to be able to utilize my skill set to further my career when relocating to Texas."
good,A good company if you are willing to bust your butt. I never had  a dull moment and would recommend them to anyone. If I had not been forced to move away I would still be there.
good,"This is a very good place to work, but due to VISA extension issues, I have to leave this company. I am looking for opportunity in Canada. I worked as Sr. Database Administrator here on Microsoft SQL server."
good,"Often times it takes a team to get the job done! It takes upper management all the way done to your porters to make it all work to provide the best guest service! But the best part of the bar I work in is that if one person falls short there is always someone there to pick up the slack and help the guest! This kind of teamwork, in my opinion, is what  MGM international resorts has always done right! They have always hired quality people that can do a great job!"
good,"Great company, good pay and it teaches you life long lessons"
good,"Exciting workplace as a typical day is never typical.  Always new projects to investigate, implement and support.  Management is fair and understanding when issues arise.  Co-workers are always willing to help each other to ensure project are successful and on time.  Most difficult part of the job can occur on a large project where many departments are involved - it can be challenging to keep everyone on point and focused on timelines and deliverables. The best part of the job has to be the people working here.  Most are hard-working, pleasant and eager to provide the best service possible."
good,La calidad humana del personal y de la patronal son excelentes
good,"Meeting with people around the world is an experience. You learn some language and the people can be wonderful. Helping out guest with information about Las Vegas brings a smile to their face. The workplace always has a surprise, you'll never know how the day will be."
good,"A typical workday consists of us having a preshift meeting to let us know whats going on and how busy we are.Then grab an apron and go to my station. I then clean  and stock my station. Then I work until my break. After lunch I continue working until we close the station I'm in. After my station is closed I break it down and go help some one in another station."

good,"daily we are maintaining cash transaction from day to day and many more work i learning like prepare flash report and day book, etc.."
good,"Walking assigned slot area-paying jackpots, clearing slot jams, ensuring guest safety by looking over assigned area."
good,"A typical day working as a black jack dealer at MGM consists of a lot of ridicule and disrespect from the guests. I would say this was one of the hardest things to adapt to while working this job. The amount of liquor served linked with the amount of money being lost births a very hostile environment and having thick skin is a must. On the other hand, my coworkers are a joy to be around as well as my floor managers. The company as a whole is a great company to work for in which they offer great benefits to the full time employees and the pay is great."
good,"The most enjoyable position, great team work, great management, where I learned to be part of group and had my supervisor support."
good,"Nice atmosphere to work in. Great breakroom with free fresh fruit, cereal and soft drinks. Large call center, but surprisingly quiet."
good,The injoyable part is cooking and friends.Preparing your food for the menu.I enjoy coworker that make enjoyable. Very diffucult but we can along and get the job done. I have to get along and put togeter a great meal.
good,simple and fun. they treated me right as well as listened to everything i had to say both positive and negative. they work with you to help solve you're problem.
good,I have been employed with this company for over three years and its not bad at all. Its rough to move up the coperate latter when they offer new games and your out on medical leave.
good,We are structure and organized in our tasks. We plan our days in advance when we know the next project. We give good customer service. We go beyond our call of duty and never say no to our customers. If there is a problem we resolve the situation with tactfullness. We want to leave our customers with a smile and satisfied with our services.

good,"Management is a hit and miss. But, overall i love my job. Its fun and exciting. "
good,A very diverse company. The wages and benefits are great. I really enjoyed working there because of the nice people I worked with everyday. The company values its employees.
good,Security is a great department to learn fast and keep one busy. Not one day is like the other. Various shifts have different responsibilities and each shift has its own excitement. Security with MGMRI is a great place for someone to begin the journey with the MGMRI family.
good,"Would come in and we would all gather around to do stretches before we begin work and at the same time management would let us know what they need for the venue and what they expect our work ethic to look like. Afterwards we were broken into teams with different responsibilities such as Loading/unloading,  Ligthting and Sound."
good,"Everyone was very helpful and professional! I learned different areas of the casino I never knew about, this was the first time I have worked in a Casino atmosphere."
good,"A typical day was sitting at my desk, preparing contracts, recaps, etc for the sales manager. It also consisted of communcating with clients. The atmosphere was relaxed, but professional. Overall, I really enjoyed my job. My department didn't have a ton of growth, however, so I needed to branch out."
good,"Be flexible , a people person and aspire to learn more and one can go very far within this company. Excellent pay for the work required. Aside the smoke, I love my job!"
good,"Company was a lot of fun to work for. Everyday was different at the pool. The only reason why I left was there was no room for moving up, and I needed something more."
good,"MGM in general is a great company to work for. The benefits are good, gets better as you climb the ladder. Management per property and department will vary. The CEO and the Senior Executives have made drastic changes to ensure that the company is on the forefront of the entertainment industry. Not one bad thing to say about the company or a experience."
good,I worked with wonderful leaders in the corporate legal department. They were respectful and had high expectations with high rewards for exceptional work.
good,Great work environment and steady paced. Good pay and benefits. Long hours but it was fun. good work team and the company has a strong brand recognition.
good,A typical day is starting the day off with pre-shifting all the new information that came out from the day before.  Giving any information of new events going on property. The diversity of the Luxor Staff is AMAZING they have people from all walks of life and embrace all the differences they bring to the table.  Sometimes the hardest part of working in this environment is dealing with other employees.  The most enjoyable part of working at the Luxor is the family bound you get from being there.  The minute you walk through the doors you are EMBRACED with smiles and warmth.
good,"Overall a good place to work for: Stable, good benefits, friendly work environment, and lots of opportunities to move up in the company.  Most of people I work with are very friendly and respectful. I enjoy working with each one of them."
good,"First experience to work in the Gaming Industry.  The Company treats it's employees like Family.  Management was Outstanding, Professional and Giving.  Over all a Great Place to work. Be aware Las Vegas is a 24 by 7 Party atmosphere and you need to be responsible and Grounded to work in such an environment."
good,"I worked at MGM 24 years ago, but it was a good job with great pay and benefits. I was a guest room floor supervisor. I checked cleanliness of rooms after the maids were done cleaning them. I helped clean rooms if the maids were falling behind. The hardest part of the job was that it was very fast pasted and stressful, the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting people from every part of the world."
good,The cultureis so rich at MGM. There are people from all over the world working there. It is a great experience. Competative pay makes it worth getting up and going to work.
good,All in all a nice place to work. The company offers great benefits and there is chance for growth if your willing to work toward it. Senior Management is excellent.
good,"Making sure employees were in on time "
good,"I love Circus Circus sales department for family-like atmosphere. The management is great. The benefits are amazing, plus the employee perks such as discounted tickets to the shows. The cons - it`s hard to move up in the company coming from Circus Circus. You get an hour of paid lunch, and of course there is an EDR."
good,"Enjoyable pool work environment with personable management. Great summer job in Las Vegas, but required much endurance to withstand 8 hour shifts in 120 degree summer days while carrying 20 pound trays of drinks and beer buckets."
good,"MGM is a great company to work for and provides excellent benefits to employees. However, because the property is union is does not give management the right to manage effectively. This becomes problematic because employees seem to run all over management, and management seems afraid to reprimand employees for bad behavior due to the union stepping in and backing the employees. Overall, the way management is treated by employees becomes disheartening and does not encourage lower line employees to want to promote themselves to management in the future."
good,Enjoyed working with the Resort to achieve creating new special events for guests; Management was acceptable and flexible when presenting them with new ideas for enhancements.  Staff very friendly and willing to learn new ways to improve customer service.
good,Good people to work with and great co workers. Bellagio VP of security is an amazing person. Along with most of management.

good,It was a great experience.  It had its ups and downs but I like the different cultures from different places that worked there and meeting new people. It was a fun and friendly  environment to work in and learning new things was great. The union was great and the benefits were good.

good,I felt the management team was great as well as my co-worker that the most I like about my last employer. Most what I enjoy about my job is customer service.
good,"My job as a Lifeguard/Pool Attendant at MGM was great. I loved coming to work everyday and working to accommodate guests every need. As a Lifeguard I would be on stand and supervise the water at all times, and clean the entire pool deck to picking up towels and trash. As a pool attendant I was responsible for handing out towels to guests, setting them up in their chairs, and selling sunscreen, apparel, and snacks to the guests."
good,"Dealing with the public, especially in the hospitality and casino industries can be taxing at best. MGM really goes the extra mile to help their employees to lead a full life inside and outside of work. "
good,"help all type of customers with their money transactions, help them with any kind of information they may need. Supervising other co-workers and help them to authorize high cash transactions. make daily reports and email them to the general manager and casino controller."

good,Great place to work. So many opportunities. Meet tons of celebrity's.  Love my workmates. We were a true team. Everyone helps and makes sure we are safe.
good,They treated you like an assembly line would be ran. It’s a hard company to get ahead in. Hard work doesn’t pay off. Seems like the harder you work then more they expect it without proper compensation either. Those that slacked off however were promoted quickly. That should have been the other way around. I worked extremely hard but no matter how hard I tried I was never promoted.
good,"A typical day at work was good because you could make tons of money. Management was OK, but they are never on your side. TIPS was great. Social life not so great."
good,I was really excited to work for the company and enjoyed the time I was there. I was laid off due to MGM resorts international wanting to make cuts to increase their profits.
good,"I am not work based on salary, my position is based on hourly performances. "
good,"I loved Borgata and the guest. But the Manager had favorites and is on an authority high. Sad.....sees things his way not fair. Just not good. One Ordertaker said when he walks into the room he sucks the air out..She was spot on... I would still be working there if he just had a little compassion. I was upset due to anniversary of the death of my Aunt that got killed and when I walked in they told me I had to do 16 hrs. I was floored because they did not split the 8 hr OT with the girl there and myself, they just gave it all to me. Which I felt was wrong. Too much friends and family type of atmosphere also and it was getting worse and worse by the minute. It was time..."
good,Its a beautiful thing when working at mgm when you get a chance to meet people from all over the world it is a really great experience thank you so much mgm
good,the job is good but I had to leave my position due to  wanting to return to school. They were unable to provide a part time position or change my schedule to work with my school schedule. The employees are good and work well together.
good,I worked in housekeeping which was very difficult at times. We were responsible for many rooms in a short period of time. The management really couldnt help which made the job more difficult than it had to be. The most enjoyable part of the job was the company gifts and all the food they offered us during break time.
good,I appreciate all the opportunities that were given to me at MGM Resorts International.they put you through an academy to make sure that you are the best officer that you can possibly be.

good,"They were kind of unprofessional during opening but overall okay. I got fired because I was pregnant and fainted from dehydration. They said it was because of the probation period, which I understand but believe it could have been handled differently."
good,"Good job when measuring the pay rate, pto, perks against the duties in corporate security. No real opportunity for high speed individuals with potential to elevate withing the department though.  If you are a retiree, or a younger guy with ZERO experience or skills and just wanna do your eight and skate...this may work for you."
good,"Understanding workplace culture and diversity, overcoming personal  obstacles and understanding the importance collaboration with the buying office and the managers as well as each property,  personal growth and teamwork within the department."

good,I would work for MGM Resorts International again if given the opportunity. The workplace culture was enjoyable and management was decent. The number of working hours could have been better but overall I would recommend this company to others.
good,"Very friendly managers, caring and under standing! Best job I ever had. Will go back in a heart beat! Good money, work at your own pace! Workers from other departments are wonderful!"
good,Work would be dead one minute and super busy the next. The job itself was simple enough. I just got bored and would ask to leave early because of school. I would absolutely love to work as a Pit Clerk again at MGM Grand. The manager of the department was okay but my shift supervisor on swing shift was a dream. Some of my co-workers were a challenge to work with. Taking extra and extended breaks above the norm/what is allowed. Some of my co-workers were awesome. I was passed over for a full-time position which left a sour taste in my mouth but wasn't personal so I had to let that go.
good,"the pay is always reasonable. i was union so there were great benefits. they have an employee dining room, free food. breaks are paid. just an overall good place to work"

The hardest part is not feeling like your advancing fast enough.  The most enjoyable part of the job is coming to work."
good,"Loved the experience at the Bellagio.  Worked in F & B. Unfortunately differences in personalities forced me to resign.  It is very unfortunate that some places have ""clicks"" and not much can be done."
good,"A typical day at work consists of checking in and checking out guests. Everything is seniority-based which is great. If you stay with the union long enough, they match 401k and you get a great pension."
good,MGM resorts was a nice casino to work with a lot of great opportunities Were provided to you. The employees and work environment was always professional.

good,"The Luxor was the first casino I worked for in Vegas. I learned various skills at the Luxor. Also it taught me what other workers in the casino business are like. I meet guests from all over the world, as well as sold products that known internationally. The dress code and fellow employees were for the most part very professional in every department. The most enjoyable part of my job was putting on the uniform, feeling like your part of something enjoyable and magical for some people.

good,I work grave-yard shift and sometimes I am sleepy but I just restock some merchandise to refill and some things to clean. Usually very busy with either a convention in town or an event in the arena so I can have fun with the customers. I see my supervisor once or twice a night usually passing by to say hi because he or she is at the other store. And there is one or two other cashiers with me and one stock host I get along with them.

I was always smiling. I have not ever had a hard time at work. We all were like a family we would help each other out if anyone needed help."
good,"Going to work everyday at Luxor has been great. I love my job and all the people that I work with, Made lots of new friends. Their almost like family. My favorite part of my job is the diversity in the guests and people I work with, meeting all kinds of people from different cultures and backgrounds. The hardest part of my job is having to work with foreign guests and the language barriers, by taking time and breaking down the words I was able to make that guest happy and satisfied with the service I provided them."
good,I have learned some things about preparing food and cleaning different areas with proper chemicals. The hardest part of the job is when we are short of team members and it is a busy day. The most enjoyable part of the job is team work and helping other team members.

good,"Work was plentiful, many of the colleagues easy and great to work with, it had also its share of negativity and bad parts. I left because of the number of work hours. Always had at least 32 hours, however it could excess beyond 52 per week with those hours unbalanced for sleep or home time. Disappointed myself for leaving the job, however, I rarely got any sleep, cant do my job effectively without it."
good,"Open work environment, so it can get loud. "
good,"Working here has taught me many things, and has only broaden my work experience as a sales associate. There's interaction with customers and workers alike, The hardest part of the job was getting through the slow nights but it was still fun as you are never alone."
good,It's a great company to work for if you had the right management team in place what I learn people are not always what they appear to be so just go to any job you have and do your best it really it was the guest that would come to the business  that made my day you have all types of people and and that was great the hardest  part was the management but I can get along with every one because Im a people person at the end when you balance and didn't get any write up's and you know you did your best that's a reward in it's self .

good,Paid horribly but great atmosphere with lots of friendly supervisors and coworkers in the call center. They train very well and the customer service jobs
good,"MGM is a great company to work for and work with.  In an organization where more than 80,000 men and women are employed, MGM manages to make their employees feel like family.  Besides the company's mission, vision, and culture, it's the people of MGM that make it such an inspiring workplace.  If I could, I would love to continue working for the company, but at this time, having relocated to western New York, they're unable to support my employment any longer.  I will miss MGM dearly."

good,"My most beloved employment.. I left to pursue work downtown and to be part of the cultural scene that is developing. I would like to be part of a structured team once again, however. "
good,Working at Mandalay Bay was very rewarding on a daily basis. I met people from all over the world and their events were always spectacular. It was a great feeling to be part of it all.
good,Great company to work for just not a full time employee. Being apart of the Union has its pros and cons. Pro for the benifets and pay but the cons is that seniority and scheduling based on that and not job performance.
good,MGM resorts is an amazing company and treats their employees very well. Indeed.com required me to type a minimum of one hundred fifty characters.  End
good,"Great management, love the fast pace and would prefer more interaction with the clients. Mostly data entry and yet definite opportunities for advancement internally."
good,"Every day was mostly the same drill steady paced and keeping the peace.  Often we as security officer get a bad reputation because we were the first to respond to an issue. Normally issues are resolved without police involvement, but on the occasions we had to involve the police they were resolved quickly and professionally."
good,"Luxor was a good company to work for when I worked there in the '90s.  The benefits were good, the company had very good employee policies and management practices."

good,"I learned so much about myself because the team was patient enough to let me grow. I was a hard worker and no one in that entire plant will say otherwise. No air conditioning or heaters all year, and the workday started at 6 am. I think in the 3 years i was there i was late to work twice. I just naturally wanted to be reliable. It was hard work and i sweat gallons but it was totally worth it just because of the growth i got for myself. I wish i could've stayed longer and made it to management but moving prevented that. I learned to be more patient with my co workers, how to just do what was ask sometimes even if that wasn't the most productive way. They did create a position for me that they had never had and it was coordinator. Because of that decision, i was able to change so much that made our department a more productive and easier way to function. It was such a challenge because alot of retraining was involved and since i wasn't a manager, it was difficult. I made everyone angry with me at some point but it was worth it because of how much better we all came together to get the job done."
good,I worked for the MGM/Mirage corporation for over 25 years. What i have learned is thats its not where you work but who you work for. You have to believe in the product your selling and in the company otherwise what is the point? The spa at the MGM had some amazing people working there who are passionate and caring about there jobs. They are in the process of remodeling it and have made some great improvements.
good,MGM has the best culture I have had the opportunity to be involved with. They have amazing training and really focus on developing the staff to move up within the organization.

good,"I loved working for this company and the job was very stimulating and rewarding. I learned alot about people and food choices. My managers were hardworking but lacked the ability to be reached properly. My coworkers were pleasant and flexible. I worked with the wait staff constantly and the cleaning crews and assisted often. The hardest part of this job is to not get too comfortable with the guest as they make you feel like family, lots of times i would want to sit down to dine with them. the most enjoyable part of the job is the chance to meet so many different kinds of people and discuss the Vegas life. The location was unique and most of the guest who came in loved the experience. I was happy to be a part of the experience too."

good,"Working in MGM Grand was a good experience. Being a Pit Clerk the job went smoothly. There were times that it was so easy if it is slow and stressful when it was busy. My co-workers were so friendly not only the Pit Clerks but also the Pit Managers, Floor Supervisors as well as the dealers. The working environment for me was excellent. I was laid off that's why I was forced to leave the MGM GraGran.d because they cut down the number of Pit Clerks"
good,all coworkers are enjoyable and kind. management trusts and allows staff to do their jobs without hovering. fast paced environment. excellence is expected.

good,The work environment is fair. I think that working there is not a bad place to work if you need a job. I learned that if you want to advance in a career you need to know the right people.
good,MGM in general is a hospitality and gaming company but there are so many streams of opportunity and growth. I started as a line level employee in the hotel and 10 years later was in management in corporate finance.  There are so many stories like this for tenured employees.
good,Gostei muito de trabalhar  na empresa  fui muito produtivo para  minha vida  profissional  sou muito grato aos meus  colegas de trabalho  quis me  ajudaram muito dentro da empresa
good,Good Place to work and good benefits.  Always nice to meet new people.  Luxor is a beautiful casino and still has the Egyptian feel in some areas.  The history is great.
good,"advancement was available and attainable, coworkers were more like family at most properties, management was relaxed allowed individuality instead of robots"

good,"Great benefits for employees. Management believes in coaching and developing and assisting you in getting closer to your career goal.Life and work ratio was very well balanced and making vacation days was cut and dry and very easy to do. Working for MGM makes you feel like you're in the middle of it all. Great restaurants, clubs, shows and attractions."
good,"I personally enjoyed working at MGM, it is a good environment to start working in if you are interested in hospitality. Lots of chances to meet new people, which can lead to many other work opportunities."
good,"Of course like all jobs, there is favoritism. But as long as you do your job and stay out of the way, it is a great place to work. Great benefits and discounts included."
good,This was one of the best place I've ever worked!  I was a part of the opening team and management was not quite what I expected.  I definitely decided to switch from the meeting supplier side to the meeting planner side when I left this location.
good,"Overall great learning experience working at MGM international. "
good,"Great place to work, but hard to advance in management roles.  The interview process is slow and at times annoying to work around.  The interview itself is like none other you have been involved, I can promise you."

good,"This job is lots of fun, a great opportunity for college students or retirees looking to make extra money. Excellent benefits for full-time staff. The staff is great, almost like a family. The work load is light but can be mentally challenging."
good,Can not review while under contract. I can say that MGM is one of the largest gaming companies in the united states and owns a large part of the Las Vegas entertainment. I worked for a property in north Mississippi just south of Memphis. I loved working with everyone there.
good,"- Tranquilo."
good,"As a cash specialist you work in a team setting environment, open desks visible to everyone. There is the FSSC that contains many accounting/finance departments in the building. Employees are friendly, co-workers concentrated on their work. There is always events organized by MGM Resorts International and hosted on site. Good career/work balance."

Furthermore, I enjoyed sampling the free food for the restaurants I booked. I had the greatest benefits package. The people I worked with were people I looked up to and respected.

good,"Friendly co workers, great team concept, best management team, but I a little difficult to advance."
good,"Every day is something unexpected and although very challenging, it has been rewarding. Co-Workers are nice and there is a sense of respect amongst all employees with the diverse culture. The hardest part of the job would be the fact that we are under staffed but the Op's Committee still expects the property to be maintained in pristine condition. Multi-Tasking is essential. The best part of the job is interacting with the guests and making sure their stay is perfect. Also, I enjoy my co-workers and being able to work with them outside."

good,"I have the type of work experience, that even during my commute to work in the morning, I'm excited and happy to be joining my team for the day!  I have been giving the opportunity to be leader when our support staff was being reorganized.  I've not only learned the ins and outs of what the on-boarding experience is for an Employment specialist, but I've also been able to learn the inner workings of our Employee Tracking program.  The wealth of experiences I've gained here are many, and leadership encourages curiosity!"
good,"I enjoyed my job at MGM I was expecting so I left on good terms January 18,2019. I was never late m,didn’t mind picking up extra days and helping others when falling short ."

At the MGM, with me working closely with surveillance, I see and hear everything and that includes the good and bad things about the place.  For the most part, I hear a lot of good. We have a great crew at MGM Grand, with the fanatically happy crew that works in the Hotel Lobby to the ladies and their crazy guest stories that run the Housekeeping department.  The benefits are great, the pay is competitive, the food... leaves something to be desired,that's because of the health craze going on currently and them shoving brown rice down our throats... who even likes brown rice by choice?! but it's free, so that's good."
good,"Great job"
good,"A typical day on the job would be setting up the pool and making sure all chairs, pool watch stands, and the towel desk was ready for the day. once the pool opens we greet guests and answer any questions or doubts they might have.We have an hourly rotation switching between booth (greeting guests), desk (handing out towels), run ( walking around the pool cleaning the deck), and being on stand (being on duty watching the pool taking care of the guests). At the end of the night we clean  the whole pool area to b ready for next days set up."

good,"Incredible property, filled with daily challenges and opportunities. Amazing staff that is up for and challenge. Fast paced environment."
good,"The beau rivage is a pretty good place to work,it has its negative people there,but as long as you ignore them its really a good paying job,housekeeping there is not what people think,it's hard work like any job but easy to learn,after your training period the money you make is kinda on you and your speed(more rooms ,more $$) if you do well you can move up pretty quick usually.there's plenty room for advancement.I love meeting guest from all over and getting to know them to make them feel more welcomed"

good,"a typical day at work would be clocking in and clocking out and doing some side work to get our restaurant ready to go and then going to break with a beautiful lunch room with a free meal with anything you could imagine except no surf n turf  . I learned to work with different types of people but knowing we were there for all the same reasons. Made new friends and became family friends...I saw young people get married and start their own families,,I loved my job at MGM.. Now for the most part..Upper mgmt were good people . They did care..They even cared about our health and had a workout room set up for us. The hardest part of my job was if my guest was not happy. The best part of my job was the people I worked with who are now my lifelong friends. I miss my job at MGM"
good,"The environment was outdoors it was fun the people there were fun friendly and they were very respectful. I worked with a lot of kids that were in high school so there were a lot of energy a lot of people actually helping out and working together. While I worked there the company treated us as equals nobody was treated any different, nobody looked down at you. I don't have much bad to say about this job accept there were a lot of childish antics going on but I guess that's what happens when its majority of high school kids. Overall it was a fun workplace to be around but it would be better with more money."
good,This was a great company to work for that has went out of business. I enjoyed all the perks I received while employed by MGM. I would have made MGM my career for life had they not closed down.
good,"I love to work at the tournament of Kings show through MGM Resorts. They have a high company standard which allows everyone to be on top of their game. The pay is good, and though the job is physically demanding, it's very rewarding. The cast and crew I work with are fantastic, and more often than not, everyone is overly goofy and happy all while providing a safe working environment. "
good,"Call-center atmosphere. The managers and supervisors are approachable and friendly for the most part. There is a lot to learn and know about the company, but the trainers are very qualified and patient with new hires."
good,"Working at the Beau Rivage, was by far an experience. As and employee with my job description you have to be on your feet the whole shift, and you are non stop, in and out of the heat, in a very steady fast paced environment. People are people, you will always have that easy going day with very friendly, laid back guests, co workers, and managers, and then you will always have that day with everyone in some sort of mood at any workplace. You learn to be completely accurate with everything you do, you have to be alert and on point at all times.You must be very attentive, broad minded, calm, confident, consistent, energetic, and independent, everyday.

Everyday I learn how to deal with the new and different types of personalities, and issues that I come across, no day is ever alike, there is always something new, whether it'll be a new case or a new employee that I meet with. I work with a great core of managers that are dedicated to ensuring MGM Resorts provides a fair work environment. I work with an excellent group of co-workers and leaders. I feel I get the support I need in order to accomplish my different task thought out the day. The hardest part of my job is trying to please all employees when they bring issues to my attention, at times resolutions go their way and at times it does not, and that is the hardest challenge I encounter. What I enjoy the most is helping all employees regardless of their position with the company; I get a great feeling of satisfaction when employees understand and know that they are valued and their concerns matters to the company."
good,"I believe the only thing i would have done different was made sure that i had a stable way to get back and forth to work, the people were excellent, the management was excellent and the compensation was excellent!!"

I work seamlessly with every department on property, and some oof property to make sure every group that arrives moves along without a hitch."

good,"Large company, with a lot of employees. Provides good benefits and competitive pay."
good,"This is a fast moving business, you have to be open to change because the casino industry has to stay relevant for its guests.  So there is nothing typical about a day, you come to work with a plan and in an instant you must change direction to address an issue or something the business feels is more important."
good,Wonderful place of employment with great benefits and a team willing to coach and support you. I would recommend MGM Resorts International for someone interested in a career in hospitality or gaming.
good,I loved working as a security officer and had a wonder supervisory team and coworkers. the hardest part of the job was working grave shift. The best part was the other employees and guests.
good,Excellent Place to Work. Needs a Few Tweeked Management Level Adjustments. College Degrees should be recognized and Promoted.
good,"MGM Resorts is an amazing company to work for.  They value my opinion and make strides to enact my ideas (big and small).  Some changes in Management can alter the culture, however the teams always seem to take this as opportunity to grow.  Rarely do I go to work and not see smiling faces and happy workers in all departments."

The people where pretty nice we all got along it was like one big family. some of us still keep tab on each other to make sure where ok.

good,"As an Administrative Assistant my job duties changed from day to day.  I love the various changes in the daily routine.  I learned so much about the government filings that the casino does and about the taxes they pay.  I learned so much about computer programs, about being a credit card administrator for all of the departments at the casino.  My co-workers were all wonderful people that also worked and gave 100 % everyday.  The hardest part of the job, I can't think of anything right now.  The most enjoyable part of the job was to help everyone communicate with each other and Ii loved helping the guests on the telephone when they called in with a problem.  i wanted them to smile on the phone by the time they hung up."
good,I enjoyed working at Luxor. It was the most fun
good,"A typical day at work always varies for me because my shifts always change. This gives me an opportunity to move around and learn many aspects of the hotel and casino. My management is fair and for the most part are always helpful and understanding. My co-workers make work feel like a second home. Most employees are appreciative of their jobs and the atmosphere is mostly high spirited. The hardest part of my job is probably in the winter time when there is not much work except for graveyard shifts. The most enjoyable is going in everyday to a place that I like and respect. Interacting with guests, laughing and having fun."
good,"I worked for MGM for over ten tears and it was a bittersweet ending. However, I wish to broaden my employment history."
good,"I have worked a year with this company and I have yet to complain about anything big. They take good care of there employees and yes it can be different by department, but anyone who clearly states they do not hire anyone over 40 or 45 is wrong, I have personally witnessed people 40 and older getting hired for a variety of jobs. The company is good and I would recommend anyone to them and to the sister properties they have. It's also called patience and diligence if you applied to this company think about how many others who are looking to get a job or looking to transfer jobs, if anyone is applying they need to be persistent and call or ask questions."
good,"This company was so great to work with, they treat you excellent. It carries an amazing teamwork, management is very well done. Customer service is given and great outcome is received."

good,"I was an official spokesperson for MGM Resorts International via MlifeTV. The company has great core values and excellent management. "
good,"All in all, this is a great job and I love the compact and close environment, I just do not receive enough hours.A typical day at work is switching between lifeguards at different stands such as the towel hut and sitting on the lifeguard stand. I learned to be patient with everything because it is a very slow and chill atmosphere all the time. The culture is not super diverse and there are mostly Filipino's and Hispanics. The hardest part of the job is definitely how slow it is, but that is also the best part of the job. The employees are pleasant and very polite."
good,I worked as a Limo/ Sprinter driver for 2 1/2 years. I liked it a bunch. The guests were great the managers were great and the other drivers were very enjoyable.

Everyday youll leave with a story of something you have learned from someone you have cross paths with."
good,"MGM resorts really encouraged employees with recognition programs and seminars. There were team building exercises, monthly awards dinners and committees. When Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast, they relocated many of their Tunica employees. We were able to easily transfer from and to different properties."

It's really up to you and your attitude as well as your willingness to learn within and without. Self development is very important. Also, community involvement and your drive to serve others and be a team player is a must.  Each facility  has a slightly different culture BUT the company is striving to make it One in goals, objectives, and purpose. Plenty of training, internships and opportunities for advancement in one location or across the corporation."
good,"I am an on call Server and I enjoy all of my co-workers and other staff.   I am well respected and liked by all and everyone, customers and co-workers alike respond to my upbeat and positive outlook. I greet customers, explain our buffet and beverage service, clear glassware and dishes, answer questions about the buffet and the property, and insure the customer has a great dining experience. The best part of my job is my interaction with my customers and being rewarded with tips for my great service.  The toughest part of the job is trying to give the best possible service when we are understaffed or incredibly busy."
good,"I had great work experiences in MGM, such as: how to delivery a awesome, unforgettable costumer services. How to do every thing you must do in a right, fast and save way."
good,There is no typical work day. The best part of the job is the interaction with other officers and people in other departments such as the gaming tables and cages. You might be directing traffic one day and assisting guests who have locked themselves out of their rooms or safes the next. The employee dinning room provides amazing food. The job provides time off for sick days and holidays. The company's health insurance it good.
good,"I loved working here and would be so happy if I was to ever have the chance to be a permanent employee. I learned a lot from the staff and management. The faith they put in me to do my job, made me do that job even better."
good,"Typical day:  Came in for midnight shift and met with other managers in the office for a report on what had happened during the last shift and any other updates and things or people to watch for.  Then we went to our stations.  One to marker bank, one to the front line.  One to the Chip Bank and one would work in the office.  Each manger was responsible for all cashiers and customer issues.  The manager of the office was responsible for auditing at least 5 carts (cash) and the manager's cart.  The office manager also gave a meeting to all cashiers on items from upper management and from the shift report from the afternoon shift.  If it got busy the office manager would open up in a window.  If we needed more cashiers, others would open up a window.  At the end of the shift managers would assist cashiers in balancing their carts and selling chips to the chip bank.  The office manager would write the shift change report and we would meet with day shift to report on things that happened in each bank and on the front line."
good,"I love my job as dealer, the interaction with the guests from various walks of life and the regulars....its a fun job for the most part that pays very well"

Over the years of working we are required to take up customer service, diversity, on going classes dealing with irate situaions to fire safety courses, alcohol awairness, and the list goes on, ext. Coming in contact with everytype of people and there personallities over the years gave me a better understanding to deal with if not every, most situations professionally. Management was always availible and willing to help in any situation."
good,"Depending on your co-workers, this could be an excellent experience or a bad experience if you care about whom your working with. They're flexible with hours. (Great for people who also go to school)"
good,"Every day was different with the variety of people who came to the hotel. From serious issues such as medicals and dealing with EMS, to report writing for alleged stolen/missing property from guests. Employees were also vital as they not only worked for the company, but injuries, and on rare occasions thefts occurred in which it was vital to keep the incident private, Security knowledge was to be kept to just those who needed to know. You worked with not just guests, employees, but general managers and all managers on property to keep not just Security, but all departments working together. In all jobs there are good and bad days, and it is in how you handle each incident, or crisis which matters the most. It is not just a job, but how you present yourself and act in each and every incident on your property."
good,"For several years, I've worked for MGM Resorts International and this company is absolutely worth taking a chance with and applying for.  If you're considering this company, make the move.  You won't regret it."
good,"Everyday was a new day with new people, Fun atmosphere.I learned to be more social. Management was very reasonable and fun. My co-workers were all fun and positive. Hardest day was rude customers. The most enjoyable part was my pay."
good,"I have worked for half of my life. I started work at the age of fifteen. By far, MGM Resorts was my ideal place of work. The typical day at MGM was varied by the many types of guests who called in from all over the world. The guests desired to know about our ten Las Vegas property attractions/amenities. I had the privileged to assist these guests in selecting seats in our world class theaters and reserving fine dining experiences at our five star, five diamond restaurants. I learned to become a communication expert! Specifically to listen closely to the guest request via telephone and to accommodate based on their request plus anticipate what might make their stay with us extraordinary."
good,"Working for the Excalibur in Surveillance was a great experience. I can't go into detail of this position or what I did on a daily basis because it would violate confidentiality code, but I can say that everyone I met while working here from line level to Executive management was proud to be an employee of MGM at Excalibur. Management was very knowledgeable and genuinely cared about their team. My co-workers were diverse and brought different security backgrounds to the department. The toughest part of the job was working 3rd shift. This shift is acceptable to work for a few months, but after a year on this shift, my work/life balance was thrown completely off track. However, this was also one of the most enjoyable parts of the job as this was the prime time for the high rollers to come in and play. I was able to observe some of the best players as well as some of the most wanted gaming teams within the gaming industry. Overall, I really enjoyed my time at the Excalibur in the Surveillance Department."

good,"A very busy location in Las Vegas especially when there is an event at the MGM Grand Garden. You are trained to offer great customer service to your customers and those visiting the casino. Co Workers are blended to all work as a team during busy check-in weekends and holidays. The most difficult part of the job is, at times it can seem like its non stop people coming at you all the time. If you like people you get to meet and greet people from all over the world and from every part of the United States."

good,"During my 10 weeks as an MGM Resorts employee, I had the opportunity to network with industry leaders as well as collaborate with like-minded interns. My task was to shadow various individuals within the Marketing department and compile the best practices of a Casino Host and use that information to create a detailed training manual for new casino host. MGM offers a great environment for its employees to learn and grow, I walked away from the internship with a greater understanding of how casinos function. I also was able to create everlasting friendships and connections while I was there. These friendships are what made it easy to work more than your normal 40-hour week."
good,"Very professional and organized, product ordered consistently, return base on regular customers is very rewarding. MGM is a great company to work for. A day at work consisted of pre shift of te weeks on going procedures"
good,"Typical work day as a retail sales associate, though you have fun with all the different customers that come in. very joyful and fun environment. everyone is just looking to have a good time and we are there to help make that possible and help with bettering their experience as well as your own."
good,Leadership is truly value and purpose driven. There are too many stories and actions the company takes to put its employees first. One of the best places I've ever worked. It's not like the pressure cooker insanity of other companies in the industry. You will work with the brightest and happiest people in the business
good,"-Lack of room for growth "
good,"Las Vegas, Nevada, is one of the most competitive culinary environments in the world. With  2.5M residents in the metropolitan area and over 8,000 restaurants, there is a steady supply of restaurant talent. MGM is extremely competitive with wages, time-off, personal leave, insurance, etc. MGM focuses on diversity and team-work; including extensive training, system procedures with constant re-analysis, and follow-up."
good,"Company was family. Well structured, great team to work with."
good,"Oversaw every facet of the daily operation of over 300 residential rental units in apartment complexes in multiple locations..

good,"MGM Grand is a great place to work with many learning and growth opportunities. Hard work and effort is appreciated and rewarded. Just like any other company, ""you get what you give""!"
good,Most days at work were always busy which was very good for me. I like to be busy. There was a lot to learn and do every shift i worked. My manager i had at the time was absolutely wonderful ! She was a terrific manager in every way was always there for each and every employee of her department member services where i worked. Some days were a struggle for me because there was so much to take in but i was always told it takes time and do not feel overwhelmed which always helped. I did learn a lot working in member services.  The hardest part was when the other call monitoring managers would yell out to move quicker calls are on hold. I gave each and every guest the one on one personalized service they called for and expected. My co workers were wonderful and having different people come into the call center from shows was always a plus with free food at times and giveaways

good,"If i could i would go back in a heart beat the benefits were outstanding thanks to the union based agreements "

good,most i learn about guest service. we have some returning guest they are friendly. also we have seen a new face. listening to guest what they order. i also loving about mgm that they been new ideas.
good,MGM resorts international was a very rewarding company to intern for during the summer. The HIP program is a great way to begin to see how a large company such as MGMRI works and get a glimpse at the fast paced and unique environment of Las Vegas. MGMRI provides its employees with many chances at advancement within the company and is very open to letting HIP interns get as much experience as possible in different areas during their internship.
good,"I enjoyed working at the MGM, It was a wonderful place to work and a great experience. The employee and guests were a wonderful bunch of people to work with and serve. We kept up on our Self Defensive Tactics, DPR, AED, Poison Control Classes Quarterly."
good,Working at the MGM grand pool is the place to work if you're looking for a job that provides non-stop interaction with other employees and guests. Being on the strip is also a bonus.
good,"First of all, all the retail managers are very friendly- including the director and VP.  They have an ""open door"" policy where they invite their employees to stop by whenever without an appointment to express any concerns or ideas. They're humble and very easy to talk to. My coworkers were also lovely people. Not just my retail coworkers but other employees at the MGM all have your back. Everybody tries to watch out for one another. The company itself has monthly orientations so all employees can improve customer service. In general the company really cares about their employees which is really rare to find in my opinion. I absolutely loved working for this company!"
good,"Great company to work for, great benefits as well as a positive company culture. Managed over 400 employees each day, maintaining 5 diamond service while maintaining over 5 million sq ft of Public property 24 hours per day. The hardest part of the job was aligning the department daily work to the budget. We successfully achieved our goals over the last few years. The most enjoyable part of this job was the people and there dedication, as well as the overall 5 Diamond appearance we all achieved."

good,"When i worked at MGM services i learned more and more everyday about cars, how they work, how to repair them and how to work with the public, give good customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and developing my skills in the work place, my hardest part of the job was if i was helping a worker with a repair and i didnt really know how to repair it it would take me a wee bit to understand fully on how it got repaired."
good,"Working in the Human Resource for MGM was like having an adventure, aside from the paperworks, it never felt like I was working. I met new people every single day, from CEO to ordinary people and they all added value to my life. In addition to that, I had my Friendly and professional co-workers, that want nothing more than for me to grow and succeed. Although I was pretty young amongst them, they treated me equally. When the time was right to depart from MGM they make sure I was setting off straight to college, with lots of materials. What I got off from MGM was a whole lot of positive. I would give lots to go back once more."
good,"This was the best place to work, was a large hotel with a lot of customers, great employees and co workers. Management support was great, got all yo needed to get the rooms ready in time for the next guests. I enjoyed my job and customers satisfaction was great from the notes left behind."
good,I truly enjoyed every minute I worked at MGM Grand. Everyone I worked with was so easy to get along with the communication within the company is great. MGM Resorts truly wants people to succeed. The only reason I am no longer at MGM Grand is because I needed to relocate to Los Angeles
good,"A Turner é uma excelente empresa para se trabalhar, o aprendizado é diário, o ambiente é excelente, a pressão com o fechamento e os reportes é normal como em toda area financeira, a empresa visa o desenvolvimento do funcionário com cursos, palestras internas, treinamentos etc, e está sempre preocupada com o bem estar dos seus funcionários.

good,"Wonderful and Friendly People, Loved working there. I learned a lot about different people and I would gladly say I would like to finish career there."
good,"I liked my coworkers and my boss, and the pay was good for the job I had. I would come in for eight hours, any time from seven am to nine pm, depending on when the boss wanted me to come. I would hand out towels and pick them up and I would sit on the lifeguard stand for 30 minute intervals and watch the pool. I learned how to better work with customers and fill their needs. The hardest part of the job was cleaning the pool deck, and the most enjoyable part of the job was spending time with coworkers."
good,"I spent 10 of the past 12 years of my work history with MGM Grand Detroit, I loved working there. I was able to learn several different areas of the company and how they operate. I was asked to fill in for multiple positions and was recognized with employee of the month in June of 2006."
good,Enjoyed the team I worked with and the Manager I reported to. It was great working at all the different properties owned by MGM but after 3.5 years I had enough of the smoke and grave yard shift. I would go back in aheart beat if the casino environment and was not so bad for my health and there were better hours.
good,"Working for the MGM Signature is wonderful. No two days are ever alike, but always filled with lots of fun! Since it is a smaller property, its more of an ""intimate"" work environment. You really get to know mostly everyone you work with in other departments, and The Signature really cultivates a fun family atmosphere to work in! A typical day at The Signature always begins with a ""Good Morning"" from everyone you encounter throughout the building. Everyone is genuinely happy to be there. I start my day out by looking at my bar, turning on my frozen drink machines, and start cutting fruit for garnishes for the day, filling juice containers, etc...Preshift happens right before our team goes out to the pool and starts the day. Always informative and lets us know whats going on in and around the properties (i.e fights, concerts, conventions, etc...) My coworkers are the greatest! I love working for and with each one of them! We work hard for each other and make sure we push one another to do their best! I like to think our pool staff is a tightly knit group of different individuals all coming together for one goal. To make sure the customer is satisfied and that they'll be back. The hardest thing about working out on a pool deck is obviously the heat, but our management makes sure that not only us, but our guests are safe. The most gratifying part of the job is making our guests happy and seeing them smile after making them one of our hand crafted cocktails or cold beverages."
good,They do apricate there employees when it comes to work ethics They also do give you chance to exceeded with company. I like they always try to give you more options in position your in. .
good,"MGM is a good place to work if you want decent pay and potential to advance in your field. There are plenty of bonuses such as paid lunches, excellent medical and dental insurance and fun people to be around."
good,During my work experience I learned about cash and credit transactions and how to quickly and efficiently work under pressure. Maintaining proper health routines and cleaning was a daily regimen along with opening the store. The management was strict but great and the hardest part about the job was the harassment from drunk customers.
good,A typical day at mgm would be serving pizza & cashing people out? Overall working there I know I improved on my customer service as well as my work performance you meet thousands of people a day so you would definitely have to have some type of experience or skill in the food service industry. Overall it is a very fun professional comfortable place to work just as well at the management

good,I loved being able to work somewhere where everyone is so welcoming. MGM became like family and every opportunity was a great one. I will forever love this company.
good,"I enjoyed every second working there.  Occasionally, I miss working there.  They really take care of their employees.  A typical day there is walk in through the back employee entrance, check with security, and head to housekeeping to get ready to work.  Management loved me because I never complained or made a fuss.  I always got the job done.  I was only part of a handful of male housekeepers, so many were surprised how well I could keep up with the other female housekeepers.  The hardest part of the job was completing 16 TRASHED rooms after a huge event on the strip or weekend.  I started in the summertime, so you could only imagine how busy it got.  But, once you get into the habit of cleaning the rooms.  Its probably to easiest job in the world.  Hard to be fire from, unless you purposely want to be fired, or didn't care.  I miss working there, but had to leave for family reasons.  I really recommend to anyone who wish to work there."
good,"Nice place to work especially for those who enjoy a relaxed....entertainment...cool type environment...."
good,"This was by far one of the best companies that I have ever worked for! This particular position though was a rough one in that they didn't offer benefits until you had been in the position for over a year and where offered a full time position. When you first start you are considered a on call employee with full time hours and a flex schedule meaning you have to be available to work anytime between 6am and 9pm all year round. Your schedule is never the same and changes weekly, you dont know your schedule until the week prior. You could work mornings one week and the next be closing."

I enjoyed the flexible work schedule and the engagement of my leadership team to review the best practices I was implementing into the guest experience.

good,"MGM taught me some of the most important and valuable lessons I've learned as a professional. I learned how to have poise throughout the day no matter what challenges arise and keep my focus on providing the best customer service possible. I also learned how important it was to be able to put myself in the guests shoes and be able to show compassion, empathy and not allow minor frustrations to be the forefront of any given interaction. "
good,"It is so much fun working with vibrant fun people. its like a family there. and if we dont have time for lunch, they feed us. They truly care about our well being and will prove it."
good,"Great  place to work. Really busy, and strict but I enjoyed it overall. It would be nicer if it did not feel like they were micromanaging most of the time, but I guess everywhere you work there are pros and cons."

good,"The beginning of each day started with a pre-shift, which was a quick meeting before greeting our daily guests.  We were briefed on what had happened in the building and outside the building prior to our arrival of our 24-hour running establishment.  This allowed us to not look any other way, but being MGM Grand Smart.  Management allowed us to be completely our selves while handling our guests in a polished and professional manner.  We shared stories on how to handle different situations and gave advice on future promotions and offers.  The hardest part of any day was when the ""untimely"" computers went down.  It affected our guests mood which in turn affected the employees moods as well.  We ate well and were given the opportunity to enjoy all the many delicacies that our extravagant guests paid for at no expense.  Our course getting paid well was one of the most enjoyable parts, but I made the best connections ever within this establishment.  Co-workers and guests taught me a lifetime of lessons."

It could range from just telling guests how to get to certain areas in the casino or hotel, or it could be as drastic as making arrests and helping the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police with investigations, trespasses, and evictions.
