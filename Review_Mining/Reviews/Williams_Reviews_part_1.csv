rating,review
bad,"The company saves money by hiring 3rd party."
bad,"They are a very corrupt company who pretty much own most of the town in which they are based from. There wasn't much to working there, but it wasn't fair the way they treated their employees. And everyone who worked their was miserable."
bad,"EVERY SINGLE WOMAN WORKING THERE WAS NASTY!! I was on a trial period to begin with and the owner who was meant to be observing me wasn't even there to observe... all the young inexperienced girls where bit*chy and nasty about other colleagues and most customers!!"
bad,Owner's were not as legit as they should have been to stay in business.
bad,"*****Cons *****"
bad,"When requesting hours to be paid, Manager got extremely irritated. I was then let go unexpectedly. The department is one large clique of employees. Most of the ""team"" are friends and they disregard the Contractors as if we didn't exist. No job security and no respect."
bad,Constant re-organizations and potential office closures have had a negative impact on employee morale. You don't know from one day to the next whether or not you will have a job or what city it will be based out of.
bad,"The day was a typical office day, come in, go to your office, swing by attorneys offices to collect paperwork to draft, draft, file and serve and repeat. "
bad,I wish not to speak on my experience with afni. I would not recommend anyone pregnant looking for employment to work here.
bad,"I was promised by my consulting firm that after 3 months I would be hired on as a direct employee. I found out two contractors in our department where hired on after be lied two by the management ."
bad,I don’t feel like writing a novel so I’ll be brief. Working here is dangerous and sucks the joy out of your day. If you’re not on e of the old Transco people you’re treated differently l. Everyone is so afraid to lose their job they throw each other under the bus. There were 4 deaths during my 3 years there. HR is CLEARLY working for the management side if they even respond to you at all. But hey they pay well.
bad,Management is part of the good ol boy system. Discrimination within certain  departments and within its leaders. Non communitive towards their employees in the construction department and others. Manger(s) excludes certain employees due to their insecurities and burn out their workhorses.
bad,"Management turns a blind eye for safety and has an one shoe fits all mentality for safety protocols and procedures. Zero job advancement unless you are willing to move. Plenty overtime, but zero relief or effort to acknowledge unsafe working conditions. Bonuses are offered but subjective within management. Employees are treated like just another number."
bad,"The HR VP is manipulative, back-biting, subversive, and plays favorites.  You're either in the house of out of the house."
bad,"Little to no upward mobility, below industry standard pay, incompetent management"
bad,Hired to evaluate company's properties in Fort Worth Basin. My work identified a number of geologic hazards (faults) on their acreage and resulted in a reduced the number of horizontal well locations.  I saved the company more than thirty million dollars and the VP sought my analysis on every well and farm-in opportunity.  Low gas prices stopped the possibility of any profitability on acreage acquired in this basin.
bad,I started with Williams in Colorado and relocated to Tunkahannock.Big mistake! the core management was terrable HR was even worse forget days off 80+ woork week supervisors who thretten you if you want a day off ! I should have stayed in colorado Williams in Colorado is much better to work for it seems like they mooved all the bad supervision up there that had been with the copaney for way to long to be fired.
bad,"Oldest Land Surveying/Civil Engineering firm in Rome Ga. Could be an extremely successful firm, but management is horrible. The only thing they actually manage to do correctly is to get in the way. The owners are 2 of the greediest men I've ever known. Layoffs galore. Pay is decent, and some benefits, but the cons involved with this company outweigh the pros 10 to 1. Beware!!!"
bad,Part of an acquired group. Favoritism was consistently displayed between our office and native Williams office. Many promises made and backpedaled on. Mission statement of one Williams not upheld. Management consistently dishonest with our questions in regarfs to our office location future.
bad,new management pranks to much and they are not always fun joking pranks they are mean pranks they punish you for the wrong things that other people do
bad,Cutthroat in every way and promote that with their employees. Would not recommend working there. Upper management does not know what is happening at the local lever. Only work on the buddy system.
bad,"Workplace was hostile, full of nepotism and promotions only come through affiliations or family relations."
bad,"Sr Management has set a great tone for the company and does and amazing job in projecting the company's value based tone.  However, many mid-level managers are stuck in their ways and refuse to adapt and improve the process.  They let a lot of Access Midstream talent go (they bought Access Midstream in 2015), and now have a huge talent gap.  Expect to see customer satisfaction go down in the next year or so, as they transition to new systems and old their processes."
bad,"Used to be a good company, until mergers started. Dishonesty is rampant and management does not value hard work. HR works for senior management and does not represent employees. I do not recommend working here."
bad,"Overall, OK company to work for, I like working with the team and most of the user community that i supported. The most enjoyable part of the job is when i resolved the user's issue and was able to do his/her job."
bad,"It is commonly heard...""I've done it this way for 30 years, I'm not changing now.""  Management doesn't seem to be on the same page and very few seem to encourage growth or development of employees."
bad,"Williams is proof it is the people that make the company."
bad,Williams provides a top notch environment for employees. The employees are professional and a pleasure to work with daily. The provide a good salary and benefits. The only issue i've had is where the company is going. Williams feels less stable and more looking to be bought out. Contractors who they keep around for years should be hired but they are constantly lead on. Ive been a contractor for 3 years and told i was being converted to full time since year 1.
good,"This place is a con, nothing here is to the book, a lot of shady things are going on. Lay offs are frequent and say good bye to your personal life."
good,"For a while, Williams had a captured market in Tulsa and little competition.  Thus, wages and benefits for your average worker were pathetically low."
good,Employment for this company is unlike any other job experience.  You must be a self starter and have strong accounting background in order to figure out what is expected on the job.  There is no training provided and it is somewhat a sink or swim environment.  There is no job stability at this office as employee turnover is very high.
good,"Drive to multiple station locations to maintenance the compressors. Changing out valves, head, and repairing leaking. Trouble shooting engine issues, then repairing the problem."
good,Management was not always receptive to new ideas except from executives.  Too much top down business decision-making process.  Company management was too entrenched.  Time off for personal issues was a strong suit of the company.
good,"the management wasn't the greatest, the workers called in a lot. didn't work well around school schedules. if the workers were there, they did the bare minimum."
good,"Compensation and benefits were good.  Management was absent."
good,"Sixty hour weeks. Stressful environment. Layers and layers of bureaucracy, can't get anything done. Safety is secondary in all walks. Not environmentally conscious. Clueless leadership. Alot of cronyism typical of the energy industry. Solely focused on making money - to hell with compliance and regulation."
good,This firm serves as a good place to acquire internship hours. However there is no pay or benefits for interning. This is temporary.
good,Management is not that good.  lots of learning on your own.  if you can do it their way you will be fine.  Culture has changed and will continue to change.  Good luck and enjoy the benefits
good,Not a good place to work. Home most weekends. Hard to get a hold of big bosses. NOT Family friendly. Will NOT work around personal life. offers OK health insurance .
good,Williams is a pretty good place to work. Coworkers are friendly and helpful. The management keeps reorganizing the company every 3-5 years so it is difficult to really advance.
good,lots of favortism at this company not room for advancement i also learned that you need to know people to get ahead in this company
good,"The compensation and benefits are outstanding; however, job security is low with little or no notice of termination (with or without cause).  The culture is very cut throat at all levels.  Senior leadership is purely political."
good,"No review to give, Lots of over-time and very little time for a lunch break. 20 minutes for a lunch break isn't much time to eat, use the bathroom and re-hydrate especially during the summer months when heat in the building is well over 110 degrees F."
good,They are a very good company to work for for dedicated runs. And they offer short hauls but it ain't really good for me. I like to go Long haul to see the countryside
good,Safety is always first. The health insurance needs improvement with coverage of services. The opportunity to train for other jobs is limited but available.
good,the day I started I was told my Manager was let go do absolute no win situation from that moment on six months later hired a VP and he laid a bunch of people off probably a good thing...
good,"Some upward mobility, but very competitive . Several people would apply and it is all about who you know not what you know. Expensive to park downtown and have to park several blocks away, car broken into because someone through a brick through my passenger window. Not safe to leave building alone at night."
good,"The company has been around for a long time and seems to really value its older workers!  "
good,was an overall ok experience but their processes are very old and a very caucasian workplace. Not many people of color or women are in high ranking roles and upper management seem to hire the exact same person for replacement.Not looking for change.
good,Fantastic place to work.  Co-workers were amazing.  I only left to have a child.  I enjoyed all aspects of this company.  My direct manager was easy to get along with and knew how to bring the best out of people.
good,"This company does not offer development opportunities, thus very little growth. The major benefit is job security. It is very hierarchical and lacking in employee recognition"
good,"Every day was different.  Assisted management and staff of 40+ with a variety of needs. Being open-minded and available to help anyone who needed help was a must.  Co-workers were team players and we shared many responsibilities and helped each other when needed.  "
good,"I enjoyed the high paced work environment. Accts Receivable, Accts Payable, invoicing, customer service, delivery. Never a dull moment"
good,processed mail routine trips to bank and court runs. helping attorneys with fillings in all courts
good,Management did a good job to taking care of the employees and there were numerous opportunities for advancement. There was room for growth and improvement of the safety culture.
good,Good environment in terms of being challenging with high degree of autonomy.  Given the necessary resources to get the job done.  Little thought given to employee development and advancement opportunity.
good,"- Typical day of work insists: Showing in between 8 and 8:30 a.m., talk or say good morning to my co-workers as I make my way to my desk, sit at my desk and unload everything from my bag while my computer turns on, check my emails and any other things that may need to be checked, take green folders (pipeline agreements) and scan/upload them to my email, enter the documents into Williams websites (Flairdocs & Livelink), lunch is usually an hour long and taken any time between 11 and 12, after lunch I get back to scanning and uploading pipeline agreements until I leave in between 4 and 5 p.m."
good,"For a hard worker,it was possible to advance.started at bottom and had serveral promotions.Most co-workers were frinds as well as management staff.Had a great family atmosphere."
good,"Williams provides a pretty good work/life balance and has some very good benefits, however the culture there is very silo'd.  All groups to things differently even within the same discipline and it's very difficult to make process improvements due to the large company mentality."
good,"I really enjoyed what I was doing.  I enjoyed working with most of the people around me.  The company offices were in a good location.  Due to the size of the company, the benefits were good."
good,Williams will always remove contractors before full time employees. Even if you are far superior to them. Other than that schedule and work from home is flexible and it can be a great place to work you just have to keep a backup plan.
good,"The company not a bad place to work but its automotive parts for the Ford company and Ford not doing so well, I worked 2-3 days a week so I had to quit and find a better job,"
good,where I learned SCO Unix and what a challange of all the projects
good,"• Conducted market outlines on specific areas of growth to forecast maximum return on investment for entire portfolio resulting in a 15% return, with a zero percent loss, over a ten year period"
good,"During my time at the Williams family I truly learned the value of family culture. I enjoyed working with their son , and grandson. An average day working there included teaching math, english, science, and working with the male child in hands on sports activity's."
good,"Happy open 6am greet people do daily ledger, management skills, great bosses, hardest part of job is standing all day and having to work till close if somebody didn't show up. Enjoyed seeing all my customers everyday."
good,"As I said Productive, the environment was alright, there is unfair employee treatment such as there are a few areas that are out of camera view that employees and managers exploit for electronic and smoking privileges while off break as others work."
good,"Williams is utility-like in their base culture and procedures. They claim to be entrepreneurial, but get bogged down in bureaucracy and sloppy analysis. The management means well, but can't seem to get the employees moving at the right speed in the right direction."
good,"Overall I feel it is a good company to work for. A typical day would be checking on my assigned compressor station. I don't really know the management team, my co-workers are great and make going to pleasant. The hardest part of my job is being on the call out rotation. The most enjoyable part of my job would be working with my co-workers."
good,"If you like talking to resolve. Micro management too close. Everyone in others business, instead of focusing on making their bonus ..then want to get upset when they dont get extra cash, when they had option to stay on phone and dedicate."
good,The place closed but we had fun and customer service was fabulous. There just were no advancements there snd the company was bought out by Lisa'Chicken.
good,Williams has great benefits including a pension and 401k. PTO is above industry standard. Co-workers are fun and the work environment is fun. But CEO is an idiot
good,"Nice place to work and nice people to work with.  Good Pay, Excellent Benefits, flexible working hours make this easy to go to work.  I recommend it easily."
good,Flexible work when needed and rigid when necessary. office space typical to all oil and gas companies. building is very modern and amenities are nice.
good,My employment was during a time when the oil/gas economy was tanking and takeovers were happening.  It made for a very bad day-to-day environment during the short time I was employed with them.  This is not a reflection on the Williams personnel.
good,"some people are given the wrong type of work,"

Always there if I needed any kind of assistance or just to talk. Being the only cleaning person was nice because I had my own routine and everyone expected it.
good,"great working experience. good benefits. Great people to worth with. Very caring staff and managment. Allows you to work freely and express yourself throught your working ablities,"
good,"My experience a Williams Company was very good.  They, like many of the large petroleum companies are passing through a lean time therefore their is naturally a lot of pressure on the company and its employees.  Nevertheless, I was always amazed at their culture of leadership within the company; Hands off, ""your qualified for the job and we respect you'll get the job done well"". The company provides a critical service to the Nation: Low cost fuel.  They do this with safety as the number one priority.  Overall its a great company."

good,"working on code for larger issues and on call for any imediate issues that come up during the day. "
good,Williams is a great place to work and the people make it worth working there. Great teamwork and need to get things done. The hardest part is continuous deadlines to propose projects to gain customers business.
good,"Very physically demanding, Poor pay and medical benefits, awesome coworkers, No company vehicle, open supervisor positions are regularly filled without open interviews and behind closed doors."
good,"I enjoyed working for my cousins company. It involved me getting up at 5am and waiting for my cousin to pick me up from my house. We had various locations to travel to such as Hackney and sometimes Chelsea."
good,I was hired to do project work in a special group but the 1st of 3 reorganizations happened then that group was moved into another group then the 2nd smaller management shift and very little project work came thru. Then the 3rd and final re-org happened and I was laid off. That was my time at Williams.
good,"I really enjoyed working with the various project teams and departments.  Working with management personnel was hit and miss as far as each member seemed to have their own criteria for reporting.  Overall, though, it was a good experience."
good,"Being at a fast pace energy company, it is a challenging yet rewarding place to work.  There are many different facets of the company to learn and opportunities to take advantage of.  Whether it be in the area you live, or looking to relocate to another area, Williams has many different locations across the country to explore."
good,"Good company to work for.  Good pay, hours somewhat flexible, interesting projects.  Office location is good.  Management a little unorganized.  No other comments"
good,"My team was a group of 9, who worked together on a daily basis and did a wonderful job supporting one another. "

good,It was a good place to work if you are a permanent hire they do lots of beneficial work with the community but some management personel have no experience and it shows. other than that it is a great company.
good,"Great Culture to work in, but they have been through a tough year for sure.  Hopefully, management will be able to pull the company in a common direction."
good,Each day consisted of analyzing data that had come in since the previous workday. Anomalies in normal flow or characteristics were evaluated and either corrected/edited in the data or sent to field personnel as a work order.
good,Good company to work for.. too bad during layoffs they didn't keep some employees that had been loyal to them for 9 years after given the chance many times to leave. But business is business just don't play favorites.
good,Williams is a great place to start as a young professional especially if you are in the development program. The management invest great efforts into providing an atmosphere and experience for the trainees to involve themselves in. My typical day would consist of solving and preventing problems on projects through monitoring and controlling project schedule and budget. I enjoy collaborating with the project team members to achieve scope for each project and learning about the project life cycle. The hardest part of the job entails tracking an unknown expense and going through many loopholes to finally mitigate the future risk. The most enjoyable part of the job is the amount of self development available.
good,"I was very jovial and fun makin guy .This makes my work easy going "
good,"I basically just answer the phones, open and close the firm and file for some secretary's."

good,"I used to love my job but now feeling a bit lost. "
good,"In nearly a decade we have had 4 major reorgs.  They promote opportunity during these times but so far not for me. I’d like to see a little more settling down, and some priority given to help advance current mid-level loyal employees."

good,Are ducted and fun place to work learn a lot about Landscaping hardships and masonry work because of you it was something new everyday lot of different projects
good,I have felt valued and appreciated at Williams. I feel like management is concerned with the employees while keeping the goals of the company in sight.
good,"The Williams Companies is a good place to achieve the corporate status quo: a decent paycheck, benefits, and a very good work/life balance. "
good,Nice company with great teams and fellow coworkers. Days can be 8 hours if not in busy season. Busy season can mean long hours .
good,"I had a great experience at Williams, Overman, & Pierce accounting firm. The hours were long. (Typically 10 to 12 hour days) But the teamwork and camaraderie were excellent which more than made up for it."
good,This was one of the best companies I will have worked for.  One Team Leader in particular was a great mentor and actually did care about us guys. Hopefully he is in upper management by now in Tulsa. I enjoyed my time with them.
good,"Excellent place to work. opportunities for advancement if you seek them out. Involved in the communities the major offices are in. Good benefits, pto, etc."
good,Started off as a pumper worked my way up.  Williams was great at promoting from within and giving folks opportunities.  They help facilitate my getting not only experience but also certifications.
good,"Cannot say enough good about this organization.  The people are great, the culture is great, and it is a great place to work.  If you have an opportunity to work for this company you should take it."
good,"With more than ten years and various positions I have found that most iterations with groups, individuals, and management have been positive.  There is always room for improvement but all in all Williams is a good employer."
good,"I enjoy working for Williams, however management's inability to make decisions and the constantly changing organizational structure make it challenging to get things done."
good,"Williams is a good company with a great company culture, but it has had a difficult couple years trying to build up an organization for the shale gas boom and now trying to adjust to the oil and gas market crash.  Doing this with the ETE merger looming and now disappearing has caused the culture and morale to suffer, as many in the organization have been directionless for a long time."
good,Williams is like a big family.  Everyone helps each other.  Great work/life balance. Not alot of advancement...but great people and leaderes.
good,The oil and gas market is not stable and leads to unmanageable operation.  The capital and long term success is hard for this industry.
good,Typical TA function within fast paced organization. Great location and office setting. Lots of very sharp dedicated employees.
good,"A typical day is meeting scheduled with the project developers to go over projects that have changed or to announce any new projects that need to be developed. Working closely with the project developer I will get to develop the project schedule that will be used to convince the company to go forward with the project."
good,"A company with a drive to be #1 in its industry, and who looks after their employees.  The culture at Williams Companies is among the best I have ever been a part of."
good,"Interesting work area and type of work (mountains) safety factor highly involved in project, contact with Williams Employees daily event"
good,"Maintain a safe and effective work environment for fitness facilities."
good,great place to work pleasant atmosphere a lot peace would again for this client
good,"Overall the Williams Companies is one the few traditional companies left that actually puts in effort into caring for their workers. Having said that, though, going from a contractor to being an employee can be an uphill battle. Like most companies, nowadays, Williams outsources much of their work to contractors. While their are hopes of becoming an employee it can be met with much resistance from the managers. Also, sometimes information needed for a contractor to perform duties is not given, because their a contractor. It can be a Catch 22: the company needs for you to complete a job, with information you're not allowed to have."
good,a lot of work throw at you atone time sometimes could overwhelm a person. a lot of good people but never sure you will have a job year after year. if you are young with new kids come here.
good,"A typical day for me at work is very simple "
good,Good place to work in OKC (they purchased Access Midstream) and then closed the OKC offices; I haven't heard how it is to work in the Tulsa offices; they still operate under some old-fashioned practices
good,As the title implies Williams is a good place to work. Changing culture but a good culture to be a part of. Good work/life balance. Excellent beneifits
good,I worked with Williams Companies for 15 years but was unfortunately laid off during a workforce reduction due to a downturn in the oil and gas industry.
good,Busy work place with supportive Lawyers. Learned a lot working with my Lawyer who deals more with land and real estate.  Many clients each day with variety in what they were asking for.  Due to the business my boss was in we had a large clientele and it was difficult to get to everyone and their needs.  Enjoyed the experience and the growing and developing I have done since being in this law atmosphere.
good,"Work at WJA was fun and there was no micro-managing.  Team members were knowledgeable, helpful and friendly."
good,"Worked 6 years previously as Administrative Assistant to Geology Department and Asset Teams.  Also have Human Resources Coordinator experience."
good,"This place does a good job at what they do. They are a little hesitant at times, but they always seems to get things right. It's part of their culture."
good,"I work within a very knowledgeable team which strives to provide excellent quality training for the employees within our divisions. We collaborate with each other and operations to share feedback, best practices, goals, accomplishments, obstacles, and incidents so we can all learn together. The culture of this team is one of open dialog, sharing, and mentoring. This is a great team to work with."
good,"I learned so much at Williams, about pipeline work, electronic flow meters maintenance and care. I loved being in the field and working at my own pace."
good,"Great people to work with, my particular group really is like a family. The company is going through hard times and many people lost their jobs, but the company was one of the last to lay people off during the gas turnout."
good,"Working at Williams was an amazing opportunity and if the economy had permitted, I would have sought employment at such a wonderful company that has given me skills that will be valued in my next workplace."
good,"Highly successful company that values employees contributions by making a strong effort to reward employees with discounts, relaxed clothing standards and good benefits."
good,Yes I was laid off but it wasn't personal it was totally business. Being at the bottom of the pyramid doesn't help. I really enjoyed working with my co-workers. It was a family feeling and everyone looked out for each other. I am a vet and my boss never had a problem with my appts or needing to take a day. I learned so much about Operations. I even had time to take college classes at night. I really don't believe I will ever find a job that I loved like the one in western Oklahoma.
good,Williams/Blackstock was a nice opportunity to work. I got the opportunity to learn surveying areas and meet new people.
good,"great job not alot of benifits or flexiablity, and the is no holiday pay but they promote from within and have alot of advancement oppritunitys"
good,Was a great job. I had a lot of fun getting to learn and grow with all the fellas that worked with me and for me. Just don’t wanna work overnight anymore. It’s been really hard on my body the past three years
good,"Williams is truly a wonderful company to work for. The environment is highly collaborative, leadership is involved and sets clear and reasonable expectations for the organization."
good,This firm is very thorough and does the best they can for their clients.  They value their employees and do everything they can to take  care of them.

I also have experience in contract law, real estate contracts, Wills, Deeds, Powers of Attorneys.  The firm has approximately 15 employees so we all chip in help out and support one another in our endeavors and daily work load.  The hardest part of the job is learning the newest legal procedures for any given task.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working very diligently on a case when clients hire us to seeing the case through to closure and the satisfaction of knowing you did your best and the job was a success.

The entire group of accountants was always willing to help in any and every way possible to my position as office manager. The hardest part of this particular job was trying to ensure clients met all tax filing deadlines without penalty or difficulty. It was great at the end of each tax season to know we accomplished all goals to that end.

I was mentored by some of my fondest leaders and was sad the day I left.  The company had a policy of how much they would increase salaries and when the numbers started falling behind the market people started leaving.  I was able to make double what I was making when I left.  Shortly after I left the policy was evaluated and adjusted.  "
good,My position was only temporary but I loved my time there. I was always treated with respect and the atmosphere is just easy to work in. The building also had the best cafeteria!
good,As long as you did your job well it was good.  I never got bored cause they would keep you working on projects etc. Upper level management and board of directors should investigate situations and find the real answers before they farm out work to companies like IBM who lied to management about being a family oriented company who cares about careers.

In terms of legal work, most of my time was spent litigating breach of contract cases.  I learned a great deal from my experience at the firm, not only about law (and especially the use of procedure for strategic purposes), but also about teamwork -- interacting with intelligent and skilled professionals.  My boss consistently gave me advice on new skills as I developed them, and feedback on projects I had completed, which was always constructive without being unduly harsh.  My coworkers were friendly, and we all had a good rapport (would go out for lunch semi-regularly, etc.).
