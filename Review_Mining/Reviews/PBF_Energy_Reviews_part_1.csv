rating,review
bad,Horrible place to work run for the hills.Management threatens you and yells at you and throws stuff at you. When they are mad I wouldn’t recommend it to my worst enemy.
bad,"Too much inbreeding from both the petroleum industry and Sunoco family. No accountability instilled in the management team, everything boils down to perception over reality. Several benefits are based more on favoritism vs. standard company."
bad,"Bad management, but big money company. New to the commodities game. Managers seem like they have no idea what they are doing."
bad,Only good thing about my job as an operator was the pay. I worked around alot of H2S which can be deadly and constantly had headaches and sore throats working on my at my unit. Management would preach safety during your initial training but once I was sent out to work no one from safety ever came around to see how things were going or just make sure employees felt safe. Some complexes are safer and cleaner then others but it all goes by seniority. But I'm just glad i got out and I dont have to worry about my health being at risk anymore .
bad,"Sets you up to fail by being under-trained moving from role to role. "
good,PBF Energy has been a challenging place to get work done due to micro managing.  Very old facility with decades of technologies.  I did enjoy this for the simple fact of being exposed to so many different eras of instrumentation.
good,PBF is a oil refining company.  It was a start up company that was growing fast learned all about the oil industry
good,The company was very immature in its processes.  The Traders drove a lot of the work and that was not managed well.  The management seemed to be tired.
good,Everyday is different sometimes when you think you’re going in to a normal day before you know it the world seems to be turned upside down that’s when you have to take a deep breath gather your thoughts and work through it
good,"Some management is very good, while others are lacking.  Certainly a place for those who can network, as actual accomplishments are not recognized.  A lot of long hour, including nights and weekends."
good,"This company runs extremely lean with very little excess, you are given significant responsibility and are impactful right out the gate. Can be good or bad depending on your personality, if you require more support and collaborative environment then they are not for you. If you prefer to work independently and thrive under pressure you will succeed."
good,"Look it, if you have a chemical or process operator 2 year degree, PBF is where to work. The Management is fair but that’s all companies are that way. You make 85,000k your first year. Yes you will work long hours, yes you will tired all the time, yes you will miss Christmas and Birthdays but if you want a high paying job with 2 years of College PBF is where to go. $43.00 dollars an hour plus OT is great money. Highly recommend to anyone"
good,"Very busy, enjoyable coworkers that care about getting the job done in the most safe and efficient manner."
good,very nice to work there learned a lot and took all my knowledge and placed it on my job site on a every day  basis miss working with such great people
good,I worked at PBF energy for my 6 month internship. There were tons of different equipment and units that I was able to learn about. Much of my experience and teachings came from shadowing engineers and self motivated inquisition.
good,PBF is a great company that is doing great things in the refining world.  The work can be hard at times but they have a great training program that is done on site
good,Took a contact to hire position here and from day 1 they made me feel like part of the team. Made going to work enjoyable. My manager has a great sole and she made sure to listened anyone with a good idea. Best part...she put great ideas in motion.
good,"As the Summer Intern in the Human Resources Department, one will assist others in the department with anything needed to help the work day go smoothly and get any and all projects finished."
good,I enjoy doing and learning new projects.  The more I learn the better it is for myself to advance within the company.  I'm always willing to take on a new project.
good,"I was just a intern at the safety department, but whenever it was not busy i was able to work with other people in different departments such as process engineering department. Everyone there was helpful in helping me understand the refinery and how it operates."
good,Great place to work. My manager  was the best in handling all problems related to pipelines and its related equipment. He helped me develop leak detection and all other items
good,PBF Energy Inc provided a fast paced learning experience at a growing company.  Employees are given the opportunity to really shine and show case their talents.
good,"its a fun and laid back place to work and possible grow. the benefits are amazing, much better than my old company would recommend to my friends if they needed a job"
good,"Working at PBF (Toledo Refining Company, specifically) means that you will be in charge of your own destiny.  The good is that management gives you responsibilities over a wide area and you are expected to make progress in your area of responsibility and raise up issues that may be road blocks before you are dead in the water.  Days can be unpredictable, but as one becomes more familiar with their job (~5 years or more), the days certainly become manageable.  The bad is lack of top-down corporate structure.  A company that lacks corporate structure may appear that there is limited opportunities for advancement, but you have to speak up!  Your area of responsibility also includes your own career.  If one raises an issue about what he/she wants to do, then management is open to having the conversation.  Overall, a great place to work."
good,"Can be a stressful and dangerous  job but usually a relaxed environment.  Very safety conscience company that seems to be looking out for you.  12 hour rotating shift work sometimes makes you miss family functions, but I love it"
good,"A typical day included walking the units to see what can be fixed. Daily meetings to review current projects and concerns that can be fixed. Workplace culture was great, everyone worked well together. The hardest part of the job was the transition into fast paced work when things come up. Most enjoyable was the work and the people and teams."
good,"I'm happy to work at PBF and I think PBF has a lot of opportunities for individuals who are ambitious and willing to learn."
good,Good place to work with safe track record. Good money if you can come in and learn/do your job. Management can make poor decisions at time but every company has this problem.
good,Excellent.  There is no red tape or politics in this company.  Very good environment and the only focus is refining success.  Senior management is the most knowledgable and practical that I've seen in my 32 year career.
good,PBF is a great place to work. they offer opportunities at every level. the workplace culture is very fast paced but the people are very nice and willing to help and any point.
good,"If you have a college degree and any background in the petroleum industry, this is definitely the best company to work for. The hiring process is difficult and very selective but if you can get through, the pay, benefits and work environment is the best in business."
good,Really dont have many bad things to say. Expect to work 10 hard hrs a day with 1 hr for lunch. Work can often come home with you via cell phones. Members of the team are often responsible for answering calls when not on main shift.
