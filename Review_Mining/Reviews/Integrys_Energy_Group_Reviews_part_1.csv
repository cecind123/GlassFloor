bad,"Don’t waste your time with the project worker position unless you are fine with working years without PTO or any sick days. Upper management and union Both do not care about you and your coeworkers. They will both claim to care about your safety but all they care about is the numbers you produce. It’s all about who you know here so if you do take the position, don’t bother working too hard to get noticed."
bad,"typical day in the peoples gas call center would be horrible. no advancement potential because they choose from whos been there longest... team leaders feel godly but cant assist with issues.. manager will not speak/encourage staff.. schedule based on seniority not production.. the reps who have seniority get priviledges of being off the phone and working so called projects... only assigned to favorites... the ENVviorment was TERRIBle.. reps laughing, cursing, eating in the backround of calls...  reps are slamming mouse into the desk while you are on the phone because the customers upset them.... so glad to have left this place, i highly suggest to consider this before believing this is a savior job, $20 a hour for this headache minus your union dues and commute to heart of the loop are not worth it!!!!!"
bad,"Used to be a nice place to work not anymore mismanaged and very incompetent managers. Friends and family now, just know someone and you're hired. No experience required."
bad,They bamboozle you with career advancement there is no career advancement. The union is a joke and they charge an arm and a leg for union dues. The health care is a joke its high deductible so u cant afford to get suck. when u get hired and start its based on seniority so u will be the last man on the totem pole. Weigh all ur options before u apply see if u can find something better they only care about the money not the customers and definetly not the employees.
bad,"She was more interested in walking out the door for retirement.  She wasn't a good manager and when someone on the team needed help getting into to complete their job, they/we were told that is just how it is.   Good pay but lousy manager.  I was confronted with a lie and tried to defend myself and I was told I lied!!!"
bad,"Mundane, micro management. Phone calls are pure nightmares. Leadership is clicking wouldn't recommend for a career. If you need a job badly here ya go. Great location easy to get to."
bad,"This place is a joke, they offer things they never deliver and because they are under the Illinois Utility gas workers union the ability for career advancements are scarce. First they make you sign a two year contract with the call center so even if you wanted to move up in the company you'd first have to wait 2 years and because its seniority based your performance metrics don't mean anything if you are at the end of that list. The company moral is low and the management team has no clue what they are doing 75% of the time. They take advantage of the fact that they are a indispensable utility and because their services are necessary they do what they want and are only in business of money the customers are just milking cows."
bad,I was working at People's Gas in Chicago. High executives have been driving this company into the ground for decades. The company moves at a snail's pace.
bad,Worked there for two decades. After the merger it became just another cold large corporation. Job security is based on the bottom line. Some of the old managers who are still around are decent people but they can't wait to escape and make it to full retirement. The corporate ethics are superficial and empty rhetoric. If you are female and minority you can use that for affirmative action leverage at this place. It's an old boys club with some token female leaders strategically placed. Watch your back. Psycho divas lurk about. Poseurs’ can flourish in the right department.
bad,This location is still under development and is extremely unorganized. I would recommend waiting another 2-3 years before applying to work here.
bad,There are many story I can tell. I enjoyed the company of my coworker. I have gained great of knowledge.

good,"At times challenging organization to work for (especially since acquisition); however, co-workers are fun and help when challenging issues arise.  The organization does not permit flexible work arrangments."
good,"The work and pay is fair and hours are predictable. They do a good job prioritizing safety. However, corporate does not seem to show remorse for the ""boots on the ground."" If you aren't part of a union they have no problem terminating people for minor issues. Even in a union they try to get people on things. I'd call it a corporate vs laborer culture."
good,The WEC Energy Group is focused on efficiency and reliability in providing energy to their service area. They are eager for individuals to gain expertise in their areas of work and interest.
good,"If you stay, you can make good money and have job security until retirement. In many ways it really is a great job, but if you want to grow, learn, and advance (not just as an individual, but as a company) it may not be the best place."
good,"The hardest part of the job is that I used to love working on projects and challenges they bring as working with the clients to get a working process while having to meet with 3rd party venders to get the product implemented. But the company has changed so now I open up a work request, read the details and then code what is needed. This is no longer what I love to do."
