bad,Es malísimo tanto lo que ganas no sugierop vender para su empresa
bad,I worked at the Zanesville location for 2 years.. you are just a number.. Pick to light.. not brain surgery. The employees are some of the most horrible people ever... Supervisors think they are way better than the average worker... Made to feel like an idiot... Don't work there.
bad,I didn't enjoy the company or the fact of the commission being the way that it was and depending on your age it really depending on how much you could sale for commission. I made everyday 110 percent effort anyways.
bad,"The higher leaders who train only look out for themselves, they mislead and do not train with integrity. The hostile and unpleasant work place is one of the worst company to work for"
bad,"Culture is not great, the hardest part of the job is reaching representatives to actually offer training during 9 to 5. Most people are available in the evening and constantly changing their appointments with you."
bad,Para kazanma şansınız ancak çevrenizdeki arkadaşları kandirmanizla doğru orantılı..Urunler kalitesiz ve firma yönetici takımı tamamen yalancilardan kurulu...Kesinlikle amatör ve is bilmez yöneticiler..
bad,"The lady that helped me get set up as a representative did not stay in contact. I couldn't even reach her. With this being my first go round in sales, I felt like she should at least kept tabs on what I was doing. To give her advice, constructive criticism, & etc. So my experience selling AVON was not the best. But it does work for some people."
bad,"Worst company ever worked for when it comes to treating employees fairly,...inconsistent hours(daily),....different start times , break times , lunch times, quitting times daily poor supervision and management"
bad,Stupid not good working place. Very bad i hated working thete. You have slow ads people. No one wants to go where they are needed. The Nantes have no idea where it what they are doing.
bad,"Deje de vender porque no te deja ganancia. Se pierde mucho tiempo y no se gana nada. Te cobran todo, folletos, muestras, impuestos, gastos administrativos y envíos"
bad,"This is not a good place for employment."
bad,Unhelpful company. All phone lines are in foreign country’s and hard to communicate. Everyone in it for them self meaning very little support is offered unless it benefits the other person. Team leaders not helpful. Not all items 25% commission have to sell certain amount before earning 20% then even more to earn 25% and all branded products are not full commission. Have to pay for all own resources which adds up and takes a chunk out of commission. Only worth doing around Christmas time. Have to work 24 hours to keep customers happy so you don’t really get a break if you want to earn money.
bad,"AVON cosmetics are drug store quality at department store prices.  That's not to say the products themselves are bad, but that the company greatly overcharges for them.  Since most people have figured this out already, selling enough of the products to break even on the cost of catalogues and little paper sacks is difficult at best.  This is not a primary career path, and I wouldn't even recommend it as a side job.  Products often ran out and were substituted without prior warning to the salesperson or customer, which leaves representatives with product that must be paid for that the customer doesn't want."
bad,Avon was a difficult job for me. You should have an outgoing personality when going into this job. You should be familiar with sales and sales techniques. This is not for everyone.
bad,Wykorzystywanie nie winnych zwierzat do testowania kosmetykow na nich
bad,didnt like this job at all. didnt learn anything.nothing was enjoyable. going around asking people if they want to buy some stufff and either trust you with their money or debit card info
bad,"the pay isn't excellent but its depending on how many consumers you get per month"
bad,Para gente que quiera sacarse poco dinero. Si no haces muchas ventas no te sale rentable hacer pedido ya que los gastos de envio corren a tu cuenta y el porcentaje de comisión es minimo
bad,"worth it if you can work it...............it is your business so you make it what you want it to be.  You can set your own hours, and have the freedome"
bad,To each their own... it never hurts to try something out and decide for yourself whether you like it or not. Everybody has their own likes and dislikes so you'd really have to make your own decision if you want to work  at Avon or not.
bad,"Very sad to see such a great company, full of amazing talented people run into the ground by ineffective CEO and clueless "
bad,"Don't bother working for Avon because you will end up paying for the products from your own pocket, because people will order and then say they don't have the money to pay for the item."
bad,lavoro di rappresentanza senza alcuna prospettiva.
bad,"Products were horrible, customer complaints daily, lack of pay, no support and no leadership, managers were no experienced, rude customer service, and no system"
bad,I learned how to work with cash on hand use math skills. It was neat to know how to talk to different people and use my interpersonal and communication skills.
bad,"Didn't have much time to work and get my business out there. It takes a lot of time to market the items. Although Avon does free marketing, its hard to get people to switch from name brand items to Avon."
bad,Avon wasn't the job for me very boring not enough money and not many people buy things for this as there are very pricy and ny paid ad much as I think you should be
bad,"Very little pay from it in my area, as not many people in the areas I was given chose to purchase from the books, no matter how much I tried. As said, not a good job for people who need to pay the bills."
bad,"When I worked for Avon I was told I would have on the job training and would earn a lot of money. I had to learn on my own and ended up borrowing money from my family just to keep my Avon account open, because nobody wanted to buy Avon. You have to basically compete with other Representatives to get customers and have to be able to pay to keep your Representative account open so you can sell stuff."
bad,"Low pay, high demand, high turn over, disconnect with upper management and lower management. reps cant make enough money to stay."
bad,Es una empresa bastante aburrida la cual haces las cosas por tu propia cuenta.
bad,"When you become a representative, you get the assigned area. The assigned area might be impossible for you to cover if you don't have a car, yet the houses you could easily-right next to you might already belong to another rep, but Avont simply does not care. Then they suggest that you sell to your family and friends (never mind if they don't actually live in this country) , and to your colleagues...even though they might already have a rep as well. "
bad,Vendevo ma avevo poco guadagno cioè non si guadagnava quasi niente e non avevi un fisso
bad,"Organización escasa, poca o nula preparación y baja comisión de venta sin ayudas ni medios."
bad,There are so many things to state about avon that I can write a novel. It is a tier based company and doesn't offer many benefits for advancement. Pretty much the more money you have when you come into the company the more customers you will automatically get and the better you will do! Don't believe everything the website tells you!
bad,I would drive around different neighborhoods in search of customers to sale my inventory to. Most  of my days were slow but a lot of customers just wasn't interested in buying.
bad,"I would assist my mother with her sales for Avon while I was in high school. I would take orders, process them and deliver the orders. I was also responsible for distributing new catalogues to clients."
bad,"people ordered and didn't pay"
bad,It is simply impossible to make a living through Avon. You have to chase customers in order to make any sales and most often the sales get returned so you do not make much money.
bad,waste of time barely made any money most of the time i just about broke even. ridiculous targets had to make £85 before you make any money. had to buy all samples and books even though you do all the work you get sod all for your efforts.
bad,Due to constant changes positions have been eliminated and new positions are not clearly define.  Company's sales and Representative count are declining year after year.
bad,"When I have had an order over £400 I have almost all my items ""out of stock"" they won't turn up for months I would never suggest for someone to work with this company."
bad,"I liked working for Avon ok hour's, nice pace job, good discounts​ when your achieved great production on your line nce employee's wanted to work there long-term ."
bad,"Tenho noções com vendas, atedimento ao publico, telefonista"
bad,travail plaisant vu que j'aime le contact avec les personnes j'ai du y mettre fin du faite de ne rien percevoir sur toute les ventes effectuer
bad,"Worst job i ever took! the pay was awful, never could get in touch with any one basically put in hours for nothing at all! wouldn't recommend!........."
bad,"Tengo muy mal recuerdo de mi trabajo en Avon, ya que yo vendía muy bien y mucho y todo el dinero conseguido iba a mi jefa y los superiores a ella, es decir yo hacía el trabajo sucio y algún mes me daban a lo mejor 5 o 3 euros y mi venta era de 300 o así."
bad,avon was ok at least I thought but it wasn't the job for me to many people was selling avon around the area. I sold a lot of products but not enough to make a stable income
bad,"Precisa de mais valorização dos pequenos revendedores, e também é necessário mais formas de crescer na empresa."
bad,Minha experiência de trabalhar na Avon  não foi boa porque não me pagaram só isso
bad,"gerente poco profesional y nadie dice nada, los directivos no hacen nada por la gente que colabora"
bad,"You'll have to do a lot of driving to advertise and give out brochures.  You'll have to pay for the samples and brochures yourself. You will make a percentage off of what the customer pay for once the order is completed. If a customer order something and doesn't pay for it when it returns,just send it back, but you make no money off that sale either."
bad,"The way the system was ran, I had to become my own source and finding members to buy the Avon products. We had to have workshop far away from home, and I did not have reliable transportation. In some cases when customers did not want the product it was the sell representative responsibility to ship the order back and pay for the unwanted merchandise. My overall experience was very stressful."
bad,This job is a fast pace and dive in job. Issues arise its a thing that you need to figure out on own. Support is not there. Its fun to sell the new things and get discounts.
bad,"Avon is the place.to work if u dont wanna leave home"
bad,"Do not become an Avon representative! You have to pay for the catalogues in the first place (they are expensive!), then it is a massive amount of effort to organise the packs to deliver, you then have to deliver the catalogues, leave them then pick them up about 5 days later. It is such a hassle having to go round and pick up the catalogues as lots of people don't leave them outside meaning your have to knock on most people's doors, it's such a PAIN! When you have picked them up you have to order the orders online, the thing is you need at least £80 to make any profit, I have very rarely made this much. Also they test their products on animals! I was appalled to find this out and quit Avon immediately!"
bad,"this is a good company I love their products, but it's not the job to have when you live in a rural area with very little population or a population that is nothing but farmers and ranchers."
bad,"about two four years I work as customer service and I love it because i love answering phone and do paper works and I like helping people and work with them. pure dew its a water company its not a big company its a small one so I work there for like two nearly three years form 2005 to 2007 I love the job I love working there I didn't want to leave but then I have to leave because I just give birth to my son that's why have to leave. Maybe after two years staying home I realise how much I missed working, On 2010 I applied for Avon product company and I got the job so I worked there for like two years then I have to stay home and look after my son and take him to school cause my husband was working so no one has to look after my son. then on 2015 I moved here to Australia to start a new life especially for my son. so on may 2015 I work as a educator at bright start education & service this job is to work with children I love kids, and I am still working there."
bad,"Don't do it unless you're getting a district sales manager or above position"
bad,This job is only beneficial for those who are into commission-based work. I personally did not care for the job cuz i was looking for non-comission work. I soon quit for that reason and found other work. It is good for the right sales person though
bad,"I'm glad i don't work for avon anymore. the earnings were low, the customer number was low and I wasnt happy. I had to quit because I wasnt happy with my earnings and low customer number."
bad,Don't work for avon as a rep you will end up at a loss rather than profit especially if you advance to sales leader etc... Especially if people on your team do a runner with money they earn from sales.
bad,"Sou revendedora e resolvi trabalhar por conta própria."
bad,"Have to invest your own personal money and time into something that doesn't help. Trying to keep up with shipping costs, and ever increasing costs for the books, you are wasting your time and money by joining this cr***y company. I tried for over a year and a half and the only thing I ever got out of it was a lot of garbage to throw out. I got sabotaged by another independent representative who told people who had received and was looking through books with my information on it that I didn't need anymore customers, I was already so busy with others that I wouldn't get their orders correct, that only she could do that."
bad,At first it seems fun till you owe them money for items that where out stock when you order them. This job is a  pyramid scheme covered in glitter and perfume. Just buy the products never sell them lesson learn.
bad,"The Products are wonderful but it is very difficult to make any money.  The ""pyramid"" structure is too top heavy, the customer service answering phones for corporate are not in this country and are very hard to understand.  Phone system is very unfriendly as are the customer service reps."
bad,derliving books to peoples homes collecting them a couple days later  with there orders placing the orders online derlivering orders out collecting money.
bad,"take customers' orders and sell products to clients everyday and is really boring."
bad,"they pay only a set amount of hours and below minimum wage. have to recruit, hold meetings, and customer service along with data entry for the representatives."
bad,I did gain an awareness of the people who lived around me and the things they are interested in. Avon is for fun as it will never pay the bills.
bad,Good products but to many people under saling others with the same items. When the under saling was brought to upper people of the company they just blow it off. As if they did not care about it
bad,"trabajar para la compañia de venta directa a sido muy satisfactorio por que nos permite tener el contacto directo con las representantes y poder darles las herramientas de hacer su propio negocio teniendo ganancias en el tiempo que ella decida. "
bad,i wont work for avon again i didnt make any money from it so i would say its the worst job ever
bad,I realized that I am not a sales person. I did not build me clientele. It was a waste of time.
bad,"normal como todos os trabalhos ,apredir a lidar com todos os tipos de pessoas fisicas ou deficientes a direcao otima nao tenho oque falar meus colegas de trabalho muito legais prestativos adorei conhece-los a parti mas dificil era lidar com as maquinas tinha que ter muito cuidado e atencao e tanbem com os pedidos das revendedoras pra nao colocar errado a parti mas agradavel era quando era elogiada pelo meu trabalho no final do dia assim eu sintia vontade de trabalhar todos os dias sem fazer cara feia ."
bad,"I busted my butt for these people. Did everything I could. I ended up spending more money than I was bringing in. This is a job that only benefits those at corporate. You think you're helping yourself make a little extra money, but you are really helping them. Waste of my time and money."
bad,"I enjoyed  selling Avon very much but if their prices were lower and they upgraded their presentation for the younger customer, i think it would sell better. It supplied my income but the highest i can earn is 50% of what i sell, so if i sell $300 per month, I only make approximatly $100 per month. I would have to sell $1500 per month to actually earn $700 per month. But i did enjoy meeting people thouroughly!"
bad,As i had to work from home this wasnt really a good job as it didnt invovle me working with other people although when handing the products out to the community this but was fun as i was welcomed by all the community.
bad,They call about 5 times a week from different numbers. If you don't put in a order they say they will cancelle you. Never get paid you have to sell $50 or more to get 20%. Over priced items that nobody really likes. This company's a big joke.
bad,"The job didn't pay, but it started at home, you are required to do everything on your own and get the money and put it in by a deadline without getting paid."
bad,"Un puesto donde se notaban choques entre empleados. Mucha competencia entre compañeros. Mucha falsedad, mucha hipocresía, trabajo en equipo nulo. Un puesto cuyo lema sería ""Vende más el que más pisotea a los demás"". Lo más positivo fue la posibilidad de relacionarse con la gente y construir tu propio punto de venta y establecerse autónomamente como vendedor, aunque sin la garantía de obtención de retribuciones por ello."
bad,"Thought it was a good job, but it's actually not. very boring and the pay is the taxes you collect from the products you have sold."
bad,productive and very beneficial company. good company that gives better opportunity
bad,"Aprendir,qui é muito importante trabalhar em equipe"
bad,"bad worst job ever"
bad,chegava muito cansada em casa.não tinha tempo para minha casa e meus filhos e marido eu so aprendir a ver de porta em porta nunca via a direção dessa empresa por que elas não se preocupa com os trabalhadores não tinha colegas de trabalho por que eles se achavam superior a mim era sair sem ter horario para voltar.não tinha parte agradavél por que nunca conheci ninguem la.
bad,"My wife originally  sold Avon. When she took sick I starting to sell it"
bad,Working for Avon was touch and go. At such a young age it was good experience for me to learn that its hard to maintain good report with clientele.
bad,Orders did not come in on time and I had customers complaining to me
bad,"I sold AVON for just over 2 years. In the beginning, I loved being an Independent Sales Rep, but as time moved on, I began actually hating it. "
bad,It hard for outside sales in this small town with so much competition here.
bad,"I really didnt like this job too much because I made alot of money, but I had to keep 10 % of what I made, and that wasn't good, after I put all my hard work into it."
bad,"Talking with a lot of people what they like and what they don't like in the Avon catalog. What they can't have on there skin. Then what like I put in the order online at home. When I get there order's I going out and give them in person."
bad,Avon Sucks! You have to give money to make money but your really not making any money at all
bad,"Aprendi muita coisa, me desenvolvi bastante, mas fui atrás não pude contar com muita ajuda."
bad,Tem melhorar mas e gostoso porque lhe damos com o publico conhecemos outras pessoas etc
bad,long hours for very little money would not work for them again
bad,"My Team Leader was not much help.  Had to learn the ropes on my own. The pay sucks! You only make money when you sell over 1,000 dollars of stuff. Nothing is mentioned before you start"
bad,"trabalhar em grupo, o melhor dia era em epoca de festas, muitas pessoas ocupado esse cargo, demora para entrega"
bad,A waste of time and money.
bad,I learned to not accept a job like this if you don't have another one. You have to pay money in order to get money. My supervisor was great but I wouldn't work for this company again.
bad,"I would take time to learn the Avon business. I completed some courses on line to improve my skills as a sales representative for Avon. Because I was on a tight budget, I was not buying lots of samples and giving many free items away to customers. I had some real good customers who kept their word about paying for their products. Others presented the challenge to even to want to sell to them again, for they were unwilling to pay for their bills, but wanted to keep ordering products. Eventually getting firm with them caused them to decide to no longer want to order from me."
bad,"AVON has a way of taking a shy, quiet person and making them into a person of power and confidence. Selling AVON and signing up other Independent AVON representatives is fulfilling and brightens up my day."
bad,"eu não goste Avon não aumentar salario muito ruim eu trabalha todo dias sabado domingo não ganhar bônus pagamento, eu fique muito doente o líder esta bravo porque pensava mentira não era mentira estou verdade eu estava doente muito passa mal levou para hospital so fica 1 dia e volto logo trabalha não deixa fica descansa casa , eu odiava muito empresa Avon são mau eu sofre muito porque eu não tenho plano carreia eu não conseguir pagar faculdade que eu não vou para começa a escola faculdade porque Avon não pagar metade so eu pago todo. meu colegas acabou morrendo falecendo monte cada pessoas foi menos 9 pessoas por ano que ficou doente a culpa que a empresa Avon trabalha dia todo não parar descansa."
bad,"This is a very time consuming job with less compensation than other sales jobs. Avon passes a lot more of their costs onto their sales representatives now which makes it hard to be profitable. The company is struggling in America and is trying to find ways to adapt in this very competitive beauty sales market. The marketing and sales tools available to you are expensive and are often not up to date with modern technology. Their innovative beauty products are often behind the curve or priced too high to compete with other big name brands. Many fashion items you sell will be returned due to poor quality or construction. Some of their beauty products, like Anew Genics, are now made in China. There is a high emphasis on recruiting new sales representatives."
bad,"Um dia típico de trabalho, inclui calls diários com o regional e diretoria, para posteriormente implementar mudanças no setor, treinamentos, mobilização de pessoas e ações de vendas em campo. Contatar executivas de vendas, promover reuniões e visitas as revendedoras Avon."
bad,"a avon é uma empresa que não dá muito lucro e não é um emprego de carteira assinada por isso não tinha nenhum direito de trabalhadora e nen muitas vantagens apesar de seus produtos que são excelentes, estou a procura de um trabalho bom que dê satisfação, com direitos trabalhistas."
bad,"Be prepared to be a slave. 24 hours/7 days a week/365 days a year. Text messages from Division manager starting at 5.30 am. As a district manager you are responsible for EVERYTHING. Your job is to motivate independent contractors wheather they are interested in being motivated or not. You will become a ""begging"" professional. Constantly begging Representatives to place orders, pay for thier orders and drive many miles all day long looking for new people to sign up to sell Avon. There is a complete disconnect between the field and upper management. They are clueless as to what District Managers are up against. Stay away, terrible place to work. There are many better ways to make a living."
bad,"a typical day was filling out order forms and putting them on in avon books and then going and putting them through doors, and then 3 days later go and pick them up which most werent left out, i didnt learn anything when working for avon, i stopped doing the job as i wasnt earning money we lost money i was told to order more products and to try and sell them at the door and then couldnt so i lost money. i didnt really enjoy doing the job it was alot of work to get nothing out off it."
bad,avon have wonderful products they makes me realise hope good to feel good.avon makes me feel famous and special
bad,Todo el dia buscando a persona para venderle productos.El tiempo lo pones tu el tiempo que quieres estar trabajando.
bad,Il faut avoir un très gros réseau social pour être VRP pour Avon.
bad,"I had a little bit of fun, when working with Avon. It was temporary volunteer to make some cash on the side to pay for some bills."
bad,"I found that the job is very easy and excellent education too! My customers were very well-mannered and I Love It! The hardest part of the job is, not enough sales today."
bad,"This had to be the hardest job in my life. We were assigned our own station to proccess orders becuase it was an assembly line job. They over worked us. we had to do 10,000 orders daily. We worked 12 hour shifts and sometimes more."
bad,Avon is going down the tubes. Treat their employers like kids out of control.
bad,"Far too mamy reps now people see.it as an easy income when it isnt. Reps have no respect for one another and will happily take customers off one another "
bad,"It was a good program when I started, and I have met some amazing people, but the years it has gone down. I focuses a getting more people to sell the products, verses helping the one that have been with the company a good while. They keep changes the products, to be less effective and cost more. The commission level have drop a lot too. The sales managers for each district have disappeared and meeting where we could see And touch the products have been done away with too"
bad,"Awful company to work for, unbelievable targets which unless you hit you're threatened with your job. The management need to understand that not everyone wants to sell Avon and if someone doesn't want to order anything then it's not the managers fault!"
bad,"Anyone who intends to work with Avon, I would recommend doing it as a second job or a part-time job.  The market is very saturated.  You lose money instead of making a profit and the idea is to make money, not lose money."
bad,I would recommend if your just starting in the sales field .you have to spend money too make money here I stayed here too long .it's a home base job you get to meet new people of all walks of life sale products from beauty n health too jewlrey n the holiday you can make a lot of profit .
bad,Eu adquirir conhecimento como trabalhar com cliente.
bad,"I signed up to become a representative, thought it was really great. They told me I would have loads of support whenever I needed it. It was good for a few months but then I started to struggle reaching the £85 target every 3 weeks and so therefore began losing money. (to make any profit you have to spend £85, plus you have to buy all of the brochures and order forms etc). Unless you know hundreds of people its not worth the it!! When I started losing money, no one would give me the help I was promised, I was left on my own, not a clue what to do. Then they started charging me for extra stuff I didn't order, I've lost so much money from it! So I decided to cancel my account, I emailed customer services asking about how to do it and someone rang me back and said it was all sorted for me. I presumed, great, my account was closed and that was the end. But, after all of that I received a message from my area sales manager saying I hadn't put an order in, I told her the situation and she said she was the only one that could close my account. My account is still active and they are still taking my money. "
bad,Vary stuctured workplace environment. Always avaliable to learn and implement new tool. Working environment is great and calture.
bad,"Didn't get enough help in the areas i needed. I wasn't given enough of a big area to be able to get a worthy salary. Only advantage was choosing my own hours. Hardest part of the job was having to deal with customers who weren't compliant with handing books bag, paying for orders on time etc."
bad,"Sending catalogues"
bad,eu ganho muito pouco geralmente ganho trinta reais por mes.eu preciso de um emprego
bad,complicado trabalhar pos não se sabe ate o quanto podemos nos dá todos os dias desligamentos muito complicado se estabilizar
bad,It's an awful and backward place to work.
bad,"I worked in management for Avon for 20 years.  The first 10 years the company was wonderful, beyond amazing.  Had it stayed that way, I would have happily stayed until retirement.  Things turned sour the last 10 years and went downhill fast.  I would never recommend this as a place to work now.  The hours are extremely long, the requirements are higher than possible to meet, the employees are treated horribly    My final two years (before I resigned for my health and sanity), there was never a monthly staff meeting that we did not end up in tears  It was torture"
bad,"Discrimination, overworked, no ethics, didn’t care about employees. The company would lie to customers about sales incentives "
bad,After relocating to another State after being with Avon for quite a while the first thing I noticed here is lack of management at any level. Will not return.
bad,"Dal 2013 sono una Presentatrice AVON e lo sono rimasta finora solo perché ho sempre sperato potesse cambiare, ma alla luce di quanto è successo ultimamente posso affermare con assoluta certezza che non è per niente l'azienda che credevo. Ho perso un sacco di clienti e la causa principale è la poca serietà dell'azienda, in quanto nell'ordine non arriva mai tutto quello che ordino. L'esempio più eclatante è stato quando una mia amica ha ordinato un prodotto a Gennaio e quando mi è arrivato il pacco a casa dicevano che era disponibile appena in Giugno! come se non bastasse, dopo aver aspettato fino a Giugno, mi hanno detto che era esaurito! In più molte volte ho dovuto tirare fuori soldi di tasca mia perché sbagliavano a mettere dei prezzi in alcune offerte e per non chiedere alle mie clienti di pagare di più i soldi dovevo metterceli di tasca mia! "
bad,"Péssima em qualidade de vida."
bad,"Would have enjoyed it as a little extra job. But due to the fact there estimates were off every month and I was having to put money in, out of my own pocket each month to cover the costs it wasn’t worth it. Not only that after ringing them after each campaign about this they couldn’t care less, the last campaign I done was £90 short after collecting in all the money left alone making any commission ! Phoned them explained it said they can set up a direct debit for the remaining to be paid weekly although I still wasn’t happy about having to be out of pocket yet again ! They didn’t do this so instead of contacting me again they decided to pass it onto a debt collection company ! No remorse absolutely appalling ! The little extra job to try make a few extra pounds a month made me out of pocket each month. Never would I recommend it. They also use to muck orders up a lot ! Sending empty boxes etc and I was the one the customer took their frustration out on. Really not worth it, doing all the hard work while they sit back making £100s !"
bad,"I believe selling Avon would benefit someone who has lots of energy and can go 18 hours a day in the beginning of their career. A lot of time and money goes into starting a business and this one is no different. The samples, brochures, books, informational packets, fundraising information all cost money."
bad,Working with the people are fantastic.  Representatives are creative and co workers are some of the best in the world. Home office has no idea what the field entails.  All of the experienced individuals are gone. Everyone new and in for a big surprise I am afraid.
bad,"Horrível, gerente horrivel..."
bad,"We were trained on the values of AVON-trust, respect, humility, belief--this is how we were to be and how to treat others, however AVON does not treat their employees in this way.  "
bad,"Avon salary are good and at par with other multinational companies. A good thing about the Avon company is their commitment to provide oppurtunity for ordinary women who do not have neccessary backgorund in business, sales or people who need extra business. However the benefits are inconsistent and HR does not accountability and archive  of old discussions about job offers etc. Management direction is inconsistent and organizations fold or magnify based on unstable business performance. This is not a company for women as there is no work/ life balance. Work continues until weekends and holidays even employee is physicaly not in the office or taking legal vacation leaves. It is traditional company that is 30 plus years in philippines yet have slow adaption to technology, proper I.T infrastructure and business processes. GMs get replaced every year. Organization very political."
bad,Avon tinha na época que eu trabalhei lá as responsaveis pelas vendedoras não cuidavam bem delas
bad,7/24 - 168 - no rest for the weary
bad,I didn't realize that AVON was only commission baised so I would end up with little to no cash every month. In the time i worked there i maybe made $200.
bad,"Non è un lavoro che ti permette di vivere, provvigioni troppo basse almeno a livello di presentatrice semplice. Non posso parlare per i livelli più alti poiché non sono mai riuscita ad arrivarci."
bad,"This company allows you to have an interaction with various people, and gain customer service and sales skills. They also provide an employee discount, and ability to create your own schedule."
bad,"-Pésimo ambiente laboral en el departamento de marketing (no en otros)."
bad,When I began my career with avon it was a wonderful place to work. With the recent Cerberus acquisition it has all gone down hill. The Director runs Avon with a dictatorship/authoritarian mentality. The company is losing money every quarter so HR is out to cut heads in order to save the bottom line. Run run run away as fast as you can.
bad,"Its a dead business model, lack of a well defined strategy combined with poor management makes it a stressful place to work in. "
bad,"I have been an Avon Rep for a year. Things were going fine until recently when I received a notice that I have $59 on my account that needs to be payed off. This was quite interesting to me since I have not placed any orders, but I payed it since it was a debt collector who contacted me about it, and I didn't want to mess up my credit. When doing research on how to cancel my account I learned from other reps that having mysterious charges placed on your account is actually quite common. Their representative support team is also awful and not at all helpful. Would not recommend working here to anyone."
bad,"I began working for Avon in June, had quit by September as I didn't actually earn any money! Paid a £10 start up fee, was constantly harassed by managers, items missing from orders and customers refusing to pay for items. After all this, I recently received a £70 bill from Avon for things I haven't even ordered as I closed my account. They are now telling me this will affect my credit rating if not paid, so by becoming an Avon rep I am £80 down rather than having earned any money! Ridiculous. Don't bother signing up."

bad,"This company is going downhill. They can't keep anyone over a year or two maximum. I was here about 3 years and pretty much I worked with different people every year because of the employee turnover. Most people leave here. There is no room for advancement. Marketing has to deal with a poor business model that continues to sink this company. The sales are bad, leadership is poor, CEO was recently voted out. Stay away unless you are desperate."
bad,"The hardest thing about working with Avon was not being able to speak to management about anything. Avon never wants too take responsibility for the wrong merchandise they send or, for them adding items to your receipt and charged you for, and they can not provide any proof of the item every being put down. Avon doesn't care that they set your merchandise outside your house, allowing it too be presented too anyone who drives by are able to stop and pick it up. If you report this happen well they don't care better find out who didn't and a story to tell your customers.  The best experience I had was delivering great customer service and meeting new people. Also i'm a very ambitious and self motivated and love being a sales representative. I've learned you really should make sure the job you pick is a trusted company and they people you are working with will be there when you need them. I love being a sales representaive."
bad,I work independently.
bad,Expected work week 24/7/365 days a year. Even if you reach your District quota that's not enough! Upper managment has no idea what their Division Managers are doing nor do they care! No help at all from Division Managers they have the sink or swim attitude.
bad,"The company went public during my tenure, the company changes and the pay structure were unrealistic and took all the fun and excitement out of an otherwise amazing experience."
bad,"Necesitas captar muchos clientes ya que el porcentaje de lo que ganas con lo que vendes es muy poco, además no hay cartera de clientes proporcionada por la empresa. Es una marca conocida, por lo que eso es un punto a favor. También te pones tu propio horario."
bad,Avon is only good for a stay at home mom. They don't pay a lot and whatever you do make your buying books and samples. There is no advancement and you can work full time but only make some money. The company is ridged so the higher ups make tons of money while the sellers make a bit. Only took this job to make a few extra dollars and the discount on the products.
bad,"The job it's self is great, you get allocated your work for the day / week so you are able to plan you daily or weekly work to ensure I work efficiently"
bad,"It was an easy job, but if the machine broke down you had to wait till it was fixed, and sometimes we wouldn't be home till 7 or 8 and my babysitter was only available till 5. It wasn't worth the long drive making 8.50 hr"
bad,This is not a good job for earning a good living of money. Whatever you earn you get 12% however when you have to buy your own equipment and other serving products you lose more money than you earn.
bad,this statement seasonal to winter month sep threw march poor income can't find a lot of customers sadly can't make profitable sales you pay out of pocket instead sadly. recruitment most people give you the runaround put in more then you get out high hopes bad optimism you still run face first into the dirt that's around  winter months. spring summer and fall you got better chance 4-5 months out the year it's a no go for sure. its seasonal.

Ehen I called Avon headquarters I was told it was my problem. They care about their profit and no one else.
bad,"With the restructuring of the company and changes to the job description repeatedly, they have put so much pressure on district managers that the goals have now become unachievable and unattainable. The job description is to remain in your home and run all the sales while training over phone and still recruiting new reps to make goals. "
bad,"Un trabajo normal de un comercial."
bad,"this was a self employed job as i was working from home, however there was no motivation at all and the bonus you get is not worth it at all. this job is good to gain some experience through customerr service and paper management and also for someone who wants to earn some money while being at home and is looking for flexible work"
bad,well I liked working with Avon it was a good job but was really my thing . I enjoyed it heaps meeting a lot of new people but I thought to myself to move on with something that I will enjoy more . The hardest part was knocking on doors then people telling you to go away .
bad,"This company is pretty much based on how well you can sell and put yourself out there. The fee to start is very affordable very you must work very hard to make sales. You do learn a lot about beauty and skincare, but if you don't put the effort to make money then you won't make money"
bad,"uma empresa de grande porte, mas sem estimulo de crescimento."
bad,Not fun. You get lied to. You need to sell about over 1000 dollars to make anything
bad,"The way i felt about Avon, dont get me wrong i loved selling the products to people but, Avon just isnt the right job for me. They charge me more then im recieving so there's really no profit there and they keep messing up the prices on my orders."
bad,"This company can give favorable salary and benefits, but you have to compensate it with long hours at work. Office politics is high. It's a young population, so expect some immaturity of some managers and co-workers. Technically, sales and finance-driven only being a direct selling company. Everything for HER, so management has no time to hear out its own employees."
bad,A typical day of work consisted of welcoming greeting coming into the office along with a fast-paced call center environment. Management met with us frequently for reviews and they generally were very informative to assist us in meeting or exceeding our goals.
bad,The old Avon was a great place to work for. However New Avon LLC ruined the whole company. Upper Management had no clear direction for the company. Very deceitful management. We were asked to perform our job without the necessary tools.
bad,"My experience with avon was partial. It was great to be able to get out and meet new people, as well as, create my own website and business cards. It was also a great opportunity to learn more about customer service. However, it did begin to become time consuming at all hours of the day and it was hard with a small child. You get what you put into it."
bad,"I have been a representative for Avon for 1 year now and I will soon have to stop doing it. I do this along side another full time job, which I was told would be suitable as I could work whatever hours suited me."
bad,"Working for Avon, like any other job, has its benefits and its disadvantages. With this job, there were no set hours (unless I set them myself), and typically no quotas to meet. However, you truly need to have an eye for sales and keep at it. Starting out, I loved working for Avon. My mother was a sales rep for Avon, and we were both avid customers before working for them. I was trained to be a very decent sales person, and for a little while, I was in Leadership and had two people working under me. But I was never able to recruit enough people to earn a salary check, so everything was commission (my pay depended solely on my sales). Most of the time I struggled financially, but not because of my sales... but because the company began taking more and more than what was intended. I couldn't even eat off my pay, and it was every two weeks. The hardest part was the randomness: every campaign yielded varying results, customer-wise. The most enjoyable had to be getting to demo the products, the discount, and occasionally traveling."
bad,"en mi experiencia laboral , avon es buena empresa pero la ganancia que tienes es minima , pero tienes la responsavilidad como en cualquier trabajo , horarios de entregan y retiro de productos como tanbien de pagos ."
bad,"Too many hours for the compensation.  Company will probably be bankrupt by end of year.  Co-workers as I are over worked, over stressed and constantly concerned about loosing their job.  "
bad,i loved working for Avon but i didn't make enough for the amount of work i put into the job. But it gave me awesome people skills .I'm a people person anyways but it helped me learn how to deal with an unhappy customer.

bad,"as with any other work at home business, you make your own hours which is the best part. You get to preview new products and be in the know. There are loyal customers to Avon but  are not very reliable with payments. You have to be charged for your order and some of the customers will not pay until they receive their order which is difficult especially if you do not have the funds. you only get 20% of  commission if you make over a certain amount."

I was doing ALOT of order placing for them but just didn't seem like I was making anything. I also found it hard to NOT buy anything for myself. It just wasn't worth working for them.

bad,stopped doing avon because the pay wasnt good enough. spending time doing something thats not worth it when your a single stay at home mom is hard to get paid 50$ a week.
bad,I liked this job because i got to work from home and i loved seeing people feel good about themselfs once they recieved the product they ordered they all were satisfied.
bad,I learned to pack and inspect. A typical day at work consist of you standing at one machine performing one job. The most enjoyable part of the job was the employee discount.
bad,"It was a good experience for my first job. I never had to leave my home and i was my own boss. I learned to manage money and most of all learn to be responsible. The hardest part of my job at first was trying to get customers to order my products. The most enjoyable part was making my money, keeping my customers happy."
bad,"Not many people were interested in buying any products, I wasn't taught how to be a great representative, and I had to buy my own merchendise in order to sell things."
bad,"Fast paced and need to be adaptable to changes that occur frequently"

bad,I have always enjoyed selling Avon it's very fun I learned to provide great service to many different people and I met new people every day every one should try and sell the products
bad,I have supplied feedback during my exit interview process. I trust that corrective action is taken for future employees. As a whole I met great people at AVON and have some good memories of my time there.
bad,Avon was a  for a small period of time. I enjoyed it  while it last but however it was not for me because I live in a rural area and it mke it hard to make sales.
bad,If you don't already have clientele it isn't worth it. Its not worth selling Avon at all. In order to start selling Avon you have to pay a registration fee that really doesnt supply you with products to sell.
bad,The company recently eliminated the District Sales Manager and Division Sales Manager position.  A position that has helped the company for over 100 years
bad,"Empresa não dava  Vale transporte  e não a sinava carteira de trabalho e não dava assistência is trabalhando, e tinha que bater as netras e recrutar novos revendedoras."
bad,Am prezentat un catalog de produse. Eu preluam toate comenzile .
bad,"I really didn't enjoy working as an Avon sales representative, because I found the support to be shocking and someone from roughly the same area as me was doing part of my round without permission. So I ended up just giving Avon catalogues to friends and family members, then I wasn't earning from it either, because I had to pay out for the brochures and everything else that I needed."
bad,"Avon to me is a type of job that is for fun. This is a hard job as well. You have to spend a lot of money for the brochures every two weeks in hopes that someone will put in an order since you have to put in a minimum of $50 every 2 weeks in hopes to try to make a little commission every so often. In order to make this a job that pays your bills and you can live off of it full-time and support your family you have to spend a lot, throw parties, recruit others to sign up and sell."
bad,"I had fun being able to work with beauty products, but the management and trust issues with their employees really took a toll in the workplace. There were no benefits and barely any hours were given to the employees"
bad,It was fine just a bit to much for customers that couldn't afford most products so it wasn't easy earning. since I wasn't earning much from it I had to leave and they over charged for postage which I had to pay out of my own money and benefit
bad,"Trabajas tanto por tan poco, la ganancia es poca los producto son caros"
bad,"I , Myself found this job hard because i was only working under a commission which was something i was not happy with as i was in need of weekly income. I find myself being hard working and confident in all tasks i do and hope to be ale to find something better for me to do."
bad,i didnt work here long because it was through a temp agency but the short time i was here was nice.
bad,"Yes, I love AVON products and I have been using them since 2003 and selling since 2010 and I went up to presidents club twice, but when I had an accident and had a surgery, they put me down like a new seller. we don't earn much money and the business products for us are very expensive so what you earned could be used in samples and books. very sad"
bad,Un lavoro che facevo tempo perso mi dava modo di stare insieme agli altri ....è soprattutto con quello che guadagnava mi compravo i  prodotti ma non guadagnava molto....
bad,I didn't really get many sales because of another competitive sales representative. I also would not recommend working for them. If there were more benefits and more people who wanted to buy Avon then maybe.
bad,"Buen equipo de trabajo, te reconocen las ventas cuando superas las requeridas, siempre mi lider esta atenta a mis dudas, muy organizados a la hora de enviar las boletas con los pagos"
bad,Moving up with the lower management is easy but you will need some kind of degree (Art degree or something none job related) to go any higher. HR doesn't really do anything but make roles and lay off. They will not know anything about your pay or benefits. Benefits that are getting less and less at this job site. Not a union but is treated sometimes as such. They are more opt to replace their workers with temps as they have Randy Staff inside the building. They are also not doing well financially so in the past four years they have laid off several employees replacing them with temps. The company is going under in the USA only their stocks show promise in other countries. Not a place you are looking to retire from as they watch your time and when you get close to that 100% in for retirement they place you on the lay off list. They lay off twice a year.
bad,I was rushed to meet requirements of my peers to be compensated by commissions only. I was informed of a based salary and did not receive adequate pay for my services.
bad,"You are your own boss.   You can work anytime.   The thing is, once you hit bottom, it's hard to go back up again.   That's what happened to me.   I don't have the motivation to sell anymore anymore, also, because I don't want to go ""chasing"" after clients anymore!   It is very tiring,"
bad,"Boa. Gostei da empresa, gostei do ambiente bom lugar para se trabalhar. Ainda mais sendo terceirizada ótimo local transporte bom."
bad,"antes valia la pena ahora  todo son pegas y a peder  nosotros lo que pasa que  yo con 16 años me  hize distribuidora  para  ayudar en casa,y tengo 52 y sigo por que  tengo mi  clientela y no tengo  trabajo pero se gana muy  poco y  todo son problemas,a la hora de cambios aparte que ya no es  tan barato  y hay  mucha  copetencian te  cobran hasta los  catalogos osea ganacias para ellos nada más  antes si valia l a pena,"
bad,"Taking peoples personal orders on a number of products"
bad,"What I have learned is to always have supplies, It is very important in knowing what your clients like and what they dislike just so you know their best interest."
bad,"otherwise you are simply lucky to break even. I quit with a team of over 300 recruits because I felt that I was ""tricking them"" into making money, that wouldn't happen. High stress, phone rang off the hook constantly, tax season was a nightmare, cost almost $700 to file."
bad,"My typical day with avon"
bad,"Une heure de description de travail pendant la signature du contrat, ventes au porte à porte, pas de salaire fixe, contrat VDI,"
bad,"Avon is a good ""job"" for someone who is already set in a home with their children already out of the home. For a single mother and full time student, this was not what I needed. I am looking to start my career, not a little job."
bad,"muy cansado, debido a que son muchas horas caminando, y no se corresponde las horas con el pago."
bad,I had to build my clientele and had no coworkers and no management. I was solely on my own. I did not make enough money to cover my bags and other products that I had to buy.
bad,"Working for Avon was an interesting experience. At first it seemed like the ideal job, due to flexibility and gaining experience, but I soon had troubles. My customers found it difficult to understand the order and payment schedule, despite my persistent efforts to make it as simple as possible for them. It began to get difficult so I resigned and began looking for a stable occupation. Although I will forever be grateful to my amazing manager for giving me the amazing learning opportunity and the confidence of knowing I can preform tasks accordingly and efficiently."
bad,In order to grow you have to sell your butt off!! Nuff said!! If no one orders from you then you make no money!! I had many times where I either had missing items in my order or was charged for things I didn't even order!! Ugh
bad,"I learned its not what you know its who you know in this business.   Hardest part is getting customers with no help from the team I was working with.  I enjoyed being around the beauty business, like playing with new products, makeup."
bad,"I sold Avon Products from a book. Makeup, Kids items. I did not make any money selling Avon Products. I used more money out of my pocket and did not get much out of selling Avon."
bad,"this used to be ""the company for women""."
bad,"Zero work life balance"
bad,Pienso que en un despacho se olvidan por completo de su vida personal
bad,"Cansativo"
bad,"I used to stay in the President's Club every year, however, when the economy tanked, so did my Avon. Don't have co workers to deal with. The hardest part of job is getting people to call me with their orders on time.  Most wait till the very last minute to call me and then some don't even get them in on time to get them order until the next go round. The most enjoyable part is looking at the new products and getting a little extra cash."
bad,"Poor Management fro Corporate office, co-workers great, representative great. Learned  a lot about time management. Goals setting. Managed over 700 Representatives in 1.5 million dollar market"
bad,"It just wasn't a job for me. I liked being my own boss, but at the same time it was hard to meet up with the quotas by myself. I was buying more than I was selling and I was younger than so I didn't have the mindset I do now."
bad,"working hours were good."
bad,"Muitas iniciativas sem foco, as pessoas são o ponto forte, direcionamentos sem futuro"
bad,Iv learned to work hard for my money and how important customer are. The co-workers are friendly people with the aim to succeed in selling every product. The hard part of the job is that not every customer will be back for more services or products and that they do not purchase every week or month. I enjoyed meeting new people with different personalities.
bad,"You sell lots of items, It's a great place to work, the people were nice, it was very enjoyable."
bad,"e muita responsabilidades, apredi lidar com pessoas, meu colegas de trabalho muito legais"
bad,"I'm not a fan of Avon, as a means to support myself. There wasn't enough customers in my area to give me profit. I spent more in gas working than I made."
bad,"I found out very quickly that to be successful in this business you have to put in a lot of work, more than the average 9-5 type of day.  A lot of the work had to be done after hours and on weekends, especially when delivering orders and collecting payments."

bad,"A typical day would be trying to find people who are interested, or people that are in their homes in order to get the money from. I have learnt that people are not interested in Avon. I haven't met many co- workers, only the one as I email her if I need any help. hardest part would be finding people who are interested and the most enjoyable would be getting makeup."
bad,I enjoyed working for Avon until every order was mistaken because of the senders of the items. My buyers are typically angry with me because of Avon.
bad,"Working for AVON was difficult. The benefits were low; more of my money was getting put into the business rather than me gaining a profit. Although I did get offered cheaper products to purchase for myself with a discount. "
bad,"best part of the job is the people in your day-to-day that you help make a difference for.  worst part is the work-life balance, it doesn't exist.  Too much pressure from corporate to perform to what they want, not what is practical for nature of the business.  You feel beaten down after awhile, hard to maintain a positive attitude.  Not the same company it was 10 years ago.  Really has gone downhill."
bad,"I delivered brochures, spoke to customers, compile order forms on line and deliver goods. This experience has helped me learn about using my initiative, confidence with talking to people and an understanding of customer service."
bad,You end up putting more money in to Avon than you eventually get out it was fun ordering and sorting goods out but I wouldn't do it again .
bad,this sort of a job is good for those who want to develop their confidence skills.
bad,A lot of turnaround and lack of direction from senior management.
bad,"The commercial for being in your own business with the Avon company are more of a scam to me. The Avon business is more work for little to no commission and it takes a toll on your wallet, your family, and your life."
bad,"collecting orders, taking money and delivery of product meeting new people setting your own hours"
bad,"Um dia dinamico cheio de espectativas que exige muita comunicação e capacidade de persuação, todos os dias crio vinculos de confinça com a equipe, a gerencia da um bom suporte de trabalho, a falta de estabilidade financeira desmotiva porém a flexibilidade no hórario é muito boa."
bad,"Company is reporting lower quarterly earnings, thus responding in a reactive mode rather than in a proactive mode."
bad,"Sales and based off commissions, you will not get much if you make small sales. But I learned how to talk to customers and encourage them to make purchases."
bad,"Athough my 5 years at Avon were filled with learning experiences, I cannot say I would recommend this position to anyone. If you want to succed and make your goals, one must be ready to work 15 hour days including the entire weekend. If one does not do so, they will fail. My typical day started at 5:30 am reading and answering about 70-100 emails per day. Then there were the voice mails from my Divisional and reps and the assignments that were due from upper management. The direct management rating is a toss up; one can get a great boss and one can get a most challenging one; I had both. The hardest part of the job was making the goals in 2 weeks; they are unattainable and too elevated to be reached. The most enjoyable part was meeting SO many wonderful people. Some of them I admired for their tenacity and work ethic, some of them for their love for life and some for just being incredibly good people."

bad,"I have been selling Avon for 13+ years and it's gone through so many changes. The biggest change was doing away with District Managers and local meetings. Now you have no idea who sells in your area. Nobody local to turn to with questions or concerns. We are basically on our own. New reps don't get credit and have to prepay their orders. Discounts are hard to get unless you sell more than $400/campaign. New campaign every 2 weeks. Profits are low, and no type of leadership to encourage you or work with you. I'm ok since I'm established and have my customer base. But would not encourage new reps to sign up, unless they don't care about the money."
bad,"Was still growing and didn't yet understand the fundermental of work place , workingv to much , adapting to new product changes, not having constant clients etc. I was not even office based with limited resoursed then so i didn't put much value  to the job, thou I did good as I would get motivated by the other Sales Rep"
bad,pouco dinheiro e muito trabalho. falta de reconhecimento
bad,"Pocas politicas y procedimientos para llevar a cabo la correcta ejecucion de las actividades realizadas, ademas de objetivos sin tropicalizar."
bad,"Es horario libre"
bad,It is a very good job if you have motivation and determination to be your own boss. It takes a lot of time and effort. The advancement benefits are good and they constantly have new incentives for their employees.
bad,"Aprendi muito "
bad,"Nella mia tipica giornata lavorativa da presentatrice Avon, ero solita organizzare e gestire innanzi tutto la mia pagina Facebook, tramite la quale pubblicizzavo i prodotti dell'azienda. "
bad,"It was enjoyable due to meeting new people"
bad,Selling was a good experience for been my own boss. Building my own clients to sell the products to. Having a good relationship with the customers. Learning the the products your customers enjoy.
bad,"Avon the company for woman really isn't  the company we all perceive it to be.  Avon suffers from fiscal woes, non loyalty to their employees a cloak and dagger approach to vital information to their employees.  I was very disappointed by the company that I perceived as an iconic beauty brand."
bad,"Networking and speaking with people from different backgrounds, getting to now them and asking what sorts of products they would be interested in. Assisting, advising and using product knowledge and initiative to select the possible best product for each individual."
bad,every one would go to there station and fill there orders some days you worked 6 hrs and some you worked 10 hrs  i was told it was a full time job and it wasn't
bad,"I was a sales representative. I showed my friends and neighbors all about avon products, and convinced them to buy products."
bad,Fun job but the pay is not all that great because if you living in a small area most people already had an AVON rep. I stuck with AVON for 2 years with the customers I already got. After 2 years I just call it quit and now looking for something that pays an hourly rate instead of selling an product.
bad,gestores nada profissional.Tirando isso é muito bom. As pessoas são muito difícil 
bad,"The work is sufficient, the products are good and the customers are friendly but it is inconsistent, the pay is low, management are never there to help, the brochures have to be bought by myself, there is hardly any opportunity to advance to a higher position, customers are not always reliable."
bad,"A typical day for me I would go around posting in catalogues with an order slip to say when I will pick them up and when delivery is to everyone in my assigned area. I would also sometimes pop into my regulars some samples of things that I think they would might like and would write a note with to say for example if they spent over £10 I would give them a free gift. I am a single parent of one so it fits in very well around my daughter who has now only started school. I always try to set myself little targets and try to make up some ideas how to get more customers or ideas to keep the customers I already have. The hardest thing about working for Avon is these days a lot of people are doing it and a lot of the time I do not make anything especially after I have brought the catalogues, samples and incentive gifts so it isn't a reliable income."
bad,Garantir que as revendedoras recebam os produtos
bad,montagem de kits e abastecimento qualidade em trabalho só para empresa.
bad,"nao tive oportunidade de crescimento. aprendi a trabalhar com p público e a falar bem em público, os gerentes não estimula a equipe, os colegas de trabalho não tem animo. o mas dificil foi me esforçar e não ser reconhecida. o mas agradavel foi conhecer pessoas diferentes."
bad,the worst part was not getting paid. also going out late at night to collect money for the orders.
bad,Avon is a good company to work for. There isn't a lot of opportunity for advancement unless you are willing to relocated often.
bad,"Maior interação com público e clientes,melhor desempenho com negociação e atendimento. Acesso a gerência e supervisão com muita facilidade."
bad,Avon is not really a job if your customers are not willing to pay. Avon pays you a commission in which you can't afford to buy groceries for a month. This is more of a part time job
bad,eu nao aprendi nada la so aprendi que tem que puxar o tapede de alguem se qyuser ficar lça
bad,"As a Sr art director at avon we would present concepts for campaigns every 2 weeks. There were multiple creative teams working on individual campaigns at any time. Wide range of different projects, from fashion to beauty to houseware and mens grooming. "
bad,The employers are Delight they are very friendly and supportive but it is an independent sales position so you're pretty much working for yourself but at a commission base percentage
bad,So glad I was able to retire when I did. They let all the District Sales Managers go with 29 days notice. Some were very close to retirement when they let them go.
bad,"Tive uma péssima experiencia na empresa; Na época, os gestores nao tinham limites e enviavam mensagens aos finais de semana e de noite. Nao fui respeitada como deveria e a cobrança por atividades que nao eram de minha responsabilidade foi muito estressante."
bad,"Working for Avon was fun and flexible, you get to interact with different people everyday selling Avon and trying to convince them why there is a need for the product."
bad,Trabajo estable comodo sin problemas pero hicieron cambio de personal y los jefes de plata toman en cuenta más a familiares que profesión
bad,"Door to door sales, but people usually didn't pay on time so I had to pay the merchandise up first and sometimes had to stay with the merchandise because people never paid me back, so I was basically losing money instead of gaining."
bad,i didnt like it. working for yourself you have to keep up on all the math and paperwork that needs to be done you dont get reimbuirsed for gas or food or anything and it works out percentage of what you sell
bad,l'ambiente lavorativo era molto tranquillo ma la supervizione era molto precaria
bad,"Working with great friends as a team and making the day enjoyable."
bad,Falta reconhecimento profissional e cumprimento de propostas.
bad,Ate hoje eu nao sei o porque do meu desligamento da empresa.
bad,Talking to the clients and selling them products that they like. I had to make sure they pay for their products and order them correctly and making sure when they arrive bring them to the clients so they can be satisfied. I had to make sure my clients were happy with the products they receive.
bad,tenia que vender mucho para ganar ..  no me convenia
bad,Its ok if you have another place of work to fall back on but i wouldnt do it to live off of. Products are great for the most part. Person I work with is really nice.
bad,"Brilliant selection of products. Overall for the work put in to sell, the pay is very dissapointing especially when you are told you will get paid much higher. Not bad for a little side job for a bit of extra cash."
bad,Avon in Springdale is closing their returns department. I was permanently laid off.  Avon should have treated its long term employees with more compassion and ethical behavior.
bad,If sales is something that one likes than yes one can enjoy it. If not it will be difficult it will be boring and it will be something one will not want to continue doing.
bad,"My day as a District Sales Manager would start out with emails, returning phone calls, looking at my KPI's to see how I was tracking daily for the 2 week campaign.  I would then go to different locations in the Districts to meet with representatives and recruit new.  After dinner I would be checking e-mails, making phone calls to confirm my next day appointments. I would have 2 sales meetings per month.   I was always prepared to talk about Avon 24/7.  Saturdays would be days to work events with representatives.  I learned to be very flexible and adapt to change because my days changed with people canceling and corporate having last minute webinars.  I always had plan B.  My favorite part of my job was motivating and showing people how they could change their life with this business.  The hardest part was letting go of the ones that I could not motivate.  The most enjoyable part was the relationships I built through my 32 year journey."
bad,it was a years contract the environment was okay but the coworkers aerent as nice i was a cashier there for a year and i couldnt go back because of the year i had to reaply and once i did i didnt get called back
bad,"Avon Products has been around for more than 100 years, and the products nearly sells itself. The brochure is what the customer makes their selection from. The company now has new owners and everything has changed. The customers are turning to other purchase avenues."
bad,muito facil bom pra ganhar um dinheiro extra facil de vender
bad,"a parte mais dificil é conquistar os clientes, e quandi falta os produtos pedidos"
bad,"Hacer tu propio negocio, saber gestionarte, administrarte, organizar tu horario, trato con los clientes."
bad,"we enjoyed every single day of communication to the other people specially the women,we always do our job well as long as we can offer them very well."
bad,"Aprendí a tratar con las personas."
bad,"You meeting different people, making friends. Meeting other sales representatives. Learning about face and body health issues. Showing what is in the new books and all the sale items. Getting to buy things on a discount."
bad,Great company but I was working for free no payment. Very easy job to do. If anyone is interested but becareful I had to use my own money and credit to pay for orders
bad,"Self Employed basis. Low earnings. No room for improvement."
bad,In this company I learned that if you want to earn enough money you need to be persuasive and move fast. In relation with co-workers you don't have to deal with them practically because in a way you are your own boss. The hardest part of this job was make the clients pay for what they consume.
bad,"Free time job.Based on promotion and selling cosmetics and many other different stuff like clothes.underwear,jewelry."
bad,"Empresa grande, tão grande que não conhece, quem la trabalha."
bad,"there isnt an hourly wage. You're paid about $.10 for every dollar you make which isnt much unless you sell about 100 items."
bad,this was just something to do on the side. didn't really make money. was just a thing for me to do while still or at the time of me being a stay at home mom.  needed something to do.
bad,"Trabalha na avon  não e ruim ,porem as oportunidade de crescimento são poucas ,e o salário também não compensa ."
bad,I sold avon to my family and friends and did partys to sell the products
bad,its easy to deal about this cause almost everyone used the products and known at the market.
bad,"In this job I must to delivery avon brochures , to found the clients and to order them orders.I pay the bill and I have 20 % from all receivables."
bad,"Os dias de trabalhos são dias contínuos de  pressão psicológica, aprende e estou exercitando ter e manter o equilíbrio sob pressão, a gerencia imediata procura fazer sempre o melhor que esta ao seu alcance. minhas colegas ate o presente momento são profissionais, estabelecer ou seja, recrutar revendedoras novas em uma área desgasta onde em cada rua , beco, viela ja possui duas, três,ou mais revendedoras com um meta altíssima para realidade do cotidiano e o que recompensa é o lidar com  a pessoas, atende-las, solucionar suas demandas."
bad,My time working was very difficult. Not much help needed at all. I just jumped right in it with no training.
bad,"I worked with the AVON company off and on for about 4 years. I never made any profit from it because with the money I did make from customer orders, I had to use it to pay for my brochures and other business supplies. I had several customers who wanted to return products and AVON asks that their representatives pay for return shipping and I wasn't always able to afford that. Also, it was hard to get a hold of my upline (managers) due to the fact that they had full-time jobs on top of their AVON businesses. I did enjoy going to the monthly meetings but the district managers really push the idea of buying preview products and I don't think it's necessary especially if it's something you know you won't be able to resell. They do offer incentives and trips but it's very difficult to sell enough product to earn those."
bad,A typical day at work was going to house to house sale Avon products. I learned doing Avon sales is hard to do on own. The hardest part of the job was to sale products. I didn't enjoy the job at all.
bad,"You are your own boss, you set your own hours, and you make the amount of money you wish. You are responsible to find your own cliental, the more clients you have the more money you will make."
bad,"It's more like a side job where you can make some money. You get paid by how much you sale. The more value your sales come out to be, the more percentage you get from it. (up to 50%)"
bad,"Ever since they rejected the COTY's offer, Stock went down to 15 bucks from 30 bucks, All employees are insecure and Ethic less."
bad,"Fun, but they are constantly out of items, that YOU have to explain to your customers, the profit made off sales is pathetic, unless you make it your life and have a ton of reliable customers. Not worth the hassle, unless using it as a hobby."
bad,"Minha avaliação foi boa ."
bad,"Εύκολη αρχή αλλά δυσκολία κατοχύρωσης πελατών και εξέλιξης, Καλή λύση σαν επιπλέον εισόδημα."
bad,"What was once a company that people were proud to be associated with has sadly become a company that people are leaving off their resumes. Or, they are hanging on to their better-than-average salaries until the company literally implodes. "
bad,"Not bad, but not great.  Doing a migration of moving servers to a new location, have some issues with personnel on both company with their turf wars, they need better management"
bad,"Working for Avon was not a good experience for me. I found the company to be dishonest and revealing with the way they dealt with product returns, and everything was to the advantage of the company. I also found some of then Avon leaders were very rude and competitive with everyone."
bad,I would not recommend anyone to work there because they never gave me any hours or right amount of pay isn't worth the hours or the pay I will never do it again
bad,Considero que es una empresa a la cual hay que invertir mucho dinero y tiempo para adquirir productos. No se recibe formación externa. Se basa en la autoformación y los beneficios son muy bajos
bad,"Buen ambiente laboral la gente es muy amable pero hay veces que no todos cumplían y quedaban morosos ,Avon te da  la posibilidad de crecer sin necesidad de moverse de casa (muy útil para estudiantes o amas de casas con la necesidad de incrementar sus ingresos ) pero no tiene muy buena paga"
bad,Avon is going through some major upheaval currently and their structure is changing. Once they get balanced out again it will again be a great place to work.
bad,Scarsa possibilità di guadagno e di carriera. Pochi clienti interessati ai prodotti.
bad,"visitas diarias a clientes,aprendi a conocer todo tipos de personas y formas de ser y gustos."
bad,"Avon lacks innovation, your mind is put in a box which I found challenging as an Analyst. In my view I know they lacked a lot of processes which is a contributing factor to the high staff turnover because people were not sure what to do at times. Processes are not a priority. In my stay at Avon I was an Engagement Champion which was to find out about employee's wellbeing of which it was not great at all, they complained about the massive workload which I think could have been sorted by putting processes in place, most people were not happy about their managers including myself. There is also a lack of knowledge from the line manager of the job at hand. They don't live their values which is very disappointing!!! I tested the hypothesis and it failed - values mean nothing."
bad,"Empresa boa aprendi a parte de abastecimento de linha de produção  através de abastecimento de canaletas não podia deixar esvaziar que se acendia uma luz vermelha."
bad,Otimo luga pra trabalhar todos se ajudam uns ao outros muito bom
bad,This is a challenging place to work and advance. The organization is not good at developing talent from within. Recently new management replaced most of the direct selling talent with talent from retail and its  not clear whether management is aligned on what to do next to save the company.
bad,"Sales and Sales Management Professional extensive experience in diverse industries dedicated to achieving profitability and delivering outstanding customer service. Treats each customer as a potential lifetime purchaser. Convey a professional image of honesty, compassion and concern for customers’ needs. Works well under pressure and deadlines. Highly organized team-builder with strong leadership experience "
bad,Deals with a lot of team work and repetition.  Working on an assembly line.
bad,I can honestly tell you Avon isn't a place for me. It was hard making money plus everyone i knew was selling Avon. So i never got any customers. They didn't really teach you how the business ran and what your suppose to do and how to make your money. I didn't enjoy anything about Avon. I'd rather buy Avon from someone else then to sell it.
bad,"daba oportunidades de crecimiento personal solo a colaboradores mas allegados a los jefes directos."
bad,"Avon was once a strong, proud company that focused on their customers. They truly cared for their customers, their employees and their reputation. This is no longer true. Now, when faced with difficult times, knee jerk reactions instead of thoughtful consideration has caused this once great company to lose its way and become a shell of what it once was."
bad,"Avon is slowly crumbling.  Too much reliance on the global brand awareness and not enough investment in staying relevant/current.  Some emerging markets are still growing, but the growth has slowed as other companies have learned from Avon's mistakes and are dominating the direct selling channel."
bad,"Working with Avon is truly a challenge. A typical day would be out meeting new customer, calling customers placing their order on the computer and checking my back office.Making payments for their orders on computer,. Advertising Avon on website. Collecting money for orders and delivering. Also taking order over the phone and in person."
bad,Lo bueno de trabajar con Avon es que no tenes horarios ni días y uno se pone las metas a las cual aspiras.
bad,Lo bueno de trabajar con Avon es que no tenes horarios ni días y uno se pone las metas a las cual aspiras.
bad,"Very micro-managed. Co-workers are very immature, very much like high school.  Exceptions are rarely made for attendance. Fear of being outsourced is on a regular basis. There is no cafeteria. Space where call center is located is being rented and the owners  do not take care pf the property."
bad,"I have been gone from Avon for years now.  But back when I joined it was a great place to work.  After only a year or so, with the company, they started laying off and closing locations. Everything sufered accordingly and it was a terrible place to work. "
bad,Avon has an intense training programs and very high expectations. There are too many grey areas in the policy and procedure and supervisors are very reluctant to work with thier employess to resolve issues. A typical day is full of high strung representatives that are no encourged to learn thier business model.
bad,"Eu trabalhei como aprendiz. Trabalhos voluntários de alfabetizacao para o público da terceira idade, desenvolvendo desta forma responsabilidade social e compromisso profissional."
bad,"My hardest part, of my job, is when customer, did not pay in time, overdue payment, otherwise, i love convincing, customer to buy our products"
bad,"Avon é uma empresa que em si é boa de se trabalhar,porém o que deixa o local pesado, difícil de lidar, é a gerência , que são pessoas pouco capacitadas,que tudo gira em torno dela , a vida pessoal do funcionário não tem menor importância para a empresa,não dar muitas opçãoes de crescimento, e quando dar, só vai para pessoas que bajulam os supervisores."
bad,"Aprendi a trabalhar em equipe,a conversar melhor com as pessoas, a conquistar metas no trabalho e na vida pessoal."
bad,As vendas caíram muito e o ganho é pouco. Mas persistindo consegue tirar a bolacha.
bad,I enjoyed the time that I spent there. It was very interesting. The accounting department was very cordial. I would absolutely work for the again. Great work place.
bad,"como empresaria en avon es mucho el proceso que se realiza y las ganancias monetarias son muy pocas y tardan mucho en darte tus ganancias. se aprende mucho el trato con gente, la comunicación."
bad,"Salary is below the market average, job security is good. however management is so so. job culture is so so. it just stick with the traditional product."
bad,Mto trabalho pouca comissão patroas legais...educadas simpaticas....mas tem gnt  q encomenda serviço e ñ paga ai sai do nosso bolso....
bad,Found that majority of people tend to think Avon is outdated and they have found other cosmetic options. Otherwise they have no soliciting signs posted on property.
bad,I didn't have enough supervision from the very beginning. I needed more guidance in order to teach sales and how to achieve sales goals. I needed coaching.
bad,Il lavoro è comodo da gestire perchè lavori a casa con tutta la flessibilità e comodità che ti serve.
bad,My 1st sales job. I did okay at it. Everyone knows what avon is. So that makes it hard because most people that want it already have an avon rep.. It can make it diffucult to sale
bad,Fun working with other countries within the company. Building an relationship. and travel to every part of the world. learned type of system and working with management around the world.
bad,"Going into area with a planned schedule each week. "
bad,"Interesante trabajo para empezar en el mundo laboral. Se aprende mucho sobre gestión de clientes y compra-venta de productos."
bad,"I would rate working for Avon as flexible and can fit around work life balance.  However, they are not good at providing products on time and missing products out of the orders."
bad,The day can vary from day to day you can leave home with a set plan for the day but you never stick to it as things always come up that you have to deal with for example someone has a problem with there account or trying to chase people for debt. the company drives on numbers and is constanly over estimating un reallistic figures and inaccurate figures
bad,"call independent representatives daily/morning conference call develop creative way to increase independents earning potential. "
bad,"•a typical day at work-- Busy."
bad,"Avon is a self based business you grow from sales of cosmetics, skin care, clothing, jewelry, colognes and various home based products for the entire family. "
bad,i enjoyed the customer service and meeting new people but i dint get hourly pay dint make enough
bad,Typical large company with good and bad features. Management lacks open communication with employees. Nice co workers.
bad,Ótima pra donas de casa mamãe que precisam trabalhar e cuidar dos filhos
bad,"Spent a lot of time doing nothing while I continuously asked for work. The work I was given was very basic and took a maximum of 3 hours to complete. And the rest of the time I cleaned parts or updated an excel sheet which still barely took any time. "
bad,they are very good at flexible hours - you can WFH a lot and can come in early to leave early - quite social depending on the team however there is a lot of red tape and you do wonder if your work is making a difference as you often get push back from the higher functions with little communication as to why
bad,"Praca jest ciężka, wynagrodzenie niskie, w dodatku nie ma gwarancji stałej pracy, bo pracodawca woli zatrudnić obcokrajowców ze Wschodu zamiast Polaków, bo na Polaka nie dostaje pieniędzy."
bad,"Politics exist everywhere, but it’s to a new level here.  There’s no clear delineation between who needs to make a decision so everyone is involved and everyone has an opposing view point.  Things don’t come into fruition until last minute. The company is doing bad and upper management is always pointing the finger at someone else. They provide no direction and change programs after they’ve launched then wonder why they weren’t successful - although they have no idea how to measure or determine succsess."
bad,Trabajar es mi objetivo en la vida para poder complot mis responsabilidades
bad,Aparecen problemas cuando la gente no paga y uno tiene q pagar por ellos
bad,"Nosso dia a dia prospecção porta a porta e incentivando vendedores a crescerem suas vendas ,com acompanhamento gerencial diário e treinamento trimestral de vendas ,bom relacionamento com colegas ,a melhor parte para mim sempre foi levar para as pessoas a oportunidade de realizar sonhos"
bad,it takes up a lot of time - it is good way of meeting new people and mixing with your local community - pay is on commission so its all down to how many sales you get but its definatly something I would advise someone to do if they are just looking for something to fill their day and to meet new people
bad,"Somewhat like a door to door salesman. Most people don't want to bother, some actually do and gets you to think of successful plans to get people interested. Manager was kind and explained things well. Really helpful to work as a team with others and got more done. Hardest part was appealing to get customers. Most enjoyable part was closing the deal with customers you get."
bad,"Currently going through an organizational turnaround and lots of ambiguity about the future.  Work environment can therefore be challenging, yet rewarding when you see changes implemented."
bad,"I found it very hard to make money from this job because of where i live, not many people wanted to buy any products meaning i found it hard to achieve the minimum amount needed (£80). The money you get from this job will really depend on where you live."
bad,"l' avon è un azienda che ti permette di lavorare a casa quando e come vuoi ma non crea una grande carriera anzi il profitto è minimo ed ovviamente a percentuale ,quindi ogni mese non sai mai quale sarà la tua retribuzione."
bad,"The job isn't hard, but if you live in an area where you don't have any people to sell to, that's the hardest part."
bad,Hand out brochures with products inside. Answer the phone and take customer orders. Turn in order in a timely fashion. Receive and sort through order for each customer. Bring customer their order.
bad,bad management and or supervision good co-workers no appreciation for exceeding expectations and no advancement for hard work   
bad,"Empresa sólida no mercado mundial. Possibilita fácil conciliação com via pessoal porém, sem beneficios que um emprego formal possui. não pode ser encarado como única fonte de renda ou ainda, a principal."
bad,"Avon has helped millions of women achieve their dreams as independent sales representatives. However, don't expect your dreams as a sales manager to be achieved."
bad,Aprendi a desenvolverme en las venta. Hablar con la gente!!
bad,"Working with Avon products I learned customer service skills. How to approach a customer & how to sale the products. Like I said it was enjoyable while I had paying customers. After customers stopped paying, I had to come out of pocket and that became an issue for me. Being that, that was my only income and I didn't have money coming in like I had it going out."
bad,Was a typical customer service job before the advent of the Customer Care Model. It was a nice job till most of the services went to India. Then things got out of control. The severance packages we're not bad but many felt betrayed by AVON.
bad,"es una compania para mujeres,la promocion es dificil."
bad,"премии сдельные,потолок отсутствует,зарабатываешь сколько хочешь,минус выплата за работу через 2 мес"
bad,"Es una buena empresa, con buenas prestaciones, pero a veces falta capacitación, el trabajo en campo no es igual a estar en un corporativo, falta esa sensibilidad."
bad,I would go and place booklets out to people. Take down any orders that they place. When the orders arrive i would give out the items they order and collect the money.
bad,I learned how to get customers. But I all so learned that they will look at the products and still want buy. They will tell me to get something but they don't have the money. I want buy put it in the computer until I am really sure that they are going to buy it. And that is when I don't hear from that person again. And I make some calls to see if the person still want produced. I just wish things were better.
bad,Es una empresa que te permite trabajar según tus criterios.
bad,You make what you want.  The more you sell the more you make.  You handle money and deliver the product to the person.  Can be time consuming.
bad,"The most important thing I learned as a sales representative that how to be an effective communicator."
bad,"Working as an Avon Representative is good due to the fact that you can work around everything else in your life, but it's also not guaranteed money."
bad,"A dinâmica do dia é bem agitada, difícil de conciliar com a realidade pessoal. "
bad,"Meu dia de trabalho eram feitos com horários determinados por mim "
bad,"I hand out books and collect them back in, I am classed as self employed and do not earn much money. I receive commission only. Very poor pay and poor communication."
bad,Do well during first four campaigns then its slow unless you have repeat customers every so often
bad,"On a Tuesday i would receive my Avon delivery order for my customers and i would divide it into individual customer orders and get them ready to deliver and then contact the customer to arrange a day for delivery and take the order to the customer at the appointment. "
bad,"Avon depends on entirely on the interest of the area you work in and sadly there is not enough interest in my area. The work involves ordering catalogues, order forms and order bags then preparing them to be delivered around my assigned area. I then collect them back in sift through the forms to find people's orders. I then make the orders for the customers online, they are delivered to me then I deliver them to the customer. Although the it is only a few days work in a week or so, it isn't rewarded with great commission. It is also very hard to do without access to a car, owing to the heavy catalogues and large lists. It does however give me the chance to work from home. I've also improved my skills in money management and cash-handling, as well as other skill that will benefit me in the future."
bad,"Make your own schedule and work your business your way. There were monthly, optional, training opportunities. I enjoyed Avon, but they started changing how we earned compensation, and many of us started getting charged for things we had not ordered. Some accounts were never fixed. Hopefully things have been fixed."
bad,"Uma boa empresa,costuma a manter e valorizar os padrões de segurança e se preocupa com seus funcionários."
bad,"Was overcharging me, had to go into own pocket just to complete so clients could have their orders and they also doubled-charged me on a few occasions."
bad,"Being able to handle all my marketing, advertising and customer relations is amazing.  I loved being in control and working for myself. I loved the challenge of finding more customers through various methods and interacting with them. "
bad,No era lo que esperaba. Poco margen comercial. Pocos incentivos.
bad,"Lo bueno es que puedes administrar bien el tiempo, pero los porcentajes que te llevas de las ventas es muy muy escaso."
bad,My current employment has taught me to be open to learning - My current position as a Supervisor is a position that there is no path to follow. So developing processes and streamlining them are a skill I have well facilitated while employed.  Also developing training material and administering it to 12 agency's and over 50 staff within those agency's has also been an unique skill I have inquired.
bad,Escuchar cualquier inquietudes de los clientes!!!.
bad,i was able to work around my family but hard to earn an income. there is fantastic support. i made a lot of new friends. its very easy to process orders.
bad,"Having most people spend money online now, sales have gotten harder. It is not impossible but not like it used to be. Products are awesome and brings a nice sense of accomplishment"
bad,I had to work by myself knocking on doors selling products and I was doing that and not making that much Money so I quit that job plus I was getting tired of working by myself and I hate staying and knocking on doors
bad,"Independently sold beauty and home good products. Door to door sale rep. Had to learn to manage objections, link needs with the customer. Share profits with co-sales rep."
bad,Working with Avon helps to build self confidence as this type of work you need to be liasing face to face with consumers. It also helps towards understanding the finance field within the environment
bad,"Delivered around 500 books per month for $25-$40. Given I did this work as a kid, this would be a lot more simple at my age now."
bad,"Avon is ideal for someone who wants to make a but of extra money on the side of a day job, but i wouldn't recommend as a full time occupation, as your wage depends on how much other people buy"
bad,"Na Avon revendemos produtos que a empresa oferece  por catálogo"
bad,"Sell avon to my teachers and friendds. Had to add up their total including tax , input thier orders online and deliver. Unfortunatley my sales representative wasn't working out for me, she was hard to reach and never helped out when needed,which made me quit."
bad,"La proporción ganada a los productos vendidos es muy baja."
bad,"For the most part Avon has the best employees.  Everyone is like family.  The downfall is certain management, not all.  Avon has the potential of being a great company to work for."
bad,"Thougt it be something exciting to do but I learned it can be time consuming when people do not want to pay.  Other than that it was ok, you do not earn much and if people order late you get charged for it.  It can be expensive and there have been times where I had trouble returning items back or took to long to get here."
bad,"com essa experiência de trabalhar vendendo os produtos da avon consegui minha estabilidade financeira e também conquistei não apenas clientes mais bons amigos! é satisfatório fazer o que gosta, e gostava do que fazia! considero não um trabalho mais um robe!"
bad,My role involved cold calling on customers in the area that had been allocated to me.  I found I was very successful in this role as I have a good rapport with people and was very flexible in how I dealt with my customers needs.  I achieved high levels of sales which was very satisfying and I enjoyed meeting different people and getting lots of exercise.
bad,"En lo que estuve en AVON fue dos semanas dado que como yo vivo en Boadilla del Monte, el catalogo y demás venía con una referencia y la referencia de Boadilla tardaba mucho y me quité de ese empleo. No me dieron alta en la Seguridad Social."
bad,"If you don't have a lot of friends , or don't like to sell or talk to people this is not a job for you. I had a little fun with this job , learning and communicating with people but it was hard to sell , i got a lot of people by posting an ad on kijii."
bad,"Would be given a new Avon books every two weeks. Most of my customers were at Startek when they laid people off, I didn't have anymore clientele. I would pass out book and place order once a week online. Sometimes people would not pay and the money would have to come out of my pocket. However, my manager was awesome he was very understanding of every circumstance I approached him with."
bad,I didn't really like Avon because I'm not too into their products.
bad,"Avon Products, Inc. was exciting and alot of hard work.  However, unless you have zillions of clients, there is no pay in it.  I am now working as a freelance writer (not getting paid for it either) and find the work even more exciting and worth it!"
bad,Je devais trouvé des gens pour les persuader d'acheter des produits d'Avon et je recevais un pourcentage sur chaque produits.
bad,i work with Great People i like this job a lot it was a great experience to work with difference people
bad,I learned customer service and how to deal with unhappy customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was some of the people I worked with. They were family.
bad,"Avon is an independent self employment job."
bad,A mi me gusto mucho trabajar vendiendo Productos de AVON por que pues aparte que cumples con tus objetivos y metas por cumplir con la cantidad designada ganas premios pero me tuve que salir por que por tratar de ampliar mas mis ganancias salia a ofrecer productos a gente que no conocia muy bien y me dejo muy mal y tuve que pagar aveces sus productos y ellos ya no me pagaban por eso me tuve que salir por que confie en las señoras y estas me dejaron mal
bad,es nesesario ser decidido y extrovertido. Es bueno si deseas ganar dinero extra o no tienes empleo.
bad,You will not have an Avon Career...you will sell it to your friends and make a little extra money.
bad,oito horas por dia
bad,Supervisaba 19 cobradores ayudandolos a alcanzar las metas exigida por la empresa
bad,"You can make as much as you want and you have freedom to be with your family when needed, although the competition is steep and other sales reps are already established in the area so it is difficult to pick up customers"
bad,"Bueno no conocí a la dirección en persona. Lo que más me gustó del trabajo es vender los productos, mis amigas me compraban algunos productos."
bad,It was definitely not what I expected to experience. Is not all what they say. They say that something is one price and then when you get the bill is more than what they had on the book.
bad,"It's okay, but it gets really boring. Your not guaranteed a lot of money."
bad,"Aprendi mucho, valore el buen trato y las oportunidades."
bad,"Learned how to deal and work with people on a personal level.Gave me a sense of purpose, importantly to be independant. I walked around a lot scouting for potential customers and always enjoyed delivering door to door. My co-workers were approachable and supportive. I enjoyed getting my commission mostly. The hardest part was dealing with difficult clients."
bad,"Este trabajo me brinda la libertad de manejar mis tiempos, poder ir a dialogar con las personas, no se trata solo de vender sino de conocer y facilitarle algo q necesite."
bad,"Entrei para trabalhar nesta Empresa,cheia de vontade,garra,me sentindo ''viva'',mas depois que houve,um ''corte'' entre os Gerentes,Supervisores,Diretores,as coisas mudaram drasticamente.Funcionários,nao Qualificados suficientemente,e vindo da ''massa'' dos ''subordinados'',tomaram posse de cargos,que eles nao eram APTOS  a exercerem penso que o Cargo ''subiu'' a cabeça deles,e assim fizeram com que a Compania,perdesse todo o seu brilho.Desmotivaram funcionarios Excelentes,Humilharam muitos de NÓS,não existia Leis Judiciais para eles,somente as Leis,Regras e Deveres da própria Empresa.As coisas se tornaram difíceis para todos."
bad,"Um dia típico de trabalho seria experimentar muitos produtos em um grupo enorme de pessoas. Aprendi a lidar mais e mais com os clientes. Não gosto nem de me lembrar da gerência, pois tive alguns muitos problemas, mudanças das gerentes de setor, falta de informações, quando conseguia entrar em contato nunca era a minha gerente. Colegas de trabalho extremamente competidores, a final, quem vender mais, para mais pessoas, receberá mais dinheiro. A parte mais difícil é não receber de um cliente e precisar se virar para cobrir aquele prejuízo, não é nem tanto você deixar de trabalhar, o pior é ficar sem receber realmente, contar com aquele dinheiro. A parte mais agradável é conhecer pessoas, é ver o que gostam, conversar, reunir, a partir disso você conhece até mesmo mais os produtos que você está vendendo e oferecendo, você  cria novas parcerias, amizades e tem novas ideias."
bad,"- I learnt how to manage receipts and cash"
bad,"You can be your own boss. You can also lose money, Results vary based on team. If you have a good leader you may have a better experience and be more prepared."
bad,"Working with Avon has allowed me to meet many people, and sharpen my customer service skills. I learned how important communication is. Communication is the key to success."
bad,"I did not enjoy working for this company, the jewelry is poorly made and turns your skin green and falls apart or breaks easily. You spend all this money to buy the catalog books and supplies but half the time all the effort you put into trying to get customers falls short because there are not many people willing to pay the prices. I made a total of $400 in 7 months..."
bad,I will never work for this company again it was so boring and quiet all the time it was time I wanted to walk out .it wasn't alot of people working there so it was very slow
bad,"not a good place to work at, products were being sent in wrong. when I asked for help no one wanted to help me. the samples that was given wasn't the samples I asked for."
bad,"New Avon is under new management now. I worked there for a long time, and what I experienced is probably not the way things are at this point in time."
bad,"A Empresa proporciona comunicação com os clientes e produtos a pronta entrega,o que favorece o nosso trabalho."
bad,el reparto es  muy bueno  tal vez su dificultad es las distancias fuera de ruta y la mala corndicionador de los supervisores y riesgos de asalto
bad,"Oportunidade de aprender a abordar pessoas, adquirir experiência na área de vendas, auxilio de um supervisor, a parte mais agradável do trabalho é vender produtos de excelente qualidade!"
bad,"Working for this company is very good and enjoyable, it does'nt take much of your time , you just sell the products anywhere and everywhere. You also enjoy the moment of experiencing their new products coming and have some for you. I love this company and am not going anywhere but to lift it to new heights."
bad,avon is a great company to work for. like that I got to make my own schedule.
bad,It is own your own business network.  You have to go for what you know to advance in this business.  Sell as much as you can and make as much as you sell.
bad,"It a good job,meeting new people everyday."
bad,aprende muitas coisas agradavel.uma empresa muita aprendizada
bad,"Aprendi neste trabalho como abordar novos revendedores,prospecção.A gerente estabelecia metas e dava incentivos para quem as atingisse.Os colegas de trabalho partilhavam experiências,e tinham praticamente os mesmos ideais.A parte mais dificil do trabalho eram trazer novos revendedores,pois as restrições cadastrais atrapalhavam,e por outro lado nao ter registro em carteira não oferecia nenhuma garantia.O mais agradável era o reconhecimento nas convenções,era conhecer novas pessoas,ajudar na sua auto-estima."
bad,un buen servicio para las ventas de catalogo en diferentes areas.
bad,"ho imparato a lavorare all'interno di un magazzino e sono stato formato come retrattilista, un a mansione che ha bisogno di attenzione e di conoscenza del mezzo che si guida. molto importante per me aver imparato a guidare un mezzo come il carrello retrattile, ed esserci riuscito in poco tempo ed essere arrivato al livello dei retrattilisti piu esperti."
bad,era uma empressa dinamica  e agradavel de trabalhar colega de trabalho exelente
good,Normal no tienes sueldo fijo trabajas a comision y cuando quieres
good,"A megrendelések összekészítése, precíz és hibátlan munkát igényel, szakmai tapasztalatokkal gazdagodtam,  de a vezetőség nem emberközpontú, a munkahelyi kúltúra minimális, nem igazán válogatják meg az ott dolgozó embereket, sose tudni meddig és mikor ér véget a napi műszak, gyakran több mint 8 óra, és váratlan műszakok is előfordulnak. A fizetés nagyon alacsony és a belsős céges munkatársak aránya csekély, többségében külsős munkaerőfoglalkoztatással oldják meg."
good,"Avon - and places like Avon seem to be for people who are rich and need something to do. As someone without money, I could not do Avon for a long time."
good,"I found that working for Avon I had no contact with anyone of any importance, just struggled alone with the work needed, lost a lot of time and effort to get nothing in return"
good,You really have to work it hard to make any money. Is not a job that pays the bills. Once your team looses interest you loose whoever is left. The communication wasnt there with upper management.
good,I loved my work and helping representatives grow. It was heartbreaking to see bad upper management decisions slowly grind the company into the ground.
good,"You can only earn if you have a high volume of regular customers."
good,I would of loved this job even more if I had more orders to make it worth while. Hardest part of the job was walking around the streets in the pouring rain delivering a few orders.
good,"I learned to deal with all kinds of people some were easy going and some were complicated at times, I learned to have patience and be friendly while working at all times, it was a great experience I learned a lot from it but this job was not for me. The hardest part was collecting all the money from customers on time."
good,"Working for this company became unpleasant due to low amounts of commission, and high sales. Wouldn't recommend anyone sell their products."
good,"I liked working for Avon because I like buying stuff. I like to work with people that needed my help in finding a product. I was being responsible in ordering products, handling money and returning the right product to the right customer who ordered it."
good,Es una buen aempresa que otorga muchas promociones que ayudan a los vendedores y a los clientes.
good,"Just as one would own a store, AVON means being dedicated to your selling and sales ... I learned to control my sales and create more, I recruited - trained - and worked threw problems with those recruits and others as well ... Management was good for the most part and other Independent Sales Reps were quite nice to work with as well ....... enjoyable part of this position is the ability to get discounts and your own making the difference of the amount of that discount."
good,"En mis pedidos llegaban productos de más y peor aún en la factura había muchos más productos cobrados"
good,"Part-time position in sales that is not a money maker. The re-organization of the company depersonalized the process of Rep/Management communication. Depending on your location, you may or may not be successful."
good,"With Avon you can build your own career and receive great discounts on items. "
good,"I think its very well designed system for mom to chose  their working hours but it should b consider as 16 hours job .as that what it takes to pack catalogues ,post them then collect them .and in between u might have to do consultation with certain people .you have to place worth £160 order to earn 25% commission .when u get there then have to pay £16 admin fee from first 2 comp. Ok next step b prepare to pay for your own catalogues after 2 comp.you at lease need 20 which cost you £5.80.which i think is ur dead investment .you are giving back ur earning basically .then client ask for samples.you have to pay for samples and carrier bags which u must need it .so basically they take back a chunk.of ur commission and first few months your credit limit would be £450.Meaning if u placing order worth more than £450 then u have to pay from your pocket.and btw people order and change their minds as well .So they might say we hv change our mind n no longer interested in products because ..... so many reasons."
good,Not good enough as a long term job security. Was only good for pocket money a long side college or school. Not good for stable income. Income varied depending on commission.
good,Empresa comunicativa e ambiente de trabalho agradavél.
good,"Comisión baja sin gastos extras incluidos, venta a puerta fria"
good,"You make your own salary, you meet people, you get to identity what people like and don't like, the challenge is when people don't pay you back for the product, always deliver to our customers and we keep our promise"
good,"Hardest part of the job is knowing now you are just a number and will be gone at anytime"
good,Its okay but it gets stressful and very time consuming. The work environment is great because you work wherever you want. There isnt a typical day for Avon because every day will be different. The best part of the job is that you choose when and where you work.
good,Its okay but it gets stressful and very time consuming. The work environment is great because you work wherever you want. There isnt a typical day for Avon because every day will be different. The best part of the job is that you choose when and where you work.
good,Iş katolog üzerinden yakın çevre ne yapılan satışlarından kazandığın primler.
good,"Terrible pay, training and overall care for the ""money makers!"" It costs too much money to stay with Avon! The leadership is bad at responding to your cries for help as well."
good,I enjoy interacting with the customers and recommending products to improve their health and beauty. I feel that the management is supportive and is helpful in building my self confidence and in building a successful team
good,"My typical day working for Avon, was spent loading transportation trailers with merchandise to be shipped to residential and commercial facilities. In addition, I also spent time preparing pallets for shipment, as well as picking and packing customer orders. The management team at Avon was approachable. Being a contract worker for Avon, I was not able to build too many working relationships with my co-workers, many of whom found employment elsewhere in a short period of time. The Avon associates, both warehouse and sales, were friendly and helpful.The most difficult part of my job, was not knowing what time I would end my day. I would start at either 1,2,3 or 5 pm, but, I never knew when I would be heading home. Sometimes we would work an 8 hour day, other times we would work 12 hours, and none of if was voluntary. The most enjoyable part of my day there, was hearing the announcement that we picked and packed our quota for the day, so we would be able to go home withing the hour. My overall experience at Avon was satisfactory. I needed more work experience  and I needed work immediately, and Avon provided me with both. I will always be thankful to them for giving me an opportunity to work."
good,Not enough customers and have to know people it really is not worth working for them they only go by commission and that sucks for sales people
good,"The job was one that required new ideas in locating new representatives and locations in which to find new customers. "
good,"Did this for meeting new people. Made no real money doing this as I was not in it for the money. Enjoyed the taking of orders and delivering them, to meet my customers."
good,"A typical day would include opening the store, checking inventory, contacting customers online as well as by phone to advise them their order has arrived or will be delayed. Receiving and stocking merchandise and keeping the store clean. The hardest part of the job was lack of help running the store."
good,"was very challenging to me working with customers everyday making sure their were happy all the time."
good,"I learned how to get customers interest in my products that I had to offer."
good,"It is a good organization that seeks to help its Representatives generate income for their dreams and goals. However, AVON is not really clear on who their consumer is or what exactly is their product. This makes it difficult to execute the concept above. Overall AVON has afforded me the opportunity to grow professionally and impact the lives of others. For that I am grateful. I believe that with its new CEO their is a chance to turn this ""titanic"" around."
good,Being an Avon representative is a fun way to meet new people and to interact with people around your area.
good,I start everyday by checking voicemail and emails. I work with 6-8 people each day on starting their business or teaching them on how to grow their business. I have learned that sometimes I want it more for that person than they want for themselves. I love helping people achieve their dreams and goals and watching them become more than they every thought they could be. The hardest part is being micro managed. I have been in this field for 16 years and have been extremley successful and have a great track record. I love what I do..
good,it was al right but it was not something that i would do when i get older
good,"precisa ter disponibilidade pra sair nas ruas e mostrar catálogos das revista e conseguir clientes,sempre atendendo de forma educada e simpática era essencial para uma boa venda."
good,"This was a dream job until : Bonuses decreased, constant turnover, disconnect between field, and corporate, constant pressure, continuous threats over job, change in bonus structure every quarter, company never gave initiatives enough time to work till they were “on to the next big thing”"
good,Requiere de mucho contacto con la gente. y cuanta mas gente se contacte mucho mejor.
good,"Avon has some fantastic products.  There is no salary.  It is strictly commission.  When sales are down, we still have to pay for sales tools.  "
good,"Good work recommendation to have if you are accomplished in a career in sales and management, to work for customers, and keep up with their account needs and services."
good,If you want to make good money with this company you have to have a very large clientele list. If that's something you do not have then you will barely make it. The expenses you pay out of pocket will only be covered if your customers order a lot. wouldn't recommend working for the company.
good,"was comission based work, was great getting out meeting new people and going to meeting in manchester learning about lastest ne products learning how to sell getting good tips."
good,Hardest part is finding customers that will buy from you. Orders go in every 14 days and you have to deliver products to customers. Fun part is trying new things.
good,Bilinen bir marka olmasına rağmen daha önce ki senelere göre kullandıkları ana malzemelerde ucuza kaçmaları çok tutulan parfüm ve diğer ürünlerini kaldırması herkesi üye yapma merakı ve ürünlerin kalitesiz satılması ve üst liderlerin alttakileri küçümsemesi bunlar gerçekten şirkete zarar veriyor
good,"A good place to develop customer service skills .  Supportive Environment, supportive management.  Fun meeting new people and meeting other Avon "
good,Not enough help given by people higher up they just ignore you unless they are after money the phone staff are unhelpful and only pester you an are not interested if you need any kind of help
good,dar oportunidade de crescimento muito dinamica muito rigida com seu regime inerno.
good,It was hard to move products and find clients. I had to place orders and gather money. I was my own boss and only worker. There is no job security.
good,"trabajo muy dificil, "
good,Your only allowed to get up to £100 and half goes to Avon leaving you with £50. Disappointed.
good,"As i was bringing up my young daughter alone and i did not have much spare time i attempted doing AVON. This did not really suit me, as it meant knocking door to door every night/evening i did not feel comfortable doing this so it did not last to long."
good,Working from home is useful. got to spend more time with my child. flexible hours. extremely low pay.
good,Avon is a good company to work for but if you don't have enough clients and the money isn't enough to live off of.
good,"Profits were less as I moved up in the company. Gas prices kept going higher. Books, samples and gas prices ate in to my profits. Enjoyed working with customers and monthly meetings."
good,"Experiência com manratham, RF e wms operar maquinas fechamento e formadoras trabalho processos de com layout e mapeamentos de áreas, reintegração de produtos, grupos de apoio, ajustes de bim. Inventario abastecimento. Operador de maquinas de montagem de kit literatura."
good,"It was nice to work whenever I wanted to I had a very flexible schedule, which was good for me considering I have children. Selling the products really was not hard you put books around place with your name and number on it, also having your own website is convenient because you still make sales and it goes toward what you make. At the end of the week you put all your orders and you order your new books."
good,"Metas abusivas, qualidade de vida e vida familiar quase zero, chefe abusiva , horário de trabalho 80 horas por semana, cobrança além do normal, muito difícil alcancar metas."
good,Unlimited earning potential  . Potentially you earn as much as you would like . You  are a self employed independent sales rep . You choose how much time you are willing to work .
good,"Muita bagunça. Falha na comunicação."
good,"I sold Avon, and worked hard at it going door-to-door for several months. It was A LOT of man-hours for very little financial reward. The Avon Corporation makes you buy too much of the items needed to sell product. The commissions are only good if you sell a HUGE quantity of product - you can only sell a huge amount of product if you have a huge family or sweet co-workers who buy out of compassion for you or a huge network of neighbors who know and love you. Neighborhood door-to-door selling is very difficult in modern neighborhoods because everybody moves all the time, people are not home as much, and people are just paranoid to even open their front door fearing it's an ax-murderer!  The man-hours of ordering, going -door-to-door, packaging when the items came in, then getting them out to the buyer and collecting the cash....totally not worth it. That's my take on it, even though I love the Avon products. They are Excellent products - At a Great price! (Avon wrinkle cremes can kick Oil of Olay's hiney any day) The representative commission system needs some work."
good,"You can choose your own schedule, routes and how you distribute booklets. You pay for your distribution booklets. Only profitable if you can get customers to buy your items."
good,My experience was bad cause of my coach but I would definitely start working here again if I had to choose. It wasn't that bad but it was at the same time.
good,Comodo da gestire ma se vendi poco si ha poco guadagno. le provvigioni sono basse.
good,"Empresa desorganizada, sem processo, sistema defasado, gestores antiquados, o excesso de trabalho mal distribuído gera um volume gigantesco de trabalho para algumas pessoas, não existe plano de carreira de fato, as promoções e reconhecimentos são feitos de acordo com o ""relacionamento"" com gestores. Uma boa empresa para aprender muito, mas não para seguir carreira. Bom ambiente e excelentes profissionais."
good,"out in all weathers, learn bookkeeping, your,your own manager home is your office,warehouse, being only commission being out in all weathers and only commission, getting to know the customers, learning about new ranges coming in."
good,"You work for yourself and have to be driven, but you also have to have lots of ""friends"" who want to buy Avon products. At the time I didn't know many people so it was difficult to sell enough to actually make any money."
good,"you have to put in a lot of work on a daily basis from door to door sales, word of mouth and online marketing so that you make make any money it is hard work yet you do get many discounts purchasing from their website"
good,"Great way to make money working from home, be able to spend time with the family. In order to make any profit you must be able to sell a good amount of products."
good,Mucho trabajo para que luego te cobren por todos lados inclusos para un par de muestras.
good,"i would recommended it for single person who want to get some spare cash,but not for any one who already have a family.it tke many times o distribute the broshure (which arent free), takes many times to sort out the orders"
good,"a typical day at work is usually taking the books to doors however i did learn that there was a pattern with customers and the orders, i never really was in management and didn't have any co-workers. the hardest part of the job was placing the orders on the website because sometimes i would miss a number or something and have to do it again, and the most enjoyable part was the money handling cause i would have all this money in my possession and i am in charge of it till it gets sent away"
good,The history of this company 130 years in business in 100+ countries is what attracted me to the opportunity. The last 10 years the North America Business has been downsizing and had a revolving door at the top.
good,"Ho perfezionato le mie capacità comunicative, nella promozione di prodotti sempre nuovi ad un pubblico ricco ed eterogeneo."
good,"Responsabilidade de buscar clientes e ganhos de acordo com suas vendas."
good,A empresa esta perdida estrategicamente e a liderança não é motivada a muda o status quo devido a falta de meritocracia
good,"I don't really recommend to someone who wants hourly pay. ""helpers"" dont really help at all. the sales you made where more for them than for me. I hate it."
good,A lot of good co-workers that are willing to get the job done. Some issues with the management. Big company equals too much politics.
good,"We were on the front lines with the sales reps yet the company treated us like badly. We tried to get corporate to see what needed to be done to keep reps and to keep them happy but they never listened. I loved my co-workers and they honestly were the main reason that I stayed so long. I was laid off do to lack of work, a.k.a lack of reps. That company needs a new CEO who knows what she is doing."
good,"No training or help if needed involved:"
good,"Leave home around 6:00 a.m. to travel to recruiting area. Conducting meetings."
good,"Era fácil de trabalhar mas o reconhecimento profissional era muito baixo. Não tinha benefícios o salário não era fixo era comição. "
good,"Era bom por que nós que fazíamos nossos horários, a rotina não era puxada. Só era desagradável ficar cobrando alguns mal pagadores."
good,"Lavoro comodo a portata di mano ma non adatto a tutti! Ho imparato a rapportarti correttamente con le persone, sono riuscita a conoscer gente nuova e l'orario di lavoro è flessibile!"
good,"Working with Avon was great at first but after a year, I wasn't making any money. I had more customers and more orders but the Avon company was taking all of my hard earned profit."
good,"Laid off the best branch of associates, in the company, because upper mgmt squandered the company's money and had no solution for North American sales drought."
good,"cansativo, mas proveitoso, manter contato com as pessoas.  aprendi a lidar com um tipo de consumidor, nessa area de produtos de beleza. a parte dificil é no quezito dinheiro e responsabilidade, tais como  datas e valores. parte agradavel é conhecer pessoas de classes e prioridades diferentes."
good,"You will have a lot of free time ...not  enough money. "
good,"I developed my managerial skills, as I was the who find customers and talk to them, encourage them to buy what they like to have. The most enjoyable part of the job is to arrange evenings and talk about make-up and anything women like to have."
good,"A good company depending on who you worked for."
good,"Empresa que paga em dias mais com a cultura de sálarios muuito baixo a nivel de outras empresa do mesmo ramo,"
good,Very hectic schedule since sales are closed on a daily basis. Need to be up on your feet to solve many disruptions in supply chain and service oriented complaints.
good,"I worked very hard and long hours to achieve Sr. Executive Unit Leader, but once I was there my Avon business took on a dark side. Working with my team of 300+ representatives was fun and I learn a lot about management but not knowing what my income would be each pay period was the downside."
good,It was a great place to work when I first started there and then it went downhill. When you work as management in a business I believe you should either of experience in the field or have a business degree. You should not be made a supervisor just because you have a degree in anything.
good,I was a audit packer. I would run a machine from time to time it was a rubber industrey.
good,There was too much travel involved for the amount of commission made. You can set your own hrs & balance family & work the way you want. And set your own goals. Postage is required to be paid by Sales Representative & is required that we offer free returns for our customers.
good,"There is not much support for this at home business.  The discount for you as a sales person is great, but I found I was putting more money into running my business than I ever made."
good,"Avon allows you to sell at your own time and gives you an opportunity to learn more about business life, although there are Unnecessary expenses which take some of our Commission to a point where you end up earning less. The hardest part of the job is to get trustable customers but the enjoyable part of the job is that you work at your own time and pace."
good,It is a great side job for extra income and to accrue discounts. I love working with the other representatives and it gets me out into the community in order to meet new people.
good,"You have your own company website to bring in more customers. Leadership classes were available, if you chose to sell other products from the norm of other reps. Make your own hours. Arranged for delivery of products with each customer. Recruited others for small fee to get started. Trained others in your downline and helped them to succeed in their business."
good,Es una empresa donde no tenemos cresimiento de chófer repartidor no puedes subir y con un salario muy bajo
good,wasnt worth my time or effort for the money you make also go out in all weathers to make a few extra quid whilst there raking in hundreds i dont think the commission is fair.
good,"it was nice, i enjoyed working there but yeah nothing much to say other then it was nice and an enjoyable workplace but no compliments, its been awhile dont know how it is now."
good,"Muchos años de trabajo aquí, buen salario, pero mucha división de procedimientos"
good,A typical day consisted of finding new clients and advertising along with working with current clients and assisting them with their orders and needs.
good,"Company is upside down as far as their financials. The company is down sizing the number of employees. The company doubled up your district, because of a hiring freeze."
good,"E uma empresa de grande poste, adorei trabalha nessa empresa Avon ."
good,Regular poderia ter alguns benefícios e aumentar as porcentagem de acordo com as vendas
good,Although I do enjoy working for Avon I feel the support you need when first setting up is not there and you have to pester people to get the help you need and the people on the phones are not interested unless they are getting money out of you!
good,Empresa boa de qualidade bom trabalho em grupo dinamismo nas execucoes das atividades imposta pelo contidiano e representando as empresa de comestico foi uma experiencia formidavel aonde consegui colocar em pratica todo o conteudo aprendido no curso se vendas em contato direto com o publico de todas as idades e sexo
good,"Principalmente no cuenta con un horario establecido, ni un salario como tal, ya que es venta por catalogo y consta de comisión por cada venta realizada."
good,"A empresa tem a marca conhecida e por isso era mais fácil vender os produtos. Vendia por meio de revistas que tinham uma rotação mensal. Coletava os pedidos das clientes e fazia a solicitação pela internet, os produtos chegavam na minha residência, os pagamentos eram feito por meio de Boletos."
good,"En la empresa realizamos prospectación para ingresar nuevas empresarias a Avon, te enseñan a desenvolverte  con los clientes."
good,"Currently Avon is in the process of restructuring its work force."
good,"I remember my grand mother getting Avon since I was little. When I didn't have a job, I decided to give it a shot. It's definitely a MLM company. After your 4 campaigns you make a percent based on your sales. Sometimes you make (if not majority) nothing. I had given up on Avon because I was putting more out than I was making in return. I even tried doing local events and hated to compete against other avon reps who were trying to make their business blossom. It was extremely rough. My upper leadership was not really helpful what so ever. I had to learn on my own and even got into leadership and tried getting people below me to make money. That never happened or they didn't last. It was ridiculous."
good,"Whilst working Avon I found it was always best to keep busy throughout the shift, the work was very high demanding with very little margin for error."
good,es bastante movido además de la responsabilidad y el trabajo q toma hacer clientes
good,"Avon est un bon moyen de cumuler vie professionnel et vie privée car en effet, ce poste est complémentaire."
good,This is kind of very easy job. Always at different location. You get chance to see different people and more friends. Drive around. More cosmetic experience.
good,"I post books out to customers, then a couple of days I go back for them. What orders I get I check them over and enter them on the computer"
good,Es una empresa muy confortable para trabajar y sobre todo que se puede combinar el trabajo con la vida personal.
good,Avon é uma empresa boa de trabalhar porque oferece produtos para toda classe social
good,"Um ambiente saudavel onde abrir com profissionais capacitados e acredito ter retribuido tambem,"
good,Recruter des Représentante
good,Lo que mas me gusta es que puedes relacionarte con la gente y darle consejos de belleza.
good,"Prospectar novos revendedores,o trabalho só funciona em grupo,ou seja,(Executiva+Revendedora).Para que a meta seja realizada,é preciso um trabalho de proatividade em conjunto,se a meta do setor é alta, mais se dividir entre o grupo de executivas,ela se tornará pequena e alcançável.Não ter um dia de folga,mais a satisfação das revendedoras supre as dificuldades."
good,"a avon é uma empresa muito boa de trabalhar ,produtos de qualidade"
good,Avon can be a good company to work for if you have plenty of time.
good,Check Emails
good,Buena empresa para laborar siendo trabajo de campo en su mayoria. Buscando clientes nuevos y manteniendo los presentes.
good,The pay really isn’t that great especially when you have months with less orders unfortunately bills still have to be paid. Some face to face clients can also be very rude if products aren’t available or aren’t in stock I didn’t feel as though Avon cared how we was spoken to by customers.
good,Pay was good..lots of people quit because of the schedule..was a picker for 2 days then advanced to QA runner.they couldn't work around my drug court schedule
good,"When introduced to Avon, they tell you that you only need to work a few hours each week to make money. When I was selling Avon products I worked at least 20 hours per week or more."
good,"Teams aren't empowered to make their own decisions. Sr. management micro-manages direct reports, but cross-functional partners are always pleasant and collaborative. Start-up environment, even though they've been separated from global for nearly two years..."
good,"quando ho iniziato in Avon, ero una ragazzina. Non ho avuto il tempo di avanzare nella carriera, perchè ho dovuto abbandonare e dedicarmi allo studio"
good,"Being part of this company helps me in my communication in dealing with customers ,strategy on how to make high sales and in giving orders on time as needed."
good,"Uma empresa ainda em desenvolvimento de uma cultura de EHS, com uma gerência muito jovem."
good,"Unless you have a very large clientele with reps under you. It is unlikely you will be making money....if you consider the cost of gas, your time spent compiling, delivering orders & brochures. You might break even. If you're in it to get the products at a discount then you might enjoy it."
good,This job is great if you want just a little extra cash on the side but its not the type of job that you can rely on as your one and only. You really have to be on top of getting your own customers but its hard when many people have their set opinions on the quality of Avon products.
good,"Buena empresa, trabajo sencillo aún que el sindicato se vuelve un dolor de cabeza el cual no permite que esta empresa cresca"
good,"If you want to use your entrepreneurial spirit, this would be a perfect job for you. You are selling Avon products in which you get to keep some of the profits for yourself for selling. They give you all the tools to set up your own online store. There is also a district representative that answers any and all questions that you may have regarding selling. Unfortunately there are a lot of scammers out there that try to get free products from you and waste your time with possible purchases. I love the christmas meetings they have every year."
good,Very difficult time for the company.  Trying to regain its momentum and get back in the swing of things. Hopefully a new location will help get the company on the right track.
good,"posibilidad de hacer horas extras, traslado a cargo de empresa."
good,"Trabajar en Avon me hizo aprender sobre el trato con las personas, a ser agradable y a que no siempre te van a recibir amablemente."
good,"Fast paced, constantly challenged to uphold quality over pushing out poor product."
good,Always have your customers pay for products in advance instead of letting them wait till it gets there ordering free samples is a plus try not to be stressed
good,"Just working in Avon as work experience.  I'm working at Avon after few months I finished my STPM exam,I agree to work there because I have nothing to do at home"
good,"Otimo como home based , indico a qualquer pessoa que esteja nesta area , principalmente relacionada a vendas , pois o produto e de facil aceitação no mercado e de qualidade . A demanda de vendas e superavel logo no primeiro mes e a facilidade de conquistar novos clientes segue sempre aumentando devido a confiança e qualidade dos produtos . Bem diversificada. Temos a vantagem de horario flexivel , ganhos de clientes e financeiros rapidos , prospeção de clientes ."
good,"The most enjoyable in this job was to know more about health, cosmetics and etc. The hardest was to find new clients every month.   Management was excellent."
good,"Mal manejo de productos y poca ganancia en venta de los productos cosmeticos o del hogar, dado a que para poder tener ganancias era necesario vender una determinada cantidad y asi poder conseguir una ganancia mas o menos regular"
good,Was ok as long as you have the time and commitment to out into it. Customers value consistency so come rain or shine I had to go out. Not much support from management and the money isn't good unless you have a lot of customers.
good,"I was on the road prospecting and meeting with new and old representatives.....wasn't home very much....I learnt time management, autonomy prioritize"
good,"Prospected through warm leads and cold calling,  appointed those Leads, Trained and developed New Avon Representatives.with different Sales Strategies"
good,"Avon is a good company to work with as you have guidance from an area rep who will help you with anything you need. However, you do not get much out of the job as if you do not meet the minimum requirement which is in itself quite high, you will not earn any commission. when you do earn commission it is not of a high percentage therefore the majority of the money you earn will most likely be going back into Avon as you have to pay for books and samples. if you live in a good area and can stay on top of the role and books and all. it is good for experience though and to help yourself become independent even though It can become hard if you're a full time student."
good,I place orders for customers and personally deliver them when possible.  I enjoy meeting the customers and learning their likes and dislikes about the products.  I also bring customers new products to try and they let me know if they want to buy them.
good,Learn to work under pressure. The hardest part of the job was getting this done. The co-workers do what they can with the limited tools we had.
good,"Seppur le percentuali di stipendio in base ai prodotti venduti siano minime, un punto sicuramente a loro vantaggio è la molteplicità di incontri che si svolgono durante l'anno."
good,"Empresa agradável, porém com baixa oportunidade, salário baixo. "
good,"Proponevo tramite il catalogo avon i prodotti ai clienti. Ogni giorno cercavo di invogliare il cliente a comprare soprattutto i prodotti più convenienti o i nuovi arrivi. Purtroppo non avevo colleghi. La parte più difficile era convincere il cliente ad acquistare i prodotti, perchè non potendoli provare o potendone provare solo alcuni non sempre riuscivo a convincerli."
good,"ευχάριστο περιβάλλον"
good,le hace falta mas incentivos y que las asesoras ganen mas no los productos deberían tener mas del 30% de comisión  para así ganar mas
good,"There is really not much to say about Avon, its a self Employment type of business. You either can do it, or you can't. If I was more active with it, I'm sure I could have made it work. Buts not my thing."
good,Avon is a great company if there are good leaders that take the time to show you how to work smarter not harder. It is purely a commission job and pretty much sells itself. I enjoyed being a until leader to show my down line how to work smarter not harder and to be supportive as much as I can. The customer service and returns is a nightmare though.
good,"tv's in break rooms air conditioned plant, company cell provided to maintenance employees. hi-tech electronics and conveyor systems."
good,"Answering incoming calls from 7 telephone lines.  Placed orders, made adjustments, transfer calls. I learned how to work in a routine clock scheduled and did not like the fact that we did not have the restroom near to our department and did not have more breaks than 30 minutes lunch.  Slavery, is what I called it- because you can only work there for one year, then the contract is over and you will have to re apply again for a minimum salary rage. Most enjoyable time, was time to go home."
good,"* Bom ambiente"
good,"90% externo;"
good,"Em um dia de trabalho na avon se acorda cedo, pra começar a bater de porta em porta, ou montar barraquinha na rua fazendo trabalho de campo, logo em seguida fazer visita as consultoras a tarde resolver problemas da empresa como; reclamações de consultoras troca, devolução e falta de produtos , e fazer reuniões com consultoras."
good,"Em um dia de trabalho na avon se acorda cedo, pra começar a bater de porta em porta, ou montar barraquinha na rua fazendo trabalho de campo, logo em seguida fazer visita as consultoras a tarde resolver problemas da empresa como; reclamações de consultoras troca, devolução e falta de produtos , e fazer reuniões com consultoras."
good,"Aprendi muitas coisas, não só sobre o trabalho mas sobre como as pessoas agem dentro de uma empresa. Foi uma experiencia boa, que levarei durante toda a minha vida."
good,"The company changes direction every few months. Management changes so quickly it is hard to stay consistent with constant change of job description. Ultimately you are a recruiter and treated like a low line employee. There is no advancement opportunities, management have never held your position and little to no training. "
good,"Typically work 10+ hours a day (mix of office & home) work/life balance isn't there anymore"
good,"Very over worked and unappreciated, upper management has proven to be very unethical and unfair to very good reliable managers. No job security, very high stress position. Best part of the job is trying to help others achieve a better life through their sales, dreams and goals."
good,Us men and women want to have the best but not the price of target or macys. Avon helps with now lower priced make up clothes we even have kids stuff from 0-5years old. we make deals to better help u stock up. Your a door to door sales but you also call around to see if your clients need more products or help finding gifts for your love ones
good,"un día típico seria llevar los folletos al cole, a la casa de amigas o familia para poder venderles los productos. con esto aprendí a desenvolverme en cualquier tipo de ámbito . lo mas difícil del trabajo era tener que pasar los productos ya que cada producto tiene un cogido y a la mínima diferencia te traen otra cosa. lo que mas me gusto fue poder obtener mi propio sueldo."
good,work on selling products from brochures. Learned how to keep customers happy and from leaving. The hardest part of the job is finding customers. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people.
good,"Trabalhava com pessoas legais e que me respeitavam como pessoa, atendimento medico muito bom."
good,"Phone calls for inactive rep. finding out if they need more training, brochures ect. Dealing with reps that are having problems with computer program, collections. You pretty much work on your own   The hardest part is to continue to call people that are owe money and they do not seem to understand that if they do not pay it will go to collections, I enjoy this job it can be a very rewarding experience."
good,"Handing out catalogues to customers and going back at a later date to collect orders. Putting orders threw , then delivering the products to the customers."
good,"Tudo na empresa é muito dinâmico, as mudanças acontecem muito rapidamente e trabalhamos sempre com senso de urgência altíssimo."
good,"Worked independently to sell Products door to door."
good,"mi evaluación  durante el año fue bueno gracias a Avon aprendi mucho, daban muchas horas extras y aprovechando pude crecer en mi vida privada ayudando a mi familia , "
good,"Great Products, Senior Management struggles to recognize outdated business model."
good,"A typical day consists of writing out order forms putting them in catalogs and delivering them to houses in your territory."
good,"Foi quando comecei a trabalhar, me traz boas lembranças, mas não me daria um bom futuro!"
good,"Avon has been on a downhill slide since 2008, cutting jobs, closing branches, cheapening their quality, cutting products, nothing has worked.  Wonderful, wonderful company with a rich history of changing womens lives... but this is NOT the place to be right now.. too much uncertainty.  Hours are very, very long... minimum 80 hr. work week, about 80% travel, company car helps, but you are still away from home at night until 10 - 11 pm. due to the size of the Districts... HUGE  representative turnover, but you are still expected to make the numbers.  The philosophy is just go recruit more representatives.  Trying to make your numbers by training & motivating women who paid $10 to join Avon... not alot of business savvy women when that is all it costs to use the Avon name.   Stock price is falling, they have eliminated approx. 500 jobs each year, for 5 years, closing international markets.. read the newspapers.. Avon was a powerhouse.. but no longer.. they need to get back to basics, remember the principles that the company was founded on.  Forget trying to make women build a network marketing business and focus on training women to actually sell the products.  Sales cure every problem, just recruiting more women who don't know how to sell doesn't seem to be working.  Hopefully they can rebound, but have done nothing but struggle for 6 years... I WOULD NOT start to work there at this time in their history.  Upper Management has turned over completely... all new people who do not appreciate the rich heritage and reputation the company was founded on.  Very sad to watch what is happening..."
good,"A typical day at work implied hours of prospect seeking and constant customer feedback. It taught me what it means to be proactive as well as what it means to be dedicated. Most of the time i was working on my own so there was little support from my sponsors; this however, did not discourage my efforts. The hardest part was when i received little enthusiasm from my respective customers as well as little feedback. Although it was a difficult experience, it provided me with insight on what it meant to deal with customers, as well as show me what it means to be a representative in sales and the personality you have to demonstrate through your work ethic. Overall it was a good stepping stone to jump-start my career."
good,"O melhor foi o conhecimento dos companheiros de serviço, pois não aprendi nada além do que já tinha aprendido em outras empresas que trabalhei, nesse periodo de trabalho na empresa Avon nem o gerente eu nunca conheci ....... tivesse algum problema para resolver com o DP ligava pra São Paulo quando te atendiam falavam que iriam resolver passave-se uma semana e nada, passava e-mail ninguém respondia, o supervisor tomava conhecimento do assunto falava pra você continuar tentando."
good,"Busy but functional, very organized many tasks to be performed"
good,It was a good place to work for but they relocated. They did treat some people better then others.
good,Pois o que ganhava pra o tanto que vendia era pouco.
good,"Me cobravam metas e sempre vendia a clientes certos.Me dedico as vendas,mas as vezes faltava incentivo da empresa para poder me treinar para as vendas e meus colegas de trabalho me indicavam a outros e para mais vendas.O trabalho é agradável,mas não assinam carteira de trabalho e não fornecem vale-refeição e transporte."
good,"I buy the Avon book and brochure bags then I post the books on my designanted streets and then wait till the collection date and collect them all in. I will then place my order online I will order a new set of books, order forms and delivery bags. I have learned how to manage my time alot more and being able to work around my Avon responsibility. The hardest part of the Job is you have to go out in all weathers to collect or give out books to everyone because, you dont get paid without orders. I enjoy people getting what they ordered."
good,I did this at a time in my life when I had 4 children at home and was also babysitting several so if I would have speent more time with my customer base i feel i would have done better!!
good,"É uma boa empresa, oferece ótima estrutura, tecnologia de ponta"
good,"Sair pra fazer visitas e encotrar pessoas para vender,aprendir estrategica de vendas e atendimento,a gerente por nao ter treinamento que chegou de uma empresa totalmente diferente atrapalhou um pouco as executivas que estava a mais tempo,mais e muito dificil era encontar sempre pessoas pra comesar a vender,mais recopensava em termos de treinamentos e reconhecimentos."
good,"This is a great job for people who excel at retail sales, and customer sales. This is the kind of job where you get out of it exactly what you put in. So unless you have a huge family, or stellar selling capabilities, it isn't going to make much money."
good,"Aprendi a lidar e respeitar as pessoas, independente do seu jeito. Conquistei muitas amizades. Sou responsável pela reunião de encerramento de campanha, compartilho conhecimento, sorteio brindes à elas, mas a parte que eu acho mais difícil em trabalhar com a Avon é você depender das Revendedoras para ganhar o seu dinheiro, existem muitas que ficam devendo e param de enviar o pedido, outras não se empenham pra estar toda campanha ativa, e o que mais me agrada é saber que tenho um Gerente que me da apoio, pois eu a conquistei, ter Revendedoras boas, e amizades sinceras dentro desse grupo!"
good,It was good to sell beauty products. No good instructions from local office. No guidance either or encouragement.
good,"Empresa já foi boa de trabalhar, mas nos últimos 4 anos, vem caindo muito o nível de satisfação dos colaboradores, devido a má gestão e diminuição dos benefícios"
good,"Avon was great when it came to making my own schedule and I met a lot of really nice people, but you were charged for every little thing from the brochures (a big chunk of your expense) to sample packets to bags and more. I understand Avon Representatives are contract workers but you would think that since you were selling their products they would at least give you the brochures for free."
good,"If you work for Avon, you really must be on your toes.  Attend all meetings and meet the higher-ups.  To make the most money, recruit people to sell products; however, do not just recruit anyone.  Make sure the person is enthused about selling and has people already in mind to sell."
good,"I enjoyed making new friends and customers. It was more of community service for me as I do not make money enough to take care of my family. I learned how to have good customer relationship, how to manage customers orders, how to make customers happy even when their products are not available etc. The hardest part is going round people's houses to know if they have any order. I enjoy doing this but sometimes they may not be home so I resorted to giving them a call but they may not pick their calls or reply text messages. The most enjoyable part is when their goods arrive and I am able to deliver to the customer and see the smiles on their faces as they receive and pay for their goods with joy."
good,"As the company profits declined due to significant competition, antiquated systems and management unable to adjust, so did the work environment. A recent buyout of the company has an uncertain future for all current associates, so time will tell for Avon."
good,Ambiente competitivo e muito bom para oportunidades
good,"I worked at Avon for a number of months as a department assistant doing odd-jobs and admin tasks. What I picked up from my time there is that most of the departments struggle to communicate with each other ahead of deadlines. This results in a work atmosphere where people constantly work late hours beyond their contract with unpaid and unrecognised for their time and effort, a demotivated staff and a business that has more ad-hoc work than planned work. A lot of work was completed in a panicked and rushed state."
good,"Ambiente agradável, porém não tinha salário fixo nem ajuda de custo, somente se alcançasse as metas que teria uma pagamento razoável ou até mesmo grandioso. Tudo era em torno de bônus."
good,"conoces a mucha gente, productos, y buen aambiente de equipo"
good,"Uma empresa que quando estava no auge aderiu a algumas  mudanças nas quais não foram bem aceites pelos clientes."
good,Bom relacionamento com o pessoal de trabalho e supervisores
good,"Commission-based sales.  Popular company with a proven track record for cosmetic and beauty products.  Household, clothing, and small appliances are also available for purchase."
good,A typical day would be placing orders from customers on the Avon Internet site.  I learned that this job is indeed a lot of work.  It is ideal because you work from home.  The hardest part of this job is fluctuation in pay and maintaining a loyal client list.
good,"Mi valoracion es buena en el ambito general de trabajo en equipo a la hora de descagar camiones y repartir zonas , por otro lado yo no tenia contrato porque era una subcontrata de Avon Cosmetic y no podian hacerme contrato . Por eso aguante lo que pude y tuve que marcharme  para otra empresa quie si me hacia contrato."
good,"Empresa que visa relacionamentos interpessoais, tem bons benefícios, procura o bem estar dos funcionários e luta por causas serias como violência e câncer de mama."
good,"Dia-a-dia é agradável,"
good,Trabajar en avon fue muy positivo pero en los últimos años un descontrol por parte de la dirección.
good,"Overall work and choose your own ours , network and get to meet interesting ppl.  Had to be reliable and resposible was a pleasure working there.  I left cause i wanted to expand in my career and trades."
good,"It was a great company to work for, not anymore. New Management needs to retain talent and move with the times.  The company will be just a name of by gone days if they do not move forward."
good,I didn't really like working for this company due to the fact I feel as they always wanted money from me when I didn't have it or I was short in money.
good,"This was an ok job. Upper management (from corp. level) was unrealistic in its demands for this region. No clue on Montana culture, distances or population density."
good,"This was an ok job. Upper management (from corp. level) was unrealistic in its demands for this region. No clue on Montana culture, distances or population density."
good,"Fast paced, challenging to deliver numbers, great incentives financially as well as trips.  Loved working and developing leaders from the independent work force.  Upper management had to many changes and my position was dissolved. "
good,You can make money and friends. I had issues with orders not coming back on time and/or orders being wrong. I learned a lot from worships etc. Its a great 2nd job
good,Avon işini daha öncede iki sene yaptım bu sene yine başladım ama maaş die birsey yok tamamıyle sosyal çevre genişliyor birazda eğlenceli ama ugrasmali bir iş
good,"The hours for being an Avon representative are very flexible as it is all done in your own time and you just have deadlines to meet each week so it is very independent work. However, you only get paid by Avon if you sell products so if you don't sell anything one wee even though you have worked then you will still not be paid for that week."
good,La empresa no le da mucha importancia y seguimiento a sus pasantes. Y la remuneración es muy baja
good,long hours for little return & have to pay for everything but unable to claim back very little as don't earn enough to pay tax.  I am currently working part time as an admin assistant alongside this job.
good,Empresa  dinâmica  agradável e responsavel empoderadora
good,"travail de nuit,une équipe solidaire ,bon matériel ,bonne organisation de  tournée"
good,Neither supermarkets no longer exist n I was just about to be promoted to front end supervisor at Bilo but then for reasons unknown to me the supermarket chain closed down.
good,"Un trabajo mal pagado. Error en la mayor parte de los pedidos, y comunicación mala con mi superior."
good,Avon really sucks because no one wants to buy and u buy some of the product to show and then u r stuck with it or someone says they want to buy it and they don't have the money and so u buy it for them and they don't come up with the money so u r stuck with it
good,No employee support. there was no loyalty from the regional to managerial support. Managers got fired left and right. No one seems to stay for longer than one year.
good,A empresa disponibiliza a pessoa a fazer o seu próprio horário.
good,due to the fact you are practically self employed the time and effort you put in is wasted if you dont get the sales because to get you commission you have to have sales over £85 which isnt as easy as it sounds.
good,"Typically as an sales rep. you'll need an appropriate amount of money to get you started just for products / advertising & sometimes travel, ect. "
good,"uma empresa boa, apesar de ter ficado apenas 4 meses, mas gostei muito"
good,"its fun and enjoy, ive learned how to manage a business from sales and marketing, no sell no money. its enjoy coz you meet new people"
good,Dia agitado no trabalho.aprendi a ter responsabilidade para liderar equipe. Direção sendo dirigida por uma gerente regional. parte mais dificil do trabalho era ter que bater as rígidas metas. parte mais agradável do trabalho era ajudar as pessoas no ramo que trabalhava
good,"Job is easy and understandable but tough during consignor processing and BIR reports submissions. The management is nice and supportive. It's hard to deal with older employees, because of superiority."
good,"Stilavo una lista di potenziali clienti, chiedendo magari ad amiche di fornirmi altri nomi e recapiti, prendevo contatto con l'aiuto dell'elenco telefonico, persuadevo le potenziali clienti a visionare il catalogo senza impegno. Mi recavo in macchina presso i loro domicili sia per effettuare le dimostrazioni, sia per consegnare i prodotti ordinati. Ho imparato a gestire il mio tempo con profitto, altresì ho imparato che più mi davo da fare, più ordini riuscivo a realizzare. Mi pare che la gestione dell'azienda fosse buona, avevamo una rappresentante di zona alla quale potevamo rivolgerci sia per consegnare gli ordini, sia nel caso si presentasse qualche imprevisto. Non c'erano parti difficili, anzi c'era molta libertà di gestirsi. La parte più piacevole era essere sempre aggiornata sui trucchi e i cosmetici più innovativi e avere l'occasione di conoscere gente nuova."
good,Avon is mostly a independent job you need to have money to be able to go though Avon. is a great place to work if you want to be an independent seller all the time.
good,"Empresa onde as chances de promoção são boas, porem difíceis de alcançar."
good,The typical day here is when there's much of discounted product.I've  learned here how to promote a product so the customer or your member can sell it. I've learned also how to put and remove make-up in a proper way.The management is nice especially my sales leader.Co-workers are cheerful and freindly.The hardest part in this job is when you need to reach your goal for that month and when the month ended and you will see your sale summary and you got tyhe goal you will have some incentives in the company especially to your leader this is the one enjoyable part and the most enjoyable part is when you go to the party and you will their big bosses and the models.
good,"Working for Avon is great to fit around your lifestyle but as a full time student it was hard as I could not find a part time job, so I took up Avon to help pay for my college equipment, but I had to at least sell up to £80 worth of goods before making £1 for myself."
good,This job helped me learn how to help clients choose certain products and learning how to deal with sales and how the business for a company works.
good,lack of support other than email communication.  good benefits and incentives always in place although unachievable for most.  Must be highly self motivated and not mind many hours out on the street recruiting and many hours at home on the phone.
good,"la parte piacevole:gestione autonoma"
good,"Conoscere nuove persone che si interessavano del prodotto, quindi uscire fare riunioni."
good,employees are friendly and very accommodating...guides you in procurement process of products...
good,"Fue una buena experiencia para comenzar en el mundo laboral, tenía libertad total de horarios y gestión; trabajaba por mi cuenta. Los ingresos no eran demasiado buenos, ya que dependía de la cosmética que vendieras en un período de 15 días."
good,"This is just a part time evening job."
good,"Sourcing new representatives"
good,"Great products and many talented associates within most divisions of organization;"
good,With this job i was on my own it was confusing at first but i learned to get the hang of it.
good,"Tenho esse emprego a pouco tempo é algo para conseguir um dinheiro até arrumar um emprego que possa me dar estabilidade."
good,"I joined this Company in 2009 and since then it has been growing from strength to strength."
good,I liked working at Avon I did really good in my sales and with customers. I just found it to be a very unorganized work place.
good,I love there products but they need to make it better on the avon reps that sells the products and change there rates of shipping
good,"o Responsible for selling Avon products, placing and delivering orders."
good,"Eu aprendi muitas coisas, tive muitas oportunidades, o pesar realmente era não ter tempo algum para a vida pessoal, pois, ficava 12 horas de segunda a sábado a disposição da empresa. Sem contar as inúmeras horas extras que eu fazia."
good,"Es una empresa con muy buenos beneficios extras, pero debe mejorar sus sistemas"
good,"venda"
good,I learned from working as an Avon Representative that you have to know a lot of people in order to sell the products. Its a flexible job so you pick the hours you want to do. I didn't have any co- workers because this job is mainly independent. The hardest part of the job was trying to get as many customers as I could possible.. the most enjoyable part of the job was reading the catalogue that were given for me to sell and righting down customers orders and seeing how there face would light up when there order was received..
good,A typical day started in my home office at 6:30 am so that I could drive to my district in Michigan. The District Had become three times larger over a year ago and that was the biggest challenge with driving time and getting everything accomplished that needed to be done. I enjoyed working with people and helping them make their lives better and seeing them grow and believe in themselves. Seeing them accomplish their goals. My co-workers were great and we always worked well together. They are still some of my bestfriends.
good,"Se coordinaba el trabajo al personal a cargo, dependiendo de la carga de inventario o los productos recibidos en el día anterior o ese día. Se hacian ajustes de inventarios, altas y bajas dependiendo del trabajo dejado por el turno anterior, en coordinación con el supervisor del area, aunque se fungia como coordinador de toda el área, se atendia necesidades a otras areas de almacén, así como otras departamentos de la empresa, así como los ajustes necesarios en los programas del almacén. Se dejaba trabajo al siguiente turno. En ocasiones se cubria otras areas, por falta de personal a cargo."
good,Worked well for me in the summer. I like being my own boss. Had a small opportunity to network. Was a fairly easy job.
good,"1. Any day for me is fine for sale, but everything depents on the customer necesiries."
good,"O trabalho é muito gratificante em relação as várias pessoas que você conhece e que passam a fazer parte da sua vida, tornando-se grandes amigos."
good,"Se aprende muchas cosas nuevas y buenas, de administración, de cultura se conoce muchos colegas, la parte mas difícil es el comienzo como todo, pero luego toda es gratificante."
good,▪ Create a form to process daily and weekly Sales Report
good,"This has been a great place to work with plenty of benefits, but in an volatile economy, job security isn't always a given. Overall, the people and atmosphere is pretty fun with lots of spirit. The Avon values are present within each person, but the black cloud of upper management is always looming."
good,"It started out great,but it was not entertaining and productive"
good,Good place to work with AVON company.They are friendly and helpful.Products are very good in quality and samples were very good.Team manager was very helpful and return policy is very good.
good,"Nella mia esperienza lavorativa presso Avon è stata solare, competitiva ma allo stesso tempo instabile per quanto riguarda lo stipendio dato che non si ha uno stipendio fisso ma esso varia in base solo ed esclusivamente alle provvigioni e spesso sono scarse dato che i prodotti non sono rinnovati ma sono sempre gli stessi. A prescindere da questo lo consiglierei ad un amica solo se ha molte e vaste conoscenze."
good,"La mia esperienza presso l’Avon è stata entusiasmante, anche se il salario era minimo, ma con un full free time da dedicare a te stesso. Consiglio Avon a chi volesse un arrotondamento dello stipendio, e non un lavoro con salario fisso e sufficiente."
good,Buen ambiente laboral y conciliación familiar al ser un trabajo en que cada uno elige el horario de dedicación.
good,"It was a nice company to work for. I was a one year consultant at Avon with no plans for permanent hire.   "
good,"In this job you need to like the outdoors as you will be cold calling, you need to know your products."
good,working for avon was a part time position. avon has very good products and the continue to provide new and improved products as well and traditional products that the customers like.
good,"Dou 3 estrelas porque infelizmente não tive comissao "
good,Avon is a wonderful place and most of the associates are amazing.  Unfortunately the leadership has brought it to near ruin and it has been in a turn around mode for too long.
good,I learned how to interact with different kind of people and i learned a lot about their products.What was really hard was having to meet the target in order to get commission and you needed to communicate with as many people as possible in order to build relationships
good,"el inconveniente es que hay se trabaja destajo y dependes mucho de las personas que suban sus pedidos y se quieran unir a la compañía a vender catalogo, dependes también de que paguen unas facturas para que a ti se te vea reflejado en  tu nomina no tienes un seguro ni unas prestaciones legales tampoco"
good,"nao gostei muito da experiencia, pois se trabalhava muito e nao era recompensada a altura"
good,I was self employed and not employed directly for Avon. This questionnaire is directed mainly at employees and not self employed or sub contract people.
good,"You make your own hours and have a mobile office, company car, with gas card, discounted products for employees. Overall great company but the company is unable to successfully employ great management. Hours for District Sales Managers are 24/7. Salary not commensurate with job tasks!"
good,"Avon is what it is. I have some customers that I have had for years, I don't really do much with it, but use my estore. The more you put in to it, the better."
good,The role and position of a District Sales Manager in the field was constantly changing.  Management changed constantly as well.  Keeping up with change could be challenging.
good,I only sale Avon try to make little money on the side. I only have a few customers. Most of them don't place order every week. In order to get a discount most of the time I have to place a order if any one else want do so.
good,"It’s fun and interactive, you can chat to customers about the products and achieve promotions throughout a small period of time which is convenient as most jobs take more experience."
good,When I was working for Avon the manager I worked under was great. The hardest part was knowing I had goals to meet and at times was unable to. I loved that I was able to work from home doing this.
good,"Me gusta el catálogo que tengo para ofrecer, el problema es que es complicado vender a título individual, aunque estoy empezando y aprendiendo de cada experiencia ya sea negativa o positiva."
good,my day will start out by going door to door with selling the avon products or going into stores leaving a book for customers to view the products and purchase
good,Most of the people I worked with were friendly and helpful. I enjoyed traveling to events and talking to my customers. I enjoyed learning about the new products.
good,"Ask customers what they are looking for and help them find it"
good,"Very Corporate, the position is 24/7 it Never seems to end, the employee's are dedicated, yet not valued. "
good,"El trabajo está bien, hay compañerismo, hay descansos te subvencionan la comida. La única pega que no hacen contratos de larga duración."
good,A parte mais agradável é quando conseguimos vender os produtos
good,avon was easy to sell because i loved the products.  was a little difficult to make money. another con was having to purchase all the brochures and samples.  got expensive
good,"poca coordinacion y desinteres para resolver situaciones a los clientes, ya que antes era una excelente compania."
good,"Trabalhei com  a a vontade para não tinha achado outro serviço,pois pagamento pouco"
good,"I can make my own hours and I work when I want to."
good,"Although 1099, deadlines to meet. Some managers were too aggressive and sometimes not enough corporate support. Can be enjoyable meeting customers and new people in the business."
good,"Working in this company allows you to meet many interesting people. Opportunity to change lives. "
good,"If you enjoy sales and being your own boss, this is for you.  Great beauty products that work and new line of home decor is getting popular.  You'll meet many great, wonderful, and helpful people with very creative ideas to increase your sales."
good,"Was a great company to work at but with recent management changes has been deteriorating.  Hoping it will turnaround and get back to the glory it once was because it is an amazing company, with a wonderful mission and quality products."
good,"Avon es una empresa accesible, te permite manejar tus tiempos, y te da la posibilidad de desarrollarte en atención al cliente."
good,É uma empresa agradável e de boa qualidade aos seus colaboradores
good,Standard Direct marketing. Your success and results are up to what you are  willing to put into it. Overall no better or worse than similar direct sales companys
good,"if you like commission based jobs , its all for you,i personally liked it however i suggest having another job lined up just in case this isn't enough"
good,In offering the Avon product u must be more talkative and speack direct to people who u wants to buy to ur prodct.  U need more patient and belivable in words you say to them..  They need to trust in item u sell..  And u must also need to trust ur buyer
good,No hay una rapida solucion a los reclamos de las representantes lo cual nos crea una mala imagen como empresa y noa impide poder seguir incorporando personas!
good,"I love being an Avon Rep. because I can work around my family and any other job I have.  I am able to have a little extra spending money and gifts to give friends and family affordable. It is the easiest work opportunity for any self-motivated woman to work a few hours here and there,"
good,Me gustó vender avon. Pero ya no vendo por que ya no tenía la misma ganancia que al principio . Es difícil mantener siempre la misma venta.
good,I don't really like working for them.I am not good at going up to people and selling them things.  I also don't like that you have to sell so much in order to earn 40-50% commission.
good,"Muita correria um dia tipico de trabalho, tem que correr atras dos problemas de sua equipe e resolver, ir atras de novas pessoas, aprendi a liderar e ser mais focada, não tinha muito contato com os colegas mais a pessoas que me colocou me dava muito bem, a difícil era que os horários eram livres mas a todo momento você trabalha, e o agradável era que se precisa-se fazer alguma coisa pessoal de casa eu conseguiria sair."
good,posibilidad de trabajar y dedicar a mi familia buscar a las chicas charlas y entrega de productos
good,The job was fine but you had to have  alot of coustomers to make a profit or  you didn't really get a salary
good,"You can sell to who you want. Work as much as you want and get discounts on your favorite products."
good,"La venta piramidal es una gran oportunidad para ganar dinero de manera rápida, pero el esfuerzo realizado muchas veces no compensa con la remuneración obtenida. Promocionar es difícil en una ciudad pequeña como León, y sin ser jefe de grupo las percepciones económicas son escasas."
good,working hours are determined by the representative. The commission is not so good sometimes because of  undelivered orders that are already paid.
good,I learnt a lot in Avon.But as i was not seeing my future growing in it i am seeking the job with good professional and personal growth.
good,Avon is a wonderful and has wonderful products but trying to build a good clientele is challenge. I really like the fact I can work right from home. I have learned a lot more about beauty products.
good,"e uma empresa onde todos se preocupam apenas com seus afazeres,ninguem se ajuda"
good,"Ter paciência  , saber lidar com contra tempo, dar sugestões quando não tem produto"
good,"Es un trabajo como e independiente, se acomoda a tus horarios, pero el gran problema, es que no deja un gran margen de ganancia, pero aun así es valorable porque te enseña valores básicos como la responsabilidad y compromiso con los clientes."
good,"Lots of walking. You only keep about 20% commission so you have to put out a lot of catalogs to get any decent income. You preferably need a team to pile into a car together to distribute."
good,"Pay is based on what you sell so pay is definitely 100% commission."
good,"Aprendí el trato con personal sindicalizado, a ser un líder y formar un equipo de trabajo con mi línea, sin embargo el personal de confianza no sabe trabajar en equipo."
good,"During my time working for Avon I was able to develop my communication skills and confidence as the role required me to approach members of the public. I had to be organised, effecient and effective in the way I advertised Avons products."
good,"Pessoas bacanas, trabalho árduo, benefícios bons, claro como toda empresa tem seu lado ruim. Temos boas chances de crescimento dentro da empresa."
good,"Very demanding job - basically self-employment. The more time and hours that I put in promoting the Avon name, products, and purchasing of products, brochures, business cards, and samples, the more I try to get others to purchase the Avon products. I also try to get other to sign up under me to sell Avon on their own which is known as Leadership. The hardest part is getting and maintaining customers every two weeks. Commission based only - but doesn't seem like enough to support a family just a fun job for extra money purposes. I just enjoy doing it."
good,"Many activities with the representatives, long days with travel but enjoyable.  Enjoyed coaching and seeing success and growth. Unskilled DVM's and always changing to different ones."
good,"I was a District Sales Manager for almost 15 years.  I had several different districts in Kansas and Missouri during that time. "
good,"A empresa era boa. tinha os beneficios que nos agradavam . refeição no local, fretado, convenio odontologio entre outros"
good,"Es un trabajo que te permite actuar con total libertad, pero no es una  fuente grande de ingresos, y no te aporta demasiada vida laboral."
good,"ambiente stimolante, opportunità di conoscenza dell'attività di marketing"
good,"encontrarse con gente diferentes caracteres,a sobrellevar la situación,la gerencia comprometida en nuestro trabajo como debe ser.cada uno hace su trabajo todos perseguimos llegar alos objetivos y cerrar con buenos números.  saber mantenerse sin muchos altibajos.q es un reto  y una lucha constante ,y bueno los incentivos q nos motivan el ambiente ejecutivo y las capacitaciones q te inyectan aser mas fuerte lo único q no tenemos beneficios como otras empresas"
good,"Multinacional de cosméticos, potencia mundial, salário comissionado muito bom para área comercial, porém escritórios em SP ficando com alguns déficits de resoluções imediatas, e grande falta de produtos muito inconveniente ao revendedor,"
good,Funcionários desmotivados e sem perspectivas de crescimento.
good,AVON is a good company run by unstable management team. People work hard without getting a thank you from managers. We enjoy improving my team's skills and see results.
good,"Was a great job and a great company.  Enjoyed trying all the products.  "
good,Fun exciting experience. Lots and lots of advertising needed
good,"Conseguimos carreira, mas entrei apenas para um salário extra, perdir uns clientes e comocei a trabalhar fixo na Yakulty, por isso sai."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my day is my team. Although our daily tasks may be a challenge, as a team we pull through and exceed all expectations."
good,"Quase toda semana havia lançamento de um novo produto, aprendi a  conviver com constantes mudanças de direcionamentos. Conviver com muita gente (as vezes motivadas, as vezes deprimidas) todos os dias. A parte mais difícil era esperar que o outro tivesse tempo para você. A mais agradável era o resultado sempre alcançado."
good,"trabalhando todos os dias na rua a procura de novas revendedoras e cuidar do grupo de revendedoras jah existente para bater lucro de vendas, demonstrar produtos, fazer reunioes, apresentações de produtos, lançamentos, ajudar o que for possivel para a venda"
good,Very laid back and independent work study. I had a very enjoyable time working independently.
good,"Muito bom trabalhar na avon gostei muito, é um lugar tranquilo, agradável,tem biblioteca para os funcionários desfrutarem do seu momento de lazer, tem uma gerencia boa e toda a liderança."
good,It was just a part time job things didnt go so well as I didnt have a large circle of friends for it to work so i wasnt earning alot of money from it.
good,"Fun to work with friends, but it kills your back, serving tables without much pay."
good,Lograr ganar los incentivos y lo mas bueno ser tu propio jefe y tu mismo poner tu horario
good,"great life work balance, poor career advancement opportunities, poor decision making senior management"
good,"Na Avon tive minha 1° experiencia com vendas Direta , Aprendi a dá valor as pessoas ,o mais difícil na empresa foi lidar com as pessoas pq nessa ramo tem muita gente falsas , o mais agradável foi passar confiança para minha equipe ."
good,"time management its a big  deal"
good,"Working for Avon is like a full time job that needs a lot of money devoted into it and a lot of time. Selling the products is very time consuming and can leave the sales person broke with no money, that is the bad thing about working for Avon. If you don't sell products then you don't make money, so in other words if you are going to work for Avon it's best you have another job. Have some other job as a primary job and use Avon as a secondary job because you can't live off the earnings from selling Avon."
good,"It didn't fit into my life as expected, Felt too much pressure and a lot of work for a few orders, Felt no accomplishment or satisfaction. It was a bit misleading and they do not tell you that you have to pay for a majority of the stock. "
good,"It didn't fit into my life as expected, Felt too much pressure and a lot of work for a few orders, Felt no accomplishment or satisfaction. It was a bit misleading and they do not tell you that you have to pay for a majority of the stock. "
good,"Avon prima pelo reconhecimento do trabalho de seus colaboradores, oferencendo prêmios de destaque aos seus cooperados."
good,work own hours
good,separação de pedidos
good,"A typical day working with Avon includes contacting existing customers, and hunting for new leads, processing orders, and making certain that your current invoices are up to date. Customer refunds are processed, and all complaints and questions are answered by the sales rep."
good,"Boa empresa, entrei como temporário auxiliar de embalagem e fui efetivado. Depois fui promovido a Operador de máquinas eu tinha uma ótima equipe pena que fui deligado por redução do quadro de funcionários."
good,"Trabalho no campo, em busca da novos revendedores,aprendi a recrutar revendedores, fazer trocas de produtos,fazer monitoramento da equipe em cada fechamento de campanha.A gerencia sempre preciona em busca de resultados favoráveis para o setor.Colegas sempre juntas e unidas,buscando melhores resultados e melhor entrosamento entre as equipes.A parte mais dificil é segurar campanha após campanha resultados sempre crescentes em relação a euipe e a parte mais agradável é ver todas as metas alcançadas."
good,"an enjoyable group of members of the agency as Avon haven't token on permanent staff on over 7 years, but the agency are very selfish and self centered, all management are professional but also have a good connection with most people as its a friendly environment."
good,always had a good experience.
good,its alright i really dont do much but pick packages that they order scan the packers then put them on the belt. one thing that is good about the job is that i get alot of overtime.
good,"É um emprego sem horários para cumprir, não é estável, sem salário fixo. Trabalho ozinha. Sou minha própria chefe. É só um extra."
good,trabjar en esta epresa me gusta pero pagan mu poco entoces me interesa buscar otro trabajo a parte
good,corrido como eu gosto.
good,Enjoyed training and developing leaders. Strong potential for energetic manager with ability to work 70 hrs a week
good,"Boa para quem gosta de trabalhar em casa.Aprendi,a fazer vendas,a gerencia e limitada,minhas colegas de trabalho sao otimas,e facil fazer clientes,o dificil e fazer vendas todas campanhas."
good,Made a lot of changes this year with commissions and made it hard to make sales and keep customers.  Went up on prices as well. I love the company but harder to work for now
good,"A parte difícil e conseguir outras revendedoras para  a equipe as vendas são mais flexíveis.eu iniciei recentemente e estou trabalhando externa,e parte mas agradável e trabalhar dentro da empresa dinâmica acredito"
good,"Empresa com ótima compreensão de crescimento e plano de carreira, mas nada funciona na prática."
good,Un día típico en el trabajo era promocionar los productos y buscar nuevos clientes. La empresa motiva muchos a las asesoras para mejorar su rendimiento en ventas. Lo más difícil era que la entrega de la mercancía por parte de la empresa tenia excepciones de zonas.
good,"El ambiente y horarios eran buenos, lo malo que al ser un trabajo casi freelance te llegaba a quitar mucho tiempo a comparación del beneficio bajo que se obtenía."
good,"Mostly on the road for branch visitation, assessment, monitoring of performance, especially on the k.p.i. or key performance indicator... namely sales and collection efficiency rating, compliance to the company rules"
good,"I signed up for Avon while stationed in NC,I came in under the District .She signed me up and was totally amazing. She provided me everything on how to be a Avon Rep. Upon being with the company I had good sales and great work ethic and becam a certified recruiter and training leader. I was promted within the company with the hard work of my District Sales manager I was promted and advanced . I had over 50 Avon Reps. under my supervision. My role was to help them launch their own Avon Business with sales,customer clients,building thier own downline is they desired. I had physical and verbal contact with my downline everyday .It was a Great learning experience."
good,you have to do everything in your own time. I was able to do this after working at the school as well as being a student. I liked being able to choose how much I work.
good,Loved everyone there but the workload was not sustainable if you are looking for a work life balance. Upper management constantly changed their mind so no project was ever completed.
good,"Empresa con un alto valor de responsabilidad hacia el cliente, basando evaluaciones de desempeño en percepción de servicio de clientes internos y externos y dejando en ultimo termino logro cuantitativo de objetivos."
good,I've learned a lot from AVON company dealing with people direct selling product. and providing them their needs when it comes to cosmetics and other products
good,"I probably didn't take on this role at the right time in my life as I was still studying at school and was about to progress into 5th year which meant taking Higher exams requiring a lot of studying and homework. I just didn't have the time to be out taking orders and delivering Avon books however, can 100% see the attraction of working as an Avon representative and strongly believe with the right work/life balance and great sales skills someone would be able to make a really good living out of this position. It does without a doubt require a lot of hard work and a lot of passion but it could be and extremely fulfilling role for the right person."
good,"Aprendi mucho en la parte comercial, es un gran punto para mi curriculum, la direccion y supervision de equipos comerciales me abrieron un mundo de nuevas experiencias, aprendi a tener un mejor trato y mas directo con el cliente y con la parte comercial, muy positivo que siempre senti apoyo de mi gerente, aunque la parte remunerativa no siempre lleno mis expectativas ya que era muchas funciones y teniendo un contrato como Autonomo no tenia ningun tipo de ayuda en cuanto a gastos de representacion  eso me parece negativo"
good,"Preparazioni di ordini per eventuali acquirenti"
good,Se os líderes tratassem os colaboradores com isomia o ambiente seria bem melhor .
good,"it is a very stressful place but i enjoy and learning a lot about how to make jewelry, the hardest part of this job its making the total of production even if you don't have the material"
good,"Pagamentos corretos"
good,It is very good unless you don’t have no orders and then you pay out of your own pocket it’s best if you have this as a part time job if not I wouldn’t bother with it
good,"Very Cliqueish. I was QA and got no support from production, warehouse or dispatch."
good,I like working for Avon. You get to move at any paste you want. I learned how to use the representative web page. Working at Avon was awesome but on the down side I needed to make more money.
good,Avon was relocating the call center to Canada.  They needed a temp call center until the center in Canada was up and running smoothly. The criteria the Customer Specialist worked under would change per month.  New scoring or Scoring system would be implemented often.  if you were below the threshold you would be receive a write up.  After 3 write up you could be fired on the spot.  Or they could over look it if the work force was to small.  Very competitive fast pace call center with a high turn over.
good,"Ser executiva de vendas da avon foi uma transformação na minha vida, me marcou muito. Me mudou muito. Foi muito bom. "
good,"Good butbhard to get sales friendly requires alot of time very productive,good to work for "
good,"Tengo las zonas de El Bolson y Linea sur por RP23 hasta Sierra Colorada, nuestro trabajo es muy simple lo que apredes es conocer los lugares del recorrido, lo que mas me gusta es la interaccion con los clientes,con respecto a la organizacion no es muy buena ya que no mantienen siempre un estaf de personal."
good,"I was very organize in there. Is a big store so, I did so many things there, talk with public, keep all clean and been friendly with everyone. Good team work."
good,It is easy to work with Avon. It is like managing your own business you work when you want to work and earn as much as you put in.
good,They don't have any cameras to watch your stuff. It was temp job for a little bit. I came in to prep the food and then start to cook what's ever goin to be on the meun . Then I will wash the dishes and at the end of the night I would clean up the kitchens n take out the trash
good,While I lived in the U.K. for 5 years I worked as a sales representative at Avon. I would deliever catalogues and collect order forms after the allotted time. I liked my time working with Avon because of the relationships I built with my regular customers that lasted over a few years. It was a great first job.
good,"O trabalho na empresa,pelo menos para mim é complicado,é necessário grande disponibilidade para revender,o que para mim é dificil ja que ainda estudava,O salário é de acordo com as vendas,ja que não tinha tempo de revender muito praticamente não lucrei."
good,Lidar com o público não é fácil mas é bastante gratificante e a empresa avon aproxima pessoas.
good,"The good thing about working there was my Manager, she gave us space and trusted us to do our best and encouraged us even at our lowest point in the company that things will work out"
good,"as a avon rep i handle cash and products daily,i delivered and collected orders,i met a lot of lovely people and the hours were flexible."
good,"Dias dinâmicos contudo estressantes por falta da suporte e melhorias no campo."
good,"A typical day at work, was   talking to customers , showing them the new products  that we have to offer , also went too the customers house to drop off the products they had purched the campagn before and while we were there we would hand out the next campaign., I had learned by working for Avon more Self confidence  I enjoyed  talking to new customers and learning  everything I could about the sales industry  the most enjoyable part was  hosting the avon parties and seeing all the ladys so ppy"
good,"People are approachable and have a positive attitude."
good,"Ambiente de trabajo bueno, compañerismo, respeto y confidencialidad"
good,"Avon est une compagnie qui ne donne aucun avantage à être vendeur chez eux, sauf un 15% de rabais sur tout achats. Cepandant, ces produits sont de qualités."
good,Delivering catalogs took less than 30 minutes from my day. My catalog provider was very kind and appreciative of the work I did.
good,"Foi muito bom fazer parte da equipe, mas fiquei decepcionada com a GERENCIA."
good,"I just started selling Avon as a past time for me. It was never about the money, its was just something to do while I was home with kids."
good,The good thing about this job was that you could choose your own hours but the bad thing is that you have to knock door to door and most just tell you to go away and if you only have a certain area this can be hard as you would be losing customers and it was never a fixed pay which can be hard as it all depends on the customers and if you only have 4 customers who only pay £3 each for products then you won't get any money back as your wage and you have a certain amount of money that you have to get to make profit which will be your wages but it all depends on customers
good,"Si bien avon es una empresa muy reconocida ,realmente no son buenos con la entrega de pedidos, te deja poco porcentaje y al ser lider te qiuta tiempo de poder subsistir con otros trabajos."
good,"Importante in questo tipo di lavoro è saperci fare con i clienti, avere una buona linguistica e esser sicuri di se. Il buon prodotto è semplice da vendere se prima lo si prova su se stessi. Il cliente cade dalle vostre labbra, compra tutto ciò che gli mostri se si fida di voi."
good,"es una empresa muy buena en su organización,  todo esta planeado milimétricamente, la empresa es excelente, lo unico malo es que se olvidan que los empleados son personas no números, solo somos resultados y nada mas. el salario es bueno, el horario es flexible. "
good,"Avon permette di gestire il proprio giro di clienti, ma non fornisce gratuitamente il materiale di lavoro (cataloghi, campioncini, buste per distribuire i prodotti ecc.), il che segna un grosso punto a sfavore dell'azienda; il profitto personale varia in base al totale dell'ordine fornito dalla presentatrice, il che può rappresentare uno stimolo, per la stessa, a fare più ordini, ma anche una forma di disagio nei mesi poco inclini all'acquisto di prodotti ""superflui"" (da parte di ipotetici consumatori). In definitiva, è un'esperienza positiva per quanto riguarda il superare l'imbarazzo iniziale del venire a contatto con nuove persone e con nuovi contesti sociali, come ad esempio il mondo del make up con le sue mutabili tendenze."
good,"Bonne entreprise pour apprendre a se débrouillé seul, acquérir de l'autonomie."
good,Door to door sales making orders and receiving product packaging and returning to customers and handles cash. Be your own boss
good,"i worked as an independant sales assistant and selling a huge variety of beauty products. i was meeting customers, giving out brochures etc. it was a good experience  but was not for me because i did not earn as much"
good,"I have great respect for the managers and supervisors. I did not agree with the pay, but that's just my opinion. I did like the fact that they a good discount for there employees."
good,"enjoyable job with constant pressure for deadlines dealing with a wide range of people from Avon representatives to call centre operatives to deal with day to day enquiries.."
good,me gusto trabajar en esta empresa pues pude conocer mas personas y sus gustos hacia nuestros productos
good,"Happy working with my co-workers and the management.I learned to be more patience,always have the team work. Hardest part of the job is the equipment and facilities is need to be change and improved that affects the works of the employee that may cause customer complaint.The most enjoyable part of the job is when you finish your job that has no any problem and gives satisfaction to the customer."
good,"I loved Avon products and have used throughout the years so I thought this would be a great way to earn income but having only lived in this city and state a short time I found it difficult to get customers and orders for larger amounts. I liked and learned how to customize my personal website and how to share on social media sites using my personal url. I had struggles early on because I was not trained nor did I have a lot of access at first to anyone to answer questions so most of the time I was with Avon I had to research and figure out the process on my own. The good things about Avon sales was the incentives offered on sales and working from home at my own hours. I learned sales, and customer service via phone, online and in person."
good,"no me agrado mucho trabajar con avon porque cambiaban a cada rato las cosas de las ventas , los productos y los premios entonces por eso no segui con ellos ,"
good,"Responsible for developing client relationships and achieving sales by ensuring world class customer service."
good,"I sell avon products during what spare time I have. I have a few regular customers who buy the products that I sell; I, myself, like the products alot so I, too, like to buy them."
good,"Hired through a temp agency. decent pay, easy job ( copy and paste from excel to powerpoint), casual dress, let go two weeks before scheduled lay off."
good,"Hard work, many times not recognized by direct management. But the compensation is good and benefits are good. They support training and encourage it. Co-workers are great socially."
good,its a job secondary job but if you dont make high sales you dont earn alot of money
good,"Foram bons anos de desafios e vitórias"
good,not making the money I would like.  I have a lot of customers and do better around the holidays.  Am also attending school.
good,"Um trabalho bom de ser prestado"
good,"muy buenas personas, y un ambiente laboral agotador, había que tener mucha paciencia cuando las personas se desesperaban por sus cajas."
good,"En este trabajo, ganas según lo que vendas, las facturas a veces son altas y no sabes de donde sale ese dinero que tienes que pagar. Al principio el trabajo se vendía más, ganaba un poco más. siempre están los clientes que tienes que insistirles un poco más para que te paguen. Un día típìco en este trabajo es salir a la calle con tus catálogos y con tu libreta e intentar vender todo lo que puedas, mucha gente ni te contesta, otra presta algo más de atención y otras te dicen que Avon ya está muy visto y que hay mucha gente vendiéndolo. He aprendido que tienes que moverte si quieres hacer algo con tu vida y llegar a un buen puesto. La parte más dificil del trabajo era a la hora de entregar pedidos y cobrarlos."
good,"it was alright, it gets very boring over time. i enjoyed it at first when i had a lot of costumers, now things are just going very slow and im not very sure if i want to continue with it."
good,"A typical day at work was making your own hours. "
good,"I worked as a district sales manager for Avon, this was great."
good,"Working for Avon was quite difficult sometimes as I worked by food because I wasn't at age to drive."
good,"bom lugar pra se relacionar,tinha um transporte até a empresa confortavel,boa refeição,plano de saúde bom,odontologico tambem bom,era interativa,sempre com reuniões pra falar sobre metas a serem cumpridas."
good,"Empresa boa de trabalhar,com benefícios bons.Aprendi muitas coisas na Avon,foi um aprendizado ótimo."
good,Made my own hours. Not like any old hourly paying job. Wouldn't live off this job its a good on the side job not all that great for paying all your bills. It all depends on you. You have to be willing to find the clients and well you have to have money to be able to do this job. its more or less investing to see growth. Its a good job for a stay at home mom with a working spouse per say.
good,"Allocating payments on Sage"
good,"O dias de trabalhos era otimos ."
good,"As a Sales Leader, the requirement to find new and interested sales reps to commit to regular working hours was difficult. It felt very much like a 2 steps forward, 2 steps back format which could, at times, be frustrating."
good,"my aim was to pick and pack customer orders neatly .I have 16 years experience of warehouse work..i did various roles over the years ,I was backup trainer which involved good communication skills.Every two and half weeks we had change over this was done to make way for new products.this evolved good team work as there was a lot of heavy lifting and moving of stock. I  was backup on a job which evolved keeping the shipping hourly figure this was recorded from iops and peem, I also recorded the hourly sheet for the logistics office this information was very important as it let the office staff know when to order transport..There was cut times in place which we had to try and keep to. The hardest part of the job was chasing around after orders that had missed the scanner and they would just keep going around the system The best part of the job was keeping to the cut times knowing customers would get their order on time."
good,"Avon was alright for home stayers, was a great experience to gain customer care."
good,"Work with many countries, supporting them and training on new software."
good,"Non toglieva molto tempo alla mia vita, non avevo una giornata di lavoro tipica."
good,"Tasks involved:"
good,Cuanto mas tiempo le dedices mas clientes consigues y mas ganas
good,"Distributing brochures, taking orders and delivering goods."
good,"Aprendir sobre muitas coisas,sistemas,segurança,respeito ao colega de trabalho..."
good,"Um empresa de grande aprendizado mercadológico, tanto no sistema porta a porta como em outros segmentos de Vendas. A maior e mais abrangente cobertura logistica do Brasil que me possibilitou entender as diferentes culturas de consumo e atendimento ao cliente em todos os Estados. De negativo a morosidade administrativa e sistema. Por ser uma empresa de relacionamento a pressão é extrema tanto por parte dos clientes como dos colaboradores. O mais gratificante nesta empresa é ter a certeza de que você faz parte do desenvolvimento de pessoas simples e que através desta proposta as pessoas tem a oportunidade de garantir um melhor orçamento familiar."
good,"Uma multinacional com benefícios precisando só ser ajustados, com bastante visibilidade para o mercado, peca na politica da empresa e com isso vem perdendo funcionários de potencial. Mas o ambiente de trabalho agradavel."
good,"Early mornings started at 5am with hand, wrist, arm and back stretches and exercises for flexability throughout the day, pep talks of accuracy and speed, and comfortablitly. Management consisted of Line Monitors checking, and helping production lines move along to meet quota. Coworkers were fun and easy to get along with. Hardest part of the job was meeting quota when there was no production of products cocming through the lines. Most enjoyable was learning the ropes in a fast paced environment with people willing to hlep you along the way."
good,Avon as a company is great but certain districts do not have the staff to accomdate the needs and demands of their customers.
good,It was simple just to go to people houses and offer them a catalog of the product we offered I would sit and chat about what product worked well for them and take their orders at the end. Get home and put in the order and just wait a couple of days for product to arrive and take them to the clients. I enjoyed doing this but it was not a good compensation.
good,"Quando se está em uma boa equipe, com gestores apar da política da empresa, e ver seus subordinados como pesssoas capazes de realizar suas funções, é um bom lugar para trabalhar. Consegui aprender muito sobre sistemas para empresas, WCS, WMS, Mannhattan. A dificuldade maior é lidar com superiores que ainda têm um pensamento de que aceitar uma opinião de um funcionário de cargo inferior é demostrar fraqueza e incompetência, e acabam reprimindo uma idéia que poderia trazer grandes melhorias."
good,my co worker give us full support to learn the things and it's the enjoyble part of the job
good,I enjoyed working with customers on a flexible schedule to keep customers happy. Introducing new products and also getting items with great prices and sales.
good,"Bom, pois tem um rendimento bom, e a gerente de setor e agradavel."
good,pass out catalogs and wait for orders
good,"A very productive workplace and it allows one to be flexible with their time and manage to go through the without any or exhaustion. learned a lot far as leadership is concerned, workers fun to work with and not hard at all, being a team leader and beneficiaries is What I enjoy the most."
good,Sono in Avon dal 2016 e ho raggiunto la qualifica di Avon Leader (capogruppo) con molte soddisfazioni e gratifiche.Spero di poter andare avanti in questa azienda che aiuta le donne a diventare indipendenti senza rinunciare ad essere mogli e madri.
good,"We had promotions in markets, on the street, home promotions, calling costumers. Not easy job beacuse people are not really interested enough. It is not easy for leader of a team to lead, beacuse avon ladies also are not interested enough to buy or to sell. I think problem in general is that people are not interested to buy these products. But I was trying a lot, I considered this job is good for me to get experience. We also had appointments with simulations of phone conversations."
good,"I feel like if you are motivated enough, this could really work for you. I feel like the compensation should be better. When you start out you only make 25% commission on orders over $40"
good,You have chance to become top agents they set you goals to achieve and reward you with special events .I enjoyed my time with Avon it kept me fit delivering orders and you make new friends you get regular orders that make your earning grow.you also get special offers o ly for reps.
good,"most of the time we were building some cliental .. once you had customers they usualy would call you  2 a month and they woudl order you woudl put there order in and deliver to there house , it was a easy job once you got to know your customers  and   got a cliental base."
good,Nice to work from home to make a little extra cash. Sometimes there were bonuses it all depend on how much you sold. Only part of working on own is not getting alot of help when product came in
good,"Lavoro da casa e con orario flessibile, ti mantiene a contatto con i clienti ma il salario non è sufficiente per pensare di avere questo unico lavoro."
good,I opened an e-store and sell from there only..I do my own marketing..I make my own hours..I have been able to make new friends. Hardest part of the job is getting new customers.
good,Se sei come me mamma con bambini piccoli o studente . Poi gestire tu come e quando lavorare . Più vendi più guadagni . Io amo prodotti e come  uno hobby per me . Ma ci sono  persone che impegnano di più e anno più guadagno .
good,"In Avon ho imparato a lavorare in gruppo, essendo presenti linee in cui quasi sempre ti trovi a seguirle in 2 o più persone. Peccato per i contratti però, che essendo a chiamata, ti permettono di guadagnare bene nei periodi di maggior affluenza di ordini che l’azienda riceve (quindi pochi mesi) e di guadagnare poco in tutti gli altri."
good,Lots of things I'ved learned specially on sales and training. KNowledge on sales and communicating with different people. Travelling to give some trainings and to recruit more.
good,Os produtos que vem para revendedora devia ser mais em conta e os produtos para facilitar as vendas também tipo banners para frente da casa  revista etc
good,"Muito dinâmica e agil, embora desorganizada é muito humana"
good,"I actually really liked working for them."
good,"For someone who is self-disciplined. The harder you work, the more you will earn. Products are relatively good for the price you pay. You need to look the part to advertise & promote what you are selling"
good,Avon is a Direct Sales Company which is great to do if you are a stay-at-home mom and have kids that are in day care or regular school. It gives you the opportunity to meet people and learn about the different products that Avon has to offer.
good,I have worked several times off and on for Avon since 1991. In recent years it is difficult to make a profit because people can get Avon products dirt cheap on big box store websites. The average Consultant can’t compete with that kind of competition.
good,"Avon is a great company to start of slow and really start to understand cosmetics and personal products. As a newer engineer, I really got to work with experienced individuals to learn from them"
good,"Poderia melhora em algumas coisas, mas tirando isso é uma empresa boa."
good,"it was difficult working this job, only did it because I was yet to find my feet in a new country, doesn't pay the bills and you work like your life depends on it but might not get paid if your rep miss payment deadline"
good,flexibilidad de tiempo para realizar las ventas de los productos
good,It allows you to make your own schedule and work at your own pace. You get to meet a variety of different people from all walks of life. You can earn a little pocket money to a very comfortable life.
good,I worked independently selling Avon products to women customers with very few male customers. I went and did door to door services as well as school grounds
good,"In my 11 years with Avon products Inc. I have been able to advance my knowledge in sales, customer support,  training, developing, personal growth and professional growth in so many ways.  As a leadership development coach and district sales manager I feel I have a great deal of experience to offer and  become a true asset to a company that is looking to grow meet and exceed company goals  in 2019."
good,"Poor management of people. Selective with promotions, they do not follow the proper process when they have someone in mind for the job- unfair to other employees."
good,"Empresa com uma cultura voltada ao bem estar dos colaboradores com estrutura moderna visando um ambiente de trabalho agradável com uma cultura americana."
good,"Was doing sales.It was only a part time job."
good,You have the ability to be your own boss which was nice when I was raising my son. You find your customers place your orders they since you your orders you fill them and deliver them back to your customer.
good,É uma empresa que reconhece e estimula colaboradores com incentivos
good,Empresa com bons benefícios.  Dificuldade maior está na forma como a gerencia cobra resultados.
good,"Avon has a very interesting challenging stressful environment, suggestive for people with a great variety of knowledge and experience. Also it is based on business requirements, meaning that its Infrastructure environment changes constantly."
good,"This wasn't my avenue for a career. I am not good at selling, when a person says no or I can't I walk away instead of trying to figure other avenues. Avon is a great company just not right for me."
good,"Como sou Revendedora Autônoma, faço os meus horários, como a Empresa Avon é voltada para o ramo de beleza, cuidados da pele e conta com um pouco mais, cuida do lar, com produtos diversos e para todos os gostos com a sua aliada revista Moda e Casa e  revista Korres que vem encantando com suas fragrâncias Internacionais, são linhas de sabonetes, loções entre outros...  Vendo, uso os produtos queridinhos da Avon e recomendo."
good,"Social skills and selling products that women love. Putting orders in and deliver the orders. Hardest part is getting enough sales for the amount I spent of the profits. Getting to meet new people and seeing their faces light up when they get their orders. And enjoying the product I sell, myself."
good,"if you like to sell, make money slowly if any and pay out of pocket for things and not get the money back, you will like this job.  Some avon reps are nice and will do everything to help you."
good,Like to meet/see people and like their products very nice place to work at. Love to make your own hours.  free to do special sales and help people find what they are looking for.
good,Really got to learn about time management and how to increase a business by helping out my Representatives with each of their businesses. Built a ton of relationships with sales representatives while really helping them make money. Hosted a lot of events to promote Avon products and traveled a fair amount to get more experience and training as a District Sales Manager.
good,"Working at Avon Cosmetics Inc. taught me to never settle for anything less than the best. Avon employees take pride is giving their 200% in everything, even for something as simple as team birthday parties."
good,"I only worked for Avon six months so I don't have much experience with them. It was a good job while I had it. I do not have much to say."
good,"lavorare per avon sembra semplice, ma è comunque molto impegnativo. le commissioni erano scarse e il tempo che dedicavo a questo lavoretto non era poco."
good,"Avon was something new to try. You have to build up your own customers, be reliable and be organised. Depending on how many people ordered from you then the more orders you get and the more you earn."
good,Avon is a great thing to do..... IF you are very self-motivated.  They have lots of good things and they keep adding to their inventory. I'd advise to work for someone than try to get things going yourself.  I lost more than I earned.
good,"si quieres dinero rapido es para ti, pero se tarda mucho en subir de categoria"
good,"lo que no me gustaba era que tenias que pagar los catálogos y las muestras, y no ganabas todo lo que te pedían"
good,"I did Christmas buying.  It was on commission. I had to run to the library all the time to do the purchasing and the coding because my laptop didnt' work,"
good,"Job required you to do alot of personal advertisement and reaching out to people and strangers, the product did not generate enough people and sales.."
good,Hardest part was obtaining new clients and keeping representatives underneath you in this market right now.  People are cutting back to save money on rising health cost.
good,"Empresa boa, adorei trabalhar lá,ótimos profissionais"
good,La parte più difficile è far apprezzare i prodotti che si vendono alle potenziali clienti. Non sempre si fidano se non vedono dimostrazioni pratiche.
good,"the job itself can be good however the company charges for items not received, rarely has all order available resulting in loss of customers and sales"
good,"I liked working there, but the there was no benifits and no advancement, I had to move on to another job. It was commission based, the taxes were high that you didn't get paid enough."
good,I just started in this job I cant said that is perfect but I really like it so I can said its ok for a good and patient seller just like me . so I do like it .
good,"Ambiente stimolante, a contatto con i clienti."
good,Constant change in management and business model which was very confusing for the Independent Representative.  It was difficult to sustain and grow representative count due to lack of and complicated incentives and percentage of income in sales for the Representative.
good,"Full responsibility of sales, invoicing, packing, distributing orders and dealing with all issues regarding shortages, back orders, etc.  Very independent working environment."
good,"buen clima laboral, aprendí a vender productos y a desenvolverme"

good,"Friendly and helphull staff. All facilities (restroom, canteen, microwave, fridge, lockers etc.) given expect conditionares.  All payments got on time."
good,"Avon offers the opportunity to work at your own pace--which is convenient, but not very structured.  There can be a lot of personal involvement or very little.  My past experience tells me that most people sign up to sell Avon in order to get the discount on their personal purchases rather than earning a significant income."
good,Adorei trabalhar com a avon empresa séria que trabalha com produtos de ótima
good,"I work here as a cashier."
good,Being a door to door sales lets you go out to the community and meet people face to face and display the product to new customers. Risk is meeting people who can be rude or someone calling the law enforcement on you.
good,"Productive Work place. Good place to learn New things in JDEwards."
good,"Income was based on sales enjoyed working with the district manager and also good to the sales meetings were important and informative. I didn't like the idea of buying own materials suc as books, receipt books and bags."
good,É uma ótima empresa adorei poder trabalhar na empresa se pudesse voltaria novamente
good,Es un trabajo bueno y que me gusto mucho aunque tenia que patear demasiado
good,I sold products for the company and made money based on the number of products I sold that day or that week. Was an exhausting job but worth it once you build a great number of clients.
good,"The ability to work as your own business woman, looking for customers and having to sell your products. Choosing your own hours but the necessary planning to make your profit is inevitable."
good,You can make AVON what you want.  You must be able to put alot of time into it to make good money.  The time is the hard part the book will sell itself.
good,"You are your own boss and you go around and try to sell Avon products to people that may be interested in makeup and etc. No rules, nothing. Choose your own hours, your own boss, get to try out Avon products, 40% discount"

good,"It was fun way to get to know people in the neighborhood, on the job and in church. Being able to go out and see the things that people feel are good for them at a good price to make the a happy customer."
good,"Avon is a great company for someone to begin their own business.  Success depends completely upon your upline.  That is your recruiter and district manager.  Without their help and leadership, you will not succeed; however, if they are with you and lead you, success will follow.  Like anything else, you must do the work in order to achieve the payout."
good,Great when I first started but less people wanted products and was not very nice to go to peoples houses to drop off booklets and pick them up. Have to be very organised.
good,"amor seu produtos e uma empresa boa de trabalha telho 30% ou mais de luxo ,aprendi me comunica mas com as pessoas ,conheci os produtos ,e bom ser vendedora e a parte dificil e em de dificudade em receber"
good,"independent sales is good to be your own boss. However, you must market and have very good customer service. Customer service is number one so that you can keep and gain new customers. Its the only way to keep the business going. Plus making deliveries, one on one consultations and parties to promote you new products."
good,E boa empresa so como temos de trabalhar por nossa conta nao ha um salario fixo nao ha ferias nao ha descontos
good,"Taking orders over the phone, in person or via email.  Handling all aspects of orders.  When orders arrive I verify the orders, pack, deliver to client and collect monies due, then submit to Avon head office."
good,"Am absolvit numeroase traininguri la nivel avansat in domeniul vanzarilor,dar si din punct de vedere al abilitatilor de comunicare,de recomandare de produse,instruire practica si suport in vederea formarii unei echipe,si apoi dezvoltarea echipei,etc. "
good,Leanred good customer service skills. Althought you  dont get  hardly any training. It is all hands on. And not enough money for how many products you sell. You should still get paid for your hours woking not just paid on comission.
good,"Empresa muito culta que oferece bons beneficíos, porém o funcionário não tem oportunidade de crescimento, mas fora esse quesito é uma empresa boa de se trabalhar."
good,"los dias de trabajo fueron muy duros, sin descanso ni vacaciones pero muy productivos, hubo mucho aprendizaje sobre todo a tratar con publico y a resolverles los problemas que hayan podido tener en  la campaña de venta"
good,"The management is trying to bring Avon back to its glory days, but there is no talk of innovation or any new ideas, so it appears as though they are likely destined to fail."
good,This is a company that keeps you on your toes. I have a great time with this because I can start and stop when ever I need to and get right back to work
good,"To start with it was very hectic in order to work out how to run my own business and work the Avon site and understanding how to work the website, it helped me build on my organisation and people skills though because I was working with members of the public."
good,"Permite que se tenha contacto com as pessoas, há possibilidade de gerir o tempo que dedicamos ao trabalho. É bastante flexível, e fácil de executar, tem bastantes incentivos para os revendedores. Existem também reuniões para  dar a conhecer aos vendedores novos produtos e suas propriedades para que posteriormente estes possam transmitir informação correta ao cliente. Aprende-se a promover os produtos e a ter uma melhor capacidade de lidar com os clientes."
good,"good to work for, very occasional work however good incentives throughout the year. excellent at gaining customer service skils"
good,The company has been around for 125 years but in a small town moving from Bloomington to a small farming community people can't afford much. I had to pay for catalogs etc and advertisment.
good,"My day would begin at 7:00 am with meetings and travel to the district. Then I would begin meeting with representatives. Training on sales, recruiting, leadership, new rep meetings, sales meetings. Selling the benefit of  becoming a representative and helping them build a profitable business for themselves. "
good,This job involved knowing people and putting yourself out there so that you can gain customers and basically you get what you put into it. The bigger the clientele the more money you make.
good,It was a little challenging when the customer has ordered some stuff and then they wanted a refund I had to go through a whole bunch of paperwork filling it out with the item number and the price and given their money back
good,"A causa da ""oportunidade"" de ganho e empoderamento é verdadeira e como pontos de atenção cito o desalinhamento entre as áreas e lideranças internas para execução do objetivo comum"
good,"Great company to work for, lots of support, great team support, the only downfall is that it is commissioned based only."
good,"Empresa con buen ambiente de trabajo, se trabaja bajo presión controlada, libertad de expresión, flexibilidad en el horario, ambiente laboral sin problemas, facilidad de crecimiento y de conocimientos día a día."
good,"se labora su tiempo y permite generar horas extras"
good,"I love the brand I am promoting. I also enjoy changing peoples lives offering them an earning opportunity and coaching and developing them to achieve their goals in life."
good,"-Working hours is 8 hours per day usually with overtime maximum is 8 hours also"
good,If you want to become your own boss one day this is the place to start. The pay is great the people that are surround around you push you to do better. You sale things that you can also use. Good Luck!
good,"I set my own hours, I went door-to-door & in person to attract clients. I learned about customer service, business,strategy, & sales. The hardest part was not being able to make enough money & send in commission each week. The most enjoyable was setting my own hours."
good,Avon is a great company to work for my co-workers and management are all nice and friendly which is a joy to be a part of. i enjoy everything about the job except the lack of hours.
good,"I liked working Independently. Looking for potential sales; friends neighbors, church.  Often times went to door to door.  Calling customers and receiving calls. Entering orders on-ling. When I received products delivered them to customers and received payments. Handed customer the next Avon book for more sales.  The hardest part of job is parking in one spot then going door to door then had to go back to where I had the car parked"
good,"es un trabajo en el que tu dispones de tu tiempo, y no tienes presión por las ventas, vendes lo que tu estés dispuesto a vender."
good,"I was a sales representative for Avon. I sold it for 7 years. I learned how to manage my own business. I managed my advertising, customers, and the inventory that they bought. I didn't have to deal with co-workers, I just had to make sure I submitted my orders each week. The hardest part of selling Avon was when I quit selling it I didn't get to see my customers anymore. The most enjoyable part was being able to see my customers and help them get the products that they ordered."
good,"Burocracia interna muito grande e pouco eficiente."
good,Easy job for someone looking to put in their time and then go home without any baggage.  Follow the guidelines and do your job well and you will not have any issues. (CLOSED)
good,"Получила хороший опыт работы в данной компании."

good,"Was able to work for myself basically.  Good products mostly for women, but also for men and children."
good,"its good for a at home job, you get to set your own hours and people are really great with helping out new people. I mean its a self employment job and it starts out for great to learning new experiences."
good,I was trying to earn some extra cash before going to college and found it difficult starting off. I never really made much of a profit and sometimes owed the company money from my own pocket. If you have good networking maybe you'll have better luck than I did.
good,"advertised Avon product, made online orders for customers, delivered product and made product demonstrations. I loved meeting new customers and availing my services to them and making them a satisfied customer"
good,"Working for Avon gives a worker a lot of flexibility and independence. If you aren't charismatic and very forward you will not make much money, and will not progress very far. Selling Avon takes a certain kind of person that is extremely persistent. Benefits increase as you further your career. Very active and friendly environment created by overseeing management."
good,"There isn't much to say, it's a job you do on your own. You're basically your own boss. You set your own hours, you have your personal customers,etc."
good,"As a Business Development Manger your day is very busy, therefore excellent time management is crucial for success.  The fellow co-managers are available for support of each other and meet frequently for team feedback and to share ideas of best practices."
good,"My Typical Day is pretty much dealing with allot of Diversity outlook I interact with allot of different products and advertise allot of new items before they hit each week, The Hardest part of the Job is making sure every order is completed by the correct time everyday to make sure every customer gets their products on time by making sure every client is very pleased with the time in manor of their orders which helps the company to sale more by keeping a customer happy. The most enjoyable thing about the Job is by being able to test the products each week before the customer where I can relate to the product rather or if they would be pleased with the product."
good,"Na empresa que trabalhei apreendi como devemos trabalhar em equipe e que todos estão sempre querendo crescer."
good,One day is never the same. Challenging with opportunities for growth and a great team. Supportive in projects and a can do attitude
good,"You Work you're hardest to get as many catalogues out as possible. If you do not push yourself and get yourself out there, then you will not earn any money. You need to make you're name clear out to the people in you're area that you and the Avon Representative."

good,Having to meet the following quality of work and quanity I enjoyed the daily challenge a day. I can say the company is great to learn about.
good,"lo que hacia cada campaña era dejar el folleto para que mis amigas lo vieran y así poder vender algún producto. Aprendí a ser mas responsable, un poco mas puntual, y a relacionarme mas con la gente. tenia muy buenas lideres que siempre me ayudaban si tenia algún problema. No era en si algo difícil el único problema que tenia era que siempre me cobraban demás cosas que no había pedido. Me gustaba mucho hablar con la gente e ir a la conferencias que hacia la empresa. Y no teníamos un sueldo fijo, era según lo que vendía por campaña."
good,"Rígida em relação ao cumprimento de metas."
good,You work your own hours at your own pace. You learn your clients needs and wants. The hardest thing is making income. The more clients the more products they get and you receive income.

good,"I sold Avon products from home, computer/in person. "
good,"Es una empresa que apoya a la mujer en necesidades basicas para la subsistencia diaria, teine programas de superacion personal y para las representantes que son las voceras y cara de la empresa, se interesa en capacitar constantemente a su personal para que sea de excelencia, proporciona al personal de ventas todos los medios que necesite para poder realizar su trabajo como : muestrarios de productos de cada campaña. automovil, vales de gasolina, vales de alimentos, viaticos si estas viajando constantemente, de tal forma que la unica preocupacion para el personal de ventas es consolidar la venta, manteniendola o superandola."
good,Avon has awesome products that i have supported since i was in my teens. Unfortunately I believe that to be an AVON rep you have to be willing to put all your time into it. There is really a great way to make money with AVON by recruiting more Avon reps. Avon gives you all the tools you would need to succeed if you throw yourself into the business. I started selling Avon to make some extra cash for myself to catch up with some things. In the end I believe I am a better AVON customer than Independent Sales Rep.
good,"Avon is a good company.  It just wasn't the right fit for me.  The people I worked with were wonderful.  The pay was average for this type of work.  "
good,"Yo me considera una persona con facilidad de palabra, hago amistades rapido, no me gusta la desorganizacion, me gusta trabajar en equipo, y que respeten mis ideas, me gusta colaborar con la otra persona, ser dinamica, etc."
good,"This was a challenging place to work. My co-workers were helpful and pleasant and the atmosphere was good. The management team did my expectations most of the time, and it is overall a great place. There is a struggle with employee engagement, but the management team does put the effort into correcting this."
good,"My Own time"

good,"Work from home, work at own pace, what i learned is data entry and how to manage my own business. No Management, no co-workers, hardest part of the job is you have to pay avon more then what you make.... you have to pay for the shipping and then collect money from the customers so basicall more money in AVON pocket then your own unless you are financially stabled and can afford to pay for the order up front."
good,"carga y descarga de camionetas con manejo de remitos,reparto domiciliario.control de stock,trato con clientes"
good,i helped a lot with the children i was watching them play and being a great team member at the job. i was mostly watching kids 2 to 5 years old and i helped with a lot with assistants.
good,"Little work/life Balance. Company lost focus in the Customer, the integral essence of the company"
good,everyone had their own click and some people would work harder then others. it was pretty easy work days we had to work on plans and print and back check our work before giving it back to the client.
good,"It was very pleasant working because I got to learn how to work with people, be more confident with strangers when going door to door."
good,I earn only in percentual and I did like to work with make up and similar things but I did not like to work and be paid in percentual.
good,"excellent experience, meeting new people and their lifestyle and choices, gained positive attitude while working at the spot, felt responsible for the company's profit maximization."
good,"Alta rotatividade, dificuldades em reter talentos, falta definição dos objetivos da empresa, aparentemente muitas vezes os gestores não parecem ter o objetivo claro das metas gerais."
good,"Everyday I am meeting other kinds of people and knowing their interest and needs were exactly the final moment I am waiting for, and I have learned a lot in managing the time in my works and family.The most enjoyable part of my job is to meet the needs of my clients that would end up registering for my team and the time that we reach the goal.."
good,Independent sales person. Delivery of brochures and orders. Money management. Data Handling and ICT Skills
good,"The job required you to work independently and the pay was based on the sales of produce you sold per month. I learned that door by door work is hard work and not a suitable job for me as I found the work lonely. I prefer to work as a team but this job I worked alone without co workers. A supervisor is given to a group of individuals and they visit every so often but there is no actual boss, essentially you are your own boss."
good,"not too heavy works everyday even though sometimes too much products for shipment,and i learned how to work fast as well ,the management was good and also my co-workers,and the hardest time  of my job was i have to make overtime almost everyday it is because of a lot job to be finish or delivery to shipped,and the most enjoyable was summer outing for all staffs."
good,"Analysis of cost and inventory. Monthly closings."
good,"dia a dia, obtive experiências em vendas e liderança de equipe,bacanas,unidos, agradar a todos, a conquista de novos clientes...."
good,"É muito gratificante você poder trabalhar individualmente e também ter oportunidade de trabalhar em conjunto. Isso nos possibilita a conhecer  vários tipos de pensamentos, ética e os valores pessoal de cada Ser. Difícil quando em uma reunião você percebe que tem um colega que acha que pode passar a perna em outro. Agradável e sentir que a maior parte do conjunto da empresa tem o mesmo objetivo...trabalhar com entusiasmo para alcançar a meta geral."
good,"A typical day at work was working with the customers, getting the customers' orders, making their recepits after they chose their orders, telling the customers, about the products. I've also learned some management skills by mananging the customers' orders, their money, etc. I was my own coworkers when it came to being an Avon Sales Rep."
good,"whilst being an Avon representative i have to deal with customers orders and handle money. I have to drop new brochures off at peoples houses and persuade them to order products. I have learnt to be confident around people and not afraid to ask them questions, I am also trustworthy as i handle money. The most enjoyable part of the job is delivering orders and the hardest part of the job is to put the orders through."
good,"Ao meu vêr,a empresa é muito boa,ajuda aos revendedores para que os lucros sejam cada vez melhor."
good,With AVON you set your own schedule! I typically try to go out and meet at least 3 new possible customers everyday. I have a wonderful up-line willing to help with anything as well as the support of AVON customer care that can help with problems and questions. I have to stay disciplined to go out and build my business because there is no one standing over you reminding you of all the things you have to do. The hardest part of the job is to get customers to place regular orders. They tend to order then they will not order again for several weeks. I have to offer promotions to help boost sales. The most enjoyable part of this job is the freedom to do my own thing as well as meeting lots of new and different people daily. I have a  rewarding feeling inside when I know I was able to help someone feel better about themselves!
good,"A new store every two weeks, fosters a sense of urgency and keeps the creative juices flowing to bring about new ideas."
good,"It was extremely American, all happy clapping and Sales incentives."
good,"It was a good working environment, everything you learn you must be able to grasp it very quick. I liked my team memebrs as we all worked as a unity towards one goal that was to ensure that everything is done as per the procsesses and on time."
good,"I like that I can set my own hours and take my children with me while doing this. The hardest part of being an Avon Rep I find to be the ""cold calling"" and trying to build a customer base. I recommend this for someone who has time to work at this slowly over time. not suitable for a work from home mom trying to sub income on a steady basis."
good,"O trabalho na Avon é meio corrido, os movimentos que os funcionários fazem são muito repetitivos, com isso gera muito estresse . Os superiores não possuem postura, muitos não levam o trabalho a serio. A parte mais difícil nesta empresa são os colegas, pois desmerecem os novatos, a dezenas de grupinhos, onde cada grupo tenta destruir o outro. Mas independente de tudo isso, é uma empresa grande, que sempre está se atualizando e buscando melhor a comodidade a todos ."
good,A typical day was usually long and busy or slow and easy depending on business. Co-workers were okay and everyone pretty much got along. Meeting new people and signing them all and seeing them enthusiastic was a good thing to witness
good,Working the assembly line was a very fast paste job you had to know when to move and how fast or you will be left behind. teamwork was the most enjoyable part of the job
good,"Multinacional con objetivos claros, estrategias bien diseñadas y alto impacto el desarrollo de las personas."
good,"Typical day consists of usually being in office alone answering phones and addressing Representatives concerns.  I also sent out daily emails and produced various tracking reports such as number of orders placed, new Representatives and delinquent accounts.  I enjoyed the flexibility of the office hours and the hardest part was getting Representatives to get involved with office events."
good,"This was a very fast paced job which I enjoyed very much I worked a 12 hour night shift from 7pm-7am, the salary was very good started at 17$ an hour.Got along with everyone"
good,"Look, it's a retail job just like any other, Yes, you will have to come up with your own money to purchase books, samples, business cards, etc, . You would have to do that with any business you start.  I do feel that it would help the new rep. if Avon game them a starter package, ( business cards, and stuff like that).  If you sign up with a local manager she/he will give you 10 brochures, not really enough to do anything with.  Now remember your manager makes money off of you and your sales, so they really want you to be sucessful, ( you work and they get paid for your work, so to be really sucessful in this company you need to become a manager ( it's kind of like a pyramid sceme).  But it works, they do have great product, and if you love there products and can afford to come up with several hundred dollars to start selling the stuff for brochures, samples, cards, than I say go for it.  Remember you will get out of it what you put into it.  You will have to work.... leave the books every where, same with business cards.  Wear the products... you are the best bill board for your new business.  Is it a perfect system?  maybe not... but you really have nothing to loose, except the start up fee of 10 dollars and all the other money you will need to put into it, because lets be honest, you can't start a business on 10 dollars, it takes money to make money."
good,"I had eight counties to work in. Performed one on one trainings. conducted monthly sales meetings, had sales goals to reach on an every two week interval as well as many other things. Also had to attend monthly division meeting that you had to travel to. Your work day was basically 12-14 hours so you did not have a personal like at all.  Learned to manage my time more efficiently. Co workers were great although some did things they were not supposed to do to meet goals. Most enjoyable was meeting some really neat people."
good,"On a typical day seeking work orders, help customers find what they need, suggest a promotion or new product, to receive goods and invoices. In this job I learned to try different characters, how difficult this job was when my client merchandise ordered did not arrive, because the client always expects his articles, which more enjoyment of this work was to meet new people."
good,"Distribute catalouges to customers, collect orders, submit them and then distribute all orders to customers fast and effectively. "

good,"I learned what is was like to work in a Best in Class company. Avon was growing tremendously in the early part of my career but as the company moved into the 21st century the Business Model was not as effective as it was at the start of my career. The Management team changed, the people changed and the focus on the S&OP's that made Avon successful were not as important as they had been."
good,I chose when to work. I learned that if I wanted to make the sales I needed I had to get over being shy around new people.
good,Avon was a nice company to work for to get to know and help people with their beauty supply and other product needs.
good,"Avon has been a challenging and rewarding place to work. I have had the opportunity to grow in many ways and am able to work with amazing people. I have been able to be highly involved in a number of high level decisions, and have had the opportunity to take the lead on a number of projects. My day to day responsibilities include merchandising campaigns, including managing multi million dollar jewelry and watch stores each quarter.

good,It was nice meeting new customers. I could give them advice on AVON products. I gained more experience in handling money and customer service.
good,"The company were professional and reliable, however the lack of demand in my area and competition from high street companies led to my position being pointless at that time."

good,"responsabilidade,comprometida com um bom relacionamento com seus funcionario"
good,"Basically when new catalogues came in I would deliver them around to houses and then take orders, place them. When the orders came in I would deliver them and collect the payments. I would then submit the payments and calculate costs. I learned how to calculate tax and how to interact with people and be personable. It was a pretty individual job so I worked by myself alot. The hardest part of the job was when there wasn't anymore of a certain product and you had to substitute a product and someone wasn't happy. The most enjoyable part was getting to interact with people and build relationships with them."
good,"Uma execultíva Avon, tem que ter muita determinação e estar sempre a disposição da empresa 24hs por dia."
good,I had a great experience with Avon however the clients slowed down and I was unable to have a consistent cash flow or customer base. The management was helpful and was always available but being a full time student and mom it became herd to manage.
good,I liked working at this company because the level of energy was exciting. the people was highly motivated.
good,Avon has many great Associates!

good,My typical day at work consist of online sales as well as going door to door with catalogs. I learned more people skills. I did not communicate with many co workers as you are alone on the job. The hardest part was actually making the sales. The most enjoyable part was going out and meeting new people.
good,aprendizado foi muito agradavel
good,"Um dia típico de trabalho na Avon consiste em prospectar novos revendedores, vender produtos para pronta entrega aos revendedores,"
good,"No inicio do seu contrato tudo é novo, porem no dia a dia as coisas vam ficando rotineiras dificil para pessoas que são proativas que gosta de apreender coisas novas que gosta de desafios, estou levando comigo muitas coisas boas e ruins tanto no pessoal quanto no profissional."

A empresa se torna agradavel por conter esse espírito de coompetitividade."
good,"No tenia horarios, pero no era fijo solo experiencia & trato con personas."
good,"I think this type of position is for a seasoned salesperson. It is hard trying to find customers mostly because there are not too many people looking to purchase things that are not neccesities but more for pleasure. This company offers great discounts to all customers and for employees, but unless the customers have extra money to spend it can be difficult creating a clientele. The most enjoyable part of the job however, is having that freedom to be your own boss, make your own hours, and ultimately deal with the people that you can trust in the sense of making sure they are likely to purchase without and ""sideways"" behavior. By far, the hardest thing is finding those customers."
good,loved it but during a bad economy it was hard to make any money.
good,working in avon is fun and meeting people who are beauty conscious
good,"I start by bagging the Avon brochures up, including order forms and home-made slips saying when I'll be calling back to collect the brochures. Then I take them round, one street at a time (on different days - I re-use the brochures)."
good,"While working with Avon, I gained a lot of experience in working with customers through direct communication and processing their orders. I gained experience in shipping and handling as well."
good,Trained sales group and guide policy procedures for new inside sales rep.
good,I was a sales rep for Avon for 31 years. Cosmetic industry has been an exciting ever changing industry through thr years. My opportunities for growing my client base have been less and less in recent years as the economy has been struggling. My contacts have become less able to and less interested in using as many products as when they were in the work world and had more disposible income. Avon is a stable company company having been in business since the beginning of the 1900's.
good,You go to house's handing out Avon books. I learned how to talk and be more open to people. I do not know much of the management. My co-workers were my bosses. The hardest part of the job is not having a car to go to house's. The most enjoyable part of the job was got to meet new people.
good,I was a fun place for me to work at.opportunities . Met a lot of great people. It can be stressful if your not use to that kind of work.
good,"Working with AVON is such an amazing experience. Sometimes it can be difficult and stressful for me, but I worked hard going door to door and going to one of the marketplace to pass the Avon brochures for customers. It was worth it."
good,"Empresa com gde potencial. Gestão imediata mto falha."
good,"Enjoyed being able to work at my own pace and achieve minimum sales to reach commission levels, made friends with customers and dealt with their queries/returns, with amicable results.  Regular customers ordered often, and word of mouth spread leading me to gain new customers and increase sales, only downside was incomplete deliveries. No ongoing contact from Area Manager either."
good,"Enjoyed working with family, friends, and other members of the community. Easily established friendly relationships with customers. Many return patrons."
good,Avon has been around for a long time but your earnings are scarce. It’s difficult to make a living with Avon. You would need to sell about $200/campaign consistently to move up the ranks
good,"Avon is the best place to work.  There you can equip with more knowledge and skills to enhance yourself and standout among others."
good,"-El encargado siempre llegaba tarde"
good,El ambiente era cómodo y era posible trabajar desde casa
good,I didn't have the best experience with this company. I worked alone with no help. That's prob why i never went for with this business.  My recruiter would never be available for questions. Allot of money came out of my own pocket to keep up with business. I don't really blame the company but the person who recruited me. She was more about making money for herself. She wasn't helpful and took advantage of me because she could. I loved their products and customer service.
good,Fazer seu próprio horário e várias premiações e comissões
good,Good solution if you have a baby. You work as long as you want. You are your own boss. You can have extra money. I find new people and new friends. I got discount for products.
good,Good company to work for. Too far to drive since they relocated. Great benefits and PTO. Very friendly staff. I enjoy my job here. Since relocating to Blue Ash it is just a bit far to drive.
good,"buen ambiente de trabajo,cadena de producción,cambios de campaña"
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, grandes compañeros, bastante experiencia laboral"
good,"Boa, mas muito exigente com novas prospecções pouca renumeração para o trabalho exigido."
good,"Don't get me wrong, I love Avon products. However, I didn't like having to get the books and see if people wanted to buy something and then have it sent to me and having to deliver it to the client. Also, it can be harder to get customers because not a lot of people find those items as a necessity."
good,"Nao permaneci pois temos que trabalhAr no sol ou na chuva e não dao material Apoi Exemplo sombrinha adoeci  e nao quis ir mais,sem fale falar que vc tem que cadastrar pra poder ganhar bem vc se mata e nao e reconhecido ."

Periodicamente partecipo a meeting e riunioni che l’azienda organizza per lanciare nuovi prodotti e nuove iniziative da proporre ai clienti."

good,"Abordar a las personas , es fácil, creando siempre entusiasmo, y promoviendo un producto que se vende solo."
good,"Empresa com grandes oportunidades de crescimento, gerência ótima de se trabalhar."
good,Working flexible hours and still be able to focus on other stuff since i was working for myself.It has to me to work hard because without clients there would be no salary so i had to motivate myself to find customers.The hard part is when people are not paying for their others in time and i end up having to pay for them and working on a loss.
good,You get to set your own work day for the most part and are judged by your results. Mentoring sales reps to be more products and helping increase their sales is the most rewarding part of the job. There is a great family culture within the Avon community.
good,Constant changes make it hard to implement and cope. Representatives are getting confuse with the changes and the things that they need to implement in their own individual business.
good,Tive a oportunidade de me relacionar com o publico.
good,"It help learn how to work with people and how to have patient and how to work under pressure and how to have good customer service  being with Avon help me to be patient,trust and respect people in a working place because I talk more with people everyday recruiting and training them on how to use the avonapp"

good,"minha função era bem corrida mais o ambiente de trabalho era muito bom.   "
good,"I have recently started working for Avon as a side job to earn a bit more money. It was very simple to become a representative. i applied, got a phone call a day or two later to arrange for someone to come and talk to me about it, by the time we had finished i was set up and ready to go. My first payment is due tomorrow and i have had items that need returning given to me in the last few days. there isnt anywhere to say what to do if stuff needs returning and if the amount will come off the total to pay, and if so how to do that."
good,"En typisk dag på arbejdet til e bruges til at starte på omkring 8, når jeg møder min manager og hun fortæller os om alle de ting, vi skal gøre, og det nøjagtige tidspunkt skal vi afslutte dem. De TAKS normalt involveret os udpakning kosmetik og gøre lister over de nye produts vi har modtaget med henblik på at kunne udskrive den kosmetiske katalog og mens vi gjorde det, vi skulle også hjælpe vores kunder og arrangere produts på samme tid."
good,"Supportive management with opportunity to advance in company. Great schedule flexibility and training seminars. Fast start, not too much training"
good,"As a representative you can work at the comfort of your own home while recruiting people and selling products along the way. Though it can be hard to find someone to recruit from time to time(depending where you try to find people), it can be rewarding when you."
good,Avon was a good place to work at for over 17 years. It has its policies that are not always employee friendly.. The morale is low over there due to the economy
good,"Though challenging these past several years, the core business and purpose remains the same, support women's independence, empower them to own their own business and be their own boss!  There has always been great camaraderie among co-workers and one mission- driving toward the success of our Representatives. One of the most enjoyable moments is attending a recognition event where these individuals are brought on stage and tell their story of how their lives have been changed by this company and their own efforts!"

good,"A Empresa oferece catálogos excelentes tanto ao cliente como ao vendedor,possui uma facilidade imensa em ganhar clientes com seus produtos maravilhosos"
good,"Typical days for me when I was working involved filling out my brochures and cards for when I would go customer scouting, looking up new products so that I would have relevant recommendations for customers, and checking my Representative website for new customers or orders. If I had just done a customer scout, I would follow up with phone calls."
good,Me permite conocer siempre nuevas personas y dia a dia aprendo mas tanto yo de mis clientes como mis clientes de mi
good,"Giornata di lavoro flessibile, gestibile come vuoi, colleghi di lavoro motivati e capaci"
good,Avon is a great way to work from home. You manage your own working hours. You meet lots of new people and can build up good friendships as well as very good customers. The hardest part of the job is when the company mess up orders and you have to constantly phone them up to get answers and to know what is going on to pass that onto the customers. The job can be really good at times but at others it isnt very enjoyable.
good,"On a typical work day is hassle door to door sales drop off catalogs. Learn to communicate better with people. I really don't deal with co-workers, I'm pretty much on my own. The hardest part of this job is that sometime there are no sales. The most enjoyable part of this job is that i get to see new faces."
good,This is a very flexible job where you can basically make your own hours as a second job.  Not great for a full time job.
good,"Working independently with door to door sales allowed me to meet new people and get to know them, this taught me to become more responsible and helped gain more confidence. I was in charge to manage my own wages and the ingoings an outgoings of customers. The hardest part was actually getting them to answer the door, but once they did i managed to make new friendships and bond with customers as i got to know their preferences from avon and help find what would be most suitable for them."
good,Learned to work in a multi-national matrix environment and strive for excellence.
good,"While I enjoy the freedom that direct sales provide, I do not have the time to devote to the marketing and sales of the products. My life requires a more structured workplace, with regular pay and hours. This position can be a 6 figure sales position for someone with the right network of clients, and time to devote to marketing."
good,I would meet with people that I knew and didn't know and would talk to them about their needs and wants and show them what AVON had to offer them. If they did purchase something I would collect their money and information and put in the order. I would then receive the merchandise and organize it and then hand deliver it to the customer. I learned a lot bout filing and organization skills with this job and I also learnt a lot about customer service and care. The hardest part of this job which made it overall difficult to keep this job was that it was difficult to find people in such a small town willing to spend money on AVON or even take the time to look at the book. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know new people and feeling that sense of joy when you deliver their merchandise to them and their so excited about their purchases.
good,"pues lo que me gusta del trabajo fue que conoses gente y pues vendes mas, aprendi a conocer muchos productos."
good,I like selling Avon. It's a good job to do on the side in my opinion.
good,"A typical day in the workplacewould be gathering consumer orders, placing the orders every other week and expecting the arrival mid-week. The most enjoyable part of the job is you see people and build relationships with them on a one to one basis."
good,"Eu adorava trabalhar no magazine luiza, para mim era uma empresa otima apesar de uns defeitos que existiam, aprendi a conviver entre pessoas eram super desagradaveis, ser agil, compartilhar, trabalhar em conjunto, não tive muita dificuldade pois sempre queria aprender cada vez mais, todos os dias eram bons. nunca vou esqueçer essa empresa!"
good,"I enjoyed the freedom of Avon the most,I basically was my own boss. The hardest part though about Avon is actually getting new sales/buyers."
good,"Foi uma experiência boa poder trabalhar aqui, adquiri muitos conhecimentos."
good,"Faço a revenda de acordo com o horário que escolho e quanto mais vendo maior meu lucro, o trabalho e fácil, mais pouco benéfico"
good,e uma empresa otima e muito boa da muitos premio de incentivo eu ja trabalho com a empresa a mas de cinco anos e nao pretendo sair nao
good,"empresa dinamica, metas e chance crescimento. bom ambiente de trabalho, apoio 0800, e gerencia excelente."
good,"Unfortunately Avon is very much stuck in their successes from years past. Although they have incredibly smart talent, they are set in old habits and beliefs for a distribution model that must evolve to scale."
good,para mi fue una oportunidad en la vida ya que gracias a la compañia de avon y mis esfuerzo de trabajo pude terminar mi carrera.
good,"avon es un trabajo que requiere tiempo libre, con el beneficio de que no importa el horario ni el dia, solo importa tratar de converncer nuevas vendedoras por campaña (cada 15 dias aproximadamente)"
good,"meu dia de trabalho era bastanti tranquila,"
good,• Brought in to develop 1 year business plan with district manager; focused on existing versus expected quotas and methods of increasing profitability.
good,hacer el valor minimo era dificil dependiendo la temporada pero lo que mas me gusto fue que nada me quedaba dificil y siempre hago mas del pedido minimo
good,"Nesta empresa me desenvolvi muito, amadureci bastante e me tornei muito mais responsável do que já era."
good,I have acquired many interpersonal skills. I keep a professional approach with my co-workers
good,"Precisa valorizar o trabalho de suas executivas, priorizando estabelecer salário fixo, como também ajuda de custo para poderem prospectarem e outros direitos regidos pela clt."
good,"everything in Avon is totally depended on how long you work and when you work i have a 1yr old daughter so its very easy for me, A typical day at work would be to do everything i have to do at home get dressed and im on the go, i have regular clients that i personally contact with frequently. i have learned that in order to make money you have to be persistent and very personable i never had people skills before this job. i never had co- workers i would meet with other reps and we would help each other with sales as far as tips. the most hardest part of my job would have to be not getting a sale i am a very competitive individual and i don't like being behind so when i lose money its kind of discouraging,, the most enjoyable part is when i am able to serve the customer with what they paid for"
good,"Es buen trabajo,buen ambiente laboral aunque un poco repetirivo e encerrado."
good,"Through working with Avon, I have learned to communicate with people of all ages about different products on the market. I have also learned about the products I sell through listening to customers and passing on to other customers."
good,No day is the same.
good,um dia típico de trabalho:
good,"no tengo horarios, mi sueldo lo gano si me esmero, muy cumplidores con los pedidos, dificultad para cobrar los productos."
good,I am self employed with AVON as an Independent Sales Representative and Beauty Advisor.
good,very fun learned alot about products and how to use them whats best for different skin types..
good,Uma empresa Boa onde tive oportunidade de conhecer várias áreas dentro de uma logística
good,Possibilità di crescita ma stipendio fortemente instabile
good,Avon Supply Chain had a great culture and after working other places was actually fairly good at planning and integrating functions. There was ample room to move up or laterally.
good,Un buen trabajo para alguien que quiere obtener ingresos facilmente.
good,seviyeli disiplinli kendi işimi rahatça yapabildiğim isg önem veren güvenli bir iş ortamı.olumsuz yanı gelecek vaad etmemesi hiç bir sosyal hakkı yok
good,"Ambiente agradável para se trabalhar. A empresa se preocupa muito com os aspectos e impactos ambientais derivados de seu processo produtivo, temos muitos treinamentos de conscientização sobre o consumo de aguá e energia. A empresa trabalha com as políticas de BPF - Boas Práticas de Fabricação e TPM - Total Produtividade da Manufatura, oferecendo muitos treinamentos para aprimorar os conhecimentos de seus colaboradores para melhoria contínua de seus processos produtivos. Eu aprendi muito sobre os conceitos de 5S, ferramentas da qualidade, trabalho em equipe, uso racional dos recursos da natureza."
good,"empresa de grande porte, fornece desconto de produtos para funcionários, fretado, refeição no local."
good,Clean offices and a group of hard working individuals.  Great location near subway.  The best part of the experience was being able to buy inexpensive costume jewelry and makeup.
good,The enjoyable part of the job was that I was working at home. I had to find customers and sell them their products. The hardest thing was that I had to go to people's door and ask them if they would like to have a look at the Avon's catalogue.
good,"Was an overall very positive experience. I gained many skills that have prepared me for better opportunities. The downside was always the unforeseen and not being able to feel the job security. Always changes to the organization an downsizing staff throughout my entire career with Avon. What kept me there was the positive business relationships, peers and the flexible work schedule."
good,I worked for this business as extra income during education and only really worked when I needed to.  If you put a lot of time and effort into an Avon business you can excel.
good,"As a manager,I believed in the products. I also believed in the opportunity Avon had to offer the representatives. That was the easy part. The hard part was the unrealistic recruiting goals. I live in a small rural area and I had to recruit 30 plus ladies a month. I believe Avon should focus teaching the representative how to sell. If the representative makes money they will stay and encourage others to sell the products. Avon representatives should receive sale bonuses."
good,Avon is a great company to work for as long as it's not your main source. If you have enough time to help it grow it could be an excellent career move
good,"It was kinda second home for me, like everything go so smooth because we treated every employee as our family, but come on i need more salary to sustain the needs of my family."
good,Es buena se conoce gente nueva haces sociales utilizas tu tiempo Cómo quieras y podes hacerlo desde tu casa
good,En mi experiencia estuve muy agusto estuve un año y no pude quedarme mas por que ya no hacían a nadie fijo
good,"A Avon é uma empresa muito dinâmica, com alto volume de trabalho. Importante ter bom relacionamento já que a empresa não conta com políticas claras. Oferece bom pacote de remuneração e crescimento profissional rápido."
good,"Diverse workforce"
good,"The most enjoyable part of being a representative is being able to work on your own time, and for the hours you feel like working. The hardest part of the job is finding new clients, as there may be many representatives in one area. Avon gives opportunities to people who don't even have qualifications, and also job opportunities to people who are occupied at the same time and don't have much time to sacrifice."
good,nessas duas empresas eu era vendedora externa e sempre tinha que ta visitando minhas clientes e fazendo demostraçao de produtos. eu so tinha contatos com outros vendedores em dias de reunioes que eram sempre cheias de aprendizado e trocas de conhecimentos.
good,"Ho imparato tantissimo e ho fatto formazione nel mio ambito."
good,"Trabalhar com avon e natura e bom mais nem sempre era lucro tinha dias que nao era boa vendas dias de boa vendas mais nem sempre era lucro,eu aprendi a me envolver mais com as pessoas ,conhecer mais pessoas a me desenvolver mais,so q a parte mais dificil era receber das pessoas que algumas era dificil mais sempre tem as pessoas boa tambem a parte mais agradavel e quando eu entregava os produtos e as pessoas ficavam satisfeitas com oque elas compravam"
good,This is a great part-time or full-time job for anyone. You can have lots of fun & make lots of money if you are in a less saturated are of the country.
good,"Trabalhei por muitos anos nesta empresa e ganhei muito dinheiro com o trabalho de Gerente de Vendas, porém os problemas operacionais e as metas que aumentavam constantemente, de 20 em 20 dias, tornaram a minha vida pessoal um caos."
good,the products are great and the management helps with seminars and follow-ups for new and struggling agents. But the job market is tough and you have a lot of competitors.
good,"Fun job.  Able to set your own hours and work schedule.  Get discounts on all products including cosmetics, personal care items, fragrances, clothing, shoes, anti-aging creams.  Great way to meet a lot of people when selling door-to-door."
good,"the most enjoyable part is meeting customers as this makes me more confidence and some are very nice.in my opinion, there wasn't a really hard part of the job. I learned many new things such as how the job is done, delivering products and talking to customers with the information that is needed. I work try and work everyday in my spare time if I could."
good,"Great people, growth advancement and a great work life balance. Global company with great innovations. Would recommend working here if you want great Global experience."
good,Buen trato con lo clientes y fácil de desempeñar. Buen horario compatible con otros trabajos
good,avon é uma empresa multinacional onde vc cresce se quiser como empresario vc faz seu proprio salario e vai passando de nivel a cada ciclo se bater os requisitos .então só depende da sua rapidez e vontade de crescer.
good,The variety of products kept the selling culture vibrant and exciting. I was a one man team with internal motivation to reach goals.
good,"Uma empresa muito boa, porém paga pouco e agente trabalha muito, o bom que agente tinha o tempo livre trabalhava a ora que quiser"
good,Avon offered a great environment to work and great compensation package and benefits throughout the time I've been there. However the company is challenged these days.
good,"Learned how to up sell to clients to bring in more money.  I enjoyed selling the products such as buying a lip color, and up selling to get the client to buy a lip liner, and lip gloss brings in big bucks."
good,es buena la relacion laboral y nos consienten con comidas especiales en fechas importantes como el dia de la madre y el padre sin mencionar otras mas
good,"Sendo autônoma, eu fazia meus horários, sendo assim, tinha mais tempo para realizar outros trabalhos e lazer."
good,"Muito divertido trabalhar nessa área pois conhecemos sempre muita gente, e isso faz com sempre nós mantemos motivados."
good,"A typical day at AVON Boutique would be a normal day as I come in to work on 10:00 a.m. and finish working until 7:00 p.m. I have learned on managing my time, managing the inventory for the AVON products, and most importantly interacting with customers. The hardest part of the job is when a customer is not happy or unsatisfied with the service given as the boutique is usually filled with customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is by working with the other co-workers as they are very helpful and easy to talk to."
good,"Preparing product such as lotion, bubble bath, eyeliner,for packaging. I learn how to prepare different products.the hardest part of the job is the company might be closing soon and thats why I'm looking for other oppurtunities"
good,I am experienced in making door to door sales and I am very independant. The hardest part of my job role was gathering a lot of customers and building on my micro business so that I can make a decent amount of profit for myself. Most enjoyable part of my Job was handing out all the orders placed by my customers and meeting and greeting them whilst doing so.
good,"Sempre trabalhei com muita liberdade,  faço minhas vendas em  meus horários livres ."
good,"L’attività lavorativa quale presentatrice avon è stata un’ottima opportunità di crescita personale e professionale, in quanto mi ha permesso di gestire adeguatamente il mio tempo e di gestire l’attività in piena autonomia. Inoltre mi ha permesso di entrare a contatto con la gente e di sperimentare le varie tecniche commerciali. Sono anche in grado di comunicare in modo chiaro e preciso, rispondendo a specifiche richieste della committenza e/o utenza di riferimento grazie alle attività di relazione con la clientela e la rete di vendita durante lo svolgimento dell’attività quale presentatrice avon. Tale attività mi ha resa in grado di gestire autonomamente il lavoro, definendo priorità e assumendo responsabilittà acquisite e di lavorare in situazioni di stress."
good,"Typically with any home based role, it is all about the time you put into it. Do not expect to see sales if you do not put in the hard work. "
good,"Learned regulations and a vast array of phone systems "
good,"Independent worker, traveling from customer to customer,"
good,A typical day working for Avon would consist of doing light paper work and walking to my customers houses to take or give out brochures and deliver their products.
good,el tiempo de trabajo lo manejo yo
good,"Um dia ótimo para trabalhar,"
good,"....sou dona do meu tempo e sou administradora do meu negócio, de como, quando e onde vendo."
good,Aprendi mais sobre as tendências da moda. Aprendi ter jogo de cintura com clientes . Administrar mais . Me senti mais profissional. Não tinha salário era comissão até 50%
good,good company to work for with flexible working hours and good benefits as a sales leader
good,No tempo em que trabalhei nesta empresa tive apoio de gerentes e amigas de trabalho como tambem da direção da propria empresa.
good,"Comecei novinha aqui, porém com ajuda sempre da minha mãe fui aprendendo aos poucos até conseguir andar sozinha. A vontade de atender clientes, de desenvolver persuasão começou nesta fase."
good,Learned fundamentals of product management and merchandising. Did a good job of educating beyond the job - included speakers from different departments and interacted in group projects.
good,"O dia a dia nessa empresa é muito agradável, pois tem um ótimo ambiente de trabalho, funcionários engajados e preparados para um ajudar o outro. Aprendi nessa empresa essa profissão de operador de máquinas pois até então trabalhei de auxiliar, e a parte mais difícil era a comunicação entre operador e supervisores no entendimento em relação as necessidades para uma boa produção, exemplo falta de algum componente, falta as vezes de peças para finalizar o set-up e etc, e o que guardo de agradável é a união da equipe em que eu liderava e trabalhava eramos como uma família."
good,se entraba a las 6 y estábamos en la linea de trabajo.
good,se entraba a las 6 y estábamos en la linea de trabajo.
good,-um dia cheio de trabalho e correria
good,"Buen lugar de trabajo,buenos beneficios,buenos compañeros y buen horario de trabajo solo que es un poco rutinario y para mi lo malo es que casi no hay posibilidad de surgir a un puesto mas alto o mas importante y solo eso.."
good,"Fazemos a prospecção a tarde, e nesse trabalho aprendi muitas coisas, como por exemplo: visitas, entregas de matériais de trabalho para as revendedoras e a nossa gerente é uma benção, muito gentil, educada, respeita todas da mesma forma,todas nós somos muito companheiras uma da outra, formamos uma família. O que eu acho mais difícil nesse trabalho é o salário, pois ganhamos pouco pelo nosso trabalho, por que temos que estar sempre ligando para as revendedoras para que elas não parem de vender os produtos. E gastamos muito com telefone, gasolina e o salário não compensa, tanto trabalho. Só que tudo isso é recompensado quando estou conversando com as pessoas, pois adoro conversar, lidar com pessoas, adoro senti o calor humano."
good,"I loved that you could manage your own buissness and time and money, but one thing i did not agree with was that once you started you were automatically on your own with little to no help on how to get things started."
good,"Being an AVON Representative was a very sociable and flexible job, however, did not provide the financial stability. The job itself is very suitable for an individual in full time education."
good,"Considero uma empresa, no geral boa de se trabalhar: o ambiente, as pessoas e a importância que eles dão a segurança, são fundamentais."
good,"Trabajo cómodo ya que trabajas desde donde tú quieras, como tú quieras y cuando tú quieras. Eres tu propia jefa y obtienes experiencia de cara al público ya que tienes que establecer conexión con ellos para vender."
good,El ser un lider en avon es de suma importancia ya que con ello se logra trabajar en equipo todos encaminados a un solo lema un solo equipo un solo avon para llevar en tiempo y forma los pedidos a las representantes
good,"Esta empresa como todas as outras o foco sempre será o aumento de fichas que precisam ser entregues quinzenalmente."
good,"Great company to work for with great benefits and people, location. Convenient to major highways and walking distance to train station, shopping and restaurants"
good,"Avon has been a good place to work with competitive salaries and good work-life balance.  However, since moving the headquarters to the UK, many of the roles in NY have moved overseas."
good,working at Avon was competitive and fast I learned how to run every machine in my department. We had a good management team that was there for the employees
good,"Ótima empresa salarial , no entanto tinha dificuldades para adaptar devido vido pessoal , tem muitas viagens pela empresa e nossa região não ajuda em estradas"
good,Mas trato con las representantes directamente y mejorar su reparto
good,i am enjoying selling skin care products as i share my knowledge with customers and help them to find what they are looking to improve their skin overall appearance.
good,i enjoyed entering into avon business because it gives me income which i needed. it adds my knowledge in terms of dealing the product to my client and it boost my self confidence as well.
good,"Empresa que tem várias possibilidades, não existe rotina, cheia de oportunidade e desafios."
good,Empresa que dá oportunidade de desenvolvimento profissional.
good,Hay que tener paciencia en mi caso particular los pedidos llegaban mal
good,"Great hard working company - if in a role you excel in you could really go far here - team really great to work with. Working with wider team - i.e different countries is hard work - to get approval or sign off for products is a long process, often other teams wouldn't have things ready in time. And management wouldn't be much help."
good,Excelente empresa destacando que nos fornecia liberdade para direcionarmos e gerenciarmos de maneira única o resultado que nos era solicitado.
good,Buen ambiente laboral muchas horas y poco  sueldo .
good,"I found that it was great at first due to opportunities being apparent. However, opportunities became minimal with little support for progression within the company. Management are great if you need help and support, however progression wasn't priority"
good,"Uma  empresa  extremamente  agradável  para  se  trabalhar  pena  que  o  Brasil  esta  passando  por  uma  crise , por  mim  mesma  nunca  sairia  de  lá ."
good,"Empresa que pensa na mulher. Pensa no bem estar dos funcionários, possui ótimos benefícios."
good,"Gestivo la mia attività in totale autonomia con tutti gli strumenti che Avon ti metteva a disposizione per guidare i tuoi Clienti all’acquisto."
good,"Avon is great to boost your income but you cannot support yourself entirely on it. Fun, flexible and great discounts on beauty products! My confidence has grown incredibly as have my organisational, communication and time management skills."
good,"Era sencillo vender a cualquier persona pero muy difícil a la hora de cobrar. Mejoré la organización al momento de cobrar, pidiendo un pago previo. No me parecía justo que la empresa, teniendo vendedoras en muchos estados y países cobrara más de la mitad de las ganancias."
good,"As a company, Avon is most certainly a great organization. It cares about its employees, their development, their needs, and their goals. It collaborates heavily as long as you are active in your work and guarantees at least some form of backup from management."
good,conocimiento de los que les gusta a los clientes tratar con diferente personas crecer en conocimientos y saber desenvolverme en mi trabajo aprendiendo y esforzandome para cada dia dar lo mejor
good,A good Company with excellent benefits - potential growth over time if the sales environment improves. People are very Family oriented and offer a semi-flexible work schedule if needed. Always offer great training opportunities that the employee can apply to future positions within the Company or at other employment.
good,The great thing about Avon is you work whenever you want. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone though because the profit is not worth it.
good,I typical day included posting Avon catalogs door to door or picking up Avon catalogs. processing orders online and handling money and speaking to customers face to face.
good,Being an Avon representative made it easier for me to earn and study at the same time.
good,A good place to work if you can handle tobacco. They have strong people and really know how to manage the business.
good,great co-workers and the management will come and talk to the employees to see how their days is going. And had a open door policy.
good,"A AVON representou uma ótima oportunidade para o início da minha carreira. Primeiramente por ser uma empresa de grande porte, com muitas atividades a serem realizadas. Em segundo lugar, o modelo de venda direta também se mostrou bastante interessante."
good,"back in old days the company was best. still is in ways.  but through out my years with the company, i went through way too many managers, at least 12 to 15. most had no personal interest in me, and offered no help for success. except one very special woman who i so counted on and miss. was sad to see her go. still keep intouch at times. before and since, especially since. the district got bigger and bigger. gone through manager after manager. younger and younger. district office closed. beauty advisor program stopped. now all they care about is leadership.and younger reps with company short time became favoritism and some of older reps been with company many years have been lost or gone."
good,"Empresa de grande porte internacional onde valoriza suas diretrizes de ética. Tem uma suave politica relacionada a planos de cargos e salários, oferece bons benefícios. os setores são geridos por gestores capacitados para administrar problemas e os conflitos do dia a dia. O clima institucional é agradável devido a gestão atual do Centro de Distribuição."
good, 
good,"Uma   empresa  bacana  de  se trabalhar devido os teus  beneficios  como dispor de ônibus fretados, e refeição no local com  ótimo ambiente   para  descançar após as  refeições uma otima sala de jogos   uma biblioteca com uma pequena lan house para passar o tempo,dispondo de uma pequena loja  da propria  avon com produtos em conta. neste  quesito  dou  nota dez  dando uma  lida em um livro que  fala  sobre  administração ou algo  do tipo  é algo que a avon precisa e muiiito melhorar  neste  quesito  pois como  em toda  empresa existe, hierarquia a serem seguidas é  algo que falta nos  setores operacionais como nas  linhas  de produção vejo que operadores de  produção não exerce de fato uma voz ativa em tuas  respectivas  linhas  fazendo com que não  haja um certo entendimento entre  operador e  auxiliares de produção."
good,I have lots of fun selling avon but the profit is not enough. wish I had moore to do and ear  money to
good,"The job was very relaxed; something I could do in spare time, whilst I was home from University and something I could build customer relations with."
good,"Buscar compradoras de productos por catalogo (accesorio de belleza, fragancias, ropa, maquillaje, vajillas,etc). Realizar pedido por Internet cuando se es representante. En la función de empresaria buscamos representantes para que ofrezcan los productos por catalogo, se les da una breve explicación de como se realizan los pedidos; se les brinda asesoría constante. Aprendí a trabajar en equipo y con mas amabilidad, a demás de tener mas facilidad de palabra. Lo mas difícil es el transportarme de un lugar a otro porque no tengo transporte y los públicos tienen su horario. Lo que mas me gusto fue la convivencia y el trato. "
good,"i been sales rep for a month or two, i did great sailing products, but only problem i don't get paid ever as sale rep unless im a leader, so if you want to make a team its good, but not this isn't job for you."
good,*Planejamento estratégico com foco no resultado;
good,Prospecting
good,"se eu podesse mudaria algumas coisas,ue trabalhava exteno nao era efetiva."
good,I really enjoyed my customers and my employees that I had. I loved organizing meetings and teaching people how to run their own business. Seeing all the new product first was always fun and showing people the product was interesting.
good,Very easy job if your looking for some experience or something small as a parent. As a young mum to 2 small children with a partner who works full time working at home is easier for me and the kids and you don’t need any work experience which is good if you are young would recommend if your looking for a little extra money.
good,it was a great experience since i am a student  i could do this on my own time and grow my sales aswell the important thing is learning to balance it out.
good,"Um dia típico de trabalho com muita prospecção, trabalho de campo, reuniões, emails e relatórios. Aprendi o domínio da mente em viver sobre pressão e dar resultados. A Gerência Regional Desumana, a cultura baseada no foco da empresa e ambiente de trabalho diversificado por ser em campo. A parte difícil foi a Gestão de pessoas de lugares e culturas variadas em uma só equipe, e a falta de seus subordinados não serem contratados pela empresa,A parte agradável é ''ter que ser e ser'' 24 horas inspiradora de pessoas, desenvolvendo nestas a vontade de vencer, conquistar seus sonhos... Eu sempre consegui! E também saber lidar e trazer resultados faça tempo bom ou caia uma tempestade desvassaladora. O reconhecimento da empresa para com seus resultados"
good,"There weren't any meetings or bosses.  However, there were online groups you could meet up with and converse with.  I literally knocked on doors and asked the person answering if they would like to look at a catalog.  Avon covers men and women and children and even your kitchen.  It sold itself and so the job wasn't really hard.  The gas was the issue and that is why I stopped selling.  I live in a rural setting and a house could be 2 miles from the next house.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to take my children with me and meet new people."
good,Its chance for anyone who is not working to have a job .interactive with people  be your on boss working your on shift on your on time .help other people to join
good,Empresa de grande porte com possibilidades de crescimento
good,"I enjoyed this job to start with,great benefits, company car, pay was average. then things got harder sales became harder and all the targets were inccreased"
good,"I really liked the idea of being my own boss, but the pay was not good for  me. My friends liked the idea of me selling Avon products. They did order from me. But they couldn't order all the time. I really didn't make that much money.  To be successful, I think people need to be aggressive and get in people's faces.  You need to sell to wider geographical area than your hometown.  If you have a car, even better. Otherwise it is very hard to earn a living at it."
good,"I was blessed to meet some amazing people in my almost 4 years with Avon. The company was ( and still is) going through many changes and despite the revolving CEO's and corporate changes, they still weren't able to bring the company back to what it once was."
good,"A typical day at work"
good,"Great job to have on the side however could not see myself creating a career with a enough financial security here."
good,"Eu que faço meus horários."
good,"Running my own Avon concession I was responsible for finding customers by visiting homes door to door, explaning the product range, leaving brochures and arranging to call back to disscuss orders. I would also arrange events for customers to come along to and hold product demonstrations. When takeing orders I would pay great attention to accuratly recording details and process these using a computer to place orders and then deliver the goods to customers once i recived them from the company. I would then takeandrecord payments and transfer these to the company as well as dealing withany faulty items and returns whilst maintaining customer satisfaction by addressing these matters promptly."
good,Little Extra Income Not Worth The Time And Energy. Too Many People Selling. To Easy To Join (So Literally Anyone Can And Will).
good,"a gostei mas podia ser melhor, la é muito bom de trabalhar gostei de pessoas que tem la mas eles nao dão tic de alimentação e nada disso , tive a oportunidade de ficar proxima de minha chefe que ganhei a confiança e o carisma ."
good,A typical day of work consisted of delivering brochures and providing outstanding customer service to maintain my clients overall satisfaction.
good,"Since this is commission, it is required that representatives go out and distribute catalogues to potential customers. I didn't work there for long, so I only sold products to close friends and family members. Once a customer would tell me what he/she would like to order, I would fill in information on an invoice then give them a copy. The hardest part for me was handing out catalogues to people I didn't know. I wasn't too comfortable with going door to door selling products. I quit because I was starting university that Fall and wanted to only focus on school. Also, buying catalogues could get very expensive, as I had to buy a lot every month or so. I did enjoy the quality of the products, the management and the customer service. I felt that they were very helpful and assisted me whenever I had problems."
good,"Avon é uma empresa muito boa com varios beneficios ,porém precisei mudar de turno e não fui muito bem recebida ,tanto que na primeira reestruturação do setor por ser a mais nova do turno fui dispensada . Mas não tenho nada de ruim para falar da empresa."
good,"Como o trabalho de executiva de vendas é autônomo , é simples conciliar a vida pessoal com o trabalho, sem prejudicar a ambos."
good,I enjoyed working for myself because I got to meet new people talk with them and find out things they like. I would say my typical work day consisted walking from door to door trying to sale different products to men and women. The hardest part of the job would be that you did not make a lot of sales in one day. The best part about the job was to sale to a customer and put a smile on their face. I have learned a great deal by having this job you get to make a customer happy and you get to enjoy seeing and meeting new people.
good,some times  stressfull fun with coworkers enjoyed  the work  the fields i chose werw rewarding to me.watching someone leave working witn infants
good,"Un trabajo siendo tu propia jefa, horario a convenir, conoces gente."
good,The hardest part of job is nothing if you put your work into it.
good,"My typical day with Avon is passing out my brochures and talking to people about Avon, taking their orders and entering them in the computer. I am learning to talk to more people and manage my time. I have leader that I talk to if I have any questions and I get emails offering advice to build my business. I love the products and being able to do it on my own time."
good,Praca dodatkowa. Małe zarobki ale dodatkowe zajęcie.Jednak ciężko jest pozyskać nowych klientów.
good,"é bom vender avon  é um trabalho agrádavel,onde vc conhece muitas pessoas,tem experiencias diferentes "
good,"Bom para completar renda, entretanto não há benefícios e o salário varia muito. Grande instabilidade financeira. Bons colegas de trabalho. Aprendi muito a lidar com o público, contornar problemas e garantir sempre a satisfação dos clientes."
good,Otima lugar de se trabalhar ambiente mt agradavel de trabalhar muito comunicativa deixa seus funcionarios a vontade preocupada com o bem estar de todos beneficios de bom tamanho etc....
good,i will strive at getting more customers by knocking on doors or going through friends and doing what i neaded too do . the hardest part would be when the day wasnt right but then id regaine my self and do better .
good,You have your own hours meet alot of great people. They have great people working for them.
good,"I mostly sale to my freinds and family so I call them, they call me, or they order online. I do take lots of notes to keep track of their ordering patterns and interest in products. If I haven't heard from one of them in a while I give them a call. The job is a lot of calling and following up. If you can learn how to keep your customers happy, they will for sure continue steady business with you. I have leaned a lot in concerns to time management, money management, and orginization. I have deffinately become a better sales person and gained a great deal more confidence. The Avon commutiy is a great support group. The woman that signed me up couldn't have been more helpful! She was awesome! I even had to meet with my district manager once. She lives in Columbia and drove over an hour out of her way to meet with me. She is extremely nice as well. They are great about keeping you up to date with very current emails. It has been a great experience. It isn't very reliable money unless you dedicate tons of time and energy into it (at least until you get a great clientel going). If you can tough things out a good while, you can potentailly make great money with the company. Otherwise, its great for extram income. My favorite part is getting to experiment with make up products on customers. Its tons of fun!"
good,"A great first management job which teaches an individual how to manage, train and motive independent contractors. Also, the employee discounts and incentive trips were awesome!"
good,Trabajo eficiente y ayuda un poco con lo que necesito
good,"Me parece buena empresa para empezar las relaciones laborales y así formarte poco a poco y a aprender a gestionar ventas, papeleo, etc"
good,"You can work when ever you want, yet you need to be responsible on peoples order. The work experience is great it lets you be more outgoing with the sales."
good,I am sure Avon is great. My mother sold avon and so did my grandmother.Just was not for me. The customer service department is really hepful when you call.The person who is above you was nice.Just not my thing.
good,Trabajo que me permita buscar mis clientes y siempre generar extras....entretenido porque hacía vínculos con mis clientes y yo siempre desarrollaba nuevos métodos para subir mis ventad

good,"es una buena empresa si sabes ganarle partido a todas las ofertas que te facilitan para la venta,puedes trabajar desde tu casa tu eres tu misma jefa"
good,"Set my own hours working from home or door to door. I managed myself however there were no online tools to help with the ordering process so it had become a mess.The hardest part of the job was getting the customers to pay for the product they had ordered because they had to pay cash, no other options were given from the Avon company at the time."
good,I enjoy having an extra income in a field that benefits the look and feel of my customers and myself.
good,"Nesta empresa tive o prazer de trabalhar com pessoa competentes , profissionais e agradáveis . Recebi valores profissionais e pessoais muito importantes para a minha vida pessoal e profissional.A empresa em si teve muitos atributos , tanto na gerência quanto na parte superior , um ambiente agradável e auto interativo . A parte mais agradável era de alimentar cadastros de novos revendedores e pedidos via internet , visando um crescimento de vendas e da equipe em que eu dominava como líder. Entretanto era necessário fazer algumas prospecções nas ruas da cidade para encontrar novos revendedores da marca , o que , de fato era constrangedor e um tanto complicado ."
good,"How to manage my own business, the most part of this I meet all types of people and the hardest part is to deal with customers attitudes"
good,"Avon is an easy job for anyone with a busy schedule to make some extra money. You don't have to set time out to sell Avon, just go through your normal day and talk to the people you already talk to and hand them a book so they can order or become a representative."
good,"Hectic, busy but fun work environment. Very heavy calendar maintenance with daily constant changes and last minute ad-hoc meetings. Direct reports were very understanding & considerate. Open communication was key to success."

good,"Amavo lavorare con Avon, ambiente stimolante e gestibilissimo; ho dovuto abbandonare perchè non avevo piu clienti interessati tra le mie amicizie; non ne trovavo di nuovi perchè esistono molte rappresentanti avon, è questa è l'unica cosa negativa, perchè si finisce per forza, col farsi troppa concorrenza.La giornata tipica di lavoro era mostrare il catalogo con i prodotti,non avevo colleghi di lavoro, lavoravo in modo autonomo, incontravo i colleghi solo alla riunioni."
good,é uma empresa otima de trabalhar tinha varios beneficios e brindes e comissao nos novos cadastros de revendedoras
good,You get to set your own hours and work as much or as little as you like. You make as much as you want.
good,"A typical day at work was passing out pamphlets to future representatives, recruiting new people, adding cash, credit card and checks intake for the day. Organizing paperwork. I've learned how to sell cosmetics to people based on their needs and or wants. Management taught me a lot of tricks of the trade and how to grow in the company. My co-workers, I pretty much didn't see too much of because it's an independent industry. The hardest part of the job was to make a certain amount every month and it be enough to live off of. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting a discount on all the merchandise."
good,It is a great company as work own hours and what you put into your own Avon business you will get out of it.
good,le but de se travaille ces de trouver des clients en fessant du porte a porte ou de notre entourage pour leur montrer les produits
good,Relaxed working atmosphere. You are left to get on with it. Must be self motivated otherwise you will not make any money.  The commisoon rate is low compared to level of work done. Opportunity for advancement.

good,"Tienes la oportunidad de desarrollar todas tus habilidades, fortalezas y erradicas debilidades dia con dia. Te da la oportunidad de poder desarrollar mujeres con limites emocionales por medio de trabajo que cumplen sus sueños mas lejanos. La parte mas dificil de mi trabajo fie dejar a mi familia por mas de tres meses para poder dearrollarme como gerente de zona sin verla pero con el impulso de poder lograr mi crecimiento y desarrollo dentro de la empresa."
good,"Tempo para trabalhar, promoções execelentes.Empresa dinâmica e bem tranquila de se trabalhar."
good,"Working for subway was fun catering to customers needs and being able to associate with them. I learnt that I am good working in the public sector. In a typical day I would clean the surfaces in the front and back, prep the food, bake breads and cakes, serve people and make sure everything is organized and stocked up. I got along great with my co-workers and was always professional. I enjoyed that I got to meet new people and interacted with different types of people every single day. The only thing I struggled with was chopping onions but I would still get on with it."
good,"I learned in this company the importance of team work and sincerety in your work.The hardest part but enjoyable is during the first and last day of book 1 and book2..During peak seasons,many customers coming inside the supermarket.Everytime there are sales item and promos all employee are very busy but still smiling eventhough tired."
good,A Avon é o início de uma vida profissional. Ainda mais pra pessoas que não tem condições de trabalhar a não ser em casa. por forças maiores.
good,Being able to understand the particapants needs and goals. Active listening and provideng resouces that are availble. What i learned on the job was get you alot more gradification out of helping the participant when you guide the way with support instead of doing all the work for the participant. The hardest part of the job is to go through the emotions with the participant with out crossing boundaries. Most enjoyable part is to see the participant so happy with themselves when they have reached their goal.
good,This company name sells itself. You have all kinds of tutorials and help on the website as well as management helping you. It is what you put into this job is what you get out of it.
good,"Working here. You need to be energetic, flexible, immediate understanding, Always be kind/smile and have a long patience, memorizing the brochure and other promo also the manager's. You have to do other things. Like me. I am a cashier, staff, costumer service, sometimes im at the bosses position, baggage and janitress. That's not all. There's other things I do there."

good,It was not the best place to be you only get paid on commission. Its hard to get people to pay or to get a hold of them to receive their products ...
good,-Empresa que vê muito o lado dos funcionários visando sempre melhorar a cada dia!
good,"Trabajar en esta empresa fue una experiencia muy buena y divertido , pero no me sirve que los productos que pidan mis clientas no me lleguen.con las demás revendedora no hablamos mucho."
good,Great place work for someone with no commitments and starting out in retail. Nice people work with and different experience on a daily basis. Commision based company if you want make money.
good,You get to work from home and make your own schedule. I learned that when people order they need to pay for it
good,"Because I worked from home, My day would differ on daily basis due to working or meeting with new different clients everyday. Some make the job easy whilst others at least try to make the job easy .Even though I worked on my own, I learned the importance of team work, working together with my clients made the job fun and more appealing. I also learnt the importance of time management as it can make the business grow if managed properly ."
good,"It was good at first, but it got a lot harder later on when customers refuse to pay for goods, so instead of me returning them back to the company, I paid for them myself and kept them for myself or give to family as a gift, I always made sure I paid for my orders, but it was like I had to pay every week, after paying one bill off, it was getting too much as I kept running myself broke just to pay those off, so I had to quit and look for something else. but the part I loved was getting free gifts, sales leader was awesome and very helpful."
good,e mas fácil e tenho mas tempo para mim e bom eles tratam bem e mas fácil para quem tem muita coisa para fazer ao dia
good,slow days packing order  not really a place to make money you would really have to work a lot dor to door walking telling people about it diffent type of work not really for me
good,"Liberal muy tranquilo el trabajo,conocí mucho la verdad xq repartimos en 12 zonas distintas"
good,"Avon is a great place to work. But i came in through a temp agency. Great hrs. You can pick you own shift, 1st 2nd or 3rd.great team atmosphere, great employers"
good,"It was a sale for someone else really.  Lots of idealism of how you could rank up the ladder but the reality was, it was exceptionally difficult. customers werent always co operative.  You sometimes had to send orders back or resell them. commission based."
good,boa empresa pena que tem pessoas que não valoriza os colaboradores com tempo de casa. Em processo de aproveitamento interno para promoções infelizmente a oportunidade na maioria das vezes fica para quem tem menos tempo de casa.
good,"Estuve más de un año en esta empresa y eran más las pérdidas que tenía que las ganancias, no sé si esto es debido a quien me llevaba a mí en la empresa o a la empresa en general."
good,meeting customers and trying to make new customers. i have learned how to approch people and help new and old customers. i have successfully managed to make good relationship with everyone.
good,".Rotina auxiliar ,orientar e buscar crescimento de vendas "
good,"Aprendi a desempeñarme como vendedora, y a perder el miedo a tocar puertas a contactar a las personas en la calle."
good,"foi um tempo que aprendi, mais existe muita pressão p conseguir novas vendedoras"
good,"Even though its a recognized multi-national Company, there is no work/life balance and you get burn out quickly.  Its very valuable to have a balance between your job and personal life, it helps to be more productive and motivated to continue working there."
good,Satış yapabilirseniz elinize küçük miktarda para geçiyor cevreniz geniş değilse ve üye yapmiyorsaniz fazla tavsiye etmiyorum
good,"A typical day at work will be when there is an open day for every consultant to come buy cosmetics at a low price"
good,"Avon is a good company to work for ,because you became your own boss you work at your own pace at your own time,avon gives opportunities to unemployed people to earn some money so that they can support themselves and their families."
good,"Avon is a good company to work for ,because you became your own boss you work at your own pace at your own time,avon gives opportunities to unemployed people to earn some money so that they can support themselves and their families."
good,Aprende muito como vendedora .aprende a ser responssavel.e desempenho meu trabalho com muita satisfacao.
good,"It was ok just had trouble gaining clients not many people have the extra money to buy from Avon, they have other priorities in life than beauty supplies."
good,"Self motivated job"
good,It wasn't for me personally. I didn't like the pay and it was boring.
good,"A possibilidade de viajar e conhecer novas culturas e o contato com pessoas proporcionando aprendizagem continua é o ponto alto do trabalho. No entanto, a empresa que presta serviços não pensou em aproveitar a expertise dos seus colaboradores para novos projetos."
good,"Avon is a brand that fairs well if you have a big market, I'm not real impressed with the products or the management."
good,"O trabalho é realizado em campo, ou seja em area externa;"
good,Sometime was very busy other times very slow
good,"Working at home is a stressful way to work because if you do not know a lot of people who want the product, you'll never make ends meet."
good,A positive with working for a piravetly owned company is if family issues occur this company will understand. There are ok discounts on the products and the owner was a blust to work with.
good,"Empresa muito Boa atenciosa...apredir muitas coisas , a me comunicar  com as  pessoas e trabalhar em equipe .."
good,The work place and the benefits was great but the salary for long hours is low. It's hard to get the promotion for employee. No free product for the lower rank employee.
good,"I  thought  i had something  good  going on  til i realized that I moved to the  wrong town  wrong place where  no one wanted Avon. I kept at  it  made private sales. My Rep manager was  sweet and  always there   to help. I may  begin again, I never  gave up  on Avon. still my favorite brands of makeup and  more."
good,Not enough money made and not enough benefits. Your leader doesn't do enough to help you. They did not help me make any money. I asked for houses to do Avon with and no one was interested. Brochures are too expensive and that is what you need to make money. I ended up spending more on brochures than I made
good,"O dia do trabalho é bom."
good,This career provides you with as much opportunity as you are willing to work for.
good,"É uma grande empresa porém os funcionários poderiam obter um pouco mais do que 30% por que graças aos funcionários que cada vez mais e mais pessoas conhecem os produtos , então tirando o salario a empresa é muito boa sim"
good,la parte que mas me gusto fueron los procesos lastima que no me dejaron desarrollarlos.
good,"You make your own hours, great opportunity to develop social skills. the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people every day and sharing the products and service avon has to offer."
good,"Good as a hobby, more or less doesnt get the bills paid when needed"
good,I am an independent representative which means I work for myself selling Avon products.  I earn a percentage of what I sell and reps that sell for me.
good,"every day "
good,Very Dynamic with OK management. Hardest part was working with people and the most enjoyable part was also working with people and gaining experience.
good,"otima empresa, só não tem muita oportunidade."
good,Mi evaluación es baja debido a otras responsabilidades. Aprendí acerca de productos de belleza y similares.
good,"Empresa Conceituada, com produtos de ponta, porém não se tem qualidade de vida."
good,They move you around a lot. They change there mind one minute from the next as to what or how you were doing something. They expect some people to give 200 percent while they give people help that don't even try. Poor pay and every year benefits decreased.
good,Working environment is great. However they don't offer a lot of development opportunities. They can try offer career succession for their employees within the Beauty Centre
good,"Salir a buscar nuevas representantes, dejándoles catálogos para que hagan sus pedidos y regresar para hacerles sus contratos.  Revisar que representantes faltan de hacer pedido, llamarlas y si no ir a sus casas."
good,"although hours were mine and it was fortunate to let me stay at home with my new born child at the time the money wasn't sufficient enough to live off. Avon quality is amazing, however i do live in a remote area in which most do have a higher wage and prefer branded wear."
good,"procurar clientes, responsabilidades, boa, bom, a cobrança, ganhar prêmios."
good,Fun to meet and talk to people but if you are not good at being pushy and a good sales person it's not for you. On the other hand if you are good at those things you can advance and you can advance fast.
good,"Llegar a la planta a primera hora, revisar la ruta designada, efectuar la carga del vehículo y salir a terreno."
good,"приличная компания, но у многих аллергия на их косметику. немного дороговаты цены для клиентов"
good,"saia quase todos os dias "
good,Working as a SAP security administrator. Its a cosmetics product based company and we implemented the SAP for Canada first and stabilized the system. I alone created the job profiles and applied more than 100 security related snotes.
good,Most enjoyable as a District Sales Manager was meeting new people and help them to develop their goals and dreams. I did love my job:)
good,"Avon is a great biusness, however you have to have a good amount of customers who will order from you in order to become successful. Avon requires a 10$ signup payment in order to start. You work by yourself you do have uplines that will help you although they have to be willing to help. The hardest part of the job is finding customers when you start out."
good,Merchandise was easy to sell and most importantly customers liked the products.
good,"I actually love the job itself, it's the politics that comes with the territory that I'm not fond of. My co-workers are awesome, they are good people. But I don't have a social life because of the hours I work so that leaves me feeling empty. Overall Avon is a great place to work if you don't have family or friends besides the people you work with."
good,"No es remunerado la venta de este producto, pero sirve de caminata el visitar clientes. Haces relaciones personales."
good,"Kind people and nice place to work."
good,"Generally a good place to work."
good,"En algunas áreas el ambiente de trabajo no es bueno, pero la compensación y los beneficios son muy buenos"
good,"trabalhei com vendas,e na outra empresa aprendi muito sobre atendimento telefonico,informatica,cartao de ponto."
good,"Un trabajo en el que ganaba un porcentaje que de lo que vendía, era muy cómodo ya que trabajas en tu tiempo libre"
good,"Empresa que se preocupa muito com o funcionário, em todos os aspetos e assim como muitas optaram pela terceirização, e em decorrência disso acabei sendo desligado.Não tive oportunidade de aproveitamento em outras áreas,muito em função de redução de custos.Isso me gerou um certo descontentamento devido às valores empregados pela  mesma,mais nada que mude meu conceito."
good,"Demanda louca, inúmeras variações, cultura agressiva"
good,"El trabajo es agotador, hay trabajar mucho si realmente quieres ganar, lo que mas pesa son los contratos de nuevas representantes y eso lo complica porque en el mercado ya hay muchas personas vendiendo productos Avon, y solo por las ventas de la representantes que ya están se recibe un pequeño porcentaje."
good,"Upon working on a direct selling company I learn more information about recruitment or field work activities, in sales,follow rules and their regulations."
good,En cuestión a beneficios monetarios se cobra poco pero esta bueno para aquellas personas que no tienen tiempo de pasar todo el día en otro lado ya que vos acomodas tus horarios y te administras solo.
good,"Flexible working hours."
good,"llegar 6.30 am y encontrar unos docentes que son los usuarios de los servicios que se prestan alli, deseperados por que quieren que los atiendan antes del horario normal, todo relacionado al laboratorio clinico, mi unico colega mi jefa una gran mujer pero con una empresa pequeña, lo mas dificil la hora de entrada, la experiencia adquirida"
good,Si estuvieramos mas unidos y valoraramos el trabajo diario de cada una de esas mujeres que salen a luchar a la calle seria una empresa excelente pero falta mas apoyo sobre todo en el salario. pero creo que hablando se puede cambiar esa tecnica.
good,"αρκετο τρεξιμο για να βρω νεους πελατες"
good,"-	Sorting brochures by filling out order forms and putting them inside the books and handing them out to houses of the area that I had been given."
good,"The job entails marketing and selling personal care products for the face and body, along with apparel and small gift items."

good,vender avon me resulto fácil debido a que uso los productos y puedo recomendar ciertos productos y darles mi experiencia personal llamándolas así para que compren
good,Este era un trabajo en el que me podia desenvolver fácilmente y socialisar
good,"Ottimo impiego senza troppo impegno, autonomo, senza obblighi di orari ma guadagno misero"
good,"Mi trabajo tenía la peculiaridad y la dificultad de desarrollarse en turnos rotativos, mi equipo debía cubrir una operativa multinacional de 17 horas de desempeño, de 7 a 24h. Aprendí en los primeros meses a autoformarme en tecnologías muy específicas y a comprender un sistema de información. El equipo debía estar en una sala de acceso restringido lo que condiciona en gran medida el trato con el resto de personal y departamentos de la empresa, e intensifica por contra la necesidad de coordinación y trabajo en equipo dentro del propio área. Es muy provechoso trabajar dando servicio a varios países. Lo menos agradable es permanecer muchas horas en solitario por la noche terminando de resolver los jobs en schedule. La parte más sociable del trabajo es el disfrutar de un comedor de empresa, en el que todos los empleados comparten esa media hora al día."
good,"No começo gostava muito de trabalhar lá, com o tempo fui perdendo o interesse e ficando desmotivado, até resolver sair, mais é uma boa empresa..."
good,"No começo gostava muito de trabalhar lá, com o tempo fui perdendo o interesse e ficando desmotivado, até resolver sair, mais é uma boa empresa..."
good,"met new people , got out into the fresh air , I could take my children with me to work ...   the hardest part was having to go out in the winter and rainy days ..."
good,Depending on the day OK.  Some good and some not so good. At first was very enthusiastic but then area manager retired and new manager was good at motivation skills and incentive to want to stay.
good,"A Empresa AVON é uma ótima empresa, poxa se fosse falar dela e como é o ambiente com os fusionários e (alguns) líderes e superiores é muito boa, mais avia algumas pessoa que querem ser mais que outras pessoas, infelizmente isso tem em todo lugar já fato, mais são aquelas coisa, atos que mudam tudo dentro de uma companhia, e era isso que acontecia os líder e superiores, queria fazer coisas que não avia cabimento de fazer alguns não sabiam fazer nada neim conheciam a empresa mais mesmo assim nos funcionários eramos a obedecer, por que quem obedeci ganha benção e quem não obedeci gera maldição."
good,"ótima, empresa de se aprender a vender e lidar com o publico ."
good,"meu dia era sair em busca de novos revendedores pra minha equipe, dar assistencia para os q ja estavam na equipe; trabalho muito dinamico, com muito foco pra ser bem produtivo;"
good,"I liked working with this company, but I ended up getting married, then moving, so I left the company, and moved out of the area. There was no money to be made at the location I was selling the products."
good,"-you work on your own time, so time management must be enforced"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the position was the interaction with the customers and staff. The organization was very family orientated. The fast pace environment, new products to be displayed with your own creative ideas. Loved being a hands on Manager."

good,Ottima azienda mi sono trovata a vendere diversi prodotti di ottima qualità
good,"Fun flexible work at your own pace, lots of flyers to hand out and make new connections regularly to expand your client list, take product orders and deliveries"
good,"Being an Avon representative means that I make my own schedule. I am responsible for my sale and the goals are to meet new people every day, sale product and help other people become a sale representative if they wish to. I love the thrills the product and my loyal customers, I dislike the fact that it can be hard to recruit new people to Avon however the challenge that is what makes it so enjoyable and fun."
good,Competitive compensation among the industry. Working with Independent Sales Force is the best fulfillment. Equal Earning Opportunity to all is the great community outreach of the company. The company values are aligned with personal values.
good,"A empresa tem um perfil tradicional mas vem mudando nos últimos anos."
good,"Everyone at Avon was friendly and welcoming.  Anyone would help anyone with anything, it was a family so to speak.  Offered a lot of fabulous trips and met senior management who would listen genuinely to what you had to say.  There were a lot of perks such as a company car and a gas card you could use for personal as well.  They gave you all the tools you needed and tons and tons of free Avon!  I really enjoyed working for the company but the daily travel was a lot, there were very high goals that were a lot of time unattainable leaving no work life balance at all."
good,avon is good to do because if you have the right amount of customers you bring in a lot of money. even tho they have changed somethings that they sell the customers still are happy
good,Mi piace non toglie tempo o spazi nella vita privata
good,"Sales representative for a home base business. This is a commission job. Pay Avon, what is left is profit from orders. Money is not fixed amounts. This is great for extra expenses or saving for a big item. Avon becoming more competitive to the standing store fronts. Great make-up, household items, clothing is big sellers, not your grandmother Avon."
good,"When i worked for Avon, i enjoyed the job but struggled to find custom due to people in my area already doing the job. I enjoyed being my own boss though."
good,Enabled me to work around my children and building up a team who became my friends. I had a fantastic manager called Tracey who really supported me to an advanced level
good,E uma boa empresa mas trabalho como revendedora por comissao e nao tenho salario fixo nem estabilidade finaceira
good,"En las reuniones con la consejera de zona  se pasa muy bien, es el único contacto que tienes con las demás distribuidoras"
good,"I loved working my own hours but truly couldn't make ends meet off of the commission alone. I seemed to spend more than I made, which is obviously not the point of employment."

good,"It's not steady with pay and customers, but the hardest part of the job is putting yourself out there when most women and men prefer to shop at the store to buy clothes, perfume/cologne, and jewelry. I have learned to be patient, a great listener, and punctual. The most enjoyable part of this job is having a customer be delighted about the product they have received, and they either wear it or use it or give it as a gift."
good,"Daily tasks involved preparation of designs, prototypes and supplier follow up for feasibility; Project management duties; Daily interaction with Global Partners in Europe/Middle East/Asia and South America; Management is removed from immediate problems due to overwhelming workload so one must act decisively and promptly to aid global regions to make correct changes and/or troubleshoot packaging problems that arise. Most challenging part of the position is working with extremely limited budget which did not allow as many line trials as would avoid future problems during production. Difficult to deal with constant personnel changes and shifting company directives. Most enjoyable  part of the position was interaction and management of Global Engineering counterparts as well as working with products I love."
good,"Tive uma oportunidade de trabalhar em diversas áreas: operador de empilhadeira, auxiliar de logística e conferente das mercadorias."
good,"Sobre a empresa tenho que afirma você tem que correr atrás de suas metas que são vender o bastante para poder ter um bom salário. Apreendi a servi as pessoas, como agradar os gosto delas, demonstrar tudo que tens em mãos."

good,i want to work in a good organization this is a good organization all the management are good
good,"O relacionamento direto com as revendedoras proporciona aprendizado diferente a cada dia. O contato com a gerência é regular e com as outras gerentes é ocasional. A parte mais difícil do trabalho é o fechamento das metas e a parte mais agradável é levar oportunidade a pessoas de qualquer faixa etária, além de participar de projetos como câncer de mama e luta contra a violência doméstica."
good,Meu trabalho junto a esta empresa foi de forma autônoma então meu relacionamento junto a direção/gerência foi de forma tranquila apesar

good,"O dia de trabalho sempre muito corrído as vezes tedo que fazer revezamento de funcionários para almoçar e determinados produtos não parar de serem produzidos devido a sua grande demanda, tive um ótimo aprendizado pois soube lidar com coisas que nem fazia idéia que existiam, as vezes tinhamos contato com supervisão e gerência mas eram raras dependendo do momento da empresa. Com relação aos meus colegas de trabalho nós aprendemos um pouco com cada um que se mostraram prestativos e nos ensinaram o que fazer em cada seção, a parte mais difício foi chegar de um mundo totlamente diferente do que vivia anteriormente para aprender e mostrar que seria capaz de superar qualquer obstáculo e continuar de pé. E a parte que mais gostei foi que consegui, aprendi e superei todas as dfículdades mas mostrei a que cheguei."
good,"Eu gostei de trabalhar para Avon,eu era revendedora,fazia amisades,"
good,I though this was very helpful as i thought you how to work on your own. It thought you how to go out and get sales and talk to customers and to be your own person and to get thing done by yourself with no help from others. The hardest part of the job was getting sales as no-one was that interested.I liked being my own boss
good,Gostei de trabalhar com avon foi mais uma experiência no meu curriculo
good,"Muy positiva,"
good,"aprendi a relacionarme, aprendi a manejarme en el ambiente de ventas."
good,"Working with AVON i was able to set up my own hours and work out of home. I was able to work at my own pace, i was my own boss and was in control of my wages depending on the output of which i sold the materials i was presented with. Also the fact that i could be able to take care of my child and work at the same time was a huge plus."

good,I worked at home at my own pace That was good for me. I would recommend family and friends to work for Avon You get to meet new people and help them with buying products to make them more beautiful
good,Going door to door posting brochures. Taking any orders. Submitting orders to avon. Taking delivery of goods. Delivering to customer. Can be a pain getting the brochures back at times which is annoying especially when you have to pay for them yourself. Commission based. This is a job that I really enjoyed doing. Always loved looking through a good old avon book !!
good,"Meet customers by going door to door, wotd of mouth. Catalogues were handed out or shared to show a large selection of products to biy. Or Demos or sampler of products. That was thé best way to sell. The income depended on how much was sold by commissions."
good,Has a vast amount of options as to your own schedule and style of sell. The flexibility is awesome. Has fine products that speak for themselves. Well known brand that brings in business.
good,"Es un ambiente de trabajo agradable, bonito porque interactuas con muchas personas por lo que es muy dinámico."

good,Workplace culture is great. Management is keen on developing its employees. Nice atmosphere. Engaged employees who work hard to achieve the company's objectives
good,This job helped build my communication skills. I also gained god organizing skills. The job consist of taking customers orders and organizing their orders and books.
good,"In the beginning, it was a warm, friendly workplace.  Then, under new  management,  it changed a lot.  Work ethic and moral dropped.  They were also planning to relocate again, which was not convenient for me."
good,"When I got there I first check for tickets if there is somethink to fix immediately, if yes; just work on it, if not; check all the applications are working ok"
good,It was interesting to try out a sales job that you get to choose your own hours and build your own client base. I enjoyed trying this out for a bit and would enjoy more customer service jobs in the future
good,"Disposición al dia, buena administración, y atenta con los clientes y emprendedores"
good,"Ótima empresa, boa qualidade dos produtos e gestão do sistema de revendas. Boa opção para renda complementar."
good,Avon gives you the time to work and assist on other important things in life. It totally balances work and life schedule. Gives you the freedom to work from home.
good,Working as an independent Avon representative I maintained a steady customer base and was able to offer and suggest Avon products according to my customer's needs.
good,I love my job and the people I work with.  Very friendly supervisor and team.  I work independently as a category specialist.  Overall it’s a great place to be!
good,El rubro de venta directa es un mundo aparte pero es un buen entrenamiento y linda empresa para hacer experiencia.
good,I needed to make extra money so I try Avon. The products were good. The company was trusted I used the products. It worked out for me being a stay at home parent.
good,"Lavoro stimolante e molto divertente,ti fa sviluppare delle abilità che non si insegna a scuola,molto consigliato"
good,I enjoyed working with Avon as it gave me the opportunity to develop and work with customers on my own terms.  it was a friendly environment and I always felt secure when making orders as I knew all my information was kept confidential.
good,Avon is a great independent and flexible job with great products.  Avon allows me to be my own boss and run my own business.  Many of Avon's products provide an avenue for women to improve self esteem. As a Avon representative it allows me to meet people and offer them a chance to grow.
good,"Boa empresa, bom salario, mas precisa se modernizar."
good,"Honestly, I didn't get much out of my time at this company. That being said, I didn't go into this as a permanent career choice. For the most part it's a great company just not for me. I ended up putting allot more into it than I was able to get out of it. You do get to choose your own hours but there is also a deadline to enter sales. On average, each campaign period is about 2 weeks."
good,Most work is thru a temp service. only can work 9 out of 12 moths. Not really any chance to get a per job. the temp service lost my benefits paperwork resulting in a 6 month delay in coverage.
good,Being an Avon representative helped me to be able to reach out to the community and meet new people and build relationships while selling my products and making some extra money.
good,Ótimo pra quem deseja ser autônomo e trabalhar com vendas diretas.
good,"I had a lot of fun working for Avon.  I met some incredible people, and was able to change a couple of lives for the better.By teaching these women how to create a bit of their own income, be there own boss, and build on their own independence."
good,"I loved everything about working at Avon. I didn’t mind the pay because I truly enjoyed what I did. You are really able to take part of the store, out your ideas in. Create the store to your liking, learn how to close the store, greeting customers. This was my favorite job. But the management was awful and that was the reason for leaving."
good,The lady who had signed me up was super nice and very willing to help in any way that I needed. This was a job that I had while I was a stay at home mom
good,"i have enjoyed working for this company because i was working at home selling to the people i know they also teach me to be confident when facing different people ,it was the best also when coming to salary becose iwas getting also my commision ,meaning the more target i make is the more money i get ."
good,working at avon was nice and also enjoy because you meet different people.i learn that you must be calm and also helpful to the people and also you must smile all the time if you working with people.the hard part for the job is when the customers to pay for the product.
good,Avon is a great company once you get higher in the ranks. At first its a slow drag to earn but once you manage to get a customer base it becomes better. Once that stage is over its all about getting other representatives to work under you which brings the problem of area being distributed unevenly.
good,Great place to work. Coworkers were nice. Felt like a family. Spent a great deal of my career here and was able to grow. Learned a lot. Very talented people. The work-life balance was a bit demanding at times but overall a great place to work.
good,"You get to Be Your Own Boss, when I was raising my family I got to pick hours that worked out for us. It was a good income at the time, then I decided to go to school."
good,"Avon is a great company to work and build a career. There is a good workplace culture, great benefits specially for women and typical day at work is not stressful."
good,"With Avon the only way you get an income is on commission, no set salary, it is difficult to find clients in a tough financial situation. The products are of good quality."
good,"job is great it fits around social life and kids, the pay is not too good if you dont sell as it works off commissions other than that overall great job"
good,Avon was an independent work environment where employees set their own hours and schedule.  Cosmetics as well as other products were marketed by Independent Sales Representatives.
good,"É uma empresa boa e competente, e tenho ótimos resultados nas vendas."
good,"Avon is what you make of it! Great products,  enthusiastic co-workers, lots to learn, flexibility a PLUS! I learned a lot about self-motivation, customer's personal needs and lifestyles. I worked hard to accommodate the needs of each unique client and build a good rapport with each and every one. I enjoyed introducing them to new products and enticing them to buy by purchasing large amounts of sample sizes which I distributed."
good,Trabajas por libre lo que te permite llevar tu propio ritmo siempre que a final de mes cumplas los minimos requeridos
good,Great people. Great array of products and a huge global company. The only down side is the domestic business model of being a door to door saleswoman. Not sustainable in NA.
good,"Good but not amazing, working for Avon is very much a self-employed job, and gives you independence as you build up your own customer base and then deliver and collect catalogs regularly. "
good,"I would not want to review since this company dies not even exist anymore, they do exist but they are not hiring anymore and laid off most of their employees"
good,Uma ótima empresa nela aprendi muitas coisas q não sabia fiz otimas amizades  e gostei muito de ter trabalhado nela
good,"Delivering Avon's magazines to different houses in various regional areas"
good,"If you can manage to round up clients who aren't already some other persons its great. They say to invite friends and family, but if they don't order from you it's pointless, then you get no income. You have to figure out your state and local laws allow regarding outreach marketing, like door to door etc. However, if your very, very outgoing or have children in school its more likely you can market to them. Avon does give you the capability of fundraisers to help with this, its supposed to be a step by step plan, I haven't tried it yet but my son will be starting school so perhaps when he does I can. It is fun, being a beauty consultant, buying soaps, make up, perfume, accessories, they even have beautiful jewelry, but its hard to convince people when target is only 20 miles away."

good,Always learning about new products. New products coming out all the time. So far have enjoyed the products that have come out. My family also enjoys them.
good,It was a nice experience in a happy environment like this. People are well- disciplined and the management was all organized. I can say that it is beyond everyone's expectation.
good,"If you have good clients then there is alot of money to be made."
good,It's alright but the paying is not all that well and the communication is a lacking skill in this work place but you would need to get out of your comfort zone to participate in this job.
good,"boa ligação entre vendedoras e  a empresa,muito atual o método de chegar aos clientes, e disponibilidade dos produtos rapidamente ."
good,I enjoy being able to choose the hours I work and I enjoy meeting people who not only become customers but are good friends too. The hardest part of the job is collecting the books and delivering the orders in bad weather.
good,"I had a good experience working for them at first and meeting new people was nice, but after they made changes to the sale it was harder and harder to make money."
good,Very fast paced working on lines at plant.different lines everyday so it was interesting.management was very helpful .training was quick and explained well
good,Very fast paced working on lines at plant.different lines everyday so it was interesting.management was very helpful .training was quick and explained well
good,"Well, I began in this work because I needed some extra money so, I worked only on weekends (Friday, Saturday and Sunday), I woke up at 8 or 9, had some breakfast, and then I went out of my house to go through the streets, visiting houses to talk with the people trying to selling them some beauty products, I ate a sandwich for lunch and continued with my job until 6 o'clock more or less, then I came back home."
good,Ótima empresa para ganhar um dinheiro extra e aumentar o orçamento.
good,It was nice to help others in dealing with their logistics needs.  Learing to create your own business and figuring a way to schedule deliveries.
good,"Avon Cosmetic s.r.l. è un'azienda che permette il lavoro da casa e favorisce quindi un'opportunità anche per chi non ha molto tempo."
good,"Good work life balance. Money made depends on how much/hard you work. Best for someone just supplementing income. Support system is okay, although I didn't hear from the person who recruited me."
good,I love working here it was a lot of fun but I had to leave due to some complications in my personal life.it was very simple and I loved communicating with my employees.
good,"working in all types of wheather, i learned when you work in genaral you have to communicate with all types of people and you cant be shy. I was managing my own business but i had someone to teach me every thing i needed to know to succed. I didnt have any co workers i only had a mentor but the job wasnt hard at all. The most enjoyable part was selling all the different products."
good,"es buena porque tengo buenas compañeras, llevo años aca y me gusta"
good,Handle customer requests and inquiries of products. Handle all matters regarding any back orders of products customers order. The hardest part of the job was finding the right clientele. the most enjoyable part of the job was the freedom to work when I wanted to.

They are so nice persons and we are still friends although I am in a Great Britan and they are in Romania."
good,Great company  to work on your own and to meet new people. great products and lots of information. sales are normally really easy to make.
good,"The only thing I don't care for are the limitations on the salespeople when advertising.  Avon advertises everywhere and can get sales (which competes with the salespeople, of course)."

good,"Se da un trato ejemplar, ofreciendo ayuda en todo momento por parte de la dirección."
good,"There's not really such a thing as a 'typical day' at Avon - that's why it's a great company to work for. "
good,"Good company for extra part time income. You own your own business. A typical day with Avon is the pleasure of meeting new people and distributing current brochures. Meeting with my customers on certain days to collect orders and payments. "
good,"Fun working experience, however, any money I earn goes towards catalogs and sales tools. It's a good way to meet new customers, but I have left hundreds of catalogs and goodies on people's mailboxes, and no response. It's a lot of work, and if you only have a customer base of less than 25 people, I say it's not worth it because you will be spending a lot more than you make."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job with Avon was giving an opportunity to recruit and train Avon Independent Representatives to earn additional income to achieve their dreams
good,"A empresa me deu todas as oportunidades de crescer, aprender e me desenvolver profissionalmente."
good,"Oportuniza crescimento, mas com muitas mudancas de gestao e isso prejudica o trabalho."
good,Uma empresa onde eu pude aprender e desenvolver bastante; Tive a oportunidades de conhecer e trocar experiencias com outras pessoas; Comprometida com seus funcionários.
good,"i enjoy my  work experienced from avon, though its just 1 year in service and small salary i still my work, which is important!"
good,Fun working for yourself. Travelling is also a plus if you're that type of person. Engaging and following up with customers is required but becomes easier to introduce yourself to new ones.

good,"I helped put the orders in the bag and deliver to customers my part of the job is to put the orders onto the computer to send off and to match the products to the correct order form, and then sometimes. It was nice to work alongside my parents but at times it put unwanted stress on us."
good,"Lot of hard work is required, specially with the distributors who are just a house wife."
good,"Everyday I try to learn a new way to organize where quality and efficiency collide. I embrace each client with an open mind, which makes the work rewarding and enjoyable. With having to work fulltime along with Avon, I test new ideas for managing both workloads while increasing quantity and maximizing time.

good,I enjoyed helping customers and keeping the store stocked. I met lots of interesting people and sold great products.
good,"Working for a company that empowers women and puts mascara on lashes and food on tables that fights wrinkles with one hand and Breast Cancer with the other. That knows the value of a perfect lip, but still opens its mouth and speaks out against Domestic Violence and for women's financial independence. This is the company that not only brings beauty to doors, but also opens them.  It is wonderful working for a company that for over 125 years has stood for beauty, innovation, optimism and above all for women."
good,Comunicar- se com as revendedoras todos os dias para conseguir manter a ativas para conquistar a meta de cada campanha e abordar pessoa para conhecer a empresa e entrar para o grupo. Saber lidar com pessoas totalmente diferentes.

good,"Day begins with stock check of area,"
good,"I liked working for Avon, but at the time I had no transportation to make certain sales so it became hard for me to make money. After while it just wasn't working out for me, so I found a new job. I am actually considering working for them again now that I have transportation and can actually get around to a lot more places then just my home area."

They are the #1 corporate sponsor to end domestic violence and the cure for breast cancer.  The culture is very ""nice"" and is build off or relationship building."
good,"This involved giving out brochures, collecting orders, processing orders and then delivering products to customers."
good,The licensed beauty center is open reasonable hours each day. Staff is required to dress business causal and has multiple responsibilities. Biggest priority is acknowledging each customer and assisting them. The goal is to build a relationship with each shopper so they will return to the store. This is also the most difficult part because you need to make each sale and be knowledgeable in all products which include skin care for all age types. If you are not able to answer a question about the product the sale is easily lost and the customer will find a representative instead of shopping through the store. Staff also has to check in shipments weekly and document each item. The most enjoyable part of the job is the management and co-workers. It’s a small staff and is very laid back.
good,Be your own boss set your own hours. Works with alot a good charities.

good,"A Avon no geral é uma ótima empresa para se trabalhar. Você aprende muito no escritório Regional e desenvolve seu lado estratégico. Há possibilidade de ter um plano de carreira, e crescer dentro da compania. Enfrentamos diversos desafios, mas o saldo no final do dia é sempre positivo. O contato com outros países da América Latina faz com que a gente aprenda ainda mais sobre os hábitos de consumo de cada um deles, e assim deixe nossas análises sobre o plano de inovação cada vez mais rica."
good,"Really enjoyed seling Avon to my customers, learning how to work as being my on boss, understanding and learing the process of self management. The hardest part of the job was collecting payment from each customer; being they all had different paydays."
good,Although I enjoyed being an Avon representative it isn't a stable job and that is what I aim for. I learned to be more punctual and worked individually. The income was not fixed and really it was just a job to earn a bit of money.
good,o trabalho é agradável de fazer mais exige muito desgaste emocional devido à quantidade de revendedoras que temos.
good,"Um lugar que propicia ambiente agradável para seu trabalhador, ensinando a convivência em equipe, relacionamento interpessoal."
good,"Working for Avon allowed me to meet with new people and practice and approve my selling techniques. I worked as an Independent Sales Rep so I didn't have to answer to anyone but I was in constant contact with the District Representative who was a very nice, well informed lady. She was also very encouraging and motivational. Every month a meeting was held and prizes given away as an incentive. The company was always updating their brochures with new products added contantly."
good,"An ordinary day would be for me I can work from anywhere I am. I can work from home, school, grocery store, even at my local park. I have learned an exceptional level of customer service and sales association. I worked partially alone and only have spoken to the Owner of the Avon company when I needed more supplies. But what I did not like was that it was only over the internet and short phone calls. The hardest yet most enjoyable part of the job is competition. I love a challenge but sometimes it is hard to get a group of people to buy from you when there is other resources that is selling the same product as you for a cheaper price or better value. I gradually use my salesman skills to string along customers with a great personality, a bright smile, and a positive attitude."
good,"Não havia um dia tipico de trabalho, cada dia era unico. Foi uma experiencia nova, um universo à parte de qualquer seguimento já visto."
good,"a empresa avon e uma empresa muito boa ,gostei muito de trabalha nela mim dou muito bem com meus colegas de trabalho ,e com minha gerente de setor mas estou saindo porque eu nao ganho salario e sim comisao e tem mes que e pouco de mas ."
good,My internship at Avon was very informative being located at a large scale manufacturing center.
good,As an intern it was very beneficial being located in a large scale manufacturing operation.
good,"Comission based position, had to have an order every month. If you didn't have an order two months running then account is closed. Pressure to deliver despite busy schedule. The most enjoyable part is sending of your orders, choosing the products selected. Not many co-workers as this is a work from home position. The hardest part of the job was getting enough orders in order to get your commission."
good,"Aprendi á lidar com pessoas ser comunicativa e agradável , foi uma boa experiência"
good,"I've learned a lot about the products. This is the type of job if you don't put effort in then you don't get paid, so that motivates me to try harder to sell the products."
good,"As a Unit leader there is always something to do for the business leaving you very little personal time. You are always building your business so you are always recruiting plus running your own business plus watching over the businesses of those under you to make sure everyone's money is right and they are ordering and growing their businesses. You have to hold meetings either by teleconference or in person periodically to see where everyone is and how to help them get on and stay on track. Your orders go in every two weeks on Thursdays at 1:00 and I help with everything from familiarization with the software to tips on how to increase sales. Saturday the orders come in and it's shipping and receiving, invoicing and exchanging, returns and delivery. In between there are flea markets to participate in and various other ways of marketing our product and that is up to the individual rep and how she chooses to run her business."
good,Empresa com ótimos relacionamentos interpessoais e excelente divisão de tarefas.
good,Learn how to be your own boss and meet new people everyday! Public speaking skills are enhanced incredibly!
good,Avon itself wasn't too bad to work for. The rep.that got me started selling Avon drove me crazy !! She called all the time & wanted to hang out...I don't think so. Most of the customers didn't want to pay once their items came in. So I had to stop selling it. I was loosing money.
good,A empresa da oportunidades para muitos pé de frango líderes e supervisor incompetentes siscam siscam e não saem do lugar só atrasam a produção  não sabem lidar com pessoas vivem sercados por panelinhas e ajudando o amigo do amigo do meu pai .
good,"Uma empresa com uma boa ética e uma liderança focada na qualidade, mas quem for trabalhar nessa empresa tem que se preparar para muitas horas de trabalho porque tem muitas horas extras diárias, quem entra por exemplo no turno B (14:40) e pegar duas horas extras irá sair depois das 3 da manha,  empresa boa de se trabalhar mas tem que se preparar porque a sua rotina irá mudar."
good,"Online training as well as personal training, meetings. Door-to-Door sales.  It was fun and exciting, however, it was also frustrating how many popular items were discontinued."
good,Uma ótima empresa pra se trabalhar  um lugar onde eu aprendi muitas coisas e costumo dizer a melhor empresa que já trabalhei nos últimos anos e reforçando eu a  recomendo pra qualquer um. Que tenha interesse em trabalhar  numa empresa séria como a Avon

good,"i was working from home "
good,Si proporcionan capacitaciones pero no siempre eran en horarios conveninetes. Lo mejor de Avon es que puedes ganar y trabajar en los horarios que mejor se necesiten.
good,"I worked for Avon for over 11 years.  The brochure drives all the sales. When I was selling, your commission was based off your sales. The more you sell, the more you earn- not sure if that is still the way.  There were benefits to higher selling- not just higher commissions, but awards and prizes. "
good,Empresa com muitas oportunidades de aprendizado e cheia de desafios.
good,"The Avon Foundation its nonprofit organization dedicated to increasing awareness and providing support for victims of breast cancer and domestic violence is special. They have helped my family and countless women worldwide."
good,Being self employed with AVON is pretty great.  I have the opportunity to work the hours that I want. It can be stressful if you don't get the sales sometimes.
good,Um tipico de trabalho vendas.                                                                ser responsavel com a minha venda e com meus objetivos.

good,"Independent Sales means what it sounds like, selling by yourself. Avon simply gives you access to products and some tools that can help you succeed but you have to assemble your own clientele, develop your own sales skills and style. You have to have the ability to basically run your own business rather than be an employee. Avon does provide great opportunity to develop skills that can apply to many areas of life. You are responsible for your own advancement which makes your income possibilities endless."
good,"Puedes dedicarle todas las horas que desees,hay oportunidad de crecer laboralmente haciendo incripsciones y manejando un grupo de gente por lo cual se te hace un pago...."
good,Grupo de trabajo muy bueno a pesar de mi corta estadía
good,"Meu nome é trabalho, esse deve ser seu lema na Avon."
good,"Bom de se trabalhar fora do mercado formal. Empresa já é conhecida, os produtos também"
good,"Trabalhar em uma empresa que respeita todos os funcionários é muito gratificante, principalmente quando o ambiente de trabalho é agradável isso facilita a qualidade e a produtividade."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was attending meetings , making new friends while earning money. Also having the option to work the hours you wanted to work."
good,"Empresa agradável para trabalhar,mas como toda empresa tem seus pontos negativos."
good,My time at Avon was pretty good. almost every day I sold product around my neighborhood at the time. I was an interesting job to work as it allowed some independence
good,a empresa é boa de se trablhar tem respeito com seus colaboradores seja ela po raça religião etc. um bom ambiente profissional.
good,"Independant contractors work here , along with district managers.  Sell Avon products to indivduals and network for new representatives.  Online ordering available."
good,I liked working there the people are nice the job was nice it was a continuous work force. Managed the people there with respect. Long as you worked you had no problems.
good,"Working for Avon was very ideal as I am a young mum and was able to work around a young child whilst a representative. Also it gave a great opportunity to meet new people and in the job I learnt new skills, such as advertising and stock taking. The hardest part of the job was meeting the minimum order value with every campaign as people weren't always ordering in every campaign, that was a challenge that I quite enjoyed. The thing I most enjoyed about working for Avon were the products, as I would order products out of a ""First Look"" catalogue (which was a book that showed new products/offers that would be in future catalogues) and I was able to demo the products before they were launched to gain sales."
good,"My opinion of avon is that its a nice job but its more like a ""on the side"" type job or a hobby really."
good,"I loved the high touch culture ... but this has changed ...."
good,Eres tu propia jefa y marcas tus horarios. No tienes un salario fijo y los beneficios son muy bajos. Hay que vender mucho para ganar muy poco.
good,"The best part of working with avon is meeting all the new people. A typical day is getting your name out there as a sales representative. You learn how to up sale your merchandise, the pros and cons of a product. The hardest part is having to find the right time to drop off your customers merchandise. In order for you to be a really great Avon representative, you need your own transportation and your own laptop is also a great help"
good,"A empresa tem boa cultura, definada de trabalho, lugar agradavel para se trabalhar, fui bem valorizado la enquanto trabalhei por dois anos e seis meses, sem faltas e nem atestados."
good,"From what I had been told and felt, the workload for me specifically was much greater than my other teammates due to my knowledge and capabilities. Overall, I still enjoyed it there and didn't mind the work load because I enjoy staying busy."
good,A Muchas mujeres/hombres le llamaba la atención estos productos me fue muy bien los precios eras buenos y los pedidos llegaban con puntualidad muchos estaban contentos pero las ganancias no eran favorables pasaba mucho tiempo en ello y mis ganancias eran pocas aún cuando el pedido aumentaba.
good,Working with Avon is easy. You meet with clients. Receive their orders and purchase and deliver the quality products.Meet new people daily and sell quality products with out much effort.
good,"Uma empresa boa de trabalhar,com oportunidade de cargo.refeição boa."
good,Learned a lot at Avon.  Management changes too often.  Company direction changes too often and the company is in a state of ambiguity.  A lot of talent has come and gone.
good,"Quality/accuracy of work"

good,A great company to work for. many sales incentives. A good company as the work is part time so it's nice to have flexi hours in a day. The most enjoyable part of the job included meeting new people when making sales.
good,"- Muchas personas dispuestas a aprender y compartir sus conocimientos"
good,"this is a funny workplace, and porductive job. because you can express and explore your skills upon sales and recruiting. and you been have a lot of friends in this company."
good,"No dia a dia da empresa o movimento da operação dá o tom. A fábrica com tecnologia de ponta permite que parte dos processos de separação dos produtos sejam automatizados. Com isso agiliza a produção e facilita o alcance de metas. Lá, aprendi a trabalhar mais em equipe e a ter versatilidade em operar em diferentes setores da empresa onde havia necessidade de mão de obra. A gerência está sempre a procura de manter programas e treinamentos que incentivam, estimulam e aumentam a interação e a produtividade entre os colaboradores de diferentes áreas. A questão mais difícil pra mim no dia a dia era ficar o dia todo em pé precisando passar pela empresa inteira para desenvolver o trabalho. O mais legal era o ambiente externo onde há uma área verde extensa com um projeto de paisagismo muito bonito e a loja para os funcionários que mantém um desconto de 30% e 15% para os vários produtos da marca."
good,"I've worked as an Avon Representative for about 4 years. I started while I was in 6th from, continued through University and I am still working as one now. My job generally has a 3 week turn around. I send in all my orders on Wednesday, receive my products the following Tuesday. I then deliver the products and the next book to my customers and give them a week with the book before collecting it. I must also collect the money and pay Avon for the products. Commission varies depending how much is spent for each campaign. It is a very flexible. There are opportunities to expand your business if you choose. The more time you put in the more you  get out of it."
good,"Fun to work as your own boss and choose your own hours - however, success depends on how hard you work and whether you go the extra mile or not to satisfy the needs of your customers."
good,"Απιστευτο προσωπικο και εξυπηρετηση καλος μισθοςκαι ασφαληση "
good,Being an Avon sales representative was great position to have. It allowed me to become my own boss for my first time. Support from my family has made my life a lot easier to cope with when order taking became too tough to handle.
good,"aprendi a ter responsabilidade,liderança com a ajuda da gerente me tornei uma das melhores executiva do setor."
good,"É uma empresa q fornece facilidade de vendas , eu conheço várias pessoas q revendem e vende os produtos da Avon , são produtos ótimos principalmente os de maquiagem , perfumes entre outros ."
good,"Exige muita atenção,fácil de lhe dar,temos que saber conversa com os Clientes,mais gostei de trabalhar como Revendedora"
good,"I loved working for Avon, but honestly not too many people are interested in Avon as they use to be. Products are Amazing and good quality. I would only recommend working for Avon if you're looking to make a little extra money not a huge amount of money."
good,This work is exciting because you are dealing with costumers who have different attitudes surely your patience will be tested.
good,"Avon est une compagnie dont les relations sont axées sur le respect et la confiance."
good,"I work home,it was a part time job."
good,"The hours are flexible being an independent Avon representative. I learned more about myself, and my customer service skills. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know my local neighbors and community whilst delivering orders and searching for new clients."
good,"Liked my time, was very enjoyable although I wish we as ambassadors would get more benefits as it is quite hard to build a customer base with so much competition from other ambassadors."
good,"Je fais mon propre horaire, je trouve ma clientèle, je rentre les commandes, je fais valoir les produits."
good,Avon is a great place to work.  Employees have been willing to do what has been asked of them above and beyond.  Company is moving in the right direction.
good,Easily marketed.very good products i use in my everyday life. Also very affordable. as a Representative you are given various opportunities to develop in areas you desire.
good,"I showed clients beauty products catalogs, samples, and having lots of fun showing them two. I learned how to communicate and interact with different types of people. The hardest part of this job is setting boundaries for myself like for example, when to say ""yes"" and when to say ""no""."
good,me gusto la experiencia sin embargo considero que son muchas horas de trabajo
good,"Uma empresa  em que eu aprendi muito , trabalho corrido porém animado ,gerência sempre motivando com palestras ,reuniões ,as pessoas que trabalhavam comigo motivadas, além de ser uma equipe muito grande as vezes um não concordava com o outro mais ficava tudo bem . O foco era fazer bem o trabalho rápido porque era meta por hora porém com qualidade ,não teve trabalho difícil se toda a equipe trabalhasse todos juntos fluíamos muito bem . Uma empresa que trabalha muitas mulheres vaidosas ,que vende beleza,era muito bom todas animadas com um propósito de fazer o seu trabalho bem ."
good,"I have learned to be able to go online and order the customers products that they have ordered I also deliver them personally to their doors, I have gotten more confident, with money and myself. "
good,The experience of building my own business has been a great move for me.  I have built my own sales team and now have my business to support it.
good,"All'arrivo del catalogo iniziavo il giro delle mie clienti fisse che guardavano il libretto e ordinavano i prodotti che desideravano."
good,This is great way to get out and make some extra money.  You work the business as much or as little as you want.  I like it as its extra money for me for Christmas or Vacations with my son.
good,"I was a sales representative with my mother while still in junior high, making income for myself and learning valuable skills through the Avon experience. I enjoyed getting to use my outgoing personality to introduce new customers to the brand, and getting sample beauty products. The hardest part of the job was delivering the purchases as I live in a rural area."
good,"O setor de Marketing na Avon é considerado o coração da empresa é a partir dele que se inicia o processo de criação e desenvolvimento dos produtos que são lançados no folheto Moda&Casa, a rotina de trabalho é bem dinâmica a cada prazo é estipulado propostas de novos produtos e com a interação de toda equipe e assim e constatado resultado no mercado, a gerencia é a base principal durante todo o ciclo e harmonia dos processos e relacionamento interpessoal no ambiente do departamento, durante a minha passagem na empresa adquiri aprendizado de grande valor profissional com as gerentes de categoria não somente o operacional mas principalmente visão mercadológica em marketing, como funciona novas propostas de venda e como ter percepção de publico alvo para atingir as metas da empresa."
good,"Dentro desta empresa, comecei a engatinhar rumo ao sucesso profissional. Apesar de requerer muito tempo ao funcionário com constantes horas extras e viagens a trabalho, tem ótimos benefícios e sabe entender a necessidade do colaborador."
good,"administration systèmes sous Active Directory pour gérer les comptes, groupes, permissions de dossiers partagés,"
good,"Utilizo este trabalho como um hobbie e uma forma de fazer algum dinheiro sem grandes compromissos, apenas entregando os catálogos e recolhendo as encomendas."
good,it was good working within the Avon company as i had a child and i could work it around her as she only went pre school at the time but i found it had its upside as well as its down sides which were things like i didn't really earn anything as i did not have very many customers.
good,"La empresa siempre ha sido puntual en traerme los productos hasta mi domicilio, ha sido también exigente con mi labor de consultora y he aprendido mas sobre la interacción con el cliente."
good,"L'avon è un'azienda in cui si vendono prodotti di ogni tipo, da casa, la parte più difficile è trovare clienti che comprino i prodotti e riuscire a inviare l'ordine entro la scadenza prevista."
good,"It's very hard to get started with this company, since you are running your own business. I don't find that to be a bad thing, and in the end, I did not come out as successful as I had hoped. But still being a high school student while looking for a full-time/part-time job AND trying to keep up with a business was just weighing on me too much. And I was spending money that I didn't have. "
good,"Não tenho muita coisa à declarar."
good,"empresa facil de trabalhar, porem há gerentes muito indisciplinadas, deixando clientes sem seus produtos o que me fazia perder meu próprios clientes pelas suas incompetencias"
good,es una empresa comprometida con elaborar productos de calidad y a un precio accesible para la mayoria de la sociedad... se preocupa por sus vendedores en general ganas lo que quieres
good,I logged in and started to process the e-mails and receiving the incoming calls from UK and South Africa. There were 6 people in the team. All of the were polish except me. They were nice persons.
good,"Sendo uma das maiores empresas no ramo de cosméticos, ela deveria saber mais valorizar o seu funcionário. o salário não é digno com o tipo de trabalho que os separadores fazem, por isso com todo esse nome que a Avon tem. deveriam sim serem mais dignos com seus próprios colaboradores."
good,"Mi trabajo era Supervisor de Ventas en el cual realizaba la coordinación del equipo de vendedoras Concretaba reuniones de grupo.Les realizaba  Capacitación permanente, orientado a resultados"

good,"I have been a representative on and off for the last 10 years, during this time I have built up a small customer base, and have learned a lot about Avon products. my general duties are ensuring customers get a brochure and collecting there orders in on time, as an independent representative you are working on your own however if you need any help, your sales leader or area manager are always to hand. the hardest part of the job is finding and keeping customers, especially as so many people order on line now, the most enjoyable part of the job is the freebies."
good,"The typical work day always started out with a pre meeting in which they would give assignments. "
good,Es un trabajo complicado y tienes que dar siempre el 100% de tí misma si quieres obtener algún beneficio.
good,"fun environment despite it being the corporate office. You really need to stay on your managers to help your career advancement, but in the current state of the business, even that's difficult to come by"
good,"O trabalho em campo é muito gratificante, adquiri vasta experiência em campo, com gestão de pessoas, viabilizando ainda mais minha grande capacidade de comunicação, o que também ocasionou certa discriminação, pois trouxe excelentes resultados em pouco tempo. O qual não tive um líder compatível para lidar com a questão e  para o crescimento do setor, faltando  interesse e diálogo para estruturar um plano de ação de médio prazo, não viabilizando  assim muitos produtos para a região. O índice de falta de produto era imenso."

good,"As far as the people went they were great people. The management was disorganized and just horrible, they never knew what was going on on the floor. Very un-involved."
good,"Avon allowed me to focus on my school while still earning money on the side. It is all done on my own time, and there are no consequences should I choose to take some days off. It let me branch out and learn how to interact with other people, something I was really shy about doing before. The pay wasn't to good because it was all commission, so if I was having a busy week with school and did not have any time to sit down and focus on Avon, I didn't make any money. "
good,"Era otimo conhecia varia pessoas , havia sempre um incetivo e isso fazia  com que nós nos dedicavamos mais , alem de fica atenaticimas na moda."

good,"Repetitivo y un poco variable, el aprendizaje fue conocimiento de materias primas y seguridad e higiene. La dirección con nosotros fue cordial. Mis colegas un paso mas adelante que yo. La parte mas difícil del trabajo era interactuar con mis colegas ya que trabajábamos en distintas estaciones y la comunicación era compleja. Lo que mas me gusto es aprender a utilizar tantas maquinarias y materiales posibles."

good,Neste trabalho melhorei a minha capacidade de comercial porém não acho justo o método de pagamento.
good,Working at Avon provides the opportunity to test your time management skills as year over year it is transforming into a VERY lean organization.  Execution of tasks and projects in due time is challenged by technical limitations as the company does not invest in improving the technological platform.
good,Office is no longer open for business in Georgia. While it was open Avon was a great company to work for with excellent retirement benefits and a strong commitment to employees.
good,"Ti permette di imparare a gestire al meglio il tempo, poiché è tua responsabilità gestire gli ordine e le richieste dei clienti in modo tale da soddisfare i bisogni nel minor tempo possibile. "
good,Buena. Posibilidad de formacion como empresarioo. Disponibilidad de horarios.
good,"Made lasting relationships from my time at Avon. Worked within Global Creative and under Marketing learned new processes for print, digital, and post-production. Great career building exposure and collaborative experience."
good,"Приобрела такие качества как : коммуникабельность."
good,"Como é um trabalho feito a partir de casa considero-o bastante fácil de gerir, comodo e prático."
good,"Buon ambiente di lavoro"
good,"Avon é uma empresa muito boa para quem não pode trabalhar em tempo integral e precisa ter um tempo a mais livre e ter jogo de cintura para vender seus produtos aos clientes, pena que não assina carteira e nem tem salario fixo para suas revendedoras ."
good,"There are many perks with being your own boss.  Avon allows this for any individual looking to add extra income into their lifestyle.  The more you put into your business, the more benefits you will reap."
good,The salary is strictly commission based. You have to sell at least $50 worth of products to make any commission. Anything less will not get you any form of income. What you put into it is what you will get out of it. I only did this on the side to make a little extra money but I feel there are things that could be improved. I feel employees should make at least 30-35% profit from anything that is bought or sold from them.
good,"this was my first job and i liked it because you work on your own time and sell to whoever you want, it wasn't stressful and it helps you not be so shy."
good,"I've been an Independent Sales Representative for many years.  A typical day would include catalog and e-sales, order processing and delivery, maintain customer contacts, recruit and train new independent representatives to own their own businesses. The most enjoyable parts of the job are seeing how happy the products make my customers, and training new representatives to build and grow their business."
good,A empresa oferece plano de crescimento e salários compatíveis com a função. Exerci o cargo de forma temporária cobrindo licença saúde de uma funcionária. Durante 9 meses pude perceber a grandeza daquela e o impacto que sua atividade exerce no Brasil.
good,"I enjoyed selling Avon.  Avon had alot of nice products to sell but it was hard to sell at the time I was an Avon representative due to economy, alot of people were not interested."
good,"Got helped pretty quick for any questions you had, it's a good job regardless of you having experience or not, you can work solo or build a team which I thought was cool. Being able to advertise online was great even though I'm not that social of a person and the management is pretty good here. The hardest part I think was getting people to buy from you that don't already have a sales rep and if you want to advertise anywhere other than online, you have to pay for that yourself. I would work here if you want a pt job and need extra money to save up for later."
good,"interactuo con personas diferentes día a día, tengo mi propio horario que por el momento me conviene ya que estudio y no se mucho conllevar horarios de estudio con los laborales, lo que no me gusta mucho de este trabajo son las ganancias que no son mucho y no me alcanza para pagar gastos"
good,"Ótima empresa para se trabalhar em relação a outras por qual passei ,portanto não vejo oportunidade de atuar como engenheiro elétrico nesta empresa; que e meu objetivo."
good,"Ótima empresa para se trabalhar em relação a outras por qual passei ,portanto não vejo oportunidade de atuar como engenheiro elétrico nesta empresa; que e meu objetivo."
good,I liked making my own money but I was not  getting paid as much and the higher representatives were pretty nice and it was very cool to learn how to run your own business from home .
good,"Handing out brochures twice a month. Collecting orders in person, on telephone, online avon estore, bagging orders and collecting payment up front and delivering their orders and collecting orders for next campaign."
good,Avon is great because you can work as much as you can handle. It was very easy for me to sell what I use in my own home. Avon allows you to know your customer base.  You can serve your costumers better if you get to know their needs.
good,"Most enjoyable part of job is the lovely ladies I get to meet and chat with who buy from me,getting to know what they like etc"
good,"Uma empresa dinâmica, presta bastante serviço a suas vendedoras."
good,Ótima empresa pra se trabalhar . Ótima estrutura .
good,"Un trabajo inestable, sin posibilidad de surgir, constante problemas con los productos y desagradable ambiente"
good,"BNTelekom ve Kibarlı Pazarlama birbirinden çok farklıydı. 11880'de çalışmak bana gerçekten çok büyük tecrübeler kattı. Mental olarak çok yorulunsa da insanlarla ilgilenmeyi, sabırlı olmayı, sinirlenmemeyi, dilimi kontrol edebilmeyi öğretti.İnsanlarla sağlıklı bir iletişimin yollarını gerek bizlere verilen eğitimle gerekse kendi kendime öğrendim. Günde 600'e yakın farklı müşteri ile telefonda görüşmek gerçekten zor bir görev. Kibarlı Pazarlama'dan ise daha az eğlenceli ve stresliydi. Çünkü satış yapmak insanlara herhangi bir konuda telefonda dahi olsa yardım etmekten çok daha zor. Ama bunu çok kısa zamanda öğrenebilmiştim. Nasıl konuşulması gerektiğini, nasıl iletişim kurulması gerektiğini vs. Genel olarak liseden mezun olduktan sonra uzun veya kısa vadeli çalışmış olduğum her bir işyerinde olumlu olumsuz tabiiki doğal olarak bir çok olay yaşadım. Fakat tüm bu olayların hepsinin ilerideki iş hayatımı olumlu olarak inşaa edeceğinden eminim. İş ahlakı nedir, hiyerarşi nedir yapılması veya yapılmaması gereken davranışlar nelerdir bütün bunlara aşinayım. Özetle çalışma hayatımdan dolayı kendimi şanslı hissediyorum."
good,"Perfecta, buen compañerismo de trabajo , muy satisfactorio"
good,"Empresa socialmenta comprometida con la mujer y con la sociedad."
good,El trabajo de vendedor es reconfortante por la flexibilidad en la que uno puede desenvolverse en él.
good,Quero uma oportunidade de crescimento e adquirir mas conhecimentos.
good,Loved working for my DM. I loved meeting and talking to new people. I worked part time so there were no benefits. I loved the Avon merchandise. It was always a lot of fun attending luncheons.
good,"Empresa oferecia benefícios satisfatórios, onde estimulava o fator Motivacional de seus colaboradores, porém não tinha um grupo de Superiores que estimulasse de maneira satisfatória sua equipe, exercia sua liderança de forma autoritária não permitindo comunicação entre Subordinado e Superior."
good,Facilidades de poder trabajar y estudiar sin afectar mis horarios
good,There is never  typical day while working with Avon because every day is different. The thing about avon is you can basically go to work when ever and where ever so everyday is an adventure. The best part is comin incontact with different people. While working at this business i learned a little bit about marketing and how to run your own business
good,los horarios son flexibles y permiten organizar el tempo personal de tal manera que permita cumplir con las labores pero tambien con el tiempo de uno mismo
good,La autonomía es lo que mas satisfactorio encontré del trabajo como revendedora Avon.
good,"Avon is good for someone who needs to stay at home and work. You can make your own hours and how many days you want to work in a week. I chose to work everyday except Sunday. And, I worked about 6-7 hrs a day. I was in Leadership so alot of my time was on the phone and computer helping others."
good,It is beneficial for someone who enjoys sales. The only reason I stopped doing it was because I was constantly receiving extra packages that if I did't sell I would have to pay for and shipping as well. This was not being productive to me. They do have great things though.
good,"Trabajar en Avon te da esa flexibilidad que necesitas; las reuniones son divertidas, te animan a vender y promover los productos, tu líder te anima a crecer como ""consejera"" (así nos llamamos las promotoras), etc."
good,"They helped me build up my confidence, in both myself and my ability to achieve my goals! I did build a strong customer base in two towns, and this I know will always be with me. Even though I have decided to leave the company, I will never be able to thank them enough for all that I learnt!! I would go out in all weathers, this surprised many  a customer. Even if I was feeling pretty ill, my customers/friends were very important to me. Word got round how I would go the extra mile, even seeing that they did not go out of pocket when they misunderstood the offers."
good,"I designed gift and decorative item under the tutorship of a senior designer. Management was very open to questions and friendly."
good,Um aspecto positivo em revender produtos via catálogo é a disponibilidade de horário. E também de conhecer novas pessoas.
good,"Aprendí a administrarme mejor, conocí más sobre el campo de las ventas y el trato persona a persona. "
good,"grato lugar de trabajo entodo los aspectos"
good,Avon is a great place to work and supplement your income.  It has been a great experience to work at your own pace at times.  Avon is more than just makeup and cologne.  Clothes and household items are also offered for sale.
good,"Ir atrás de novas revendedoras"
good,"Na empresa Avon aprende a me relacionar melhor com todos, a ter "
good,"Eu aprendi a organizar meu dia a dia e a separar o lado pessoal do profissional, a parte mais agradável pra mim e quando consigo chegar os meus objetivos profissionalmente e a a parte mais difícil é lidar com alguns clientes, mas sempre consigo reverter a situação e agrada-lo."
good,with avon your income is based upon commission alone and it can be greatly beneficial financially and very fun but it takes more work than hourly jobs
good,i enjoyed working for Avon as i got to meet loads of new people the hours fit around my day to day life the only complaint that i have about Avon is its hard to build your customer base to start making money.
good,"- A great organization to work with"
good,"I enjoy going into the training center and being the first one there. I've had the wonderful opportunity to meet some of Avon's top reps for the three districts that are managed out of the training center I work for. The best part is when I reach out to representatives and they have a conflict, or issue that needs to be resolved. It makes them feel like their concerns are important. Actually providing a solution is what makes it more fulfilling for me at the end of the day."
good,vi era un buonissimo ambiente lavorativo dove le persone erano tutte gentili e serie e avevano molta passione per questo piccolo lavoro
good,"Opportunities to work with leadership and help them be successful. Loved being in the field working one on one, introductions of new products, building an awesome district/team."
good,"people I worked with was great, I came to do the job, but stayed because of the great people and culture. Very relaxed, but depending on the department."
good,Empresa de medio porte com excelentes funcionarios facilitando um trabalho tranquilo e sem problemas fazendo que o ambiente fique em harmonia
good,"You leave early, prospect and join new representatives to sell Avon. Long hours, driving a lot, paperwork  and planning on arriving home. Work out of a home office. With a phone and tablet provided a lot of office work can be done in the field working in your car or at a fast food place with free internet access."
good,"during my time at avon I collect orders for my customers and place them online on the correct date,. Avon is a good thing to do to help gain confidence,"
good,"I have learned to approach the work , though I do not even know what I should do. And I also learned how to make friends with those my work."
good,"Avon is a great place to work, if you like change.  They are always making changes.  Which I do not mind, the place is never boring. "
good,"- Dia típico de trabalho: Contato com os clientes."
good,"Avon é um pouco corrido. Aprendi que trabalhar com pessoas é complicado mais é bom. fiz muitas amizades como Revendedora. A responsável pelo meu setor era uma pessoa maravilhosa.Meus colegas era admiráveis. A parte mais difícil é que eu caminhava muito. E em fim,Avon é uma ótima empresa. Adorei trabalhar com pessoas."
good,"I learned to have more confidence in my self"
good,Is a good place to invest if you have the all the money. I was not always available with the amount of money you need for the investment to sell the products.
good,Gostava de trabalhar todos os dias da semana. Aprendi a me comunicar melhor com as pessoas. A direção da empresa sempre estava disposta a ajudar sempre que eu precisava. Os meus colegas sempre foram amigáveis e presentes. A parte mais difícil era quando faltava algum produto na caixa. A parte mais agradável era estar junto com as minhas clientes e o bom desempenho nas vendas a cada campanha.
good,"Uma empresa multinacional onde está passando por muitas mudanças principalmente no nível de diretoria e gerência( em um ano   passaram 3 gerentes). Fora essa questão uma excelente empresa onde valoriza o ser humano e cumpri todas as exigências legais. Aprende muito pois foram 15 anos passando por diversas áreas e setores, mudando de cidade e a empresa nesse período ofereceu vários cursos de aperfeiçoamento."
good,"Ótima empresa, com um bom horário entre turnos, salário razoável, bons benefícios, infelizmente meu trabalho foi temporário pois a agência pela qual me contratou saiu da empresa e tive que sair junto, o dia de trabalho é bem puxado, mas a empresa passa bem sua cultura e sua visão, porém algumas áreas não são bem gerenciadas, falta um pouco de visão, ótimo relacionamento entre operadores, o serviço é bem pesado, porém a união faz a força e todos se ajudam isso é muito bom."
good,"melhor vida"
good,"Always something new to look forward to. A new challenge everyday."
good,"Nesta empresa tive a possibilidade de crescer profissionalmente,empresa lider de mercado."
good,"My job requires me meeting new customers, serving regular customers, delivering books and products, putting in orders on line, making adjustments on orders as needed, paying for product in a timely manner, managing a website, blogs, etc.  I especially enjoy talking and visiting with my customers.  Most of them have become my friends over time. I take training courses on line and manage a team and lead them in sales and leadership."
good,"I loved selling Avon products. Meeting new people, customers and other Avon Reps, was very rewarding. We had monthly meeting so we could all share ideas and keep morale high. The hardest part of the job was finding new customers. But, you just had to keep your business on your mind at all times and promote it every time you met a new person. So it wasn't bad at all. The most enjoyable part of the job was on delivery days I got to see all my customers. It was so much fun keeping in touch with all of my customers."
good,"Well for the most part Avon has been an awesome company. I have noticed some changes do to them trying to bring the company up again. I worked for Avon more than once and in that time it varied from time to time such as marketing, orders, and products, We also had district offices where we held meetings and borrowed demonstration products to hold sales parties. Our offices have closed do to lack of funds. We still have district managers and so far they have been awesome to work with. They hold rallies in different cities so they never stay in one place. Recruiting is still on the rise which is a good thing. My pet peeve is that on some of the products they have been selling is not the best quality.I've also had customers who are skeptical because of a bad experience with a product. Such as toys, jewelry, and holiday items. We have to work harder at our commissions now because they raised the percentage you have to sell to make a good commission."
good,A empresa muito bom para trabalhar mais as oportunidades não são para todos.
good,"ha tive muita esperiência profissional foi muito bom :) é uma empresa  que te dar muitas oportunidade de conseguir premios,viagens."
good,"I love being an Avon representative as it gets me out and about I can fetch my children along with me, I meet new people everyday and there is always something new to learn. I do work as an individual but like to share my tips and ideas with other Avon representatives. I can work at my at my own pace and around my family."
good,I like Avon because I can do it on my own time and getting the word out is quite easy.
good,"Como é uma empresa autônoma, o único contato que eu tenho é com a supervisora da empresa Avon e com minha mãe, a qual me ajuda nas vendas. No entanto, minha comunicação com ambas é de uma perfeita harmonia, onde checamos todos os pedidos dos produtos, a finança arrecadada e como melhorar as vendas dando às clientes amostras grátis, pois assim, elas irão ver o que mais as interessa, aumentando a compra conforme o desejo da mesma."
good,Avon cosmetics are really well made and the company have a lot of time and effort with their customers. they put passion into their work and are proud of their positive thoughts from customers.
good,"El horario laboral era de 13 a 21 HS, con merienda y cena incluida en el comedor de la fabrica.dos dias en la semana teniamo 15 minutos de gimnasia laboral,es un trabajo donde tenes que estar muy atento y ser rapido para las manualidades ya que las caja, etiquetas y el embasado era todo manual y no podias perder tiempo,en la lineas de produccion se trabajaba en equipo y habia que estar muy atento a lagunas caracteristicas de los distintos productos que estaban en preparacion."
good,"Foi uma experiência muito boa ajudou nomeu crescimento profissional pois entrei no operacional e surgiu uma oportunidade de crescimento onde pude realizar todas rotinas administrativas,aprendir bastante coisa .A dificuldade que encontrava para exercer meu trabalho era as questões climáticas, hora muito frio hora com chuva pois as vistorias no veículo era feita em áreas descobertas."
good,"O trabalho é feito em equipe, um pouco rotineiro focado mais no abastecimento de linhas de separação, o uso do RF é diario e aprendi muito com o WMS, movimentação dos produtos via sistema.   Pessoal comprometido com o trabalho."
good,"To work at Avon is to  live and work in an environment where communications are open - where people feel free to take risks, to share their points of view and to speak the truth as they see it.  It believes in work life balance and was a good place to work in.  Most importantly you are given the opportunity to meet some great people."

good,"it's nice to be an avon representative, because it can work around any other work or school schedule i have."
good,"Revendia produtos de revistas, aprendi bastante nesse tempo como melhorar o meu comportamento perante às exigências dos clientes. Era meio difícil lidar com alguns problemas que aconteciam, como todos sabem, os revendedores estão sujeitos a problemas como a insatisfação dos clientes em relação aos produtos encomendados e algumas vezes o produto não chegava, mas com alumas palavras, conseguia fazer com que o cliente deixasse o nome ali na revista para pedir novamente o produto."
good,The most important things i learnt were how to deal with customers and management.
good,"A typical day would be issuing brochures to family, friends and neighbours and collecting their orders and inputting their orders into the computer. once their items have been delivered I would deliver their items to their door."
good,I enjoy doing it. The only thing about it is that its only commission base so I don't keep it as a full time job on a side job.
good,"Todos os dias tinhamos que entregar as metas estabelecidas. Aprendi muito pois entrei na empresa como Operador II e subi de cargo até ser lider de operação. Sempre tivemos contato com a gerência e sempre deixou aberto para que pudessemos procura-los quando necessario, a parte mais dificil na minha opinião era controlar o absenteísmo pois é algo comportamental e a mais agradavel é sair no final do turno com as metas entregues."
good,"my review of the company is that it is very productive and hard working which i like but most of the time it was a fun workplace to work in and i got on with most of the staff their which is what i like to do i like to make new friends."

good,"Manage time wisely to include training of new sales force, business reviews of established sales representatives, problem solving skills, provide product training."
good,"Ótima empresa, porém na AVON Expressa Guarulhos projeto piloto aonde trabalhei não há plano de carreira para seus funcionários ,ótima gestão na qual tive oportunidade de aprender muito sobre processos administrativos e obtive domínio completo em Excel, um ambiente extremamente agradável para se trabalhar pecando somente na área de promoções de funcionários que procuram crescer profissionalmente."

good,Was a good time working from home with many different clients.
good,"El trabajo es bastante cargado, aunque la mayoría de personas manejan un ambiente de trabajo agradable, y son muchas las actividades que debía realizar y en su mayoría con Urgencia."
good,"It entails a lot of clerical, sales and marketing skills with customer services being key. But basically a lot of variables go into what kind of orders you get, large or small, many or few."

good,"Me gustaba el trabajo tenia tranquilidad, había comprensión"

good,Mi sono trovata bene ma non ho avuto un riscontro positivo nel guadagno 
good,"Uma empresa voltada aos valores Humanos, onde fomos muito valorizados, aprendi muito.. tenho muito saudade"
good,"Los días de trabajo son diferentes unos de otros, el año se divide en 19 campaña de 13 días hábiles aproximadamente cada una.Cada día tiene sus actividades definidas de acuerdo a una regleta administrativa, y los días que quedan sin actividad administrativa (normalmente de 2 a 3) se planifican visitas de campo."

good,"With Avon I was able to make my own hours which made life very easy. I am a student therefore it is a great job to have on the side and carry with me where ever I go. I learned how to be an entrepreneur, a sales associate, a team member and a hard worker. Avon management is a little bit different than regular companies because they are an independent representative type of business. However I felt very supported by my district sales manager, and was always encouraged to keep up the hard work. My co-workers varied depending on their passion for the job. I like working with a team and helping others out, but often it is difficult to work with someone who is not as passionate as you are. The hardest part of working for Avon is that it is a lot of driving in order to deliver orders, set up and go to meetings, and attend seminars, ect. The most enjoyable part of selling Avon is the look on my customers face when I deliver their orders and how easy it is to get excited about working for Avon."
good,A parte mais fácil entrar em contato com pessoas diferentes ver necessidades de produtos diferentes vendê-los de forma a suprir estas necessidades.

good,The good thing about this job is you work on your time. You meet new people. They have great products.
good,"If you have the opportunity, work at Avon. Yes, it seems a little crazy from the outside, but people work hard and are producing great things. The environment is calm and the people are nice. More care about the company than not. Good people. However, very little in terms of growth opps. A lot of lateral moves."
good,Avon was a great choice for me while interning during college. I've continued to sell through working part-time and it is now helping me while I am unemployed.
good,"Na Avon tive ótimos gestores, onde tenho lições de vida ótimas, aprendi que um bom atendimento e fazer tudo com excelencia a melhor recompensa é o reconhecimento de todos."
good,"A empresa oferece ótima remuneração e benefícios. É um trabalho gratificante. Essa companhia me ensinou muito, tanto em vendas, como em relacionamento com pessoas. Porém, nao tive estabilidade depois que ganhei meu filho."
good,ACTIVITE D'APPOINT TRES FUN

good,"Foram 7 anos de aprendizado, trabalhando com responsabilidade e tendo o retorno por parte da empresa. Uma empresa que preza pela qualidade de vida dos seus funcionários e pelo crescimento dentro da mesma. A empresa tem uma política de segurança muito considerada, antes de qualquer processo... Cada vez se modernizando nos processos de trabalho."
good,"Very fun to be apart of this company. No matter how many meetings that get you pumped to sale their products, I wouldn't depend on the income unless you work overtime in taking orders and/or recruiting people."
good,"I've been with a run for 10 years and I really enjoy it. It is a fantastic company to work for. I like the products so much that my wife and I buy many of them. We also have a large, diverse client base, and that helps sustain the business."
good,"E' una azienda dove serve un minimo di gavetta partendo dal basso, con l'attivita' di vendita diretta."
good,I very much enjoyed my time at Avon and would reccomend a friend to seek employment there. I was employed in the warehouse which involved picking packers also loading and unloading trailers and unloading containers.
good,Was throwing different events and party’s for my customers and letting them try products. You could also throw online party’s and do giveaways to your top customers
good,Buen sueldo. Buenos beneficios. Mal desempeño de los delegados
good,"Esta foi uma empresa na qual eu me senti totalmente realizada, principalmente profissionalmente ."
good,"I enjoyed being my own boss. Giving parties for facial and educational seminars. It would have lasted longer if I was able to retain more clientele. Products were good quality but people only like to receive the free samples. Many people would RSVP and then there where NO SHOWS. That was a bit frustrating .There was no overhead and no stocking of supplies. Everything was received a timely fashion."
good,One can do work online from home and can good amount pf money. There product are good a little expensive for the quality they are giving. Quality of the product is ok.

good,"A typical day at Avon Supply Chain Distribution Centre consists of servicing National representatives through a mail-plan ordering system, Representatives would place daily/campaign orders with a delivery service expectation of named day service, expectations are very high as Representatives are business entrepreneurs, impacting their service will prevent their ability to service their customers"
good,"A great company to associate yourself with as an independent sales rep."
good,Working at Avon provided me with ample opportunity to develop my professional career as well as a chance to utilize skills I had acquired over the course of my education.
good,"This is a commissions work, not a real job, to get work on this job you have to go out on a limb. The investment and the time it takes is really not worth doing as this is good for a social life, but cannot be taken seriously as a career. I have known this type of work on commissions basis for many years in Philippines and Australia but in Australia no -one I know will take this employment seriously"
good,Me pareció un empleo muy cómodo y divertido. Tenia tiempo para todo y eso me facilito al momento de estudiar y trabajar.
good,"I was an interim district sales manager, so my position was somewhat temporary. It could have been turned into a permanent position, however my health took a turn and I had to leave to company and take care of myself. "
good,I love Avon products and the professionals leaders. Working for Avon was a great experience for me. I met so many nice people and had fun while hosting Avon gatherings to promote Avon's quality products.
good,Working for Avon is enjoyable as it is very flexible and you can just do it as a job for an extra bit of money. You practically choose your own hours.
good,"I was on contract assignment there at Avon.  While I was there, I enjoyed working in the Quality Control/Assurance group testing the products, using the machines in the lab, and always testing the products so that it met the excellent standards."
good,Was a good place to work I was able to take my kids and work at my own pace on my own schedule.... you make the money you want however it can get very time consuming...
good,"Avon es una buena empresa en la cual aprendes a distribuir, y adquirir experiencia laboral."
good,Overall good place to learn and grow. The motto of the company is to strengthen women in all sorts of ways. they are protected and helped at every stage of the included process of achieving their dreams.
good,It was fast paced and quality orientated. People are usually friendly and if you have a concern you can talk to your lead or supervisor. There is lack of advancement is the only reason I left.
good,Fue un buen trabajo para mi porque me enseñaron la organización de equipos y liderazgo.
good,"A equipe de trabalho,sempre focada em atender todas as normas da empresa,para melhor atender suas revendedoras,bom lugar para se trabalhar."
good,"It was fun, worked well with being a stay at home mom. Their products are great. I got to spend all my time with my daughter while being able to make some money for her as well!"
good,It was great I could work when I wanted to because I had a new born baby at the time. Working there was great if you need a felixable schedule. Then this is a great job for you.

good,"I like working for Avon, but I am not getting paid with the company. I only get discounts when I order products for my customers.

good,"Excellent part time.  If you willing to spend 4-5 hours a week making calls and setting monthly meeting and letters this is the job to have,  Avon management and representatives are great to work with"
good,aprendi a negociar e perdi a timidez que era um dos meus maiores desafios.
good,"Making calls daily through referrals, family & friends, and established customers. Product demos, sales and delivery bi-weekly or as needed by customers. This was a self management job that required me to step out of myself and really get to know and serve others."
good,The people are insanely fantastic but it is so hard to grow here! The people really make it wonderful to come to work! Definitely a place that is looking to grow and change a lot!

good,el trabajo es totalmente independiente adecuado al horario de cada persona y con una cartera de clientes amplia
good,"Avon was a great company to work for, however it was a business model that did not keep up with the times. I loved my coworkers and still converse with them frequently. Keeping the plant running was quite the challenge however working closely with the engineering department was beneficial and kept things running smoothly."

good,"*  O dia a dia em meu trabalho muito desafiador."
good,"Avon is all about the customers, communication skills are key and vital for sales, as you can work your own hours it depends on committed as an individual you are, how many rounds you deliver or your clientele is based on determines the length of time you talk to customers, or spend doing your rounds. Meeting deadlines can be hard sometimes, because your goal is to sell as much avon products as possible however sometimes customers may take a while to decide what they would like to order or they may not be in when you do your rounds therefore causing a couple of issues but nothing which can't be sorted."
good,"Il lavoro di rappresentante può essere abbastanza stimolante."
good,It was fun working with AVON. I have learn a lot from AVON. Got a chance to visit many countries. it was a great experience to work with AVON.

good,"Empresa muito boa,com flexibilidade de horários,o pono contra foi a falta de pontualidade nos pagamentos e concessão das promoções."
good,"So much fun selling to customers and talking with co-workers. I somewhat learned how to and how not to approach customers when selling to them. My sales leader was amazing she was the nicest person I have ever met, I really enjoyed working with her. My co-workers were amazing as well, there was never a dull moment. The hardest part for me at first was approaching the customers and also being able to pay for the products for the customers while going to college. I had fun with this experience in selling for the first time."
good,i   to work but never home with family had to work 7 days  17 hours a day the work was good but after years of doing it  it gets to you i would love to go back

good,"O trabalho na empresa é bastante desafiador, pois o mesmo exige do funcionário bastante atenção, dedicação e raciocínio lógico do funcionário."
good,"As an Independent Sales Representative, there isn't a set of hours in which you have to work. I was free to run my business when I could, and was free to exercise my creativity when it came to selling the various products that the company offers. This job taught me the importance of being financially balanced, and making sure to pay close attention to how you make money, as well as spend it."
good,"Un buen ambiente laboral, con tecnicas y trabajos de grupo. jornada productiva llena de calidad puntualidad y responsabilidad."
good,"A typical day includes cold calling, door to door sales and marketing, recruiting, interviewing, and training new representatives. I have learned that you have to set goals and be dedicated and consistent daily. If you do this you can advance in title. I have a remarkable manager. She is committed to assisting all representatives achieve theirs goals. My co-workers are responsible, leaders who are committed to recruiting, training, and assisting others. The hardest part of the job is convincing others that Avon is a wonderful platform to gain hands on experience and to learn what it takes to be a new business owner. The most attractive and enjoyable feature of the job is the flexibility and the rewards along the way. I can work from anywhere: home, an off-site location, or the office."
good,The management is very nice and approachable. And can get hands on on new technologies
good,"A typical day for an operations manager at Avon is a mix of office and floor work. The usuals--emails; preparation, audit, and submission of reports--are generally done in the morning to give way to client servicing, which usually peaks after lunch. Client servicing includes making sure that all personnel are giving the Avon standard in customer service, making sure all necessary marketing materials are available, ensuring that the warehouse has enough inventory to replenish the store, and the management of customer accounts."
good,"en este trabajo se me facilito muchisimo manejar mi tiempo y realizar otras actividades laborales, las personas encargadas de asesorarnos  a nosotras las representantes AVON eran muy amables y cordiales, lo mas complicado es conseguir clientes pero al pasar en tiempo se hace muy facil"
good,"Não há monotonia na empresa há muitos dias que é bem agitado para se entregar em dia."
good,"Um dia de trabalho na Avon é feito junto dos revendedores, aprende-se imenso porque são pessoas com histórias de vida muito diferentes e todas têm as suas dicas para vender. Na minha zona não tenho colegas diretos da empresa mas trabalho com pessoas que indiretamente estão ligadas à Avon e é gratificante quando conseguimos desenvolver uma pessoa em termos de progresso na carreira. A parte mais difícil são algumas pessoas que simplesmente não se esforçam para atingir os objetivos e ficam à espera que algo aconteça."
good,I was self-employed. So it was a great experience and of course the management was excellent.
good,"Tudo que eu aprendi sobre liderança e gestão de equipe se deve ao que eu vivencie no trabalho na Avon. Eu era responsável por mais de 2.000 revendedoras numa abrangência de 27 cidades. Aprendi na prática como lidar com todos os tipos de públicos. Além dessas revendedoras autônomas, liderava uma equipe de 18 executivas com contrato direto com a Avon, focando continuamente no atingimento de metas, prospecção de novos clientes, gerenciamento e desenvolvimento de equipes de vendas."
good,"•	Lider em implantação de Gestão Antecipada (controle inicial);"
good,"Avalio a companhia Avon como uma boa empresa para se trabalhar, tive grandes oportunidades de aprendizado e evolução na carreira."
good,"I am thoroughly enjoying doing this in my spare time, it has helped me meet new people and expand my selling skills. helped me get back into working with new customers and engaged me with something to keep me busy with until i start university. this is also something i can do in my spare time as it doesn't take a lot of effort or time, however, since there is no official pay, i desperately need a new source of income during my degree studies."
good,Empresa muito estável que oferece muita segurança aos empregados
good,Ótima empresa. Promove grande oportunidade de crescimento na carreira. Salário e benefícios de acordo com as melhores no mercado.

good,Avon was a great company to work at and you meet some amazing people
good,"I work from home "
good,"Wonderful corporate culture, nurturing environment."
good,"Selling Avon is fun and exciting because you get to learn all about the products that are coming out and learn what goes in them but you really aren't paid which is why I need another job. I plan on staying with Avon because its just something on the side but I need to make money. I enjoy every part of it . All the people I come in contact with along with the ordering, inventory, distributing selling all of it"
good,"tem que ter paciência, saber comunicar com as pessoas e esta por dentro das novidades e do gosto dos clientes."

good,"O que me agradava na empresa era ter um dia produtivo para a realização das tarefas,o convívio com os colegas de equipe e dos líderes para mim era uma satisfação e aprendizado a cada dia e mesmo com  a cobrança da direção me sentia muita realizada e com a sensação de dever cumprido todos os dias."
good,"walk around to different areas, introducing yourself and selling different products. explaining and describing the products to the consumers"
good,"Everyday is busy day. You learn many things like how to deal with customers. You learn to be creative and proactive. The management as a whole is fair and friendly but you have to adjust with your co-workers in critical times (especially during big events like conventions  and conferences, launching of new products, etc.) The hardest part - the work itself is very stressful, needs to attend in many details.  But the most enjoyable is knowing the programs and events are successful."
good,"It could be a little easier to advance... that's sometimes a drawback."
good,"A avon pode ser bom pra alguns e ruim para outros, para mim foi os dois.. Não pude como ficar andando por ai para trabalhar por que não tinha dinheiro, gastei o que tinha e o que não tinha para tentar trabalhar. Porém eles dão premios, ensentivos..  O ruim mesmo era só o dinheiro de passage que eles não davam."
good,Very fun getting to sample products and sell things you have an interest in. Was great getting to know customers and definately helps if your organisation levels are bad!
good,"I like selling avon because I am my own boss, and my customers are my friends and family."
good,"Nice curently work during the main work. "
good,"empresa multinacional, como todo comercio exige muitas metas,porem tem uma otima aceitação do publico e a sua visao e missao é maravilhosa. aprendi muita coisa neste periodo e principalmente a trabalhar em equipe. os colegas de trabalho ,cada um faz sua parte para unir ao todo, não temos muito tempo juntos.porem são todos unidos pelo objetivo maior. a parte dificil , é que o salario varia muito ,com o periodo do ano . não temos uma visão antecipada do lucro. a parte mais agradavel é o relacionamento com as revendedoras , pois cada uma se torna especial amizade."
good,I loved what I was doing and who I worked with. Just the right fit.
good,é uma empresa que oferece oportunidade de ganhos a mais com um bom custo beneficio
good,"A Avon tem um ótimo clima e estrutura para se trabalhar, realmente parece uma empresa destinada à beleza da mulher. Todas as pessoas sentem o clima organizacional e buscam ser sempre educadas perante aos outros (funcionários ou clientes), o grande problema da Avon é que não existem processos claros e definidos o que prejudica demais o andamento do trabalho das pessoas e há muito instabilidade quanto aos objetivos, mudam rapidamente como se não houvessem sido planejados."
good,"Um trabalho muito dinâmico! Muitas tarefas ao mesmo tempo tendo que atuar com gestão de pessoas, motivando e desenvolvendo profissionalmente essas pessoas."
good,"Um dia típico de trabalho, era eu exercendo minha função. Guardando materiais no estoque e retirando quando preciso. Com a ajuda de uma empilhadeira. "
good,Aprender sobre ventas.Encontrar los puntos exactos para la venta.
good,"Manejo mis tiempos a mi gusto y disposición, aprendo a interactuar directamente con mis clientes, lo mas difícil es hacer un nombramiento y subir de nivel por ventas y lo que mas me gusta del trabajo es que puedo manejarme independientemente."
good,"AVON is good when people are really interested in some campaigns but on the other hand, sometimes theyre not. And if they dont buy anything youve wasted your money buying the books. But you will always get the regulars who buy the same thing all the time."
good,"Excelente empresa que cuenta con una gran estabilidad laboral y beneficios contractual,"
good,"you are your own boss,you learn what it take to run a business.customer service is priority.recruiting was the hardest."
good,The best thing about this job was being able to work around my own life.
good,"As a Avon representive, I never actually had a set day to work. I did what I needed to do, as and when I felt/needed to. Day one, I would write out all my receipt dockets and place them into books. Then look thoroughly through my book so I could highlight the special offers to my customers. Then I dropped off books to my regulars and I tried to make myself at least 1 new customer a day. After a short time I would collect the books and place the order online. Once the orders were in, I met with my distributor, who was a very lovely lady, and i would arrange the orders and arrange with my customers a suitable time to drop off their items. The best part of the job was that I could work around my own times, and work at my own leisure and from my own home. I often  wished of having co-workers to enjoy a laugh with, but the people I met along the way were lovely. I learned a lot skills in this job, as mentioned above. My job was a commission based salary so I set myself a target goal each month to achieve. Being honest, there were times I never achieved the full target, but I was never far off."
good,I basically worked for myself. I handled my own sales and merchandise. I learned how to do these things and manage the money. the hardest part of the job was getting things together but I did succeed. The most enjoyable part was seeing customers buy a dependable product and were happy with it.
good,"Aprendi com as diferenças pessoais, ensinei uma rapaz com deficiência auditiva e eu por não saber falar a linguagem de sinais, me senti naquele momento deficiente. "
good,"Muy buena empresa solo que aquí realice un contrato determinado, por reposo pre y post-natal, luego vacaciones, de una empleada fija."
good,"The hours at Avon varied, alot of times they needed employee's to work the first shift although, my hours were 3-11:30pm I would volunteer to work any shift they asked me to. I really liked working for Avon, the inter-action with all the District and Sales Manager's. I was responsible for taking Inbound order's via pc, using an Window's-Based system, Data Entry /Order Entry and Customer Service skills. I learned 10-key and from various company spondsored training classes I learned: How to diffuse anger, Professionalism, How to conduct up-sell and Survey's and How to handle Irate Customer's.At Avon, I earned an Certification and became an Certified Order Entry Specialist. The management staff and co-worker's were professional and a joy to work with.The hardest part of the job was taking your paycheck home because we got employee discount's on all of Avon product's. The most enjoyable part of the job was working for such an prestigous company, having a job and having a job that you would love to get up and go to that was productive and a fun place to work."
good,Team work is appreciated. Students value your contribution. Management can be inconsistant. Politics is a problem.
good,Great job. Very physical but rewarding. Filled assembly lines with products. Target deadlines required to be met on a daily basis.
good,Es una empresa buena. Aun que con areas de mejora en los metodos y en la busqueda y solucion de la causa raiz de los problemas.
good,"A typical day has you out and about meeting old and new customers. My area managers are always friendly, helpful and always available to help out and give advice."
good,"excelente compatibilizar tiempo, estudios, trabajo con esto, es una gran ayuda."
good,"Empresa dinâmica do ramo de vendas diretas onde desenvolvi liderança e gestão: pessoas, estratégias e de resultados; proporciona um ótimo ambiente de trabalho com colegas atenciosos e prestativos, a parte mais difícil do trabalho era gerenciar os conflitos Empresa X Cliente (faltas, cobranças indevidas, datas erradas de entrega) a parte mais agradável era o contato direto com revendedoras, a capacitação que eu proporcionava ás executivas e revendedoras através de reuniões e palestras instrutivas e motivacionais."
good,"gestisci da solo il lavoro, la gestione delle attività,, della pubblicità per moltiplicare le vendite."
good,-Visitar amigas y gente nueva para ofrecer mis productos.
good,"A typical day at work when selling Avon is easy, fun and relaxing. The things that I have learned selling Avon is how to be more open on products, and how to speak up in front of a group of people."
good,"You get to meet and work with new people everyday. I learned how to perform retail sales, time management, and inventory. Hardest part was getting people to join the group."
good,"Trabalho muito rotineiro onde em alguns momentos se tornava massante, uma gestão dificil de se avaliar ja que hoveram 4 gestores diferentes no decorrer de dois anos, oque dificultava o andamento das atividades por terem as prioridades modificadas. O convivio com a equipe sempre foi muito armonico e agradavel. Aprendi a lidar com as mudanças rápidas e conciliar as prioridades."
good,ótima em todos os tópicos.
good,The five years I spent at Memorial were the best in my healthcare career. I left to help raise grandchildren. I do not return because I do not wish to work 12-hour shifts.
good,"Durign the time I worked there I had many satisfactions as a professional, trouble shooter, analist, Engineer, boss, strategist, Project Manager, and a colleague. I put all my knowledge to work and it was good untill it lasted. Then, for personal reasons, I decided to move and therefore I quit... bad move because they don't re-hire."
good,"Si riesce facilmente a gestire gli ordini con la vita privata...infatti non si è sottopressione anzi uno gestisce quando ordinare,come e cosa effettivamente sulla base delle esigenze della clientela e ogni cosa ha un buon rapporto qualità /prezzo,adatto a tutte le tipologie di clienti."
good,We essentially work for ourselves and by ourselves customer satisfaction and relationships are our only goal with that comes sales. When you supply a product that people want and buy from you that is the reward.
good,"While I worked for Avon, I was sixteen and for me, I figured it was fun to meet new people, learn how to multitask and learn how to handle cash at a young age. I also thought it was a great experience because I got amazing deals as well.  I also didn't know the difference of how high or low money was back then so of course I figured $25-$30.00 was a lot lol"
good,"Si basa sulla qualità dei prodotti, ma il guadagno è minimo. Si crea un clima gruppale all' interno del team che aiuta a stare bene. Le Avon leader sono molto gentili, e il clima è piacevole. Mi piace parlare e ricevere prodotti in promozione perchè sono introvabili nei soliti negozi o profumerie o altri store."
good,"Working for Avon has been a wonderful fit for me.  I am connected to the community, have independence and a flexible schedule.  Once you build a loyal customer base, you have the potential to earn some money.  The down fall is having to pay for every little thing; samples, brochures, postage, etc.  It adds up."
good,"Great ppl to work with and comfortable atmosphere, great team work within the IT departments, I had the opportunity to support multiple countries so I gained great friendships all over."
good,Would reccomend for anybody to do whilst taking care of the family  home you will find it a convenient place to top up the earnings and a great chance of getting to know your community
good,If you want to work for yourself and have endless money making potential than this is the job for you. You have to be a go getter and not afraid to put in the time and do the work. You make your own hours and are your own boss. Not for an unmotivated person. Learn to be tech savy. It will help you place orders and recruit leads to sign up under you.
good,"Empresa de grande porte, com excelente possibilidades de crescimento, bem como um bom clima organizacional."
good,"Uma ótima experiencia, tralhar com publico, clientes bem agradáveis."
good,as long as you were willing to put in the effort there is plenty of money to be made. Were able to choose locations of where you would like to work. And there are also events available for you to set up an sell inventory and recruit new people to work under you

good,Oferece as ferramentas necessárias para o desempenho da função
good,"Trabalho excelente, muito dinâmico que nos dá a conhecer muitas pessoas."
good,"Pleasant place to work with a good manager. However, at times the company's generous policy of giving people second and third changes kept poor performers in place, which added to the workload of others."
good,"Grande ricerca ed attenzione al prodotto, grande interscambio tra i diversi team e funzioni"
good,en el tiempo que labore para la empresa fue un ambiente laboral muy agradable
good,the workplace culture is great. everyone is willing to help each other. it has gotten more intense work wise. there was a split between the global and north american divisions. this caused a lot of the work that global was doing to be put on north america.
good,"Esta empresa es interesante, ya te permite administrar tu tiempo para poder realizar tus ventas, y tú te pones tus horarios de trabajo, pero lo que a esta empresa le falta es tener más asegurados a su empleados."
good,"This job teaches you how to work autonomously. You are in charge of running your own little business as it is your duty to build clientele, take their orders, place the orders and ship out the products once they have arrived. It is also necessary to provide an excellent customer service experience as that is what will allow you to maintain a high amount of sales and generate high profits."
good,"I worked around my children,  I got to meet many new people, placed order online then delivered the order.  helped with any problems. I carried my books everywhere i went, schools, dance class for my Daughter."
good,"Avon has curved a wonderful journey for my career as a enthusiastic and strong worker who wanted to do what I love and be able to balance my everyday life. I am a sales women at heart and also a cosmetology graduate. I have always loved being a makeup artist and finding what seems like the small things for women like the right shade of lipstick or how blend your foundation the right way. So to be able to grow with Avon and my clients growing all the time its great. I work mostly online ordering, shipping and giving my customers my best. My Avon family is a blessing as well because without them I would not have grown and been newly educated with all my skills. I make my own schedule and find a lot more time to get things done that was harder before."
good,"Basically the more work that you put in daily , the more you got paid. You had to learn and maintain structure and discipline. My manager was awesome and helped out with any issues or questions anyone had."
good,Avon is a great company to meet new people and advance your career.  You are your own boss and are able to achieve many things throughout the company.  Avon has a good award system
good,As a maintenance technician I had my own 2-3 lines that I maintained every day. So that gave me time to focus on and learn the machines inside and out. Every couple months I would switch lines with another maintenance technician so we could cross train to learn the other machines. The production floor was temp. controlled all year round. Most of the management that I dealt with were very helpful and great to work with. I really enjoyed the freedom the my Maintenance Manger gave me to improve the machines that I worked on to make them more effective and efficient.
good,"I could work during my own times . Im improving my communication skills . I am making ok money for my self ,but not as much as i use to . But i still enjoy working for them."
good,Avon is great if you want to try your hand at being your own boss. Most of the time I used my debit card to pay for consumer purchases on the website.
good,"Catch up on previous days sales."
good,Hermoso recuerdo de avon es divertido y competitivo  con muchas metas y desafíos los tiempos los manejaba uno y era super
good,"Otima empresa, otimo lugar para aprender, grandes profissionais envolvidos."
good,"I've been working at Avon for almost 13 years. The staff is wonderful and they've always got your best professional interests in mind. Great benefits, as well. The changes in management styles, after the US buyout, have been different. However, they always welcome input and questions."
good,"Il lavoro mi piaceva, però se non si ha molto giro non si vende e non si guadagna molto, anche perchè le provvigioni sono abbastanza basse."
good,"Anyone can be a sales rep. Just gotta put time and effort in it. I mean I had a good experience, the people were friendly. They gave me good advice on how to sell my products and tips on how to be a good salesman."
good,"Trabalhei muito na Avon, me senti muito privilegiado por isso. A Avon tem uma gerencia maravilhosa. O trabalho é massante em alguns setores, mas em outros fluí que é uma beleza. Fiz muitas amizades lá dentro e saí com saudades, deixando muitas marcas positivas."

good,"Dependendo da área, é super descontraído e as pessoas são excepcionais! Salário competidor e ótimas refeições no local."
good,"this is an ideal job for stay at home mums which I was at the time but I found that without many customers you didn't end up with a great deal of money left over once you had put all your time and effort into it plus what with having to buy your books and bags for the job it didn't leave you with much, but I enjoyed getting out and about walking and meeting lots of new people."
good,"This job requires you to be productive and on your feet at times. Though this is a challenging and productive job.  "

good,Learned the products for many years. Learned that persistence can pay off but also clients can be a bit demanding. Have had fun doing very small demos and giving free samples when the opportunity happens.
good,"Avon is a good place to work at if you are good at selling.  I myself thought I would give it a try again because I had tried it at another time but I am just not a good sells person. If you are good at selling this is the place for you to start,   If you have a family and are trying to be at home as much as possible with them, yet supplement your family income, give it a chance.  Your really have nothing to lose to see if something new will help you other than your time.  Good luck, maybe it will work out good for you.  I know some people that have really done well with it and are making good money."
good,"Работая в компании нужно много времени уделять клиентам, изучению продукции и саморозвитию. Колектив очень отзывчив. На сайтах компании есть полное обучение новых сотрудников и вся нужная информация о продукте.. Иногда есть проблемы с регистрацией новых представителей, пакетами документов. Компания не дает полной информации сотрудникам внутренней информационной службы."
good,The employees in Avon cosmetics were super nice. They still entertain their direct sellers like me no matter hoe they busy they are in their works. I like about Avon Cosmetics is that every brochure released there were lots of promos.
good,"Empresa com rotinas bem definidas, com grande exigências aos desafios. "
good,"The people that you work with are great, all are always willing to jump in when needed to get the job done. The only part that is left to question is upper management and the long term plan, better known as the 5 year turn around. I believe this put the company on a downward spiral, which has never regained it financial footing or profitability strive."
good,"Todos os dias o trabalho devia ser seguido no mesmo ritmo, com a linha de separação com meta de 400 caixas/hora. Equipe focada nos objetivos estabelecidos para alcançar a meta diária, boa relação entre os colegas de trabalho e liderança sempre muito ativa e presente em determinadas situações."
good,"Sair as ruas e fazer prospecção de vendedores em potencial era ótimo, cresci muito profissionalmente e despertei em mim um espirito de liderança, minha gerente era maravilhosa e sempre me ajudava no que precisasse, minha equipe so quem cuidava era eu uma turma de mais de 60 revendedoras e as vezes as minhas colegas me ajudavam, o mais difícil era enfrentar o sol mas no final era recompensador sair com resultado."

good,"A typical day is unknown.  It could be 6 hours or it could be 12, depending on orders and staffing.  I learned and grew a lot in my position and gained useful experience.  Some management seem to have their own agenda and once you fall from their graces you are pretty much out the door. It's a different culture and if you have problems adjusting to the culture you won't do well.   Loved my co-workers and I enjoyed the company benefits."

good,It is a good way to help bring in a little extra income to help support one's family as well as a great opportunity to meet new people. Plus it is nice to be able to set one's own hours though it can be difficult to find new clients within the area that don't already have their own reps.
good,Some customers were cheeky and decided to quit getting Avon. and then wondered why they didnt get avon anymore. it was an ok experience but i learned that my Avon was quite good pay for it. the hardest part of the job was arranging everything into who is who. the most enjoyable part was getting to know my neibours

good,"Gostava do que fazia, foi uma oportunidade de aprendizado trabalhar na Avon"
good,"Trabajo tranquilo en las horas libres, con facilidad de venta y obtención de ganancia.!"
good,"Being an Avon Representative is easy as there is no set hours to follow. This is beneficial in allowing you to balance your work and social time effectively. The amount of money you earn depends on how much you sell. The more hours you put in, the more money you will make. However you do have to buy your own stationary/equipment including the brochures but overall it is still worth it-especially if you are a student with a busy schedule."
good,"A typical day at work consists of flexibility. I can do anything in the day and fit Avon around it. If I'm ill, and in no fit shape to go out, that doesn't matter as I'm working from home."

good,"I like Avon a lot, they have many causes that they believe in and they believe in their representatives, which is why I still am an Avon representative and always will be."
good,"O dia de trabalho não tinha horas definidas, eu é que fazia a minha agenda e trabalhava mais ou menos 9h no terreno e mais 4 ou 5 h em casa, mediante a altura do mês(fechos de campanha) o que poderia traduzir-se em trabalhar ao fim de semana muitas vezes; por isso era complicado gerir também a vida pessoal. "
good,"Overall Avon is a great job. Basically it isn't about teamwork, the more effort you put in, the more dedication you have then the better the outcome and the higher your salary will be. The worst part of the job was when customers wouldn't be in when you went to collect the brochures and then you'd have to go to their door again. However, many of the customers were very polite and welcoming which i thought was the best part of the job, i grew fond of many of them and they made it a lot better. As i'm only young, this was just a job on the side to earn some money for myself, now i will attend sixth form and hopefully University which is why i need to gain work experience which i believe this gave me. I learnt to be organised and dedicated in order for it to b e successful."
good,"This was a self-employed role in which I could decide when i worked and how often. I had to deliver and collect books, put in orders, pick and pack orders and deliver the products. This role taught me to be organised and efficient. the best part of this job was getting to meet new people."
good,"When I worked as an Avon lady, I introduced products during my work especially during recess time and noon-break.The hardest time is when there were lot of costumers who will not pay on time."

good,No two days are the same. A typical day is an atypical day. New challenges and issues are faced each day due to the management of approximatetly 900 Independent Representatives. A plethora of ususal and unusual problems and situations are experienced daily. The most enjoyable part of the job is the independence in creativity and flexible schedule it allows. Truly like operating your own strategic business unit. Challenging and difficult in terms of KPI profiency being measured bi weekly. The enjoyable aspects of the job are the ability to positively impact people's lives through mentoring and coaching.

good,"The best thing about working with this company is the flexible hours and the fact that I am my own boss. I am working as self-employed with this company, and it enables me to learn how to run my own small business. To be honest, it has it's ups & downs, but I can say that I've learned alot about sales & interacting with people. The hardest part of this job is to maintain the new recruits. I recruit new sales representatives and so, I also earn through them. It is not always that easy to maintain & earn from recruits under my downline, however the company bonuses are awesome..i just have to work real hard & put all my effort and time into it. I am now able to manage my own small business through Avon Co."

We have a very good support structure from our sales leaders as well as the company itself.ill'd have to say the hardest part for me will have to be collecting the parcels from the post, cause the post is quiet far from where i staying and there is no public tranport in between too.

good,I was partner with a family to help sale avon. She would order a bundle of products and we would set up a booth at the flea market. We did very good with sales. I learned how to communicate and handle customers. Also every item that was sold I had to write down the price so I guess that would be like inventory. There wasn't anything hard about the job and it was just enjoyable helping so many people.
good,"a empresa tem uma estrutura muito boa onde os funciónarios podem enriquecer seus conhecimento de diversa formas,podendo assim coloca-las em prática na própria empesa."
good,"I could go at any time to sale. My goal was to introduce many to Avon and to in the process make as much money as i wanted. I like being able to travel around from place to place and when i delivered, I enjoyed seeing happy customers satisfied with their products...I even got tips, never knew people would tip thought that was only in resturants..."
good,"Avon is a good part-time job. It is convenient. It is like having your own business in a way because you can do different things,set how much time you want to spend on it. I think that the more time you spend with it and the more people you know, you will make more money. If you don't know to many people, the income is low. You definitely can make some money in it."

good,A typical day at work would start out by labeling the catalogs with my contact information. Then I would distribute them to all my clients and potential clients. After that I would take one day to contact them and see if they want to order anything from the books. After I input the orders I then wait for the order to come in and then I schedule my deliveries in order to collect payment at the same time.  I learned that you should never give a client an order without payment. The hardest part of the job was the follow up on old clients that had not ordered in a while.

They are there to help when you need it and answer all questions effectively. I personally don't make a lot off of it yet but every little bit helps and the more you put in the more you get out.

Os profissionais mais antigos se demonstram sempre prontos a ajudar e auxiliar no que for necessário, criando um ambiente agradável de trabalhar.

good,"you work from home so its not really any different from being home on a regular day. Although sometime you have to go around your block and see if anyone would like for you to be their representative, you give them a brochure, they tell you what you want.

good,"um dia de trabalho em fechamento de campanha é muito trabalhoso porem satisfatório,fora fechamento .dias tranquilos. aprendi que ter um bom relacionamento com equipe é um grande segredo para um bom desenvolvimento de vendas. ter um bom relacionamento com a gerente e atender os princípios da empresa ajuda no crescimento de aprendizagem. Ter respeito pelos colegas de trabalho,respeitando o espaço deles para que o seu seja respeitado. a parte mais dificil e a tristeza de fechamento o receio de alguma meta sem cumprir.Aparte mais agradável é o reconhecimento da gerente e empresa pelos eu desempenho. e ver que toda equipe conseguiu cumprir as metas ."
good,"A cada quinze dias ocorre no CD Bahia a troca de campanha,temos que esvaziar todos os bins que são estantes que ficam os produtos a serem separados.Teriamos que correr contra o tempo para entregar para outro turno a área limpa com a troca feita.As outras áreas se juntaram e fizeram um mutirão para ajudar a terminar ,aprendi que o trabalho em equipe é essencial para um bom funcionamento de uma empresa.E a posição dos supervisores foram de exatamente chegar junto mesmo ajudaram os funciónarios,carregaram caixas e faziam a liberação.A parte mais difícil foi quando chegou no horário de encerrar o turno, mas ninguém saiu da área continuamos com o mesmo entusiasmo foi que vinte minutos depois gritamos e batemos palmas por que a última caixa foi colocada no bin e a troca foi um sucesso."
good,"As a Representative I very much enjoyed meeting with customers and promoting new products as it was completely new and exciting to run my own business; allowing for flexible hours, creative sales skills development and experience in the Beauty industry. The village where I live in Yorkshire has grown vastly in the last 20 years which meant there was plenty of opportunity for door to door sales. A typical day at work would be walking door to door on my allocated streets with brochures, promoting new products to new and existing customers and displaying brochures and new products in Country Hair, the local salon. Other responsibilities were collecting and delivering orders to customers, sending monthly orders online to Avon, handling payments to Avon, learning about new products coming out and researching sales techniques. The difficultly I found with this job was I did not have much contact with other representatives or others in the Company. However I learned many valuable sales techniques, how to approach and talk to customers and it was great to work for such a well known company as Avon Cosmetics."
good,I like how we have meetings to talk about the sales. And we do raffles at times to make things more fun. I go to peoples homes and ask them if they would like to join the Avon team.

Todo o dia de serviço era um novo aprendizado, tanto para a gerência, quanto para estagiários e aprendizes. Meus colegas me acolheram muito bem desde o primeiro dia, me ajudando nos serviços e eu auxiliando-os. A parte mais difícil era controlar o tempo, devido a alta demanda das atividades, mas a parte mais agradável foi de ajudar qualquer colega em um problema na sua atividade"

good,"A typical work day for me at Avon for me was  great. I got along with my Supervisors and Co-workers which always made the work day go well. Unfortunaley, I was effected by a downsizing in the company which affected the department that I was in . However, I learned alot of good valuable things and skills with Avon in which I feel will be very helpful in whatever new job position that I attain. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I was able to work from home and become a virtual agent. Although, I loved working around my peers, being able to become virtual made if less stressful for me to have to come in during times when there was bad weather. I enjoyed working for the company but am excited about a new opportunity to work and learn new skills from another company."
good,"This kind of a job is a job you do during your own time."
good,"My typical day at work was to give customers avon books so that they could have a look through and choose which items they would like. I would then go back another day to collect the book and send off for the items. When the items had arrived, I would deliver them to the customers at a fast service. I learned how to be organised and how to keep track of time and I became more confident and sociable. The enjoyable part of the job was seeing customers being satisfied with their items and wanting the book again to order more items from avon."
good,Avon is great if you live in a big city not a small town where everyone sells avon. More opportunity with more people in a city.
good,"This involves a number of responsibilities including delivering brochures throughout my territory, collecting the brochures and engaging with my potential customers, placing all orders received with Avon before the deadline and delivering said orders to my customer’s home or work place.

I learned a lot about how to sale,talk to customers properly and keep the customer relation to an professional level so that they trust me and keep ordering from me."
good,A typical day at work would be filling orders for the representatives. We try to work as a team to get the job done. Knowing that we did the order quota we needed made the job satisfying. The hardest thing to do was keep the machines running. My supervisor was always on the floor when we needed him.
good,"As an avon representative i enjoyed it for a while, but things did get a bit too out of hand and got on top of me with other things, so if you have spare time on your hands this is a perfect job for you but if not i would reconsider."

Didn't have co-workers in this job. hardest part I would say is meeting the quota for sales. The most enjoyable part was when we met the quota."
good,"*  Review and track the sales and make sure that the representatives are aware of trainings and due dates."
good,"Normally after college I would get my Avon magazines and I would spread them around the neighbourhood, leaving my number and the pick up date. I would also give it to family and friends. I worked on commission, so the more products I sold, they higher pay I would receive. After collecting the magazines, I would place the order on the website, and by the end of the weak the products would have arrived already. Then I had to put the products in different bags according to the order, and then deliver them to the customers and collect the money. "

I loved it though no matter what, but I can't grow this business and still have money for a full load at college. I just can't put all of myself into it. The best part is interacting with new people. "
good,"It's a very easy and fun job. You can work from home selling products or other items such clothing, jewelry etc. In the beginning it's tough building up your customers but after a month of selling my number in customers went up.

good,"have been working since 14 years, which gave me an early sense of responsibility. After law school, I worked in a large law office for 2 years, I interrupted my career to dedicate myself to my son. When I returned to the market, I felt that the legal career did not attract me anymore. I became interested in the commercial area (sales), since then I've worked in three of the largest companies in Brazil, an American company, a Swedish company and a Brazilian one. My strengths are commitment, focus on strategic development, targets achievement and relationship interpersonal. I still have a great relationship with the people that I've worked with. Leading groups and act in leadership are not a problem. The hardest part of dealing in a company is when I do not achieve a goal. The second aspect that bothers me is working with uncommitted or people who do not like to follow company rules. I consider myself adaptable and responsible."

The break kitchen was open and had a nice selection of coffee or tea, whatever you needed as a pick me up to get through the day. I learned an immense amount of information from the Creative Director I worked under. He was both professional and inspiring to work for, every morning we would talk for a few minutes before getting to the daily tasks. The most approachable boss I have ever worked for in my entire life. My co-workers were all very sharp as well as intuitive. Days there went very quick and although the environment was fast paced, it was nothing less than extremely enjoyable every day."
good,"The company where I'm working now, it's a wonderful place. Managers and co-workers collaborate well together, there is good communication and respect towards everyone. "
good,"Working for Avon was wonderful. Getting the products in the mail, getting it organized, taking inventory, sorting into individual orders, making a receipt, bagging products, and delivering to customers was an average day. I learned more about sales and how to run a small business. The hardest part was placing an order and having every item shipped. A lot of items were placed on hold and shipped later if it ever came at all. The most enjoyable part of the job was selling and up-selling."

good,"Bom."
good,"aprendi o começo de como seria o mercado de trabalho. era dificil por que tinha que ir em busca de clientes, os colegas de trabalho eram ótimos as informações contidas nos produtos era claras e facilmente de demostrar."
good,"See my work history for my typical day at work, I learned that the customers I trust aren't always going to buy a lot of products every time I get a new catalog and that I don't want to sell to strangers because I don't know them therefor I don't trust them therefor I don't make as much money as I'd like, management is fine, co-workers don't exist you work alone from home, hardest part of the job is being lonely and bored because I have no co-workers and the wear and tear on my car and how much faster my gas goes, most enjoyable part of the job is the money I get to keep and when we have meetings/conventions/luncheons and getting free products every now and then  and getting to model items from the catalog at the conventions..."

good,"For a 14year old girl it is a very interesting work advancement into the world it helped me develop people skills and sort through money and order and deliver products it improves use of mathematics and English. It is a normal job to have where you can have productive hours, the management is helpful and helps you in the beginners stage and then they don't particularly contact you unless needed, you don't really see co-workers unless you are already friends or related to them, the hardest part of the job is the sorting the products and making sure that they are all going to the correct customer, the most enjoyable part of the job is talking to the customers and giving them advice on what they should buy and helping them."
good,"As principais atividades de uma Executiva de Vendas são:"

Кроме того, постоянно знаешь, что нового появилось из косметики. Много новых знакомств. Единственный минус - это то, что ты постоянно ищешь себе новых клиентов, если хочешь зарабатывать деньги, это очень сложно, потому что существует очень много разной косметики."
good,It was a very good and fun job lots of exercise from walking to different houses but it can be heavy and tiring as you have to carry all the brochures around with you and you have to do it in all weathers which was annoying as I didn't have a car so I couldn't drive around or place them in a car and keep going back to it.

good,"A typical day at work is interacting with customers while receiving positive feedback and referrals. I gained a great amount of experience and am hoping to gain more. I learned that the more you apply yourself to the job and building relationships, the greater your overall experience. My co-workers are like mentors to me in which they are always there to help. The hardest part of the job is knowing that your pay is based off commission sales so it gives you the drive to work harder, meet and set goals. The most enjoyable part of the job is becoming diverse and informing others of new products and sales."
good,"Learning experience"
good,Tengo tiempo libre para realizar otro tipo de trabajo en conjunto ya que no me influye en el tiempo para desarrollarme en un trabajo estable con horarios y obligaciones.

good,"In this job, I have had so much challenges. I worked every hours and everywhere. Because I am the one who has to make my own customer it was hard for me until i decided to step out and try to talk to everyone near me. It helped me to develop my communication, and making my own customers, I didn't have a co-worker beside my manager. She tells me what to do. the thing I enjoy in this job is when I accomplish the amount of customers I wanted to earn. Also its pleasant , when the customers find the products more exciting that they expected. Its has been really fun to work here."

good,Avon is like a hobby with benefits. I have about 20 customers that I cater to. It's a real personable job. I spend alot of time visiting with my customers when I deliver their products or catalogs.The hardest part of the job is if they are unhappy with a product and I have to send it back but even that isn't very difficult. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people.

good,"Avon inc is a great company to work at, being able to pick your own hours was a really great thing. Working alone and running your own business could get pretty hectic. Thankfully i know how to operate a computer because that helped me submit orders for customers. I learned that it takes hard work and dedication to get the job done."

good,Tive muito prazer em trabalhar nesta empresa porem tambem tive sonhos em crescer junto com a mesma mas infelizmente nao foi possivel a empresa nao oferece estabilidade
good,"A empresa trabalha com metas e dependendo do município não tem como a mesma continuar crescendo, pois tinha de ser cadastrado a cada 20 dias um número x de revendedoras novas e com isso,não há  como continuar por muito tempo em uma empresa que só pensa em crescer.Aprendi que devemos esta sempre buscando um novo.Esse tipo de trabalho existe uma certa competição entre as colegas de trabalho.A parte mais difícil era esta sempre crescendo a equipe. As reuniões eram as partes melhores dos encontros, onde nos reuníamos para troca de experiências."
good,"On a normal day I deliver brochures to my customers and show them the new products that have just come out or that are on offer, I then leave the book with my customers for a couple of days so they can have a look and decide what they would like to order."
good,um dia de trabalho é muito gostoso e rendável pois aprendi e apreendo algo nao todo dia direção e gerencia tem muito a desejar pouco qualificada e colegas de trabalhos bons amigos e pouco profissional o mas difícil é q nem jesus cristo agradou todo mundo q dirá eu o mas agradável é ver as revendedoras satisfeita e alegres pois amo o q faço e faço com amor eprazer
good,"Avon is an excellent company. It used to be one of the best companies around. Unfortunately with the shift to online purchasing, most people no longer use representatives to receive products. The products are good, but are not as competitive as they should be. The recent mergers have caused plants to shut down while others have grown. It may only be a matter of time until operations are only at one plant."
good,I was an Avon Sales Consultant for two years. I enjoyed being able to work a full time job and have a second job selling Avon. The hardest part of being an Avon Representative was that there were no benefits and there wasn't a regular wage amount as far as income. It was hard not knowing how much I would make or how many sales I would have. I did very well and had a lot of customers when I first became an Avon Sales Consultant and did very well. I made my own schedule and made extra money outside of my fulltime job. When the economy started going bad and a lot people were getting laid off is when I stopped being an Avon Sales Representative.
good,"I started become a direct seller when I was still a student."
good,"A day at work for this job employment was a tough one,Because i first i really wasn't into dealing with door to door sales or even approaching people, but once you get the hang of the job, it turns  out awesome at the end of the day,you get to meet new faces daily! That was the best part of my job!"
good,"Being a franchise dealer in Avon Cosmetics, Inc is not really my regular work, it is only my side line wherein I can have an additional earning by influencing my target customers by advertising and promoting the products of Avon Cosmetics, Inc. through showing the brochures to them and eventually they will have their orders and I will personally purchase the orders in the near Avon outlet."
good,"Praticamente todos os dias ."
good,"Trabalhar na Avon abre as portas para o conhecimento. "
good,Self employed sales representative.  Taking orders from customers either on the phone or through email.  Placing orders online.  Receiving orders. Organizing orders and then delivering them to the customer.
good,"Fui super bem recebida ao entrar na empresa, aqui se encontra um clima ótimo para se trabalhar. A empresa valoriza muito a mulher como profissional."
good,Excellent training and support from management! Great perks and incentives. Love the Avon products! They have a great reputation and have had loyal customers  for over 125 years.
good,"deals with a lot of people specially ladies, manages my own time, im just reporting to the manager the most enjoyable part of the work is that I can enjoy the freebies of the product im selling."
good,"Bem e relação as empresa que já trabalhei,são excelentes mas deixa à desejar na administração, pois se você quer ver sua empresa sempre em alta tens que fazer seus funcionários ficar sempre motivados,"
good,"A empresa é muito boa de se trabalhar, trabalha com pessoas e acredito que foi por isso que gostei tanto."
good,"Esta experiência foi muito importante na minha vida profissional,porque eu desenvolvi habilidades que não conhecia."
good,"This job always has room for advancement however if you are in a heavily populated area, there is guaranteed to be more than one Avon Rep in your neighborhood. So it was hard to maintain a customer base."
good,I learned leadership and communication skills. I often trained and supervised newly hired employees. I worked well with all my co-workers and respected their space. The hardest part working at Avon was the ever malfunctioning machines. The most enjoyable part of the job was exceeding the daily quota. 
good,"it is nice selling Avon but I had not many people because they were already through someone,"
good,Growing up with the Avon lady is one of the fondest memories I have from my childhood! It's neat to be a part of a brand that's been around forever. Love the variety of items we sell now too!
good,"Meeting and searching for new customers, making a trusting relationship with those customers I established. Everyone had different needs and attitudes to what was expected. Didn't deal with management or co-workers, unless there was a meeting, which was not mandatory to attend. The connection I made with my customers was the best part of my job, they became a part of my life and counted on me for receiving products even if they didnt place an order on time, especially around holidays were gifts were being purchased,"
good,"Foi onde eu descobri o meu grande dom e talento profissional. Levantava bem cedo, e saia para o campo, atráz de novas revendedoras. Com um belo sorriso no rosto, meu dia rendia muito. Depois do almoço, fazia visita as minhas revendedoras já cadastradas."
good,"Pues en verdad,soy una persona que me gusta trabajar, ademas me gusta lo que es el comercio, relacionarme con el publico, me yevo de cada empresa unos aprendizajes, pienso que es bueno aprender todos los dias algo.Por supuesto que el compañerismo en el trabajo es muy importante,y la parte mas dificil de un puesto de trabajo, creo que si trabajas con ganas no debe de haberla, por lo menos para mi."
good,Muy buen ambiente de trabajo con mucha preparacion e informacion con coferencias mensuales y desayuno gratis
good,Avon is a private company which people sell product for.
good,com a avon e lucro na certa.nesta empresa e muito legal nos lucramos muito questão ter disponibilidade de conquista novos cliente e se comunicativa
good,"Avon is basically a company for women created for women to feel uplifting."
good,Buena empresa si tienes buenos habitos de desempeño automotivado
good,Excelentes prestaciones y prioridad por las personas.
good,"Although Avon is good as it allows you to work when you want, the admin involved and the leg work to put out brochures, collect them and distribute products can be a bit much for a fairly low salary. Although your salary is based on your own sales, you are relying on a good catchment area so there is no promise of consistent orders"
good,"Avon é uma empresa que trabalha com a revenda de catálogos com produtos variados para cama, mesa e banho e beleza, é uma empresa confiável é muito profissional."
good,good and friendly people do stuff a lot.rude costumer sometimes. and i get lots of people sometimes too.go place when lots of stuff get free stuff lots of people work and tream leader as well
good,"Lo bueno de trabajar de comercial es que podías organizarte el tiempo de trabajo como quisieras, sin embargo, es complicado promocionar en la empresa y las comisiones eran muy bajas teniendo en cuenta el volumen de trabajo que necesitabas para conseguir clientes y la poca fidelidad que obtenías, en algunos casos, de ellos."
good,"Cresci muito profissionalmente, ótimo lugar para trabalhar e agradável. Empresa prestativa."
good,"Para tener tiempo libre, ganar un dinerito extra y hacer algo que te gusta ...esta muy bien."
good,"Enjoyable as a hobby, but for me did not provide financial stability."
good,"customer training in order to teach them how to sell and collected funds from their clients,conducted inventory,sell prepared office for sale meetings and offer promotions for representatives,make call to work on job fairs and special events,help manager with all the representatives she needs to reach and balance her time from the meetings she had from her upper management and representatives "
good,"Great for a hobby. Not worth it for full time since the customer base is hardly there. No weekly paycheck. No benefits. Unless, you have a regular job and this as a side job, you won't be able to pay your bills strictly just by selling Avon"
good,"- Atingir as metas de vendas do setor, volume e positivação."
good,"If you know how to sell, then Avon is a known company that has years in the industry. Selling cosmetics and soap, Avon also trys to have some thing for everybody in your family. The sales approach to Avon is not sneaky, but direct and honest. You can go door to door and or have fun parties with your co-workers, friend and family. it is a good way to make a few extra bucks to making it a career."
good,"Avon is a company for people that want to have their own business but, don't want to put out thousands and thousands of dollars. You put out a small fee and then you get to be an independent contractor. I do feel very empowered with Avon. I would definitely say this is a company for women, who want to feel like they have something and can make their own way in this world. It is a fantastic company."
good,Get to make friends and sell some excellent items not just make up but clothes and lots more and receive gifts and discount on ur orders. You also get help from ur up line if u ever get stuck on what u need to do .
good,"it is fun working and interacting with colleagues and clients. l learned to work as an individual and also as a team. management is just superb. the hardest thing in working in that company is getting to market your products to clients as yous must explain and convince the client to place an order. the most enjoyable part of the job is getting more clients, customer satisfaction  and good service delivery."

good,"being work at home allows you to work at your own pace and hours, so you can do it when you want, and how you want. now that avon is now online, you can run your own digital home based business without having to host a party. the easiest part is lodging orders and the hardest? well, the hardest part is keeping up with orders at xmas time!"
good,"trabaje desde casa, pero aprendí mucho a tratar bien a los clientes."
good,"i would come in and be posted to a certain job flow, start first on trays, then on the line on station 23, then go to labeling. bosses would pull me off the line to help others to keep the line going, then i would run back to my line and get all orders out, i learned alot of team work here, i love jumping in and helping other people, the hardest part of the job is when i got layed off, i really enjoyed this job, i love the rush of being busy, my bosses really liked me"

good,Un lavoro molto gestibile perchè puoi gestire il tempo e parte difficile vendere e trovare nuovi clienti
good,This is a good job to work if you are looking to advance in your entrepreneur skills and you like working for your self and with customers. This is commission based and does require you to go and get sales.
good,Being my own boss was fun..Got to try different products. Selling wasn't easy but at least I had fun doing it. I loved the jewelry and perfume samples.
good,"making sure that everything is up-to-date respecting my job as to know my duty , I have learned a lot about patience and how to have a good relationship with people/customers . I have learned to manage my time very well and be a good communicator as to sell the products .my hardest part of my job was customers who didn't want to pay. The most enjoyable part of my job was convincing customers to purchase the product which was just water under the bridge and doing new challenges everyday"
good,"Absolutely love working for Avon."
good,Me gusta trabajar en esta empresa por la facilidad de horarios y por el manejo del tiempo y me gusta las compañeras que tengo y el apoyo que recibo de mi Gerente

good,"When I joined Avon I discovered a wonderful world of beauty where I learned all secrets of healthy skin, the magnetism of scents, the value of perfect lip and eyes, breathtaking stories of women, their dreams, passions and motivation. I was filled with endless enthusiasm and deep personal pride to be part of such great company. Empowering women were truly a unique privilege and responsibility"
good,"you can sell anytime, anywhere with Avon. I sell mainly to friends and family. I get orders via text messages, phone calls and on my personal avon website. There really isn't a hard part to selling avon, but returns are a little annoying. I enjoy my dicounts and seeing whats new every couple of weeks when I receive my orders. There are also awards and prizes you can win for making alot of sales. All of my managers have been very helpful whenever I had any questions."
good,"•	Increased opportunities for repeat sales through providing outstanding service and by developing expert knowledge of company products and services. "
good,"It pays for my make up, and other household things, and allows me to make my own schedule. I can dedicate the time I want. I have a few loyal customers, which I like having a small amount to deal with at the moment. I order brochures and customer items, do inventory, pack them, and deliver to towns closer to healdsburg."
good,Avon is great company with wonderful core values and great benefits.  They have a very good management model and upper management is well involved in all aspects of the business.
good,"Avon le brinda a la mujer la oportunidad de desarrollar un negocio, independiente y rentable, que le permite alcanzar su independencia económica y ayudar a su entorno familiar, incluso en lugares donde no existen otras posibilidades de éxito."
good,"A typical day in this business consisted of talking with customers, and potential customers. Taking orders, placing orders and fulfilling orders. Customer service was a big part. Keeping the customer happy always the most important."
good,"Superei meus limites, mas não pude ficar, pois era comissionada e tinha filhos pequenos, então saí.... Mas foi a empresa que me fez conhecer o mercado de trabalho. Agradeço a Avon por isso."
good,I did this part time from home and frankly did not put much effort into the work.

good,"Muitas ligações diárias, visitas."
good,"Mi trabajo consiste en vender y asesorar en los productos que ofrezco, tanto por vía telefónica, venta a puerta fría o  así como en reuniones para captación de posibles clientes."
good,"Avon is a company that teaches you how to run a small business. You decide your own fate with the company. How it works is Avon sends you their catalogs, you find your own clientele, they place orders, you manage the ordering and product delivery to customers, manage money, and then do it again in two weeks. I felt Avon was a good experience. I personally did not have a good time with it but not because of the company. I had customers place an order and never pick it up. As an Avon rep you are responsible for paying for everything however they do have a return process. Avon had perks. You made money based on how much product you sold. This was great because it's where I bought all my makeup. Avon really is a good experience. Responsibility and self motivation are two key components of the job."
good,This is a great part time hobby but it can be challenging finding new customers in a small town.
good,Ottimo lavoro perché offre la possibilità di gestire in completa autonomia sia il guadagno che l'orario di lavoro.
good,"make your own hours and goals"
good,"Aprendemos a lidar melhor com as pessoas de fora sabendo fazer um bom atendimento, trabalhava-mos todos os dias, tinha uma boa direção a empresa, todos n ós colegas de trabalhas não tinha-mos problemas uns com os outros até por que a zona de serviço não era igual, a parte mais difícil era  ter que andar embaixo de sol fazendo cobranças, as vezes tinha clientes que atrasava o pagamento e nó que tinha-mos que pagar e a parte mais agradável e que fazia-mos muitas amizades e ganhava-mos o carinho de muita gente"
good,"Avon was a great place to work. I went to work every day to a job that I loved. This is where i learned to drive all of the powered vehicles. My co-workers were like family to me. Working with the same people over 10 years, you develop a good relationship with them. My job was very physically demanding. Sometimes the packages weighed up to 100 pounds. I liked the feeling at the end of the day knowing that i had accomplished something so large."
good,good company to work for but you have to put in 1000% all the time to reep the rewards
good,"I'm a self starter. I work on the Avon Representative accounts when they call in.  Some functions would be Price Adjustment, Fundraising, Leadership, Top Producers, and perform various tasks to assist our sellers."
good,"Since I am an independent sales representative, the work place is of course ideal.  I work from home, set my own hours and meet new people every day.  I love it."
good,I would make the product up put it in the right containers then i will pack the product and send it out
good,I finally have customers on Avon and it's really warming that this is my opportunity to communicate with other people by giving them time to choose what to order
good,Helping people with cosmetics and body care.  Work your own hours and meet a lot of great people.
good,a good place to work and friendly i liked my job and my team leaders and managers and the agencys i worked for
good,"My typical day at work would be to drive to different locations in and around the city to pass out the Avon booklets of the company. I enjoyed communicating with different business about letting me leave some of my booklets with them. I often would go door to door also. The hardest part of the job would be that there was none only that the fact of collecting the money after a sale when on numerous occasion a client would not have the money by a set date. So it is time consuming in these situations. The most enjoyable part of the job was making a sale. What I learned from being an independent sales representative. I learned that it can be a competitive job in order to make it to the top in this business. Being that I was ambitious and enthusiastic, I did a fantastic job."
good,"favoreceu muito para meu desenvolvimento profissional e pessoal, foi gratificante ter a oportunidade de trabalhar em uma empresa Multinacional Americana do porte da Avon."
good,"Fui a Reunião para Revendedoras.onde me encontrei com minha gerente de vendas.ela me instruiu sobre os novos produtos,aprendi muito com minhas colegas, onde debatemos muito sobre os benefícios de cada produto,e formas de vendas"
good,"making sure that i got all the orders right. i learned that all of my customers loved me as sales representative. my boss was a very loving personand my co-workers were my fellow sales representative. unpacking the boxes and putting all the products in the right customer bags, and dating all the books and putting my name on them. knowing that my customers were staying with me because i was a very good sales representative."
good,"This is an independant position. I utilized the onine business to suppliment my income over the years. I learned how to manage a small client base and keep relationships for years with them. I think doing the ""parties"" and actually making cash instead of product deals was harder than I expected. The regional meetings were wonderful at times depending on who was the manager at the time."
good,"podía trabajar en las mañana o en las tardes, aprendí a intercambiar opiniones con los demás y a vender, conocí personas luchadoras y lo que mas me gusto fue que me divertía y a la vez ganaba por mis ventas"
good,my co-workers i always have developed a close bond but yet professional enviorment at the work place there has always been a place and a time for everything.
good,es una buena oportunidad para relacionarse con personas y sacar personalidad nos ayuda a crecer y formarnos como personas sociables.
good,"Variety was the theme of the day. Never knew what would be waiting for me when I went in which made it very interesting. Management was hard to get information from or hard to find because we were involved all over the plant. Most of the co-workers were great and they would come to me if they needed something or sometimes just to vent. I covered the Quality lab, Processing, and temporarily in Maintenance. Also interacted with FDA visits. The only overall rating your website will take is five stars but I would only rate the a three overall."
good,"i get to do avon on my own time, i get to work from home, easy to understand, manageable"
good,A typical day working with Avon is I set my own hours and work on the phone and computer alot I visit with my customers and have developed friendships with them. This is a great part time job for me because I do not miss things with my family.
good,"I had the opportunity to gain great sales experience. I promoted a variety of new Avon products bi-weelky. Self- employed position, but opportunity to grow within the company as well. Commission based Salary. Make your own schedule."
good,"I was responsible for overnight replenishment, where I would open boxes that were unloaded place them on hangers as needed size them and stock them throughout the store in the proper location. I would also take any excess product and place in the proper back stock location. I was also responsible for general clean-up duties."

good,"Aprendí a relacionarme con mas gente, a facturar por Internet."
good,Si è bello ma vai a provvigione 20€30€ questo è il guadagno non è uno stipendiko
good,"Buen sueldo y comisiones, excelentes prestaciones, desgastante ya que no tienes un horario fijo y el ritmo de trabajao es acelerado, pero esta perfecto si te gusta las ventas en campo , para mi el mejor empleo que he tenido."
good,"Uma empresa que pensa nos funcionários, boa alimentação, bons benefícios,reconhecimento dos funcionários."
good,There was always something to do during the day. It was a fast paste environment but with familiar faces that made work enjoyable because relationships with the customers were formed and better understood one another.
good,"A Avon Cosméticos  explora o potencial da revendedora, uma vez que esta precisa correr atrás de clientes para que possa ter sucesso nas vendas. O trabalho pode ser facilmente atrelado à vida pessoal, devendo ser observados apenas os requisitos de organização e tempo. O salário se define conforme a venda mensal, então no início é tida uma estabilidade de acordo com a vivência e experiencia de cada uma das revendedoras. A empresa integra cada um de seus representantes aos respectivos revendedores e está sempre inovando em produtos, linhas e em contato e condições de venda melhores para com os funcionários."
good,Muy buen ambiente laboral ! Bien remunerado pero no te ofrecen una estabilidad ya que son 6 meses de contrato sin posibilidad de efectivizacion
good,"El porcentaje de comisión  es muy bajo pero bueno, por algo se comienza."
good,"With Avon, you're your own Boss. That can be good or bad depending on the type of person you are. However, you can be on other leaders teams as well. Avon is very competitive and is great for someone who needs flexible hours and can manage time and money well. I wish I would've been able to interact with the company managers more but time is money. Let's face it, we all need money."

good,"Uma ótima empresa ."
good,"Great people to work with, gave tips on how to approach people making sales door to door and easy to follow tips on hosting successful book shows."
good,"It's fantastic if you want to work full time from home. I'm not that kind of person, so for me it's more of making a very small amount of pocket change. It's nice to go out and meet more people. although it can be rather disheartening to hear rejections often, but once you find a customer they're usually very loyal and will often buy something every campaign. It can be hard to establish a strong customer base, but you just gotta keep at it and it's doable."
good,"Es una de las muy pocas empresas que hacen sentir muy bien a sus trabajadores y los premian por su buen desempeño en el trabajo .si yo me retire fue por motivos ,que estube trabajando para una servis y no directamente para la empresa y no era lo mismo (sueldo).Pero me hubiese encantado trabajar directamente para AVON."
good,"Ofrecer a los clientes los productos de esta empresa obteniendo una importante cantidad de productos vendidos y ganancias, obteniendo así gran facilidad de palabra y conocimiento en ventas, me dio gran satisfacción al tener mi propio negocio y al mismo tiempo conocer mas personas."

good,"Mi dia a dia en el trabajo de AVON era independiente, solo tenia que mandarles el pedido para recibir los cosmeticos. Aprendí mucho a relacionarme con los clientes para atraerlos a que compraran."
good,"Good company for beginners, Average salary but good work life balance. However, manaement & company rules/regulations keeps changing every quarter"
good,"A Empresa Avon cosméticos  é uma ótima empresa, só tenho coisas boas para falar dessa empresa ,o tempo em que fiquei la fui muito valorizada eles valorizam muito os funcionários ,era um ambiente muito agradável e gostoso de trabalhar ,tanto a chefe como os lideres em geral sempre respeitaram a todos e dividia o serviço de acordo com desempenho de cada um ,o mais legal de tudo é que no meu setor eramos todos muito unidos nos ajudavamos sempre tentendo fazer o melhor para empresa ,consegui aprender muitas coisas relacionadas a logística como separação de produtos na linha de produção ,estoque ,inventários e digitação de produtos devolvidos. entre outras atividades na minha área,a parte mais difícil do serviço era pegar caixas pesadas e a parte mais agradável do trabalho era de separação na linha e na devolução"
good,"A typical day involves delivering brochures, mainly to offices in my local area and a few neighborhood homes. The brochures must be stamped with identifying information. 3-5 days later, I contact the people I gave a brochure too and remind them it is order time and attempt to take their order. I also send out reminder e-mails to many customers. After taking all orders, I submit them on-line by a certain date. 2 days later, my order is delivered and I organize and sort it into individual orders, preparing the customer's invoice to accompany. I then make calls or e-mail to let the customer know when I will make delivery and what their total will be. I typically divide my deliveries into two days and often take around a box of ""clearance items"" (returned goods) that have been marked down for quick sale. (cash and carry). My customers seem to appreciate my consistency and know what to expect from me as their personal representative and the value of Avon products with a 100% money back guarantee."
good,"A empresa em si era boa ,mas não tinhamos tanto apoio dos funcionários efetivos."
good,"I loved the fast pace environment.I've learned quality and timing to achive cut times for representative orders. management is great and professionally succesfull in pushing acurate orders daily. my co workers are like family, easy to talk to with minimum issues that will arise. The hardest part of the job is falling behind and trying to get on pace to meet goals for the day. The most enjoyable part of the day is when I can go home after a hard days work knowing I did my best in achieving the days work.."
good,"uma empresa muito conhecida pelos seus produtos, mais um trabalho que precisa contar com a sorte,"
good,"A day at work consists of putting order forms in brochures and then posting them to my allocated territory. Brochures will then be collected a week after and any orders will be uploaded to the Avon website and then ordered and sent to my house. Then, the orders are packaged and sent to the customers."

good,I have no issues with the company I love avon I just wasn't making enough money to survive on
good,"tinha muitas clientes, sou comunicativa e tenho facilidade pra lidar com as pessoas"
good,es un trabajo con excelentes posibilidades el unico inconveniente en que me siento estancada y sin posibilidad de avanzar por que es un producto con mucho oferta y muy poca demanda
good,"write out order forms ,deliver brouchures,online ordering,sorting products etc"
good,"Avon allows they're workers to work around their own lifestyle, when being an Avon Representative it is your own responsibility to go out to work.  If you don't work you don't get paid.  And the more you work, and the more effort you put in to working for Avon, the more money and the more benefits you get back."
good,"our daily routine is to follow up our downlines by text and  call brigade make sure they know the promos, offers and schedule of training for the day , for the week and for the month. We motivate them to ensure higher sales. The overall job was enjoyable except that now we are not fully compensated enough because of the new marketing scheme.  The recognition part and the sales bonuses was d best. `"

good,"Maintain and check product location to ensure merchandise is in bin, if not I will place an order and when order is filled, I will use forklift to pick up merchandise from the warehouse.  I have learned how to be efficient in placing orders and maintain quality and stock levels.  I work very close with management daily and communicate with coworkers about product levels.   The hardest part of my job is maintaining high quality levels and error free product.  The most enjoyable part is working with others and able to see the good end results of doing my job daily."
good,"Gosto de revender para essa empresa mesmo trabalhando registrada, mas nas minhas horas vagas pretendo continuar revendendo."
good,"A typical day at Avon is basically writing my order forms, delivering my brochures to customers on time and then making sure they are all collected in on time then give out again to more customers. Then also making sure all data from orders is put in to the system and sent off on time. Then when the order arrives a couple of days later making sure all stock has arrived and sorting each customers orders out and making sure they are delivered on time. On a day to day basis at Avon I learn to be more confident within myself, I learn more about products and how they work and I also learn more about the business its self. Working with Avon gives me the chance to be my own boss as I am responsible to make sure everything goes to plan and everything is done by the correct dates set. I enjoy being a local Avon representative because I get to meet new people everyday and I get to make them happy by introducing them to new products that suit their needs."

good,"o dia normal de trabalho é na rua ,abordamos pessoal para oferecer que elas entrem como revendedoras da empresa,com essa função aprendi que não existe não consigo alcançar metas e sim não tento ou não procuro...qualquer serviço requer boa vontade e determinação ,a parte mais difícil do trabalho é convencer as pessoas a comprar o kit de trabalho inicial que não é caro mas é necessario ,a parte mais legal do trabalho é que faço meu horario e tenho tempo pra cuidar da minha família"
good,"Gostava muito do meu trabalho, o realizava com muita satisfação, tinha ótimos colegas de trabalho, aprendi inclusive á trabalhar em equipe e trabalhar com metas e objetivos. A parte mais difícil era apresentar os relatórios de produção, pois nem sempre saíam como desejávamos, devido quebra de máquinas, dentre outros problemas, que acabavam por acarretar o resultado da produção do dia. A parte mais agradável era o trabalho que realizava, pois apreciava o que eu fazia."

good,"It a part time "
good,"This was the first job I ever had. Working here was very relaxing and I always felt at ease. The manager was very nice. The only reason I ended up leaving the job was because she could only afford to pay one worker, and I was still in HS while the other worker was able to work full time."

I learned business skills with Avon.The management is quite friendly and understanding. I do not have an office I am my own boss working at home.The hardest part is when you make less profit in a particular month.The most enjoyable part is when you win a competition.
good,Adoro trabalhar como vendedora externa da Avon.mas devido a grande quantidade de vendedora na minha cidade o lucro não é lã essas coisa mais ajuda um pouco.sem falar nas promoções que mi ajuda a garantir os produtos para meu uso pessoal.
good,"With Avon you are your own boss, you work the hours you want you make as much as you want. Avon pretty much sales itself but in order for you to keep your clients you must be good at representing what you're selling."
good,Really friendly and cooperative staff. Good work life balance. Beautiful office space and great design work for a creative individual who likes to be challenged.
good,"He aprendido a relacionarme mas con las personas, a ser mas extrovertida y me encanta vender y comprar los productos de esta empresa"

good,"Ser uma revendedora é muito legal, poder participar e fazer parte de uma coisa que todas nos precisamos aliás.. Não existe mulher feia existe mulher que nao conhece os produtos Avon."
good,Working at Avon has been a great experience. It mostly involves sales by catalog so I was able to start out at a young age helping my  mom with her sales. Now I'm able to sale as a independent representative and the products basically sell themselves. All it takes is showing the catalogs to people and promoting the right products based on their likes and personalities.
good,"A forward thinking company who invest time and training in their employees, ensuring they have the skills to perform the activities required of them."
good,"Reunion con la lider y supervisoras y compañeras en el hotel sussex de nuestra ciudad, cada quince dias. Festejo de metas , evaluaciones, practicas."
good,"I enjoyed working for Avon for some time, gave me the chance to go out and meet new people, the job was very occupying and kept me busy, but the job started to get even complicated because no one was buying from Avon, so I stopped working for Avon and I wanted a new challenge."
good,"No estoy contratada por Avon directamente,por eso no disfruto de sus beneficios,una compania de inyectarsele dinero en cambio de imagen y concepto"
good,"O setor onde eu ficava era bem corrido e não dava tempo nem para beber água, abastecia maquina de separação de materiais. No setor não consegui aprender nada, pois somente era abastecer a máquina."

good,I love Avon because it gives me the opportunity to meet new people. I am able to focus on my studies and duties at home and still be successful.
good,A typical day at work consists of reviewing my customers orders and making sure it is all correctly organized and ready to be sent for payment. I manage my own business which involves door to door sales and trying to collect different customers so I can earn money. The hardest part of the job is if a delivery is late and I have to tell my customers which means time is wasted and people get frustrated. I soon solve the situation and quickly put my customer service knowledge into place which makes my customers happy. The most enjoyable part of the job is showing people what sort of products I have available and showing samples. I also love to meet new customers.
good,"Tudo o que me foi prometido,foi cumprido."
good,I truly love what I di. I help independent representatives build and grow their business. It's very rewarding. I have great support. My district consists of 500 independent representatives. I'm one of top performers in my division.
good,"Uma empresa boa para se trabalhar,com bons benefícios, pessoas legais para se trabalhar."
good,"Um dia com uma grande demanda de trabalho."
good,"a typical day for me is delivering brochures, then picking them a few days later then redistribute. once a month i put orders on the system wait for the delivery a week later i  then do my deliveries to my customers. Once all deliveries are done i then work out my percentage and pay Avon the rest."
good,Es un trabajo un poco dificil ya que es buscando clientes diferentes  cada dia para convencerlos y compren de los productos. Aprendi que hay que ser una persona consistente para este tipo de trabajo.En parte era comodo ya que el tiempo de trabajo es elegible. Lo dificil era cobrarle a los clientes ya que algunos no tienen el dinero a tiempo y tendrias que pagar de lo que has Ganado.. Lo mas que disfrutaba eran las entregas de productos a los clientes.  Se siente bien verlos satisfechos
good,Taking orders from customers for avon products.  I like to teach customers how to use products for personal use.  I have never met my management.  I work alone as a personal representative.  The hardest thing is to get sales in todays economy.  I love that I get to meet people on a daily basis.
good,"The day I started, an Avon rep came to my house to talk me through what the job would entail and what areas I would be covering.I found this extremely helpful and the woman was very friendly. The woman gave me her mobile number so if I ever need any help with a customer inquiry she'll talk me through it. The main role of the job in to find customers that would be interested in the Avon cosmetics (as I go to a beauty college i have a lot of friends/teachers that are interested in the products) and sell them products for commission. The hardest part of the job is finding new customers that you don't know in your local area, that don't already have an Avon representative or are interested in Avon's products."
good,This position is for someone who is willing to work in sales. You have to establish clients and treat your business as a full-time job. Customers like personal attention and exceptional service. Avon provides lots of free online training to learn about the products and how to run the business. It takes effort and willingness to keep on going when things are slow.
good,"A typical day at work I hand our brochures, ask if any of my clients is searching for a certain item, if so, I assist them with finding the best product that works best for them and their budget."
good,I love being a Avon Representative first of all because they support a lot of good causes to help others in the community .I also has great sells products and customer service .Avon is an all together place .I love ya Avon.
good,"I just celebrated my 4yr anniversary as an Avon Independent Sales Rep.  You have to think of your Avon business like a plant.  If you don't take care of it it will die!!  You have to be willing to talk to strangers.  Brush off the ""No thank yous"" and take GOOD care of your customers.  Avon customers are some of the MOST DEDICATED people you will find!  I LOVE to get new customers BUT I also LOVE to hear, ""I've been ordering from the same Avon lady for __yrs"".  I have a downline, which means I make a commission off of their sales.  The idea is to help new reps build their business like you are building yours.  Then it's a win win for everybody.  I have signed probably 200+ people since I started in Leadership.  I have a solid team of 59 reps.  These people are dedicated to their ""plant"".  They take care of their customers and we are all making money.  FYI, I just took 1st place for sales in my district....YOU CAN MAKE $$$ SELLING AVON!!  You have to realize, there is work involved and you have to learn to deal with peoples quirky natures. "
good,To work at Avon I feel that I have learned to be organized and how to handle cash on a daily basis. I get along with other representatives that I have met and like to attend meetings with them whenever I can. the hardest part of the job is reaching the amount where I can start getting comminsion and the most fun part is meeting and gaining new customers.
good,It was fun meeting new people and making people feel good about themselves. It was also nice to be able to help people shop from home due to being unable to shop in the traditional manner.
good,Era muito bom adorava mesmo mas era por contrato de 3 meses e foi prorrogado por mais 3 meses .
good,Uma empresa que se preocupa com a beleza e ao mesmo tempo com a saúde da mulher.
good,"As an AVON sales representative, I contact customers and have lots of face-to-face contact. During my time as a sales representative I have learned how to handle money, handle products and deal with complaints. During a typical day, I will collect order forms from customers and I will add them to my own online order form and submit the form to AVON so that they know what products to deliver to my house. Once the products have been delivered I will bag them and deliver them to the correct customers. I will then collect money for the order and send it back to AVON. The management staff and area staff are extremely helpful and are ready to help at any time. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing how happy customers are with their products upon delivery."
good,Il lavoro di presentatrice avon è splendido perchè hai la piena libertà di gestirti i tuoi orari come più ti piacciono e sopratutto puoi lavorare da sola senza avere interferenze con magari colleghi che non sono tanto simpatici cosa che magari accade in un ufficio.
good,"I love working for Avon, because I get to meet new people everyday. I enjoy the group meetings, and learning new things. Overall I get satisfaction by meeting my customers needs."
good,"O dia de trabalho era muito estressante, mas tinha suas horas boas."
good,"Eu revendia os produtos dentro de casa, realizava as reuniões de demonstrações em casa e só saia na hora das distribuição dos pedidos, onde eu aproveitava para conquistar mais clientes..."
good,"A typical day would include spending a couple of hours looking for new representatives by speaking to all types of people, then I would meet those people and spend an hour training with them for their first training session, then I would need to contact other representatives by telephone and help to resolve any problems they may have. I have learned never to judge anyone and that all people need to be offered the chance to work, and also to be able to recognise management potentiality in people, also to listen to peoples problems and to help where I can but to acknowlege when it is time to let them stand on their own two feet and support them  a bit less, The hardet part of the job is the knockbacks when you have worked really hard with a representative to help her grow and then she suddenly decides to leave. The most enjoyable part of the job is when someone says thankyou for your help and support and lets me know that they appreciate me being there for them"
good,"Empresa altamente dinâmica com boas oportunidades de crescimento, premiações, e incentivos para seus colaboradores."
good,"Es un buen trabajo de forma independiente tu organizas tus tiempos, las ventas son variables.-"
good,"Levantarme. Hacer las cosas del hogar; dejar la tarde libre para trabajar, salir con los folletos y visitar."

good,"Valoriza os funcionários, gratifica com bônus e viajem quando os objetivos são alcançados, cultura e valores presentes em tudo."

good,Its realy good work ...earn extra money from seeling avon products.Co worker really kind and the most thing i enjoy avon is when i meet new people and make friends with them.
good,"Me gustan los retos, el contacto con la gente, un trabajo dinamico donde hay que expresar tu creatividad, donde es remunerado justamente, el reconocimiento y el crecimiento diario, donde se trabaja con valores. Aprendi, que si quieres lograr algo te va a costar, pero la satisfaccion es increible, la parte mas dificil es cuando sientes que el reloj no tiene mas horas y lo que mas me gusto cuando se llega a la meta propuesta es una satisfaccion economica y emocional"
good,Very good at trying to understand internal management and org effectiveness needs.
good,"Aprendi muito a lidar com o publico, com vendas hoje tenho mais amizades com meus clientes ,para mim no começo pensei que ia ser complicado mas nao foi nao faço o que eu posso para ver meus clientes satisfeitos."
good,Com o dia á dia do trabalho comecei a trabalhar na conferencia e aprendir como conferia os produtos.
good,"Durante o período em que trabalhei para a Avon convivi com pessoas maravilhosas, com as quais consegui estabelecer vínculos fortes. Não tenho do que me queixar da minha gerente, pois ela é uma pessoa de fácil convívio e muito dedicada a empresa. Foi um trabalho que me permitiu colocar em prática muitas das partes administrativas, financeiras e contábeis da minha graduação, pois além de lidar diretamente com o público era imprescindível cumprir os prazos e metas estabelecidos. Na minha opinião a parte mais agradável e a mais difícil era a captação de novas revendedoras para a minha equipe pois ao mesmo tempo em que me dava a oportunidade de conhecer novas pessoas era um grande desafio conseguir aumentar a equipe em uma cidade com muitas executivas e um alto índice de inadimplêmcia."
good,"A very rewarding job, indeed!"
good,"Trabalhar das 14h30min as 22h30min, todos os dias tínhamos uma pausa de 15 minutos para a ginasticas na linha com um personal e 1 hora de janta. Para sair do setor era necessário avisar e deixar alguém no lugar. Pude ressaltar ainda mais meu lado de responsabilidade e compromisso. Possuía um bom relacionamento profissional com meus lideres colegas de equipe. Com tudo posso declarar somente coisas boas, a Avon me ajudou a crescer profissionalmente e me possibilitou uma grande experiência profissional que levarei por toda a vida."
good,"Uma empresa que respeita o fucionario,que não aceitar qualquer tipo de discordia,e ensina valores como honestide e humildade,todos nos aprendemos uma lição nessa empresa que e trabalhar sempre em grupo.Fomos bem direcionados pela gestão.A parte mais dificil e a responsabilidade de não errar pois eram muitos cordigos,aparte mais agradavel era os muitos treinamentos que tivemos,levo esse treinamentos ate hoje. Aprendi muito como profissional e pessoa nessa grande empresa."
good,"Every two weeks I call my customers for their orders. After that I type their orders into an Avon Computer program. I send my order in an electronic program and they process the orders. Four days later the order is delivered to my home. I set up all the orders and do some deliveries. I am in the Honor Society for several years. I had to sell $20,000 in the first 12 campaigns. I also have representatives who I have trained and are now selling Avon products on their own. I have learned many things about customer needs and how to meet their needs and what products they need."
good,"Ótimos benefícios.( fretado,sálario,convênio,restaurante)."
good,"eu adorava trabalhar com a equipe que eu comandava,a gerente era uma pessoa muito boa."
good,"Um rotina diária, era campo, das 8 da manhã até as 14hs meu trabalho e foco era fazer visitas e treinamentos as minhas revendedoras e Lideres de equipe, acompanhando e ensinando a arte de desenvolver vendas e personalizar nossas revendedoras."
good,Everyday we do conduct routine inspection/audit of assigned packaging lines to ensure that components finished ingredients and finished products conform to specifications.
good,"Avon products are a great, affordable varied line of products. I offered 20% discounts for pick-up at my business, which increased my sales base exponentially."
good,"I have been selling Avon for the last year to suppplement my income. I really enjoy it, as I work at my own pace and you really get out of it what you put in. My DM is always available when I need her, as well as other Reps if I feel that I am having a difficult time. As a part-time career, you really get to set it aside to focus on achieving work/life balance. The hardest part is constantly keeping my name out there, bringing in new clientele, because I can be very shy, however I feel the best sense of satisfaction when I am able to come through for those clients who have allergies, or experience skin sensitivity, or those who really just want my honest opinion and it turns out for the best!"
good,"É uma empresa que te da muitas oportunidades de crescimento,ela desenvolve muito bem o trabalho em equipe,e tenho muitas amigas nesse setor.Mas anceio por novas conquistas pelo fato que a remuneração ou ganhos consiste nas revendas e não é um salário fixo varia de acordo com as revendas.Tenho muita afinidades com a Gerente não tenho como pessoa do que reclamar,mais gostaria de poder estar conhecendo outras empresas e poder somar. Trabalho muito bem em equipe e se prescisar de ficar só também trabalho bem e gosto muito de lidar com o publico e quero continuar trabalhando e me áperfeiçoando nessa área ."
good,"As an Avon representative, I had to use my persuasive skills to sell products to my customers. It required a lot of time and face to face interaction, as well as commitment in order to achieve higher sales. I worked very well independently and this built my confidence and interpersonal skills, which is necessary as a sales assistant."
good,my most enjoyable part of Avon is helping people. A typical day of selling Avon is going out and handing out brouchures and talking to prospective clients.
good,"Since I was in high school during my time at AVON my hours were short but productive. As district manager assistant I was to do anything my district manager asked. I set up meetings with her colleagues, I cleaning the office, but mostly I acted as a receptionist. My main purpose was to contact AVON representatives to keep them posted on upcoming sales and remind of them of current balances owed. My co-workers and I worked together so that we could get done faster. I called about 300-400 people a day and sometimes more. The hardest part of the job was handling very upset representatives that spoke other languages. The most enjoyable part was working under my manager, I learned a lot about running a business. The pay was very low but the experience was worth it."
good,"As an administrative assistant I would typically make three to four appointments for my district sales manager to meet with representatives. I would then begin emailing or calling any reps to remind them of an upcoming events and deadlines. In this position I learned time management, organizational skills and appointment setting. I worked from home so my only co-worker was my boss and she was pretty fun. The hardest part of my job is calling reps and making them aware that they are late on their payments. The most enjoyable part of my job is having the opportunity to talk with many different people throughout my day."

good,A typical day would be delivering Avon brochures to new and old customers. What I have learned is that you really have to have an outgoing personality.

AVON has everything from men's cologne to make-up for women. Their wide range of products allowed me to reach almost everyone that I met. I find AVON more as a hobby than a job. Although, I do feel that over the last year I have learned much about sales, marketing, public speaking and finance tracking."

good,"The good thing about working for Avon is that you work in your spare time so whenever is best for  you. The job allows to meet different people and allows you to expand your own network, one of the disadvantages is that it is commissioned based so  you have to be sure to meet your targets."

good,"As a Avon representative you are able to make your own hours and pick your own days. Also get to work from home or on the go. There is a variety of products from makeup ,clothes ,shoes , also jewelry etc.. I went from door to door handing out avon books to boost my sales also had an account setup online. I even hosted parties for people to come and see exactly what avon was about , you could also buy some products or ask any questions about avon. The only downfall with avon was when people order a products that were on back order."
good,"I was able to show that I could sell things to others, with no problems, It was not a job required to work with others. The hardest part of the job was actually getting people to follow through and pay for their orders when they came in.

Porém a forma de recrutamento não é uma das melhores. Havendo muitas mudanças de profissionais, trabalhando apenas com contratos e ao fim do contrato sem chances de efetivaçao..."
good,It was a great place to work. Advancement takes a while due to many 15 year plus associates who have senority.

Its hard at the beginning finding the customers, but once your round is established its alot easier, that is providing your customers are in for delivery and always leave there book out.

So it was a lot  of fun at the time!! Hard tho if ur in it to make money but if only for enjoyment then yea it was good. Playing with invertory giving reviews and howtos, showing most recent liked products to Customers. Selling in groups is fun. Keeping up with product inventory  records. Doing makeup is fun for youth. Only sold MEETMARK products from their Magalogs tho not Avon Brochures. Famous for their launched line of hookup lipglosses that connect and you choose the combo. They really do stick to recent trends at least when I sold it I looked forward to the delivery's and the points and telling people and getting the new magalogs that come every 1-2 every month."

Every other week the order needs to be placed for the current brochure. A few days later the shipment arrives, I check in the merchandise and prepare it for delivery to my customers. It usually takes me two days to get the shipment all delivered to my customers.

good,"I loved doing Avon because I can sell as many products as people wanted and they would buy them, I would then take that amount of money out of my account and Avon would compensate me. Avon has a lot of really cheap make-up and items that are really cute and many people really like buying them. Some people buy them every day or monthly, etc. The only catch was having to find people who wanted to buy and that could pay upfront. I loved that I was my own boss/manager and my co-workers (the people I hired to help sell Avon) were all very flexible with the online work and did well with selling the items. The most enjoyable part of my job was the excited look my consumers would give me when recieving their products. It made me happy by making their day."

good,"I love being a representative its fun and easy to do, best of all you can set you own hours. The only downside is the fact it is commission based, if you do not make a certain amount you do not get your cut. A part from that I highly recommend it. If you love cosmetics, jewellery, perfume and meeting new and different people then I'd recommend signing up as a representative."

I distribute catalogs to my customers (family, friends, businesses, etc.), collect their orders and payments, submit those orders to Avon via our representative website, then distribute the orders when they arrive. I also schedule events as a vendor within the community. I participate in one-time events and also recurring events. An example of a one-time event would be a benefit. As a recurring vendor, I take Avon to a nearby residential home for the elderly."

Minhas vendas aumentaram e muitas pessoas me procuram para comprar produtos e perguntar como fazem para revender .São incríveis as oportunidades que a Avon me deu e as portas que mim abriu.

good,"En general, muy acogedoras las líderes, puedes hacerte tu propio horario pero las comisiones son muy bajas. Por ejemplo le haces por campaña más de 50.000 a la empresa y tu comisión es 12.000. Lo encuentro bajo por que una es la que está pateando calles para vender, hacer malabares para entregar los productos y que te pague la gente. Para quien se inicia en su vida laboral está bien para aprender a ser organizada y llevar las finanzas pero no sirve para levantar un hogar económicamente."
good,The hardest part of the job was trying to find costumers that wanted anything with avon. A lot of people did not want to get involved due to constant emails and the constant bugging of the representative.
good,"excelente empresa, preocupada com o colaborador. "
good,"A minha noite de trabalho na avon é resumida em entrar na estação onde fica os produtos para separação,o leitor le o codigos da caixa e eu apago a luz e pego o produto."
good,"A typical day at work as an Avon Representative for me  is a combination of contacting customers, taking orders, delivering orders, attending group meetings or conference calls. I have learned how to work independently or in group, how to coach a team and have become unit leader. I do have to say that district 5111 as a whole is a great team to work with! The hardest part of the job is deciding if I want to work from home that day or out in the field. The most enjoyable part of this job is being able to help each customer with his or her unique needs."
good,"I enjoy doing Avon and I have also built up a lot of confidence and communication skill by going to customers doors. I deliver Avon book to customers doors, I go back a couple of days later to collect the book but if they are not finished with the book I go back another day, I gather all the orders together when it is ready to be sent, I log onto the Avon website and enter each product into the computer to make orders, I place the order, when the orders come I then look at the customer’s order form and gather up all the items that they have ordered and put them into a bag with their order form attached to it, I then go out and deliver the orders to the customers, I collect all the money in and then pay the invoice when all the money is collected in."
good,"Quem quer trabalhar na AVON deve ter muito tempo, pois há muito trabalho, como também há muitos bônus e brindes."
good,"Worked daily with over 500 AVON Representatives helping them to grow their AVON business financially.  I learned a lot about people and what motivates them and what doesn't.   One thing learned is that in order to get people to do what you need them to do, you need to lead by example and inspire them.  You need to help them figure out the ""why"" in what they do...what is the reason, the ""BIG WHY"" that they are even doing what they do?  I worked with some great Managers and we were more of a family than a Team.  My Representatives became very close to me and it was a real pleasure seeing them excel in their business and reach their personal goals.  Although, the job was very challenging and was truly a 24/7 job, it was extremely rewarding and I loved the challenge and the stress!  It was one of the best jobs I've ever had and taught me a lot."

The company provided many sales opportunities and provided excellent venues for winning trips.  Enjoyed a few trips to the Bahamas and Mexico and Key West."
good,"It was a job were you only worked by yourself or with one other person from your own home or environment which was very nice. A typical day was usually taking customers orders, writing up receipts and on shipping days send it off, wait for the order to come in then deliver their items safely. You were you own boss so you had to make sure that you kept everything in order and accounted for so that everyone could be happy. The hardest part of the job was trying to remember all your customers sine you met new people everyday. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to meet new people everyday and making the happy, and using all the information you know to help them make good buying decisions."
good,its fun at work meeting new people.i learned to be successful in retail.manager is the greatest and kind soul.co-workers also nice.the hardest part was people saying not interested in buying stuff.the most fun has to be meeting new people.

The hardest part of the job is to find and obtain clients, however, once you've got them its easy and important to maintain them. The part of my job that I enjoy the most is that I can make money buy selling products to clients and the ability to have my own team of Independent Sales Representatives. A typical day at work is walking around and getting people I meet interested in Avon and hand out brochures, when a client orders from them they are ordering from my ""store"" and my job is to delivery their products one time. Having a job through Avon is perfect for stay at home mums, people who enjoy travelling, and students saving up to go to college. The job is flexible as you get to set your own hours."

good,"My daily routine was to knock on the doors on the streets and areas given by my manager until we complete the area we were given another area to work on. Basically I learned to socialise with those people who intend to be my regular customer, and for those who didn't want to I still encouraged them to see the latest products and so on. I managed to earn well enough commission on the basis of how many customers I was be able to face and intend to make. It really just depended on how much customers you make. I had other Avon representative who worked with me and we managed to work together in the places given. The hardest part of the job was to make as much as customer I could to earn a lot of profit. I really think I enjoy working as a Avon representative because I had my family and friends support, from them I made a lot of commission."

good,"Na Avon era uma delicia de emprego, amei trabalhar com cosmeticos, sempre ganhavamos brindes da empresa como maquiagem, bolsa, sapatos, qual mulher não gostaria? Então lá eu cumpri meu primeiro emprego, aprendi tudo sobre recepção de clientes, trabalhar em grupo, lidar com problemas rotineiros tais como, um cliente insatisfeito, uma revendedora insatisfeita, e ter aquele ""jogo de cintura"" para controlar a situação e resolver o problema. Eu gostei muito de tudo q eu vivi dentro desta empresa. Minha saída foi por ser apenas contrato, pois a Avon não registra funcionários de Gerentes, e minha gerente não tinha firma aberta, então fui em busca de algo melhor para minha carreira profissional."
good,"Aprendir muito sobre vendas,e a falar em publico,convencer as pessoas a comprar."
good,"AVON is a GREAT company that makes many people a lot of money. I met many wonderful people through AVON and loved that I was in charge of myself and could work my own hours. It was wonderful to not have to miss out on any of the special moments with my son and my family. Unfortunately I heard a lot of the same responses when trying to get customers.... I love AVON but I already have a representative. I was not out to steal anyone elses customers and all though I had great support from my friends and family I was never able to make enough money to cover the expences to keep my business alive. No one should have to pay to work for someone else, so I learned quickly that this job was not for me."

Avon was one of the best companies to work for. I liked my co-workers and supervisor. We all worked well together and we made a great team.

good,En esta empresa aprendí a dejar a un lado el temor de hablar con otras personas y a ofrecer un producto. En ventas por catalogo se debe tener en cuenta que producto vas a ofrecer si hay facilidades de pago que productos salen más económicos para la adquisición entre campaña y campaña. Lo más dificil es la busqueda de clientes ya que unos son buenas pagas y otros no tanto.

good,I was only young when i helped out witht the avon buisness but from what i remeber it was a fun thing to do in spare time and i liked helping my mum and grandmother with the orders.
good,"Avon is a great employer with wonderful and friendly atmosphere. A perfect company for people in their 40. and 50. who are looking for a very calm position with day to day tasks. However... there is no willingness to change the processes, make the communication easier. Lot of time is wasted on preparing presentations, which are not even reviewed. That might be a wonderful and competetive company but with the slow pace of work they loose with the other brands in the markets (even if the quality of Avon's cosmetics is way better)."
good,"A typical day with Avon is selling products and recruiting."
good,"A empresa tem por característica um modelo diferenciado na área comercial por ter como base a Venda Direta, o que obriga que seus colaboradores e executivos tenham uma postura pró-ativa na solução de problemas, definição de estratégias e implementação de projetos.

good,"A empresa era agradável para se trabalhar."
good,"Chegava passava o turno falávamos sobre como estava a linha se tinha muito produtos faltando se teve paradas qual seria a meta do dia, logo após logava na linha olhava a quantidade de produtos que tinham na caixa se estava tudo certo para começar, começava a montar os kits quando precisava abastecia e fazia pedido dos produtos que estavam faltando sempre com agilidade e preocupada em fazer tudo certo, aprendi a ter mais agilidade, respeito com a empresa e suas normas, a ter mais paciência aprendi que gosto de ser útil e ajudar sempre que preciso e gosto de apender um pouco de tudo na empresa sobre os equipamentos principalmente. Sobre a direção ou gerência não tenho o que falar pois nunca tive nenhum problema sempre que precisei me ajudaram, sempre tive um bom relacionamento com as pessoas com quem trabalhei muitas inda tenho contato, a parte mais difícil era quando faltava os produtos ou demorava muito tempo para chegar os produtos para o abastecimento à parte mais agradável era quando conseguíamos bater a meta da linha e quando as coisas davam certas, tive muito prazer em trabalhar e ter tido essa experiência para levar comigo."

good,Avon is a great company to work for. The products appeal to everyone. The company has great growth opportunities for all employees

good,"While working as a sales person with Avon, I learned how to become an entrepreneur. I learned how to manage others. A typical work day  consisted of me working independently. I would hand out brochures, do some up selling on products as well as recruit prospects. The most enjoyable part of the job was being recognized the hard work and dedication it took to grow a business. The hardest part was working off of residual income and not know sells would be."

My area manager was fab very helpful and always very positive, an inspiration to me. It was exciting to see what Avon would offer customers next as they always had special offers and purchasing incentives that my customers looked forward to. It was very sad when Avon decided to leave Ireland as it was a brand that everyone had come to love and rely on for there personal care regime, Both my customers and I took a while to accept that they were gone and we would have to find alternatives to products we has become use to."
good,"i enjoyed this to begin with, but slowely i realised not everyone wanted to buy things so i gave up cause i was not making much out off this and was probably spending more then earning."

good,"Empresa com foco no desenvolvimento de pessoas. Cultura empresarial muito boa e muito competitiva em salários e benefícios."
good,"I work for Avon in my spare time and it is commission based. It is helping me to earn my own pocket money on the side. I work from home and it doesn't take up a lot of time. I just have to distribute brochures to new and present costumers and take their orders, once I have collected orders I then send them over the website to the distributors and they send the goods to me. Once I have the goods in my possession then I have to sort them out and package them for each individual costumers. On delivery I collect the correct money then the company will tell me how much I have to send to them and how much I can keep for myself, the money that I keep myself is my wage which could vary from £20+.  I have learned by doing this job to be independent as I am working alone and also how to manage money. I don't find anything hard about this job and I find it highly enjoyable."

I also send out emails to all my current customers to let them know what's new that they can order. I place any orders that need to be put in that day. The hardest part of my job is making the kind of money I want to make. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that it has potential to be my own business.

With the amount of information I have with those products, I could probably sell more than I can imagine. The knowledge that you have with the products is what makes sales.

good,"As an Independent Representative, I get to work at home. I move from door to door distributing Avon leaflet. I have learned how to speak to potential customers, which has increased my interpersonal skills. My Senior Representative is always available to give me advice and help me through the process. However, salary is not always guaranteed. Sometimes customers might be interested in buying the product, but other times this might be otherwise. This reduces our commission. However, it is enjoyable to meet customers and gaining their trust, in order to make them my permanent customers."

Havia também uma reunião (um briefing) entre a liderança, supervisão e coordenação após a reunião com o time para traçarmos a estratégia do dia e os objetivos a alcançar. Aprendi sobre gestão de pessoas, gerenciamento de conflitos, sobre administração do tempo.  Como lá funciona como uma engrenagem e um setor depende do outro para atingir os resultados finais, a parte mais desafiadora era manter essa  sintonia e sinergia entre áreas, ás vezes direcionando colaboradores para auxiliar em outras áreas e também solicitando colaboradores para nosso auxílio e a parte mais gratificante era atingir as metas estipuladas e premiar os colaboradores."

La cosa più stimolante è l'ambiente che hanno saputo creare: giovani da tutte le parti del mondo, quasi tutti con Erasmus o esperienze di lavoro in differenti paesi. All'inizio è sicuramente complicato confrontarsi, negoziare, discutere con persone che hanno un provenienza culturale diversa, ma alla fine apre la mente e ti insegna veramente cos'è il lavoro di team."
good,"I sell at presidents club level and I am currently a Silver Ambassador in leadership. I only work 2 to 4 hours a week. I am a stay at home mom so taking care of my 2 1/2 year old daughter is top priority. In December 2016 I received a $2000 leadership bonus which was great for Christmas time. I typically earn between $600 and $1000 a month (not including leadership bonuses). Every campaign I add at least one team member and I give myself a raise. I am happy moving slow and steady, if you put in the hours selling business to business and fundraising you can make a lot of money. If you spend 40 hours a week you will grow your business quickly. I would not have any spending money if it was not for my Avon business. This is also a great business to help save money for college, a dream vacation, and put money away for retirement. I love the boss life :) "

I was able to keep in contact with the Sales Leaders if any problems were to arise. They were very helpful and patient, and helped me in any way they could to help me be more successful as a sales representative. The hardest part of my job was contacting the corporate office with delivery issues I was having. I had a couple incidences where  had to return products, and it was difficult to contact the people in charge of local deliveries to pick up these orders.

good,First setting up recorder for processing of wire transfer to customer and other business. Making sure the phone system were recording properly. I learn that you have to have compassion and love what you do. You must always listen to the customer but still complete your job at hand. Management was great in training. Co-worker was great but sometimes could be diva. The hardest part of the job is not being able to settle at the end of the day and coming in early to settle and make adjustments. I love the challenge and the customer it was always something new happening every day.
good,"i was a Beauty Advisor at AVON. i would advertise and demonstrate make-up on customers.working at AVON i have learned better ways to apply make-up and how to deal with a persons face in a proper manor.My co-workers were a big part of the organization because we were a team and got along very well and worked together as one which i loved, but the hardest part was during fashion show time when we were called to do make-up and had to apply make-up to the models within 30 seconds and it had to be perfect that was so overwhelming but for the most part the most enjoyable part was just being in an environment which allowed me to learn more about taking care of my skin and allowed me to teach young girls how to apply their make-up"
