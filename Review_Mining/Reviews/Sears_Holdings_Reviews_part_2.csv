rating,review
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job, us co-workers like a unit. Not slackers. I've learned, you wanna enjoy your work, got to be a unit"
good,"The workers were wonderful, but when it came down to management, it seemed as though they just promoted anyone. When they began outsourcing, they took people based on how long they worked for companies similar rather than their productivity and management skills, whether they were customer oriented or unreasonably strict without knowing guidelines and procedures."
good,"My typical day involves setting the merchandise to company standards, printing signs, marking the merchandise when it goes to clearance."
good,"Being that I was the only person working in my department (Fine Jewelry), when I was not working with my direct supervisor (which was almost every shift) it was very hard to get help in my department. Otherwise there's always something to do."
good,"Lots to learn in this work environment."
good,"The position I had with Sears was commission-based, which was pretty much where the rewarding aspects of this job began and ended. Management was fine. They did a good job of working with the employees, many of which were students, but weren't necessarily the best motivators/teachers. Most of the co-workers were cool, no more jerks than you'd fine in any job setting. The biggest gripes I had with the company came from the lack of advancement opportunities, as it seemed as though most of the management was was well entrenched in their respective positions, and the job culture. Not that there were bad people, simply that motivations, incentives, best practices, and just overall focus of the company seemed to switch every couple of days. Being in the retail environment you come to expect your expectations to change fluidly but at some point I felt the company should at least stick to some fundamentals. In the end, I find that the job could be rewarding after you set aside all the things distracted from the be all end all. Sales Metrics."
good,When we had to change the items from the clearance section and fit a wider array if jewelry in three boxes. I learn that even though there are various items there is a way to make it fit properly and look beautiful.
good,"Manage a high volume inbound service calls.No 2 calls were alike listening to the customer needs  making sure they were satisfied."
good,"the most enjoyable part of job working with customers, co-workers was nice,management was very poor,what I learned to stay focus,a typical day at work was fair."
good,"Although this job is very easy, working in the electronics department is not very rewarding or stimulating.  The hardest part of my job is trying to sell when business is as slow as it always is.  Managers and co-workers were always friendly. Working here advanced my social skills and made me more comfortable talking to people."
good,"While your money is in the control of you, customer issues and solutions, as well as store processes, employee relations, and rules can hit a huge roadblock (or 30)."
good,"specific location I worked was always understaffed so that made the job a little frustrating at times."
good,"I love the job I do.  Enjoy meeting people, learning from them, and being able help them fill their needs. Co-workers have become more like family.  Most of the products we sell are quality items and it's nice to hear positive comments about them."
good,I would help members on the floor and do store orders. At the same time I would fill the floor with new product. I learned great deal of visual work. As well as customer service.
good,"Worked full and part time.  Fun place to work, get to interact with customers every day.  Limited inventory, most items have cosmetic damage.  Pay is limited, they rely a lot on you selling the customer protection agreements."
good,"If you don't produce, you don't make money. I was not hired for this position. I was brought in hourly then my position was conveniently eliminated. I had to take a commission based position or be without a job."
good,"The new Culture of SHC is a fantastic idea. There are tools and training that will help incorporate the culture throughout the organization. It seems as though the senior leadership is slow to execute on initiatives as they are busy doing the work of the person above them. They call this career development but it feels more like ineffective delegation. "
good,"Stock Shoes, Customer service, Locate Stock, process trucks, Cashier, reset floor ads, inventory, work with heavy duty machinery, liquidation, Clean,  fix light fixtures, Interview candidates, attend daily meetings. its was a ok job"
good,"Management lacks transparency and commitment. There needs to be strict guidelines for abusive managerial conduct and dishonesty. While associates in general are both hard working and committed, there are no safe guards to protect and reward the efforts being made for the benefit of the company."
good,"Sears has been a part of peoples lives for generations. It has been a go to place for a variety of purchase options for people of all walks of life. An American original."
good,"This was a decent job. This was my first managers position so it taught me a lot in that aspect. However, I hated standing on my feet and pressuring customers to sign up for credit cards no matter what."
good,"Better home work balance life. Future of company not stable."
good,"My first job was to give assignments to associates. Following thru to make sure load integrity was utilized. I learned if employees are properly trained, they will succeed. That's a team win. During the 4th quarter the job was very demanding. But realizing all customer orders made it to the stores on time for customers was very fulfilling."
good,"Sears is ok place too work, but sometimes they give you very few hours to work thats about it that bad, and it was a far drive to get there just to work 2 days a week."
good,This job is slow but teaches you to provide good vehicle maintenance to the customers and that you can preform to even your own vehicle.
good,"A day at work was typically good. I learned different things about lawn mowers and tools. Management is okay, never really round when you call for codes. co-workers are fine, just not a environment I liked. The hardest part of the job is making sure everyone is happy and dealing with irate customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is the look on people's faces when they are satisfied."
good,nothing really bad to say. my management and co workers were okay. the only down side was if u had to go to the bathroom you had to wait on a relief person and if they were busy then u just had to wait
good,"Enjoyed the variety of tasked learned in the position.  Nice, professional employees eager to provide a satisfactory shopping experience."
good,"Sears is a great brand and the work-life is really great. It really great to work with team, however depends on the team we work along"
good,A typical day involved receiving inbound calls regarding our customer appliances. We made sure all customer services needs was meet while checking on shipping info as well. Within this job I was able to participate in the Transitional to leadership program while being promoted to installation sales department. There was a lot of growth within the department. This job is was not difficult just required a lot patience. The environment and management were decent but there could be some improvements in the near future.
good,"-very busy"
good,"Co-workers were great! Management not so much. Learned how to work with people. Enjoyed making customers happy. The hardest part was trying to learn and memorize the different benefits of the 50 different rewards programs that the Sears company were always coming up with and having to listen to the managers pretend that they genuinely cared about the customers when they would constantly dog you if you weren't getting the desired numbers they wanted. I thought it was about the person's experience at the store that mattered, apparently it's only about the numbers and how much money you're making the company, which disappointed me a lot."
good,I learned the numerous features of electronics and how they are great to know when customers are deciding between similar devices.
good,"Selling big-name Sears brands and being helpful to Sears clients."
good,Worked in the one of the largest shoe departments in the region.  The company at that time was merging with Kmart. I was flexible enough to be able to work in multiple departments.
good,The staff makes this an alright place to work. Some supervisors are very down to earth and easy to talk with. he turnover n employment was low.
good,"This company provides a great flexible work schedule.  The work is easy and simple.  That is literally the only benefit from working here."
good,As far as loss prevention it has  a good structure.  Only issue is no one knows where the company is headed and there is not good communication in that aspect.  Met a lot of good people willing to teach you though.
good,I was a cashier at Sears during my time in High School and it was a very repetitive job. I didn't learn much besides how to use the cash register but there was no room for advancement.
good,"Most days are great to work there, but due to the fact that we've been short staffed for as long as I can remember it gets very stressful at times and help is not where it needs to be."
good,"its an ok job, but i need more hours. management could be better. i like working in customer service. the workers could be better as well"
good,"slow paced work environment , nice people , the hardest part of the job is  that not a lot of people know about this place . not many sales."
good,This company just split away from its parent company and is trying to figure out who they are. Upper management tends to bark at people even when things are running well. Not a positive environment.
good,"The Lands' End department was a group of excellent workers. The standards were high, but we all enjoyed the work. "
good,"opening the studio, handling customers working with children taking pictures and editing pictures handle money and making deposits. management was okay for the most part. hardest part was having to handle unruly customer because a photo session was behind. the enjoyable part was when I worked with the babies I love posing and taking pictures of children their so cute and fun. I learned how to take great pictures and do photo shoots for family outside of the job."
good,Great place to work while I was completing my degree as a full time student.  My co-workers are great individuals and respectful especially management.  The only hard part was familiarizing myself with the thousands of parts we have for various appliances.  I always enjoyed customer service and helping others.
good,"A typical day at work consist, first of a rally meeting, all employees are require to attend. Sales goal for the day are announced, customers reviews of store and employees are evaluated whether favorable or not favorable. Working for sears has thought me that customer service is very important and it determines whether a member will return or not. My coworkers were very friendly and polite thus creating a calm and relaxed atmosphere. The hardest part of the job to me personally was pushing credit. We were required to open a certain amount of credit application per day and at times meeting the goal was a bit challenging since majority of the customer already have the company card. However there were days that i excelled and day where i didn't. The most enjoyable part of the job was being recognized for your achievements."
good,"A typical day at work include organizing display of products, coordinate and train staff on company new products,served customers in any prizing issue or complains. Learn alot in customers service aspect, how to prize items, how to display a product, inventroy control, HR administration, cash deposit, working as a team. very friendly co-workers and helpful, the hardest part of the job is having conference calls back to back and the most enjoying part of the job is going on trips"
good,Good place to work. Suggest more training for management team. Great products. Limited growth and advancement opportunities
good,"This is a job where you need to to go in with an open mind. My co-workers were very lazy, I encountered my fair share of customers (to be expected for customer service), and District Management always made you feel low on the pole. Work was busy on days that we have shipments . Organizing the items could take months, but once that was over you were bored for the next 6-8 months with no nothing to do but to try to find things to do. Overall, wouldn't recommend sears outlet"
good,Es un trabajo con gran responsabilidad ya que manejas dinero y pagos con tarjetas de crédito y es importante mantener tu atencion durante el proceso de pago.
good,Sears auto is a very fast pace environment to work in. Sometimes could very stressful. Practically always understaffed. Long working hours.
good,"I have been with sears holding corp. for more than a year a now, and i must say if you are looking for a part-time to waste your time work here. if you are looking to make a good salary and work here you HAVE to be management because sales are always slow its rare that you make a big pay check and you do get compensation through applications but its minimal and wont allow you to live comfortably. especially in the state of NY, so unless you plan to work for management or make some extra money on the side this is not the place for you"
good,"enjoyed it for the most part except petty 'favoritism' and drama that comes along with working with a bunch of females."
good,Work life balance was good. Always have peak times of extra hours in retail environment. Management team displayed exceptional teamwork and adaptability. Casual work environment and reasonable pay for the job.
good,I love working at Sears holdings corp.  It has been a very challenging and rewarding opportunity. I has been a pleasure working here but at this time the company is downsizing and I have to move on.
good,"no available hours, management stresses easily and takes it out on employees, and employees are unhappy with work environment."
good,"Systems were all outdated. "
good,"I have to say when I started working for this company I was enjoyable. I would wake up wanting to go to work. As the years went on things did change, People changed, management changed. I have never seen a company change over time to where people hated going to work. I have never worked for a company that has no common sense, always backwards. The hardest thing about my job was is never knowing what is the first priorty,  I know customer should be. I am talking about what tasks was first and for most important. Management always wrapped up to tight. The people there are nice and some you can make friends, some of the people you wouldn't want to trust if your life apended on  it.. The most enjoyable part for me was to reset the floors."
good,"I was never paid my last paycheck despite contacting many time, I was very happy in my job and like my fellow co workers but the management was poorly handled and the owner never returns phone calls"
good,It was not bad to start with but it gets boring after about the first six months. I believe that in order to get promoted you had to kiss a little butt.
good,"I was working from 8h00 to 4h00 Monday to friday "
good,"Time management is very important as we are not managed to heavily and required to complete out duties in a timely manner. Working here i gained a significant boost in my customer service skills as well as building my sales ability. Coworkers make this job extremely enjoyable as we help each other out in extreme cases, also as becoming friends who hang out even outside of work. managers were not a heavy factor in my daily routine as they were often looking at reports and future sales. The hardest part of this job would definitely having my hands tied when it came to getting someone service for their water heater, understandably angry when they were with out hot water for weeks at a time and the weather was extremely cold."
good,"I learned so much at Sears and had a lot of ownership over the product at a young age!"
good,"call center, how to work with many different types of people and situations. The management was lacks, they said one thing and did another. The co-workers, some treated the job as a joke and did not take it serious. They treated customers poorly and rudely. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with customers that were transferred from one person to the next because the employees were not doing their jobs right. The most enjoyable part was when I was able to take care of the customer in a short period of time and they were happy at the end of the call."
good,"The job wasn't too bad a few years ago, but since then, it has taken a huge nosedive. Hours have been shaved, and many people have been laid off."
good,Sears is a place that you can learn truly learn dispatching and routing from the ground up.  Sears is a company that is always  doing fun things for the employees.
good,"Became ASE tech. II, within a few short months starting employment.  Sold services, changed batteries, parts replacements (shocks, brakes, alternators, starters, and so on), preventative maintenance.  Accelerated the ranks, so to speak."
good,"• Counted money at the beginning and end of each shift and handled customer funds, as well as processing transactions."
good,Repair is a fast pace and multi tasking experience. Some times it's fun other times it's overwhelming with the work load per time to complete the task. Sears works with you and will try to provide additional assistance if needed.
good,"After being hospitalized for being struck by a car in the winter, i had to take some time off work due to back pain and a serious concussion. The managers mocked me in front of other coworkers, and claimed to not believe me. After returning to work a few days later, a costumer got upset over a sale and struck me with merchandise. Being concussed, I was very upset and in pain, and management did NOTHING. I asked to leave early, because I was very stressed out after being struck in the face with a boot by an angry woman, and they said no. All around, horrible place to work."
good,"Oversight of building inventory.  Ensuring inventory integrity throughout receiving, put away, and order filling processes."
good,"If you work at Sears design office, you never have a work routine, everything changes by the management frequently. People are afraid of losing their jobs. Not a secure feeling. Job was ok, there wasn't long hours of work. Pay and benefits are ok."
good,Win it's good it's great when it's slow it's none existent. As for training your on your own it is rushed. Do not apply if you the sole income for your family. It takes a year to learn the job. But there is potential for good money.
good,"A typical day included answering phone calls from technicians and customers and ensuring the routes were organized for same day and next day. I learned to be able to multi-task different things throughout the day and to be more proactive. Management was great for the most part, the team leads left a lot to be desired though. I had a lot of fun and interesting co-workers. The hardest part of the job was most definitely the upset customers. The most enjoyable part was helping out the customers whenever I could."
good,"Working at Sears as an MCA allowed me to be close to the customers and to assist them on a one on one basis. I was able to understand the new trends of this generation and it's upcoming changes. "
good,"A typical day is spent making sure the studios are clean, calls are made for appointments and that all photos are ready for pick-up, if you get customers you will have to spend a total of 15mins taking pictures,"
good,The doctor we worked with was awesome.  She was very professional and very thorough in her exams.  Yet she was also alot of fun to be working with and we all got along wonderfully.
good,entire job depends on your location - the store manager controls everything.  this can either be a huge plus or a big negative.
good,Sears has the potential to be such a great company as it used to be years ago. The problem with sears is that there is no improvement in any of there departments which are slowly deteriorating from it. The president of the company which is a hedge fund specialist is not trying to improve the company but instead milking it for what it is and not adding a penny to help it grow. I see it falling in the next couple of years.
good,"I enjoy customers and working with my team."
good,A typical day was usually slow. I learned how to work their system of work. Management was doable. My co-workers where very cool. Hardest work was moving the appliances. I enjoyed to be able to work throughout the store to help and various areas.
good,"A typical day at work included turning on the registers, keeping up to date with product knowledge of consumer electronics, and assist customers in satisfying their needs. A typical sale would start off with greeting them, asking them various questions to assess their needs, then show them the best electronics that would satisfy their needs. The majority of electronics that we sold were televisions. I learned how to sell thousands of dollars worth of electronics and satisfy the needs of customers. The management wasn't the best I've had, they weren't too reliable and were a bit clueless at times. However, they typically were friendly and respectful. My coworkers were amazing though, they treated you like family and were always looking out for each other even though technically we were all in competition to get the most sales. The hardest part of the job was trying to meet the daily sales quota, but they were usually fair about it. The most enjoyable parts of the job were getting to learn and play with the electronics, work with a family of coworkers, and getting to know multiple customers and being able to help them with whatever electronic needs they had."
good,"run cashier and waited on customer. Handle money, i love working with customers. Closing register at night. i enjoy working with people and have a great personalaity."
good,"It's a good chance for me to begin my job in Canada. The management of here still old style, need to be improved for future business."
good,This company has its challenges. If you like working for a company that you can expand your talents and skills then Sears is the place for you. Unfortunately I can not say much more about the company.
good,"An okay company to work for, no room for advancement, but a great first job nonetheless. You basically help customers, ring at the registers when they need help, and clean and fold while the store is open, and after they close."
good,I worked with a great group of people in global sourcing department.  Everyone was a team and cared greatly about doing the best job for all business units.
good,"I am a diabetic and they knew this from the beginning, as I gave them doctors note after doctors note and it took a major surgery for them to start to listen and obey what my doctors required of my job which was reduced hours, freedom to sit and to not deny my breaks or lunches.  They also didn't listen to me when I told them my blood sugars were becoming dangerously high as a result of the constant harassment to ""meet metrics"" when I was always doing the very best that I could, tried to be positive to keep my job but was always on edge of not meeting the company's unreasonable expectations."
good,"a typical day required me working the register and ringing customers up. i learned many techniques in all aspects,management was okay, not its best.co workers were okay, some were friendly. hardest part was being the only cashier in the cash wrap. and the most enjoyable part when the store closed up."
good,"No permanent seating, there for headsets and all work supplies was taken home daily and compensation was low.  Benefits did not begin to accumulate till 1 year of employment was completed.  Co-workers were great and supportive.  It was easy to advance and learn new skills.  Training provided a great foundation for any career in customer service and retention."
good,Flexible job with fair work conditions. No ability to move up and grow with company.
good,Clean safe Work environment. Plenty Of training on New products. Not managed very well. Enjoyed many years working at this company.
good,"I found it challenging explaining to customers their vehicles shortcomings and selling them mechanical work.  I learned to communicate with the customers and locate parts in a way that would maximize profits.  I found it frustrating that our area of concentration would change from month to month, especially if we got a new manager or District Manager."
good,"The Auto Center opens generally with customer who needs service done on his vehicle. He may have an idea what's wrong or is clueless. I go to the vehicle. I record the data from the vehicle and get more clear information as to the problem(s). After paperwork is finished, the vehicle is driven into the garage. The technicians check the vehicle out for professional solutions.Once solution(s) are established, the Manager on Duty gives the customer the problem and solution(s). If there are several vehicles, then MOD is to keep work flowing and keep customers up to date. Management is to schedule the best combination of manpower for each day. I was the customer service adviser and often MOD. I have learned not to discuss solution possibilities until the vehicle has been seen by the technicians, Customers will decline when work needs to be done (safety) and sometimes require work not needed. The customer can make the job most enjoyable or hardest. I learned to be pleasant and professional no matter which they are. All work done must be approved by customer and sometimes it is hard to get them to do so. Time is the hardest commodity to manage. Customer service keeps the doors open and loyalty. The corporate has sent different requirements as to how processes are to be be carried out. Best part is to be to help customers sometimes very inexpensive."
good,Sears had great lower management and cashier staff. Fun environment and friendly customers.
good,"I loved coming into work everyday and meeting new people. typical day at Sears Outlet would be coming in, cleaning my area of responsiblity, catching up with customers, spend some time on the cumputers, try to sell protection agreements and help people understand what a protection agreement is. The hardest part of my job is some of the customers that we get sometimes just really in bad moods and dont want to be bothered and the management wasnt the best. I love all my co workers we all get along fine. and the most enjoyable part of my job is making sure a customer leaves out of the store more then happy and having them come back asking to work with me again."
good,"Everyday is never a typical day. It always brings interesting dynamics as I interact with a vast array of people. Each day brings different challenges. I constantly interact with customers and work to energize the associates that work with me. Being in retail we work very hard to meet our sales goals, however, we have to work around obstacles and objectives to entice and make a great shopping experience. I enjoy the associates that I work with as they a very talented group of people. My associated are dedicated as they appreciate my management style as I lead by example and always provide them with honest constructive feedback."
good,Good place to work if you get your required credit applications otherwise you don't get hours or breaks. I really enjoy interacting with the public on a daily basis and meeting new people though. I definitely learn something new everyday! My co-workers are great but most of the time you are on your own and don't get to interact with them. The hardest part of the job I think would be credit applications. We have to meet a certain quota everyday and sometimes it's very hard. The management seem to take their time answering calls and would rather see more credit apps then happy customers and that's hard for me to deal with sometimes.
good,"I love the position as loss prevention agent,  the company itself needs work to bring itself back up."
good,It wasn't a busy job. Sometime we had many breaks during the shift. I've lerned to replace tires and batteries. Management was nice and my co-workers as well. The hardest part of my job was learn all words about automotive but i've a good team that explained to me everything
good,"I was had of customer services, counted down the register and the and of he night, and put up all returns"
good,"Sears was a good place to work. The people were nice and the managers understanding. The problem I had was that the company went to a system that required the cashiers to push credit. I felt this held up the flow of the lines and caused backups. Otherwise, there is plenty to do. I worked in all the departments and generally like the store. There was a great variety of work and it was fun to work there."
good,"I worked as a sales representative. I cold called customers who purchased appliances, but didn't purchase the insurance. I learned the importance of needing insurance for appliances. The work enviorment was safe and the co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job was cold calling customers. I enjoyed everything else about the job."
good,I learned a lot and enjoyed the crew I worked with. I enjoyed the fact that my pay was directly effected by how fast and how hard I worked. It made for a good part time job.
good,Typical day was picking and binning merchandise in backroom also running the merchandise pick up .I Learned alot about the backroom and the trucks.Management were very professional and goal orientated.My Coworkers worked hard at all times and the were cool and fun to work with. Find merchandise that was upstairs in the backroom in less then five minutes. Just Coming To Work Is I am In A Great Mode So I Enjoyed It.
good,"Sears was a good job when I started there. Business was good and considering I was on ""the draw"" which is basically commission- good business meant good paychecks for me. It was good for a while but once the store started to lose business and fewer and fewer customers were coming in. I was one of the top salesmen on the sales floor and saw my numbers plummeting due to the small customer concentration. I switched departments due to this and went from commission to hourly rate pay. I was at the hardware department for a while and was eventually ""let go"" due to the small numbers of customers. Corporate sent the message to my store to cut people from the staff that weren't a high necessity (basically people that were there for a year or less.) I was one out of about 9 or 10 employees cut."
good,"I assisted customers and checked out customers, while performing good customer service and reataining customers by offering credit apps and reward sign ups"
good,Sears was an okay place to work. my co-workers were pretty cool to work with. the hardest part of the job would be management.
good,"Tracking leads,seeing which leads had become sales and making those whom it was due to, received  the commissions. Not much to learn, just routine work with very little variances  . Management was adequate and the co-workers were nice people. The hardest part of the job was the paper work involve and the most enjoyable part was going home"
good,"A day begins helping a customer who brought in their vehicle for automotive maintenance. Visual and work order inspection all around the vehicle from tires, leaks, dents, and everything in between. Presenting the customer a list of options and prices for their requirements and our suggestions. Updating customers on time, status and increase of pay (with customers acknowledgement). Management and co-workers create a fun, friendly work environment/atmosphere. "
good,"Usually I open all registers,(6) by then I either have a customer or the phone is ringing. I love dealing with the customers, I have learned all about tools , Lawn Equipment, Exercise Equipment, Patio Furniture, Grills, and Bicycles. The training is very extensive. Most of my co-workers I love and the job is for the most part very rewarding to me. The management in the store is good but when you need them sometimes hard to find. The hardest part of the job is that I walk from the time I get there until I leave. I have to stock and in the tool area that means table saws, 4 ton jacks or various other heavy objects. This has become too hard for me to do. My body is hurting a lot that is why I am looking for an office environment.  I love working and because I love the environment at Sears I have stayed for so long but the benefits and the pay are not good."
good,"sears is still a good place to work, however I don't know how long they will be in business"
good,Okay place with great people. Management could use a lot of work.
good,"Keeps you busy throughout the day."
good,"This job requires minimal experience but still needs hard workers. It's a fast paced environment with decent management. Although it can be boring at times, the culture and social freedom allows for freedom and fun. This job ranges from cleaning to hard labor but it is always active. The active lifestyle of this job allows for time to fly by thus making the work day bearable."
good,Great People.  Work hard for little monetary compensation.  Management was great they need to allow time for family.
good,Underpaid...Expects you to work like a slave for minimum wage...Barely get hours some weeks...No raises or benefits....
good,"Its a busy day and fun at the same time. But most of all I learn a lot "
good,A good company that was fair to it s employees but always under the threat of your job being cut
good,Was a sales associate on commission working in both the hardware and lawn and garden departments. The hardest of the job was competing with my co-workers in getting sales done. The enjoyed interaction involved in the job.
good,good atmosphere to work at. great co workers. low compensation
good,I enjoyed my position as an assistant store manager but I dislike the lack of opportunity for higher growth with the company.
good,Physical labor position creating extremely respect for this position.  Proud of the results at the end of the work day.
good,"As the only Human Resource associate in my store I was kept very busy performing tasks and assisting associates with Human Resource needs.  I learned a variety of computer systems over the years as well as several other aspects of Human Resources including interviewing, hiring, orientation, training, payroll, staffing and scheduling, resolving harassment/discrimination complaints and labor negotiations.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the interaction with new hires, current associates and management.  Over the years my position was supported by management but the most difficult part of my job was working retail hours and being required to work on the sales floor as a manager on duty.  Because of that I was often unable to concentrate on my own duties and pay proper attention to new hires and address associate's needs."
good,"Sears slogan states it's a place to Work, Shop, Invest. I spent 18.5 years doing all that and more. I miss the people I worked with."
good,"They schedule numerous of calls to complete in a 4hr time frame and when one call takes longer than expected, the tech is responsible for calling the customer and negotiating if you can still do the call. Benefits are through the roof and not really worth it. If you're a sale person this is a job for you. If you're a tech and don't like to be pressure into making sales than look else where. They supply you with some tools and the rest you have to purchase with your own money."
good,"Customer service, the ""customer is always right"" you must sale sale sale! Don't forget to mention Sears Credit Cards, and get $15 dollars off your purchase today or get it for free depending on credit. Never let them know about the credit part or the bank if they decline the customer."
good,"My first year of work at Sears I worked in the office.  In the mornings I would count the money from the previous day's sales and prepare the deposit.  I also made sure the safe stayed balanced.  During the day and evening hours I answered phones, provided change to the cashiers, printed signs, and assisted managers with different tasks.  My last two years at Sears I worked in the shoe department where I assisted customers with shoes in their size.  Management was there to help when needed.  I made life-long friends with some of my co-workers.  The hardest part of the job would be working on commission in the shoe department.  The most enjoyable part of the job would be working with great people."
good,"I was a Sales Consultant. I informed customer service  at the highest level, helped customers make choices of what they needed for Yard equipment, exercise equipment and/or tools. I was trained in most of the items I sold; most of my co-workers were  very nice and fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was knowing week to week what hours/days I was going to work. The management was great, but really pushy at time concerning selling of Credit Apps and other things other than the product. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the customers."
good,Typical day consisted of helping customers with any questions they had about products we sold and closing the sale.
good,"started working for sears as a second job, made good money and moved up fast. with the inconstancy from above and  cultures changing fast"
good,Be prepared to work 60-80 hours per week as it is needed as a General Manager.  Last minute conference calls and upwards to 15 conference calls per week.  Lots of business partners involved and creativity is not in their culture.  Follow the script and you should be fine.  Hard to keep good talent.  Talent bench is non-existent so talent level is low for leadership.
good,"Management was always changing, co-workers were generally unhappy and pay was not enough to support  in the long run."
good,"home improvement sub contractors, offering home remodelation services and guarantees."
good,"Ma toutes première expérience de travail. "
good,"Greeting customers and helping them with there needs."
good,"Pay is good, could use a little more training for depts."
good,"Go in and interact with customers then then go home to family."
good,Working at Sears has gave me good experience as well as knowledge. I learned different things about diamonds all the way to different types of clothing. The time management at Sears was also manageable and the co-workers were very work orientated and had very good personalities. The most enjoyable part of this job was to watch each customer leave with a huge smile on their face. I knew that apart of my job/goal was achieved right there and then. I don't think there was every a tough time at this job.
good,"Keyed and verified sale prices and quanitites"
good,Great company to work for. I enjoyed my time working here. Was recognized and promoted timely. Good management structure. Solid product selection. Friendly work culture and associates. Learned basic management skills.
good,Good place to start and get the title you need but not great for  benefits and compensation
good,"The ablity to coach and create a customer service focused team. The best part was being able to not train and coach my assistant managers but taking the time to be able to coach and groom them to the next levels. Being able to work with my whole team from my part time associates to my assistants on selling, operational processes, shrink, customer service, merchandising and then seeing the postive effects it had on the store sales and profit. The hardest part of the job was making sure that I had a set plan to try and stick to so that I could see every associate everyday and be able to spend time with them while managing the the different businesses. This was something I had to really train myself and hold myself accountable to do and it did mean that sometimes I would stay extra hours in a day to have that opportunity to make someone better or give them that ""highfive"" for doing a great job. Part of the job with such a large staff and many different departments  was a challange but one I truly enjoyed it allowed me to learn over the years with Sears all aspects from selling a tractor to merchandising a Women's ready to wear pad from front to back. I had several great training and coaching along the way and had a lot of district training and coaching roles that prepared me to be able to coach and training on a district level."
good,"Not all management is competent as to the processes and organizational skills required for any management at Sears.  But, I believe if one is able to quickly grasp new concepts and constantly improve on organization skills, I believe you will succeed.  Great environment to work in, however, in my opinion, the company is unorganized when implementing new practices and technology advancements.  I enjoy working with others and my fellow coworkers are great.  Teamwork is most important here and my social skills allow me to come to work and enjoy what I do."
good,"This is a fun place to work.  The people are great, there is generally a happy mood among other employees.  The pay could be better for hourly employees, but they also encourage you to move up in the company."
good,"un día típico en el trabajo, llegar limpiar me área de trabajo, ponerme al día, "
good,"Everyday is a learning experience"
good,"A typical day was slow, but there seemed to be tasks to do. The hardest part was to figure out what the management wanted, on minute they wanted one thing done, the next it was the complete opposite like the first was never mentioned.  However, working with great associates made it enjoyable."
good,"Its a very good job but lot of disturb  changes in management,so job is not fix at all"
good,Its more of a family store for those who like fixing things themselves or if you work at a larger store its great if you want to buy cloths cheap. You do get a few customers that are unruly but there easily handled. My coworkers always are on a first name bases and like to get to know you who their working with. Hardest part of my job was getting people interested in the sears credit cards. The most enjoyable is working with different customers everyday that take time and thank me when I am able to give them cheaper stuff through our companies sales promotions.
good,Every second of your day must be micro managed in order to keep up with work load and expectations. There is not enough training to prepare new associates in the hardware department and not enough compensation to attract worthy associates.
good,great co-workers always willing to help as needed. I like being on the road and not stuck in an office or shop all day. Most of my customers are great. I like being able to repair their appliance whicjh makes them happy.
good,We sell appliances and we have to constantly take exams to learn about the new appliances coming out.  During my time at Sears I had a great time learning about the products.  I had a great manager and the greatest co-workers.  I did not want to leave but I did not like the direction that sears turned to which really hurts their sale associates.  The hardest part of the job was cleaning the appliances and moving them around.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when you had a good day. This job you got paid on commission.
good,It was a god job to have while going to school.  I learned how to work in a retail environment.
good,"I would greet customers and assist them with items they may be seeking in store or online. I'd clean fitting rooms, setup/take down the sales ad, straighten the merchandise on the floor, as well as restock what needed to be on the floor. If there was a long line at the cash register and I wasn't busy, I'd help out on the registers. Occasionally, I would set up visual displays. Also, I was responsible for training new employees."
good,"In the summary. It's a retail job, sucks most of the time, but does have it's perks. You get a lot of people who complain about the company, but takes it out on the associate because we have the power to change policy...not"
good,"Working at Sears Canada in Limeridge, I was privy to being apart of a select number of stores who got to test the pilot for Men's Commissioned Dresswear. This was a straight commission pilot. There were only three of us who worked in this department continuously for the past three years. Last year our department sold over a million dollars in merchandise, and we were first in our region for volume of sales. "
good,"The job was simple enough: completed reports, check sheets and mis mates. Customer service is big and so is computer usage. You need to make daily sales either in the store or on the computer.  Don't believe them when it comes to being promoted. You don't have a chance unless you are a favorite of more than one manager. Even if you qualify and have all the skills needed for the job you will not get it.  I was told by a manager I had a position and later told i was lying. Not the best place to work at if you have a social life. They will interfere and hardly allow you to switch shifts with other employees in your department. it's hard to get raises too.  Overall it is a good place to work at if you keep your head down and do the work; just don't have too high of expectations."
good,"Process driven organization with multiple reports to determine the root cause of performance opportunities. Culture changing environment that encourages positive recognition to link results with associate behavior."
good,"get to work go to the line you are assigned for that week"
good,I have learned that customer service jobs are much easier than I thought. Sears was my first job and I loved it.
good,"Each day is different. I have learned how to do audits and maintain a safe work environment. Management is not the best, but I am a Team Player."
good,"Sears can get you good experience in e-commerce and software product management.  It is, however a tough environment to work in.  It is a sink or swim environment and those who can work in that environment can do very well."
good,"A typical day at work consist of driving around 200-300 miles a day, going from one appliance in home call to the next.  My calls can be up to 1 and 1/2 hours apart.  A typical day brings approx 8 calls.  Some are quick repairs,and or diagnostic calls, some are complete overhauls of appliances. "
good,I learned great customer service skills as well as inventory taking and logistics.  I taught customers how to use their sewing machines and sergers.  Management is not the best and the company as a whole is going down the tubes.  Upper management only look out for the share holders and not the front line workers.
good,"Sears was a normal retail environment. I learned a lot when it came to customer service, on how to deal with all different forms of people. I've worked with better management teams and I went through quite a few in the 7 years I was there, but most seemed to be there to help you have better days. Dealing with customers was the best and most difficult part of employment. You meet many wonderful people, but you also deal with many difficult personalities as well. You also realize just because you deal with a thousand difficult people with a smile does not mean you are allowed to deal with number 1001 with anger."
good,"The management is flexible with schedules, especially since a good amount of employees are students. I've been able to learn different facets of customer service; partly in dealing with customers face to face and also in answering phone calls. The hardest part of the job is that you must learn all of the other positions; cross training plays a big part in advancement. I am grateful that I was able to be in an environment where you're taught more positions than your own; it's gained me skills which can be implemented in other jobs down the line."
good,It was a good place to learn. Learned a alot but left to go back to school.
good,as manager I always reviewed the prior work day first thing in the morning. I learned that people are the greatest asset for the company and my managers agreed with me. Most customers are friendly and courteous but when a dissatisfied customer approaches me I have learned patience is the key.
good,I worked with a good group of co workers. Management was rarely understanding of your problems or just wasn't there to help.
good,"Sears provided adequate training, my manager and coworkers were very helpful at explaining the running of the store. I was treated well by all the staff, and we were encouraged by staff meetings to do well. I learned to have a positive attitude, approach customers in a helpful manner, and communicate efficiently. The hardest part of my job was identifying item prices on sale items during returns or exchanges. The most enjoyable part of my job was talking to and helping customers with merchandise problems and needs. A typical day at work involved me working the register, answering phones, tidying up my work space and organizing the merchandise on my part of the floor, talking to customers, recomending merchandise and programs, and checking customer's merchandise out."
good,"Nice people"
good,Answered incoming calls from a call center. Scheduled appointments for technicians to perform service calls.
good,"Management is good, the people are great but overall the company is bad. The computers and registers are archaic."
good,"Nothing special, a friendly place to work. Good place to learn about managerial and retail situations"
good,"Nothing special, a friendly place to work. Good place to learn about managerial and retail situations."
good,Good beginner job but hard to move up. The enjoyable part is working with co-worker cause you have to deal with alot of temper mental customers
good,"good work environment, good pay and hours management was decent. never had a problem with coworkers. a typical day was great was just servicing customers"
good,A great place to learn sales.  If you can sell here and have the aptitude for certain industries you can sell anywhere.
good,I've haven't learned much at this job. They cut hours regularly. I work pat time but even the full time associates work less than 35 hours a week.
good,work was good and people friendly for the most part however all sears warehouse/call centers in canada are now closed.
good,"I worked closely with Dr., to best fit and dispense eye wear."
good,"Enjoy my job, very busy just need more of a challenge.  The environment is very controlling.  The call center is not really what I want nor am I use too."
good,"Enjoyed working with the company."
good,"As it is my first Company, i learned a lot from my Team."
good,"A typical day at work: I come in and help customers select a mattress or vacuum that suits their needs. Open and/or close the registers depending on whet time I am working."
good,easy job with great pay but there are no hours and you never new when you were going home. very unstable with hours
good,"If your looking for a call center, this is your place.  There are a lot of people, (mostly teenagers) that work there.  Not a very professional place.  I did receive very good training and would suggest this place for beginners.  The training that I had received has followed me every else I have been.  The managers are pretty good,  Most of them have moved up the ranks so know the business well."
good,très bon endroit pour facilement s'acclimater au marché du travail.
good,Great place to work if you do not have a family.  Learned alot about HR laws
good,You work at SEARS because you need to be there not because you want to be there. Customers and employees are always angry no matter how hard you try to please. Management depends on where you go but most of them are very nice people doing what they have to do. There's no camaraderie at the work place. It's all about fending for yourself. The best part of the job is the paycheck.
good,"A lot of the employers are friendly, I learned sacking So much about shoes and pricing, the hardest part for me was the schedule was online and clocking in with 12 numbers."
good,I have really enjoyed working at Sears.  People are friendly and I keep busy.
good,I learned how to interact and provide excellent customer service to the visiting public.
good,"Call center specialist I use customer relations skills, technical product knowledge, database information and additional related resources to assist customers with troubleshooting laundry and kitchen appliances and offering general operational instruction. , After troubleshooting the issue, I offer and promote to our customers other Sears products and/or services."
good,"This is a great job if you are single, or you are going to school and would like to make a little money on the side"
good,Most of the work depends on the weather making it difficult during the winter to assists the customers. Management make it enjoyable to work.
good,Hours very inconsistent and having to deal with that and being paid from sales commission it was very stressing
good,The sales associates are always told what to do and the manager is just sitting around the computer watching a movie. But the people are really fun to work with and I appreciate their positive attitudes and their funny personalities.
good,"A typical day at Sears is not a typical day in any way, You can schedule for coaching's and they will get cancelled. You can try to do a side by side coaching, but you are limited in as far as talking with the adviser. You have maybe 5 mins that you can speak with the adviser and then they are calling to have them back on the phones, so side by side coaching's are of little value to the adviser as they will tell you themselves. As a manager it is very frustrating when you want to help your advisers to be successful and you are held back. "
good,"This is where I learned the basics to becoming a Loss prevention agent. A typical day at work consist of Apprehending shoplifters, doing paperwork(Prosecuting Documents), and conducting thorough Internal/External audits within the store. Great working environment, enjoyed the company and protection of my co-workers as we prevented theft and loss from occurring on a daily basis."
good,"Put clothes back on shelf, help dress manicans, in charge of inventory"
good,waking up connecting my computer to recive my route for the day.Start running my route as sheduled.the. fexing and repairing costomers products and thier complains.
good,"did not enjoy working there"
good,"I monitored the premises to prevent losses to the store. I also organized the clothing and put away go-backs. In-put important information and data into the computer data basis. Answered the multi-line phone and provided excellent customer service. It was very slow work and it didn't expect much from. I felt like there wasn't a lot of good management or training going on. ""It was more like the more you can put off the work that needs to be done, the better."""
good,"This was a great learning experience. I learned how to open and close the cash register, and awesome experience with customers as my first job."
good,Very hard work that is not appreciated and not worth the pay.
good,"Sears is a high energy environment that requires a strong soul to handle it. You are constantly under pressure to not only complete your tasks, but to provide the best customer service in the industry. I certainly strived to be the best I could and I know for a fact it showed well. I highly respect the manager that I worked under and am very glad to have had the experience."
good,"It was ok , I didnt like the scheduling. I didnt like aswering the phone in the appliance section because strangers were always yelling at me for things I knew nothing about. I didnt really like selling appliances , just not really the right job for me."
good,"The best thing I can say is I met a lot of great people and still have close friendships. "
good,"A once fun workplace with nice, friendly co-workers is now understaffed and overworks the employees that remain. I've learned a lot of values working here at Sears but this past year business has taken a significant drop and work is no longer challenging. Associates take the majority of the flack while managers are hardly ever to be found."
good,"changing tires rotations flats and spares refilled fluids, i learned breaks alignments on a daily bases Managers were nice and sensible equal to all employees"
good,"Working there is good, keep to yourself and work as a team when needed. You recieved 10-20% discount on items thats not on sale.Hardest part of job is the people."
good,Flexible hours. What I learned to value most about this job was time management.
good,"If you're looking for a career, this wouldn't be the place to work. Great for students because of schedule flexibility."
good,"Everyday is a experience"
good,I did enjoy the freedoms and flexibility of the job but the pay was terrible.
good,"overall a great place to work, the associates are amazing, dedicated and loyal. Senior leadership seems fragile with significant changes on a regular basis leaves the front line associates uneasy as to future. Currently in a state of transition but showing positive signs of a turn around. Appear to be focusing on short term gains vs long term plans."
good,"Not a bad place to start as entree level, I went from a cashier to a sales lead, took me 4 years or so.  The pay is hard to come by you have to fight for every penny.  I learned a ton about sales and marketing.  Your co-workers are mostly reliable.  The time allotted to complete tasks are tight which makes your work harder and faster."
good,Sears is a performance company. Their core values are around Member's and metrics.
good,Sears was a great enviroment and you were able to learn many different customer service techniques. A typical day involved assisting customers on the salesfloor simply answering questions and completing the cash transaction. you may also take the opportunity to open a new credit line for your customers.
good,"-Loaded and unloaded air freight"
good,"Fun job, didn't really deal with management to much. No raises"
good,very large turnover in employees but I thoroughly enjoy meeting people and assisting so I enjoyed that aspect. I found for the most part management and staff were professional and very easy to approach and willing to assist.I learnt how to work in a team environment and did well at it. The hardest part of this job was dealing with people especially those that were impossible to please but it was also a good challenge and a great feeling when you won someone over
good,"Like helping people find what they need for their appliances needs and wants.  Love learning something new everyday I go to work."
good,great co workers and lots of fun taking pictures of children.  only down side is lack of hours or staffing at times.
good,Working at sears I learned to have patience and take my time when doing a task. Management was helpful at all times. My co-workers made the job fun and the time fly by. the hardest part of the job was closing the store. and the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting and talking with the customers.
good,a regular day at the sears warehouse was tiring and hectic for the time i was there i learned that things dont come handed or giving you have to earn(take) what you want the management was terrible but at the same time doing there best with a corrupted company also the co workers worked hard each day to get laid off..
good,Sears has the right mission in place to ensure that it takes care of their customers. I believe that Sears utilize a lot of the practices that are taught in business school and portrays that to their members of management. My favorite part of the day is when the team has had a successful day by taking care of customers and meeting all of ours goals for the day.
good,"loading unloading trucks, stocking locating, inventory and shrink"
good,Learned alot about applaince repair and how business works.
good,"Preparing cash registers"
good,Liked waling around talking to customer's and meeting new people
good,"Clothes buying for ladies/men/children are very useful in the community where the climate has 4 seasons.  However, the diverse culture are able to know the true value of its merchandise where it is manufacture and made.  Value of the price at times is moderate but to those who scrooge their money spending due to big expenses in the realty, customers tends to just buy what is the cheapest commodity and just buy the best if it is mostly needed in certain occasion."
good,Increased demands on associates and managers. Under staffed and low payroll hours. Team does the best under the circumstances. Too much  criticism and not enough kudos for the staff. Poor work/life balance for most of the staff
good,I learned how to stock the shelves with supplies for the customers. I learned how to work as a team. The good part was that they worked around my class schedule.
good,"I worked here as a loss prevention agent and it was my first time doing so. I was trained very well and I had a great team and manager. We were not a high theft store so the work was often boring and repetitive. I met a lot of really great people here, many of whom I am still friends with. This is a good start for any one looking to get into security or law enforcement. It gives you an idea of the other side of retail. I found that the work varied from chasing shoplifters, to managing inventory in the warehouse and main store. You will learn a lot techniques for apprehension so pay attention and don't let your self doubt get to your head. "
good,"Responsible for both selling/servicing customers "
good,"A typical work day is steady, I am ready to utilize my degrees. The call center setting is not what I would like to do. My Job is a place where I go in and I give my all. I have had several advancements since working with the company. I can say that most of the advancements were lateral movement with the pay. Management is un organize sometimes but some can be approachable if you had a questions. I enjoy the associates I interact with on a daily basis and I get along well with my team mates."
good,days are long bad a good job if you like working alone with little to no management 
good, 
good,"all aspects of shipping and receiving"
good,I handled escalated calls for the repair side by helping them becoming with their repair needs and becoming happy customers.
good,It was a good experience for me to learn more about sales and it helped strengthen my communication skills with customers. I learned a lot about different products and about customer service.
good,"I didnt like asking every customers to fill out a credit application. it felt as if i was kind out harrassing them, because we had to ask them more thans once if they said no. but overall i loved working at Sears."
good,"I Unloaded truck and done anything they needed done including hang clothes, stock shoes, and stock floor. "
good,Sears is a good company to start your retail career. They have a good national college trainee program. 
good,"I loved working here, I maintained the studio alone. The customers became regulars and was proud to provide happiness to them threw pictures. A typical day was very busy customer after customer, taking photos, editing them, ordering the pics, taking money, scheduling, and much more. Time management was a huge key in this job and i proved to myself how self sufficient I can be. I managed this specific studio all alone, although would have been nice to have a co-worker sometimes I managed on my own very well. The hardest part of job was not always being able to fit customers in when they needed it. The most enjoyable part is gaining relationships with customers threw making memories that will last forever with pictures."
good,Shipping and receiving. I learned proper safety technics while working. Management was fair. My co-workers were easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was unloading truck shipments. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers when I could.
good,I enjoyed the work I did at Sears however management made being unemployed here difficult. The pay was not as good as it could have been for the work that was done. 
good,"The commission+base pay is nice, especially for anyone who is looking for part time work.  Co-workers were very fun to work with. Nobody would be concerned if I made a sale in which the store would lose $1000 as long as it made my personal numbers look good, so I guess that should tell you a little bit about the company's priorities. Corporate would abandon ideas too quickly, leading to constant change within the store itself.  If you can put up with the passive-aggressiveness of corporate/management then it's a job worth looking at."
good,"For having not worked before, this position and work environment were a good place to start. There were several opportunities for advancement in the management and sales areas - and nothing otherwise. Unfortunately, being a tech guy, my skills were rarely used, being that sales were my primary focus. The pay was consistent and the hours were for the most part correlated with the amount of effort and enthusiasm you put behind your work. Great for someone in high school or college that hasn't worked before and is looking for starting experience."
good,"* Provide positive frontline contact with customers"
good,"Selling, customer service. Cleaning. Displays. Etc. Inventory. Clearing out dressing rooms. Helping customers."
good,"It is a fast moving place from taking photographs, answering phones, delivering orders, to solving customer issues and working out promotional events.  I've learned that even though we may be working alone in the studio, we have to have a form of team work.  We may not be there all the time to and the other members need to know what we've done the day before.  It is a place that I feel we all are on the same level.  The managers have been in our position and they have that understanding when we have issues that needs to be resolved.  It is very hard to let a customer know that the session isn't going well and needing to reschedule due no fault of anyone and that the situation will continue to get worse if there is not going to be a break for everyone.  I have been able to see many children grow through making some of the best memories."
good,There is always training and updated information on new products. There is always helpful material to read to prepare for sales.
good,"Sears was decent to work for. They provided many many hours of training, managers were usually available to help with any questions or customer concerns, and the pace varied between snail speed and absolute chaos which was nice because it broke up the day."
good,On a typical day at sears you come in and get to work.My co-workers were pretty cool but some of them were lazy.The management was ok but some of the things wee did weren't organized.Overall the working experience was pretty decent. 
good,"A typical day at Sears would consist of scheduling appointments in person and over the phone, selling portraits and taking them.The hardest part of this job was dealing with the unruly kids that didn't want to smile! The most enjoyable part of this job was coming to the sales table and wowing the customers with the finished product. "
good,It seem as the workers were responsible for everything in the store while the managers just relaxed all day.
good,"Very busy atmosphere and lots of hours available."
good,"Most days are fairly simple, the biggest challenge to prevent things from being returned. The Benefits seem to be going away through out the company. It is a laidback environment and if you don't want to work hard and make decent money Sears is good, just not if you need insurance or would like to move up in the company."
good,"My day at Sears consisted of me logging into my computer and pulling up Outlooks to see what was scheduled for the day. I would check on my team by walking through the cubs saying my hello to everyone and finding out which agent may need immediate attention. I would check attendance and pull up all necessary systems to access reports that are needed as well as our main system that assisted with montoring service levels and agent activity. I would prepare for individual coachings, monitor calls and attend meetings, along with helping HR with interviewing new candidates for the positions available within the call center. I would also assist with escalated calls where a manager was requested by customers and sometimes de-escalating some customers was the hardest part of my job and saving the sale from an irate customer."
good,"I loved working for Sears. It was a fun place to work and was always busy working, made the says go by quick. The only thing is all the hours were split unfairly. One of the employees is friends with the boss and gets all the hours so his sales numbers are inflated due to the fact that is always there to assist customers. He also has had several complaints against him but never get's disciplined for them."
good,Could be a great company if the company leaders knew what they were doing and had reachable goals for employees.
good,not enough work for all the men employed at location. They would schedule seven guys for work that was based on commission
good,There is nothing atypical abouut this job. about 20 years ago when the company was thriving you could make a living with a position there. Now it seas that hardley anyone is trained well and most of them do not even care about there jobs. my co workers are excellent and my dept manager is the one of the best managers I have ever had which is one of the opnly reasons why i am still there
good,"I worked at Sears for almost 7 years. Bad management, low morale and low pay. I was in sales and it was difficult to make good money. I guess it varies on where you are. But management was unorganized, but the coworkers were awesome. Disliked the company overall although it was a job."
good,Most days at work are slow but it does pick up between Thursday and Saturday and this is not all of the time. I have learned alot about all of the different departments that I have worked in within the past four years such as how differently they all run and what different steps you have to take to get things done in each department. With my manager experience I do have the mind set of both a regular associate's and a manager I feel that I have become a better associate. The hardest part of the job to me is being the only associate that really takes pride in there work to make sure things get done. The most enjoyable part of my job is some of the insensitive they have for the associates when they do well.
good,"A typical day at sears is nice and interesting, i learned how to stand my ground and my opinion counts. The management is not to friendly and my co workers where not motivated."
good,"Very relaxed workplace with good pay. Not very good business goals, due to pushing shop your way rewards so hard. With the way the day to day business is run Sears may be out of business within the decade."
good,"I am only speaking for the store which I work at. There seems to be a virus of ""it's someone else's problem"" going around. As a backroom associate with some pride in his work, I've found the lack of care in my peers for proper job completion to be appalling. Many of the processes are broken due to employees not following proper procedure, and what is worst is the management that can't reign in these problems."
good,Sears is a great place to move up in. Management encourages all associates to move up within the company. Training is provided to help you achieve this success
good,"Management very laid back focuses on some metrics, some of the time. Poor customer service skills. M ost enjoyable part is helping a customer find a solution."
good,"twelve to sixteen hour shift work, hot during summer, workers can be a little hard to deal with at times, pay was great!"
good,"Fast paste Photography. Work alone most of the time. You have 30 minutes to take photos, edit them, sell and print per session."
good,"Working there for a little over a year and the pay stayed at 7.25. No matter how hard a person worked or what they did for the company, Sears remained in a stagnant ""Pay Freeze"" for whatever reason."
good,"Working for a retail company has its ups and downs. a typcial day of working with people can be stressful, but having friends there to releive the stress really helps"
good,"Usually Mon- Fri I opened so I would open the registers in Vacuums and Electronics. Then I would tidy up the depts before the customers would come, I would assist the customers and answer their numerous questions. I would tell them about each vacuum, (the difference) microwaves and mattresses."
good,When Sears was purchase by a hedge fund operator who was only interested in profits and not customer service things went downhill I was taught that if you give good service the bottom line will grow through repeat business and referrals
good,A typical work day was hectic.I learned how to deal with problems in different ways. Management was not too bad. my co-workers was good. The hardest part of the job understanding the pricing in the beginning . Most enjoy part was the people interaction
good,"I have learnt a lot at Sears and they have increased my knowledge of sales, merchandising and planning. I have been blessed with great managers and a great group of people to work with."
good,"Didn't like it very much, was treated unfairly. Management was very biased with certain things, unfortunately."
good,employees and managers dont always work within company policy or good work ethics.
good,unpack stock prior to store opening --
good,This is a job for people just starting out or trying get on there feet.
good,the managers needs to be more helpful with their employer.
good,"Low wages unless busy, compensated on commission. Lots of old rude shoppers but some that will brighten your day. i suggest working in electronics to make more money."
good,"My time at Sears was fairly short but enciteful. I enjoyed being able to experience what it was like in retail. I was at the low end of the ""totem pole"" as a sales associate but it was good experience."
good,"The sales associates definitely need to earn the money they are working for. Its a high pressure position, but you can make plenty of money part time."
good,Learned to communicate with customers and how to be self sufficent in work tasks.
good,"For the first five years I worked hard everyday because I believed in the product and my management supported me. Then with a change in management things went south. But in my time there I became affluent in all departments except clothing, and enjoyed most co-workers. The hardest part was trying to advance in my carreer there never seemed to be a position availble. I enjoyed my customers most of all. The satisfaction of knowing you helped someone purchase the right item for them and their life is very fufilling."
good,"I was new to this type of job, but my trainers made everything very easy to understand and it helped me to succeed for the time I was with the company."
good,The hours were very flexible. I usually work mornings to evenings. Then on the weekends open to close. I learned a lot about all the different models and brands of shoes. Since I unloaded truck I have a good idea where everything was by memory. Management was very poor I'd say they were very unorganized. The hardest part of the job was working the hours I was assigned and sometimes a lot more on short notice because of how unorganized the working schedule was.
good,"As an in Store Marketing Associate (ISM), my duties consisted of hanging up promotional signs for events that consisted of merchandise advertising in our sales papers. I also rearranged the sales floor to make room for new merchandise coming in so that there will be ample space to accommodate the items to be purchased by the customers. The hardest part of the job was moving things around and the most enjoyable part was the discounts that they gave. My co-workers were awesome to work with and they taught me how to run a walker stacker use a hand held device that would scan the items we had."
good,"my experience was good,very good work environment.Amazing co-workers and very supportive manager."
good,"Some places have great managers, and others have ones that don't understand management. But luckily I had a couple of good managers. Even though it was part time for school purposes, it was pretty fun and informative working there. I would suggest those who have a good sense of people-skills to work there."
good,"trying to get hours in is a strugle, but nice people. good if you need a job, but i dont know about a career"
good,"While Sears has been leading in technology and thought leadership, they have not been able to provide solid results. This is majorly due to the organizational top down approach and a lack of focus in getting the core value proposition right."
good,"Needs improvement in technology, especially inventory systems, Point of Sales systems, and infrastructure. Also new policies should be implemented and the money wasted on useless programs should be used for employee advancement and raises."
good,The work hours were long and unpredictable
good,Lots of driving and stress to complete service calls. Most of the time a large part of your day was spent driving.
good,My work day consists of managing accounts for Sears Premier customers.I also supervise and schedule In- home repairs. I specialize in customer service which is the most enjoyable part of my job. The hardest part is not being able to fully utilize other skills and assets as an employee due to the type of job I do.
good,Come in and wait for cars to come in needing services or unload truck with tires on it sometimes that was very demanding and stressful but I got it done. I enjoyed my co-workers it was a line of mostly men so we related to each other. Hardest thing about the job would be the weather conditions.
good,"I liked this job, how ever to much stress and no support."
good,Typical day is slow and it's easy money guesss that's why it's only part-time?
good,"Un día era igual que el otro, con la diferencia de la mercancía que te llegará."
good,HR needs improving. Newer cash registers are needed. Basic hygiene is bad( break room and bathrooms).
good,"spent most of the day in the back room stocking surplus items, locating items for online orders, and helping customers load their cars."
good,"Depending on which store and location your employed, there are different pros and cons. Different divisions have various employees some more katty than others. Most are helpful and enjoyable. Large company so there are many opportunities to switch divisions. Larger cities have less respect for employees where as smaller cities have more respect for their team. Although over the years management shifts and the odd great ones move on or leave. Really depends on managment of your overall division, not the store managment. Hours sometimes can be scarce. Fulltime hours are hard to obtain unless your a lifer."
good,"It gave me an opportunity to interact with various type of personalities who were my customers and I considered that as a scope of learning to communicate with people, from new comers (to Canada) to Senior citizen, school kids to research students of University etc."
good,"A typical day at work was taking phone calls to reschedule appointments for customers. The hardest part of my job was not being able to help the customer when they got a phone call that their appointment needed to be rescheduled because the technician isn't going to their home. Management was great, co-workers were excellent. The most enjoyable part of my job were my co-workers. Extremely relaxng and comfortable environment."
good,"Well I was a soft lines MCA. I just dealt with putting out clothes and cleaning fitting rooms while assisting on the floor. No big deal as long as you have cool co-workers as I did. Unfortunately the management that was there during my tenure was awful. Literally treated the employees like slave and hardly any respect. It was only SEARS, take it easy. The pay should of been higher I must say for that position. We practically did everything."
good,Started off selling mantance agreements for products bought at Sears. Usually acheeving money goal. With the MA department closing in Mass. was moved to installations where on more then one occasion I would be sent in a card and balloons thanking me for following therw with coustomers who had installation problems and were getting the run around.
good,this job sucked if you wont get any raises I worked there for three years and only got one raise for 25cent. The managers are idiots and don't want to get off there butts and assist customers. Merchandise Pick-up do so much work for so little pay its ridiculous.
good,You get to meet new people every day as this job is in retail and clients come here to shop and my job is to help them load their items into their vehicles when it isn't in a bag they can carry.
good,"As a cashier I assist customers, answer & transfer calls, complete customer's purchases, make sure monies are balanced at the end of the shift, and organize merchandise in the store. I've learned what all the duties are working at a retail store and what customer service is like. I've learned the proper way to deal with difficult situations and customers also. The hardest part about working at Sears is fulfilling one of the duties which is getting customers to apply for credit. That part is hard because the economy is down and customers don't like applying for credit. The most enjoyable part about working with Sears is making customers happy. I love when the customers leave the store satisfied with their purchases."
good,"Sears was a nice place to work, while I was in college. I learned a lot about how a business is run and how to solve any sort of problem. Some of the managers are encouraging, while being goal and people oriented. Some of the other managers, that I have worked for, have imposed very cold, authoritarian leadership style. Overall, I enjoyed the job because it allowed me to learn a lot while interacting with a wide variety of individuals."
good,"good management, great work envrionment, learned ability to adapt to customers needs and expectations"
good,Unfair production level. Uncareing management. Lack of work. Bi-weekly pay.
good,"Great opportunity to manage very talented team members, however was laid off due to unit closing."
good,"Sears needs a lot of things changed to be the powerhouse it once was. The pay is terrible and they refuse to hire full time. Also, advancement is a poor chance. You can definetly work there for as long as your willing to."
good,A good place to start a career and move up fast. Self starters will do well in this fast past environment.
good,I enjoy working at Sears because there is never a minute of downtime.
good,"It was an easy going job. I was a merchandise customer assistant which involved me with customers. I was responsible for re stocking shelves, keeping the fitting rooms clean, and floor neat and tidy. The coworkers and my manager was the best part about going into work. They always made me feel good and even though we had our work to do, we had fun doing it."
good,"Sears was my first job in 2009 while I was still in high school and after I graduated and moved to Georgia I was hired again because of my experience with the company. For that, I am grateful. It is a good temporary job."
good,"Check-out people ,help them find what there looking for.Also take payments and answer there questions about the store and bills statement."
good,Pros
good,I worked in the men's department. I folded pants and shirts all day and night. Ring up customers and make sure the fitting rooms are nice and cleaned out. Not a very complex job in terms of responsibilities.
good,"A typical day at Sears consists of customer service, photography and sales. It is important to build a relationship from the first hello because when your taking photos of families you have to bond with everyone so they feel comfortable and have the best experience. The management at Sears is good. There are a lot of bosses though and sometimes that can cause communication issues. I have a really great team that works for me, we get along great and they are very loyalty. The hardest part of the job is trying to get 9-12 poses with every family. Sometimes its very easy and other times you are lucky to get one. The most enjoyable is getting to know the kids, the family and being a part of their lives and watching them grow."
good,"Sears was a very busy workplace, and could be stressful at times. However, everyone was very supportive. The pay was not very good, but you could easily advance."
good,"Not many hours . People were very nice and helpful. I liked working there , I wish they gave me more hours , But I was only temp for seasonal."
good,"It's a competitive sales job. Salary, while compensated by minimum wage, is solely driven by commission of sales. Knowledge of the products you sell is key to driving solid customer support, which in turn drives customer rapport and satisfaction."
good,"I made calls to customers about expiring protection agreements on the purchases such as washers, dryers and televisions."
good,"The majority of my time was spent organizing the warehouse, assisting customers with their purchases, and stocking the store. I learned that attention to detail is an important skill to utilize in a job that demands knowledge in many areas. The office manager was really nice and easy to work for, yet the store manager seemed to be a little lost at times. I enjoyed working with all of my co-workers which made things go more smoothly. The hardest part of my job was lifting of heavy objects without the assistance of a team member. The most enjoyable part of my job was the warm working conditions provided by my co-workers."
good,This work required talking to as many people as possible to explain the services that Sears was offering. I am a gregarious person and therefore I enjoyed it a lot.
good,*Runing store ready meetings to set up the day with sales and matrix for the day.
good,It was a very good experience. I enjoyed the time I had with the kids and making the parents happy!
good,"Generally my day begins with review of the previous day's sales figures. then the normal management tasks..(i.e. reviewing overages, shortages, shipping, and receiving of high value merchandise...etc.) Training of new employees, and meet with the store staff to talk about accident prevention, shrink control, and general safety. Then to the camera room to monitor the goings on in the store. The afternoon management team business meeting, conferance calls, giving gaols, and instructions to my staff, then home."
good,Not a bad place to start working for. But management and corporate are quite out of touch with the customers and what they need. The went head first in trying to grab online business and investing in Ipads as replacement for the old school registers instead of trying to keep current customer base and trying to improve at the existing register infrastructure. I hope they go back to basics and bring the focus to store customers.
good,The average day consisted of observing customers and suspicious people in the area of the store
good,"Recieving inbound calls from often livid customers for repairs on products purchased from Sears. The department is really supposed to be a technical support group. However, with minimal product training, it may be very difficult with out extensive knowledge. Goals and metrics on the phones can sometimes be impossible to meet. Especially the ""quality"" part of calls. Sears litterally wants you to be the happiest person in the world over the phone. Even with customers that can be the most rude, hostile, and condesing people you will ever talk to. Most of all the employees are all there to make a paycheck. Few have the desire to move up. Managers can be great or just suck. I went through 4 different team managers in 1 year. However, all of them were very nice, helpful, and understanding. Dealing with the outsourced call centers and several other people who ""pass the buck"" makes the job very frustrating. Overall, I dreaded going to work everyday. But the pay was worth it. Lots of incentives too."
good,"It was just a seasonal job but it needed to be strengthen with core values, management, and policies."
good,"The retail industry is under pressure these days since consumer spending is declining. Sears like others are looking for the niche to keep them afloat. With the rumors of Best Buys possibly in trouble, Sears should capture the appliance and electronics business."
good,"All days are pretty much the same at work. We work in each department merchandising the items according to the plan-o-grams. We have good managers and team leaders who work with us and give us lots of inspiration. We see it everyday our work pays off. Hardest part of the job is when management do not want to understand the issues, it becomes hard to work. All the ladies are around the same age group so working is not boring but makes it fun."
good,"I started out as a cashier then i moved to a assistant manager, when i became an assistant manager the pay went up so that was nice but all the employees were horrible. Then i got injured then got canned."
good,"A typical day includes: Coming to work with a smile on my face, helping customers with questions and also running the cash register."
good,Love the job but company stability is uncertain. I can't say to much this Job has been a wonderfull career.
good,Not a very busy store and not a lot of work hours available.Must get customers to apply for credit applications.
good,Sears had affable management to balance out the unrealistic credit goals.
good,I have worked at Sears for almost 7 years total having left for a year and returned. Sears is a great company to work for. I love my co-workers and the culture that is fostered here.
good,"Managed cash drawer, and assisting in the training of new employees."
good,"Open/close register. Work directly with the Host Management. Work directly with the Doctor of Optometry, pull insurance information and patient files. Help with the selection of frames and ask open ended questions to find out patients needs. Contact lens training for new contact lens users. Adjust,repair, and dispense eyewear."
good,I liked working for sears but I feel like the company could do a better job at providing better customer service
good,"Little Advancement, highly structured, Macro- Managing not reflective of true sales environment"
good,it can be a verey fun place to work for full of fun and friendly people
good,"As a manager, you are put under so much stress over numbers, it kills your morale. When you walk into a Sears, its completely dead, and the employees are so unhappy. Career advancement is a joke, there is none. Being one of the top performing stores means absolutely nothing to them."
good,I loved talking on the phone and helping people understand the product or assist them with activating there credit card.
good,Job does offer ability to increase sales to increase compensation (commissions on top of hourly rate). I do enjoy the challenge of making more sales and compensation. Management is generally helpful. Varied work week makes for inconsistent sleep patterns and disrupts ability to participate in many family events.
good,"I like working at Sears when it is busy, but when it is not busy, there is nothing to do and I get bored easily."
good,"As a first job this place is a great place to work. You will learn about inventory in where things go, learn about product, customer service, cash handling, and working well with your co workers. Most of the salesfloor position are commisioned based so you have to know how to talk to people and sell or else you will not get a good paycheck. They have great benefits for their full time employers and great retirement benefits such as 401k if you plan on working there for a long time."
good,Overall Sears product services is a good place to work. However there is little to no oppertunity for advancement in product services. Sears should have listened to their customers and not to the accountants and top level managers.
good,I was employed for over a year. I was in the receiving department. The current location of the store was once a different company. Our stockrooms were too small for the type of volume of products we received. We were constantly behind with seasonal items being put on the floor. Individualism was more of the process rather than teamwork. Only time policies seemed to be implemented were when we had Regional Managers come around.
good,"Under new ownership, Sears has evolved into an ""in your face"" attitude. Their favorite saying is "" If you don't change, then you will change. McDonalds is hiring>"""
good,in sears they worked around your schedule but store managers and anagers beneath her had very nasty attitudes.
good,"Bonne emploie, mais leur system de computer on besoin d'être renouvelé aux program récent,,,toujour de tâches à faire pour te tenir occupé"
good,Help and assist customers on what they are looking for. Try and satisfy the customers with free shipping and deals that are going on within the store.
good,"Trabajo muy desgastante, muy poco el porcentaje de comision. Buenas prestaciones"
good,Started working here and everyone was kind and taught me a lot on how to work. People help each other out to get the job done. Felt like we were understaffed so lots of work to be done.
good,Nothing stands out negative or positive about this work place/environment. Not a place you want to work long term. Management is professional but not very efficient.
good,"they push you a lot for credit card sales when they don’t do any of it themselves. but overall easy work. fold clothes, check people out, clean section"
good,"Customer service with courteous greeting each customer, Assisting each problem with a positive attitude. Providing a safe and secure environment. Acknowledging each person's feeling about their shopping experience."
good,Has great supervisor hours were alright. I never complained about the work I had to do. Laid back place. Minimal days off always work . Worked on holidays
good,"My job at sears is very close to my heart. This job is my second home. I have learned so many things about customer handling and dealing with customers, how to manage a team."
good,"working on cars and trucks doing alignments brake work front end rebuilds drive line repair ac work coolant flushes , transmission flushes , power steering flushes , brake flushes , all forms of tire work , electrical repair , alternators, starters, batteries, general under hood repairs."
good,"Muchos empleados están cansados y otros no aptos, no se puede trabajar en un ambiente con compañeros que no saben qué hacer y una empresa donde el pago es mínimo y para rematar hacen demasidos descuentos, el sueldo no alcanza y muchas horas de trabajo"
good,"Sears has a great team, apart from there not being enough workers. The workers are always humble and try their best to not let a customer down. I felt appreciated with out any doubt"
good,"Boring. That was the only thing that was bad about working at Kmart/Sears. The job was boring. Overall, I enjoyed my time working at Kmart. It was nice. It was peaceful. I knew everybody and everything there."
good,I was working in a backroom over flowing with inventory you couldn’t really get around and you really didn’t have much to do but unload a truck just making sure things were in place
good,"Was a great place to work, lots of friendly faces and opportunity. Forklift certified and walk about 10 miles a day. Many different departments to work."
good,Good place to work but the compensation could have been more.  The hours could have been for more and the benefits were not very good.  The managers were good.
good,"Typical day would include too much driving (250+ miles), constant pressure to sell more, and pressure to not get any overtime. "
good,Sears was not a company I wanted a continued career with.   Threats of closing our division made for an uneasy work day.   Lack of support from management
good,this job provided a pretty good opportunity for me to increase my cashering experience. worked with some really great people. this job was very close to home but the pay was not very good.
good,It was a great first time experience to learn to sell with commission and base pay. I personally enjoyed the learning skills and opportunities they provided to me.
good,The company was great. I considered it a start up into the IT world as i was part of the noc. The company sadly had to let go of people and resort to offshore to save on expenses.
good,"At this time, work place is fast track as the company is building back up from  previous bankruptcy, but all workers are working to ensure that we continue to provide great service to our customers"
good,Terrible employees. Not good pay or hours for what was worked. Long day’s of nothing. It was a season job but it was ok for the time being. It could be better and better managed.
good,"The have a large of sense of community. They tend to have alot of holiday events. The management is very hands on, in training  there agents for success."
good,A wonderful experience. The knowledge received from working here will definitely be pivotal in my refrigeration career moving forward. Along with life long mentors for support.
good,"I worked here for 26 years and had advanced through the leadership in training program.  They guided me all through my career, and gave me all the tools I need to become successful."
good,terrific and great people to work with always busy and customers were great to talk to and work with co workers were friendly and willing to help others out
good,"Working at Sears is only has fun as you make it, it can be slow and irritating to work at because of difficult customers but its a friendly work environment for older age people"
good,"Would start off with a team meeting, then the gates would open. Help customers on what they was looking for in a tv, led plasma or lcd, what brand did they prefer. When it was slow stock shelves."
good,"Company recently closed. There was high turn over, mandatory overtime. Team environment  and pay was good. Training was also good which help improve customer service skills."
good,I work for Sears for over 20 years. During that time it was a great place to work friendly staff great commission and bonus opportunities. It’s unfortunate that it’s going under at this time
good,"It was an interesting work environment, I was a le to learn a lot and grow as a worker. I just wish that the pay was greater because the pay was not suitable for the cost of living."
good,"Most enjoyable part was helping customers with repairs and sales. "
good,This was my 1st job and the management team that I was working for was great. I learned everything I needed to know surrounding a great customer experience.
good,"It was near the end of Sears when I arrived, so things seemed to be very mismanaged and all over the place, I will say though that the staff were very friendly"
good,"The work is redundant and i am looking for a challenge.  I am very innovative and like change and there is none at Sears.  Management is great a very flexible, they're what makes the job interesting and fun.  They are very loving."
good,Overall sears was a great company to work for. Friendly working environment. Unfortunately they’ve been closed down. If they was still open I would recommend those to put in a application.
good,"Good work place and flexible with hours, although it is commission based. Competitive work floor. Lots of foot traffic due to Costco next door. OK area."
good,"a typical day at work was easy. most days were slow but they really push you to get customers to apply to their credit card offers. your biggest responsibility as a cashier is to assist customers around the selected department you're in, make quick and comfortable transactions."
good,"When I (and many others) first started working at Sears, it was a cool company to work for. Now, there are too many issues at the corporate level, and it effects the store associates. "
good,First experience as a cashier. Dedicated workers who depend strongly on customer service and credit. They train you well and trust you will do a good job. I like that they challenged me.
good,"Sears is fast paced, constantly changing direction and focus on order to respond to market needs. The job itself was great and the team had autonomy to test and execute whatever we wanted."
good,"Sears is a great place to work but the managers push you to ask each and every customer if they want to apply for a sears master card or a regular sears card, i didn’t mind asking each customer, it was just unfair that if you didn’t get enough “credits” (customers to apply for any of the 2 cards) you wouldn’t get hours. I find it unfair that the customers say no because they don’t want to go in debt and i totally understand. It’s all about luck if the customer doesn’t already have the 2 cards and if they are whilling to try to apply for them."
good,"The sears I worked for was closing, therefore there was a casual sort of atmosphere attached to the workplace, however this meant less incentive to work harder in order to gain more, and ended up being nothing more than a job I could do while finishing high school to save money."
good,It was a great learning experience working for Sears. I learned a lot about customer services and de-escalation. The job is fast pace with consent change. it was a challenging position to hold but i walked away with a lot of good experience and knowledge
good,This location was okay to work in. The people here were not super nice were they very social. Sometimes I was left to work on my own and no one was there to help me around.
good,i like the environment and fast paced with a lot of walking and great team. They are closed down as we all know but i still appreciate the time and working knowledge that i gained at sears.
good,"repaired customer appliances in home till tremors in hands forced me to take early retirement , repaired just about every mechanical or electronic appliance that they carried. when all electronic repairs were sent to Chattanooga , Tennessee I then repaired refrigerators and window air conditioners for 21 years"
good,"Its a good first job for teens, that's pretty much all who worked there anyway. It was a very relaxed environment but the pay was awful. I started at $7.25/hr"
good,"Sears is a zombie of a company. While in the distant past it was a might retailer, the 1900s version of Amazon today, they are not much more than a failing retail chain in many dying malls. I had a good experience with the people i worked with, but I was never invested in the job."
good,"Management is very strict on dress-code. Plain shirts, nice pants, business shoes. There is no leeway for disabilities unless with a doctors note. Favoritism and/or carelessness around the office leads to hostile environment. For example, when people should be working, they are on social media. Management doesn't seem to care about correcting the behavior. Quotas for call processing are very low for most employees, but high for me since i can get anywhere from double to triple amount of work done compared to others."
good,All of the people at the store were great people. They were always around to help and lend a hand when it was needed. Everyone worked as a team and that was great.
good,"Trbajo muy pesado en temporadas altas (Navidad, dia de las madres)"
good,You have to be mentally strong and have tough skin from the constant racial slurs and belittling by customers who are deemed always right. And be willing to work and still struggle because you can't get more hours because managers and supervisors are taking all the hours denying everybody but management
good,Fast paced long days - driving to customers houses performing various repairs on various home appliances. Phone technical support as well as OTJ training.
good,"Falta oportunidad de crecimiento a su personal,poca capacitación de su personal en Todas las Áreas."
good,I worked at Sears for almost 18 years. In the beginning it was a great company to work for. There was lots of incentives and company programs. The opportunity for advancement was vast and I moved up to management within a year. At the end the company was struggling financially so there was a lot of stress and the morale was low.
good,Management are adding more work and not adding more pay. Management upped call volume on both inbound and outbound communication.  High stress with very little pay
good,Ok place to work. Laid back environment and the customers were friendly. Had maybe one incident with a customer being unhappy. I really enjoyed working there
good,"Sears has closed however, I left on a family medical leave. I left to care for my mother who has passed in January 2018. I had the pleasure of assisting customers with open a new credit card account, check them in and out, assisting with returns and handling customers complaints before management."
good,I mostly enjoyed working with the people. I did enjoy the department  I worked in. I just wished it was busier. I liked the location of the store as well
good,I fairly enjoyed working for Sears due to my relationship with the managers and other staff but corporate is extremely selfish. Despite this. I would still recommend a job for this company if they weren't about to go out of business.
good,Estuve 3 meses; el capacitador: un cretino más. Pagan en forma.
good,"Calidad humana; nivel bajo. Es todo el dia, y las comisiones iban bajando,"
good,Sears doesn't value loyal and hard-working employees anymore.  When I started there 11 years ago I believe they still did.  Sad to see that change. Sales was fun and a challenge for me.
good,"Essentially the foundation of sears was good ,however the old school boys school was a great disadvantage for employees trying to move ahead in the company .like vultures almost all managers gorged themselves at the trough as the company started to fail taking more than what they deserved. my job was appliance repair. I really enjoyed that task and the people in the office and the customers ."
good,Teaches a good lesson about customer service and productive employees. Very clean establishment with responsible managers and coworkers as well. Very helpful as well.
good,"Sears was always very busy and had multiple registers open, which made it easier to checkout. Cashiers were always quick, courteous and did their best."
good,Empresa donde puedes crecer según tus intereses y prestigios
good,Job is made more difficult due to bankruptcy reorganization and certain managers who are in place only due to tenure. They really want people to work there and thrive and do their best to make things fun within the limited operating budget.
good,I enjoyed working in the warehouse. it was always busy. Enjoyed working on the floor with the public and helping the customers find what they needed. I liked it.
good,Since this company is no longer around it really doesn't matter much. I got to work with some good people and learn many skills. Anything else really isn't worth saying.
good,"The experience has helped me as I continue to work in a suitable environment that suits my needs."
good,"started out great while in training, production floor started out great, but then they started closing  depts and letting people go, on the plus side my supervisor was great and lots of help, i really enjoyed being there with him, he really was there for me when the managers wanted to let me go because of personal off time, ( potty breaks ) then they not my boss kept me from getting my unemployment benefits, i knew sears was going down hill, too bad i grew up with sears, when the store here in town closed, like most my generation ( baby boomers ) cried when they closed the store for good,"
good,I worked there for about two months and everyone seemed to like me and I dint mind them either so I do recomend sears as a good place to work for the summer
good,"did stockroom stuff mostly as a temporary job. I wasn't a super huge fan of the managers, but it was easy entry level work that paid money, so I cannot whinge too much."
good,I Enjoyed Working The People Around Me. I Also Got To Work In Different Areas Of Shopping And Learned How To Multitask While Taking Care Of Talking To And Helping People
good,"Loved my job, but company downsizing eliminated my position, then the store closed soon after, so I guess it was inevitable! CEO was the downfall of this once great company!"
good,"Has been many years since I interviewed and was laid off 3 years ago. I received alot of diverse working background between Retail, Operations, Technical Management and District Leadership."
good,A good place to learn the customer service skills in a real world environment and to better identify my career goals to maximize my quality of life.  Provided another skillset for me to have in my toolbox.
good,"I was eventually laid off from my position at Sears Holdings after almost twelve years with no severance pay.  The management Executives seem to enjoy the ""competitive"" environment of their staff when what was really happening is they were encouraging employees to undermine or sabotage their coworkers efforts, projects and confidence just to see how far one is willing to go to make an extra forty cents an hour."
good,"Loved working there, very easy and hard to mess up. Hired a new manager who was not good at her job. Would not let me sit down even though I had back problems. Tried to get me in trouble every chance she got so I left"
good,The call center could close at any time.  Lines of business are being sold off to stay afloat.  There is insurance through the company but it is expensive and there is a high deductible.
good,"•	My duties were to assist customers with picking up their orders, to assist customers with loading merchandise, unload the trucks and assist with pricing merchandise and staging the floor."
good,"Sears was a very straight forward, human resources job.  There is not a lot of room for promotion, but the people were nice and they kept you busy.  It was a fine experience."
good,"My co-workers made my day and made my job easier to let the day go by. They also gave us lunch on Fridays. The only problem I had was with the assistant manager who was working there at the time, she was hard to get along with."
good,Individual ideas dont matter here. You are trained on a process and that is the process. Not much room for implementing new ideas or ways of doing things.
good,"I would sell to existing customers over the phone and would talk to at least 100 customers per day."
good,Organization was followed occasionally. Individuals were held responsible for issues that were not within their scope of practice. The volume and type of work allows you to learn quickly and stay somewhat busy.
good,"This was an average retail job. Show up, work your shift, got home and repeat .  The do offer and employee discount but little else in the way of benifits."
good,When my location was open it was a good work environment. My fellow employees were awesome people. We all worked together to reach a common goal. Sears was honestly a great company to work for.
good,"Learn a lot from this company, met a lot of good people from this company and good customers, travel lot of cities while working. Company losing  jobs."
good,"Sears/Kmart was a great place to work until they were bankrupted by crooked upper management.  "
good,"I worked at sears for 6 months during college. It was a job, it paid my bills. I left because i finished college and moved out of town. Not much else to say about it."
good,"I worked at Sears during my completion of high school, so it was my first real job. I am a outgoing person, so it was a little slow paced, but relaxed place to be. Customer Service is number one in the retail business."
good,"Maintain and clean airducts,Carpet floors and responsible for washing and maintaning van equipment,Everyday customers service was a must ,overall good place to work for.."
good,clearing the packed boxes out in a fast orderly fashion. Pricing and tagging clothes properly . Hanging and separating clothing in the correct departments.
good,I learned how to work quickly and effectively in a fast paced environment. The managers were understanding for the most part but some were very emotional and mean.
good,Sears provided a great work experience but I could have been payed more for the service I provided. I worked with family so the experience was a great time for me.
good,The job itself was not hard as long as you knew what you were doing on the clamp you were fine. It was working there was not stressful it was easy to make production the pay was just not satisfactory.
good,"Has changed over the years, systems are starting to be updated, company is transition to another company after bankruptcy. Size of company has decreased tremendously over the years"
good,"Sears was a fair, part-time gig. Nohing too exciting for a softlines associate. If you like having a casual pace and helping people/guests pick out clothing, while working with a small team, then go for it."
good,"fun day competitive lots of fun prizes for your efforts "
good,A typical day at work was slowed work paced day full of excitement.  I learned new things with online ordering and more experience with cashiering. The work culture was different because of the different personalities. The hardest part of the job was since it was my first job as a cashier was to learning he cashier and all the responsibilities the came with it . The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new things and I had a daughter at the time so making money for me and my daughter and also becoming independent.
good,I worked loss prevention and my boss was very helpful and guided us with kind and helpful direction.  The camera system was well placed and easy to follow a suspect throughout the store. The working conditions was helpful and working was a pleasure under my boss.  The only bad thing was going to court and having to wait for my cases to come before a judge.
good,"12 hours of unloading three 30 min breaks , its not the time that kills you its the weight and the pay =. now ask your self is 11 dollars a hour worth your back"
good,"Because there were only three people on my team, including myself, and there was a weekly list of jobs that had to be done, there was never a moment where I didn't know what to do. Unfortunately, that meant if you did not move quick enough or suffered a major setback, you could bring the whole team's productiveness down. It was an enjoyable job, however, once I figured out all the various tricks and procedures required."
good,"Worked for Sears for 11 years. I was provided with the necessary tools, coaching and development to progress within the organization.  The workplace culture was very sales performance driven and team-oriented. It honestly felt like working with family. Management was supportive and understood how important work/life balance was. I learned how to coach, lead and develop a team of sales and offline associates. I was also on several projects which allowed me to learn how to change and implement sales and operations strategies to fit the needs of the business and move performance forward.  The most enjoyable part of my job was THE PEOPLE! There were relationships developed that will last a life time. The hardest part of my job was getting the sales associates to adapt to change."
good,like most places it started off great but constant policy changes made it unbearable. i met a lot of good people there both in management and employees.
good,"La empresa es buena, los supervisores deben crear un ambiente de trabajo en equipo a todos los trabajadores los deben tratar con respeto y ser parejos a la hora de evaluación y no crear división entre los empleados"
good,"Can set your own pace to do your job. It’s a shame that the company is in a bad way. They we’re known for products & service but they are in transition and I don’t know what to tell customers. People are nice to work with, hrs are decent, pay is ok."
good,"Eh tendio experiencias malas, el apoyó al personal a la hora de resovler problemas es bastante malo."
good,"Kept me busy and the people I worked with were really friendly and it was a very non-stressed environment. The management team was very good as well, never had any problems."
good,Benefit dont work you over 31 hrs.pays extremely low keep hours low so they dont have to give benefits.no cleaning crew expects employees to do.extra work cashier stocking pricing put stuff up from warehouse.
good,"Al ser un puesto en el que los ingresos son por comisión, en ocasiones se generan roces por mal compañerismo o malentendidos, sin embargo, en su mayoría el ambiente es muy agradable y la relación con superiores es muy cercana. Se cuida a los empleados y se promueven actividades para relacionarnos entre nosotros; sin embargo, las horas de trabajo son algo a considerar y que además en ventas especiales pueden extenderse los horarios sin beneficios ni compensaciones adicionales (café gratis o comida, por poner algún ejemplo), nada más que lo que uno pueda aportarse a si mismo por su propio esfuerzo."
good,The workplace was clean and kept but the functions of the facility were very weak. Lots of merchandise theft and cash theft from registers. Closed for a good reason.
good,"Retail is retail. The hours were flexible, we were short-handed most of the time so hours were given out freely. Nice place to work, customers were mild, nothing too crazy."
good,It was a learning process for me and I was able to teach others to become more safer while working and to resolve matters professionally. Great hours.
good,"clean the floor"
good,"It was an okay experience for my first job. I got hired, when they were closing, so It was like working for a sinking ship. Management kept on changee"
good,"The most important part of the job that it was challenging and exciting at the same time, communicated with people from various external companies and the sense of achievement gained when your efforts resulted in customer satisfaction.  Team atmosphere was always a plus."
good,Sears distribution center moved to different city. I really enjoyed to work for this company my first job. I was fun. I worked in different departments.
good,store team was stressed out not knowing if the store was going to be shut or when. lack of info was hard.lots of personal battles between staff. caring was not a big thing.
good,While working at Sears Roebuck I was a salesman and helped out in the tool department y serviced was required in many ares Shipping & Receiving.Paint department etc.
good,"Sears was a great place to work.  The head office was located in the heart of downtown which made it easily accessible for everyone. Leadership was poor, but peers were great."
good,"I enjoyed working at Sears since I love helping people with their queries, I also learnt time management and handling returns,payments and order. Due to the poor management ,I left the company"
good,"there Shop your way  program is hard to understand "
good,Good place to go for experience but shouldn't be a career move. Facilities and equipment are adequate at best. Your value to the company is determined by how fast you work.
good,"Store closings resulted in challenges related to staffing, sales, loss prevention and morale.  Difficult to stay profitable with deep discounts and tenured staff leaving."
good,I honestly sometimes miss the family environment that came with working at a smaller Sears store.  I would go back for a part time job should the opportunity ever arise.
good,The first 8 years were pretty good and most staff were happy. My last 2 years got progressively worse as there was more expected work and less pay. By the end I was making the same as a new person even though I knew significantly more then 80% of the staff.
good,"We had between 80-120 employees at this location depending on the time of the year. I was over hiring, training, payroll, scheduling, budgeting and employee relations. I enjoyed my job but grew in my skills in both hr/payroll."
good,Sears was a good place to work while I was continuing to find something that better suited me.  It was part time and no real options for advancement at the time.  It was never really stressful or fast paced and would be perfect for a teenager just finding their way in the work industry.
good,"You get to do a lot of different things, you are not just a sales associate. You might be stocking products, loading products for customers, using forklifts, assembling tractors, or even unloading products from semis all in the same day."
good,"In a typical day at work, I will greet over 200 customers daily and 	Processed payment from customers purchase and returns using credit card for over 300 customers daily which reduced the waiting time of the customers. "
good,Wasn't given much training. Put clothes away in proper spot. Put clothing displays up. zDesigned displays to look more appealing to customers. Helped customers look for clothing articles.
good,"A typical day at sears is like working at any General Labour jobs really, its fast pace, fun, communication is key and it well organized. Its a lit job."
good,This was my first job after high school around 2005. I worked in the electronics department selling televisions for a 2% commission and $9.00 per hour. It was a miserable experience and I'm glad the location closed its doors.
good,Fun place to work but management strategy was not productive enough to keep the business running and eventually the company ran out of business and closed down all their stores in Canada.
good,Extenuante horario de trabajo pero buen ambiente..
good,"learned a lot about sales and merchandising, operating the cash register and dealing with customers. One of the hardest parts was cleaning the fitting rooms, but was satisfying when clean"
good,Basic Job if your a sales associate they teach you basic qualities on being a sales associate and how to work a cashier and how to talk to customers and have people skills.
good,Todo el personal es muy amigable y es agradable el trabajar con ellos
good,"It was O.K for a first job"
good,"I enjoyed being a photographer, but did not enjoy the push to sell packages and the very small amount of time allowed for each appointment. The appointments would typically run over schedule and would inevitably back up the rest of the day."
good,it was a good job for me while I was finishing school. every loss prevention agent there was also doing the same.  but we were good at communication and understanding what our roles were and enforced policies
good,"Let me start this off by saying that I learned a lot from working at Sears, and I wouldn't change anything if I could go back in time. I just think that paying people minimum wage to work in the stockroom is unfair."
good,It was great working for Sears Here in a department met a lot of people set up a lot of appointments  Also learn how to clean hearing aids Met a lot of people coming in-and-out of the mall great location
good,"Sears as a company is a good place to advance. Giving the ownership, the stability of the job is always in question. Co-workers are friendly and helpful."
good,Normalmente no hay descansos los fines de semana en la tienda
good,I worked there seasonally when they were in liquidation I quit on December 20th and somehow they put I was terminated on January 2nd  which I couldn't believe it was okay working there but there was a few upper managers that had severe attitudes
good,Loved my coworkers. However I believe managemnet could have communicated with the employees in a better way. Some of the managers seem to always be angry.
good,Its a dying store but it was good for the experience. I worked as a Backroom associate and you had relatively good freedom just do your job and you will be fine.
good,I left the company because I was disappointed by the production side of the business and because the company was cheating sales people out of rightfully earned commissions.  My customers were constantly complaining about no returned calls and poor quality workmanship.  Sears management used false or misleading information to avoid paying the second half of the commission due when the project was installed.
good,I have mainly dealt with customer service and sale teams.  I have learned a lot and improved my problem - solving and customer service skill.  It is too bad that this company does not exist any more.
good,"Very slow location, didnt see much foot traffic. The people you work with treat you like their own and will make you feel very welcomed. If you are okay with a commission dominant position, then this is for you."
good,"Learned to not be so critical in everything did and patience is always key, they took care of their employees.  I hated leaving the company but they closed all the stores."
good,"I haven't worked there in over a decade, so I don't know what I can say, honestly. when I did work for them the company was changing and the people I worked with were great, but it was just no for me."
good,Good company to work for. The Hours are flexible. Store Manager is a good person to work for. The hardest Part of my job is the costumers always trying to gems for free. Disgruntle and hateful to the employees.
good,Sears was a great first job.  The pay was not much more than minimum wage so I could not make this into a self-supporting employment opportunity.  The company is going out of  business soon.
good,"nerver get a complaints from manager,get complements not taking off,always helping other people that need assistance,associates always asking job related questions"
good,finding new business daily was lots of fun. I have to make 200 calls daily and 150 of the calls are cold calls. Visiting different families was not fun.
good,"Honestly a great place to work, but knowing that it will be closing puts a damper on everything and everyone. Really wish it would stay open, and it would be a great place for me to stay while in school."
good,I liked the interaction with the regular client base. The regular customers were the best part of the job because you could always count on them to be loyal and supportive.
good,"Sears was mostly known for its appliances and automobile departments. All others weren't given much priority, and sometimes not dealt with at all, causing sales numbers to decrease."
good,"La gestion, la distribution et la coordinnation de la marchandise en tre les succursales était difficile. Système informatique non à jour"
good,"Managed IT projects for the vendors and other departments."
good,"I worked in a great area of town , but to often we never had to product. we never had any item to out up for customer and horribly management. could be better"
good,"A typical day at work was very busy maintaining the warehouse keeping it organized and dealing, we receive from UPS FedEx and other deliveries co. Also we do a lot of shipping out of merchandise causing us to continually  be totally aware organized and focused on detail on all exported items as well as receivables."
good,Management was really flexible with scheduling and worked around your school schedule. the work environment was great and everyone got along and helped each other out.
good,"I learned a lot regarding late payments and bill scheduling payments"
good,"Selling windows,siding ,roofs and doors is a tough market. Sears quality was very good but people had a hard time agreeing to the price for that quality. I just wasn't hard enough to push people into buying. Just not a good fit for my personality."
good,"Great training always available. Paid for ASE's. Never a dull day. Fast paced. Most enjoyable part was a satisfied customer. Hardest part of the job, the occasional dissatisfied customer."
good,It's making me write a review even though I don't wish to. It has to be over one hundred fifty characters long so here you go. I wish they let you skip it.
good,"Sears has closed most of its stores in the country, and none are remaining in my current area. Sears used to be a great place to work, I had some great mentors that taught me so much over the years and great employees that flourished within the company as well. Unfortunately Sears has not been able to keep many of its doors open especially over this last year."
good,It provided me with a many good opportunities to learn and advance towards a career in IT system support. However most of the systems were quite old and had not been updated
good,"I loved this job, pay was based off how hard and efficiently you would work and I thrived in this type of environment. I love working for flat rate pay. The harder I would work the more I would make, it made being slammed busy almost enjoyable. Unfortunately the company was and has been going downhill for years."
good,"My mentorship experience @ Sears was fantastic. I was able hone up my skills and it gave me the enthusiasm to do repairs with confidence. The people that I worked with were friendly and I was comfortable with both the people that I worked with and the customers that I met doing their appliance repair. I was able to start my day off from a company vehicle and a laptop with most parts needed on the vehicle. Technical support was only a phone call away if needed or I could always call one of the other appliance repairmen for tips and tricks if needed. The days were long , most days but rewarding at the end of the day. I always felt that I made a difference each day."
good,"I worked in the complaint department, which could be very stressful when you deal with irate customers all day long for 12 hours a day. Helped each customer to best of my ability and if I was not able to help would look for assistance from management. The workplace itself was and ok environment."
good,Typical work day starts with morning meeting about sales goal. Will have a lot of customer interaction. Good please to develop communication skills and learn how to develop good customer service skills.
good,Unfortunately this company no longer exists but it was a fun place to work many years ago. Great sales experience and collegial atmosphere. Good learning opportunity.
good,very chill work place managers are nice and know how to communicate and interact with their workers. can get busy at sometimes but it slows down after a while.
good,"It was a job. I went to work I took pictures of kids, adults, and groups. I sold products that pertained to the photos. I showed the customers their pictures."
good,"It was a very nice place to work for I learned how to organize shoes, management was fine. The hardest part of job was making sure all displays were perfict"
good,Although they no longer offer 401K match and other benefits are poor they are very supportive of work life balance and flex hours. Also there is a lot of good opportunity for career movement and growth.
good,You never knew how you stood with the company that you worked for and it was always a very stressful environment to work in. There were always rumors of the company going under which made it hard to focus in on your job.
good,Sears was a great place to work whereby you can sharpen your customer service and sales skills real time as you engage with customers and employees.  I learned how to engage better with customers face to face.
good,"Sears was not a bad place at all in fact, I enjoyed the time there until they shut down. I would call people for managers and have them see if items were in stock or send customers over to them."
good,"This job required you to be on the sales floor your entire day.  It started out with making sure the cash registers were ready, floor was clean and product was displayed properly.  Once the store started, I managed my department and ran the manager on duty phone which allowed you to assist with customer complaints."
good,Sears was a temporary job for me but not too bad to work for. The pay wasn’t anything to write home about but it helped get me through. Sadly most stores are closing in the very near future and employees will be out of work
good,Sears isn't totally bad the pay is whatever compared to a cashier position. Weekdays theres no one at the mall and typically you'll be talking to your co workers most of the time. Weekends is where the money happens.
good,It was a great place for my second job.  I learned a lot about retail.  The people I worked with were great.  I would do this again.  I enjoyed my time there.
good,"So this was a place where it had its ups & downs. Some of the management were good where they'd follow the ""open door policy"" and would try to help with the situation at hand but the benefits & pay were very poor, you got vacation time but no sick time, i had 3 managers when i worked there: one i liked(who quit to work somewhere else), one that showed nothing but favoritism to everybody on his team but me(He quit as well) and the last one i liked as well. The company definitely had no career advancement for anyone never mind me. But the Sears i worked for is now closed down."
good,"It was a job that was close to home with flexible hours. It was enjoyable at the time, but it wasn't permeate for me. I learned a lot about customer service there."
good,"Was able to advance within the company and received great training while employed. Store closings limited advancement to other areas. "
good,"It was good while it lasted, it's a good temporary job. You get an employee discount and very flexible hours.Good job for a student or elderly person."
good,Having this job taught me how to greet people and it also improved my social skills. It was a cool job because everyday you went to work you  had to talk to someone. And also i was surrounded by great co-workers. days got a little hard sometimes though because the store wasn't getting that much business.
good,"Good company to work for, Worked in order desk placing customers orders. Part time 12 hours week. Good friends to work with. Sears closed out of busness"

good,"I started out liking it, but due to the stress level I couldn't wait to leave. You didn't have one boss you had 5 and you had to please all of them. I left to start my own business."
good,"The training was competitive fair, just a a lot of favoritism with managers within the organization in reguards to shifts, I felt discriminated against, I was a employee with Sears Retail store, I love working in the store, nothing wiat I experience in call center."
good,Every day we met to discuss the current goals and expectations of the day. After that we all kept each other accountable to reach those goals and make sure we were on target

good,"mas o menos, pues bien pero a secas"
good,environnement de travail intéressant .Contact régulier avec la police de st-jérôme .Le congédiement d'un employé suite  a une infraction majeure du code d'éthique était la moins agréable des taches mais toutefois nécessaire. Suite  a des visionnements par les caméras l'arrestation d'un ou des suspects de vol s'avérait parfois difficile.
good,"Counted drawer before shift, and process purchase daily. I had to maintain the cash rep and issue sears credit cards. The work place was relaxed and quiet. The hardest part was issuing credit cards. I enjoyed learning how to become a cashier and work in retail."
good,"ok place to work. pay was decent. overall great room for advancement and great co worker, the hours were pretty good as well. it would be a great place for a highschool or college student."
good,this place was very busy as this was the last time that they were going to be open. great business felt very bad that they closed down. they had very good deals and would recommend when gift shopping.
good,"This company is an alright place for start out mechanics, but the lack of proper management causes uncalled for mistakes to occur. And lack of customer satisfaction."
good,"It was an easy job in high school and was flexible. However, did not get enough hours and it ended up not being a good fit for me. they  were good at being flexible with hours."

good,Not the best place to work . Hours were very minimal. As to why I did not work there for very long. Enjoyable part of the job was commission that was received on some catalogue products
good,to often leaders seem to be more like followers of idea and implementation of ideas that they know do not work and will not work for a global company. They need leaders who think globally about how a business survives.
good,"Sears was a good environment.  It was physically demanding going but the staff were good, management team backed us up."
good,"we always start our day with a meeting and talk about what is needed to be done today while talking about yesterday Goals being met."

good,This was just a stepping stone job while I was at school getting my degree. Not a bad place to work for. It is no longer around though. Met a lot of good people.
good,"The work, is pretty easy, and if your just looking for some extra cash then its fine. Besides holiday season there isn't much hours available if you're in need of it."

good,A typical day at work was giving those getting their driving license their oral driving and driving instructions. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to people.
good,"Sears was my first employee when I moved to in Dallas in 1977.I thought it was bomb at the time,but somewhere down through the years things begin change. Benefit package was always good but not so much the pay. I  learned a a lot in corresponding with the vendors and accounts payable."
good,"Company is struggling, so not fair to comment. Overall I’m happy there because of the teams I work with.  Good culture within my small group and support department."
good,Taking a day off at sears is tricky especially if you haven’t been working there for a long time. If you don’t speak to any of the managers about taking time off and just write it on the calendar you will be terminated.
good,This job is no longer available. Sears at one point had a portrait studio. The studio managers and employees took photos of children and families and sold products and photos to the customers after services were provided.
good,the workplace environment isn't a bad place to work at all. the work isn't really hard and the people who work there are actually pretty chill as long as you do your job.

good,"My job was to handle inbound calls from customers that had a charge card with Sears.  I took request for credit line increase, payment arrangements, authorizing purchases for the cashiers in the store.  I handle several states at our call center.  Sometimes, the calls had to be transferred to collections, retention and supervisor (upon customer request).  I had a quota to meet on a daily basis this was divided by the number of employees and the average amount of calls received on a daily basis.  All calls are recorded so, you have to maintain a smile while talking, be precise and accurate on information that you are relaying to the customer."
good,"Sears was very ‘whatever’ towards things. Never got my schedule/ hours right after several reminders. We did have a general sales goal for credit cards, but no one ever enforced it"
good,"Te hacen desarrollar el diálogo con las personas, a tener paciencia, tratar de llevar un ambiente laboral cómodo, la capacitación es constante. Solo no hay pago de horas extras, el trabajo es excesivo y es muy larga la jornada de trabajo, los jefes son pesados y poco accesibles. Te mandan a cubrir áreas que no son tuyas y es responsabilidad tuya lo que pase en ese departamento aunque no tengas conocimiento de los productos."
good,"Love the people"
good,"It was a good place to work at first , but then the company changed."
good,"Worked here throughout high school, developing my customer service and sales skills. Help me understand how to better interact with customers, as well as management. Great employer to get some experience in the workforce."
good,"Prepare displays, post price changes. Resolve customer issues. Assist customer with product selection. Prepare new appliances coming to the floor for display."
good,"This was a challenging position.  Management had to follow corporate guidelines that don't always match the local needs.  You can meet many people and learn about sales, merchandise, and management."
good,"As part of Sears University, I had the opportunity to design and develop training for management development, coaching, team building, retail sales, and product knowledge."
good,"Typical day monitoring over 2000 sites"
good,"You can travel as much as 200 miles per day. Learned to feel comfortable traveling in unfamiliar areas. Management was rigid. Work place culture - 10, 7, 3. The hardest part of the job was traveling to an appt. 2 hrs. in one direction and finding out that you were given the wrong address, or its a vacant lot or what they have requested we don't even sell or do. Plus this job is 100% commission. The most enjoyable part of the job is when every thing goes right with the sale, the financing and your commission statement is correct. There is potential to earn a lot of money, but the Nashville market is very hard place to do it in. Therefore I was forced to resign."
good,The beginning of working at Sears was great a lot to learn. After so many years upper management had lost contact with the store level and as a result they are closing stores through out the area.  Sad to see an American icon disappearing.
good,"This was a great beginner job for any teenage person still in high school or working part time. Management was super nice at this store, however not much room to move up in the ranks"
good,"-It has been so long that I've worked here I don't have an opinion"
good,Many Sears stores are closing down. Employees are being layed off. Not able to have holidays off to spend with your family such as Thanksgiving. Only upper management have a better opportunity for job security.
good,te da buenos beneficios y prestaciones tienes sueldo base y comisiones y te dan una aportacion en la compra del uniforme
good,Good job if you're a high schooler wanting some extra cash and it isn't that stressful. it does get a little hectic on Saturdays and Sundays but that's any retail job.
good,Systems were outdated and added additional workload
good,"I had a great manager who cared about his employees. He taught me a lot and I've become the best agent on the team thanks to his leadership. He tried to give me a pay raise due to my high apprehensions, merchandise recoveries and attention to store safety but the Store Manager never approved."
good,Part time work. I was hardly scheduled any hrs as studio was closing. Position came with lots of perks with-in the photo studio. Was pretty professionally kept.
good,"Great Bonus structure to receive big pay outs and incentives. Great hourly pay! Fail to meet goal 3 months in a row,you will gone! Even after eight years"
good,"Good Company with challenging marketplace.  The internet has definitely changed the way companies do business, and this is no exception.  I wish them the best of luck."
good,"It may have changed by now, but while management was actually pretty solid, most of the  workers were teenagers that refused to work and had no consequences to their actions because of how understaffed the store i to begin with."
good,"You'll be understaffed working with sears, Its a company where if you work hard you can advance. It just scary because sears is a dying company and at any time you could be laid off"
good,We worked hard on these homeowners to set up appointments for there home. l was one of the top bonus employees we made little hourly pay but our commission was great.
good,I worked there many years ago and can't say how the job would be now to work there.  It was not bad when I was working for Sears except for the pay.  It was minimum wage and there was no advancement or pay increases.  I worked there for 5 years and only made $7.25 an hour.  I ended up having to find a different job that paid better
good,"Typical retail job; need to be able to keep yourself busy, have customer service skills be patient, and keep a friendly demeanor with your customers. Typical retail."
good,I really enjoyed the job as assistant store supervisor but was disappointed when I was told I was being let go because the store was closing. I was given no warning.
good,"See above, it's a retail position. No experience is typical and largely depends on the location, staff and client share of local market. How far you go in a company is dicated by your drive to succeed."
good,"sears is a brand name in the us, i enjoyed working there but the upper management never took into consideration the customer and even less the employees like they used to do."
good,"to many hours standing with nothing to do in a slow day. "
good,The vision to improve the financial standing is solid. The challenge is the tendered managers that revert to old ways when under pressure. You most stay true to your values of a manager to keep the vision going.
good,An iconic store.  Sad to see it go due to the store closure.  There were a lot of great people that worked there that are now without jobs.  It was a very unfortunate event.
good,Store closed due to not making enough Net operating income.  Store across the country has been closing.  Had enough work life balance to live outside of work.
good,"Sears had a great team that I worked with and I was able to grow my skills with Procurement activities."
good,"No growth potential, gone out of business. Eratic work hours, Pay system is flawed and unfair. Poor management at all levels. Good place for unskilled workers."
good,"Friendly  place to work, selling major household appliances. Sears sold all major brands of appliances. Sales people worked on a rotation of sales people to service customers as they came into the store."
good,El trabajo es bueno pero el crecimiento es muy poco.
good,"I know that Sears is a business that is teetering on going out. I believe that it has run it's retail course."
good,"Work here if your going to school, other then that I do not suggest that anyone work for this company. The management was not supportive to employees, employees could never figure out what we were really getting paid."
good,I worked briefly for collections for the first time here and found out that I really don't like it.  I felt like I was on the floor without a lot of guidance.
good,Sears is very slow paced so it is quite boring on a daily basis. Usually just standing and waiting for customers. Management and coworkers were fun to work with.
good,It is easy to meet the sales goals if you just offer what you are supposed to on every call. Sometimes there will be mandatory overtime as well based on business needs.
good,Strong company with a very good vision of the future of retail. Implementation of all moving parts in a big company like this is proving to be very difficult for them.
good,"For a job to have while in college, it had a really flexible schedule. Whatever time I needed off, all I had to do was request it off and I got it."
good,"I was a cashier so I had to stay in a box my whole shift until I transferred to the Photo Studio. The Photo studio was very fast paced and I had to deal with difficult customers, I transferred back to a cashier because I was offered full-time but was ultimately laid off because of holiday sales being down tremendously."
good,the company needs to be updated to the century we are in.  The product that was being inventoried at the store did not meet the quality of same product purchased from online stores.
good,"Good culture"
good,"As my first job in the state of Georgia, I found that it was a great stepping stone to my current occupation. It offered me a wonderful time to meet different people and adjust to the culture of the area."
good,"If you like a competitive atmosphere where you can make commission off of sales, this is the place for you. Sears provides worker with 401K benefits and dental plan options."
good,Good first job for people straight out of high school. Offers training to all their sale associates with vacation days. management cares about their employees and their careers.
good,"Was a good place to work with a storied history."
good,"I worked during the holiday season so it was quick paced. However, I wasn't trained so it took me some weeks to adjust and learn things on my own. Nice experience though."
good,"Excellent work environment, great area and environment. Great starting job, Not a full time career.  Customers were always friendly Best part of the day was helping them find things they needed/wanted."
good,"Good company to work for; boss was great.  Made some good friends. Work day was pretty decent unless it was peak time, then it was a 6-7 day work week."
good,I would come in for my shift and pretty much straighten out the merchandise and restock if needed.  I would move around to different areas of the store if I was needed elsewhere
good,Not the best job ever but not the worse. I had a great time working here for a while. Great discounts for the employees. Sears gave me knowledge on how to approach customers
good,"The store manger at the time had his favorites and didn't seem to appreciate anyone who wasn't on that list. Started as a temp employee for the holidays and was hired on full time. Learned alot, and received the necessary training to learn cashier, shoe department, and loss prevention."
good,Working at Sears has been a learning experiance for me. I ran and operated the whole store. Management is great. They stay on top of you. Very high goals. It can be very stresfull
good,"buena empresapara trabajar por el ambiente de trabajo, tienen peésimos sueldo base, demasiado bajos. Aparte no reciben reingresos."
good,Sears is a good place to work they care about the customers and are always running specials to stay ahead of the competition. They also offer classes and trainig to help associattes.
good,Credit Apps are their most important goal and it can be stressful and effect your hours negatively . The workplace culture is very close knit and welcoming.
good,"Sears helped me grow professionally in many areas, but the career growth in Michigan was limited with the headquarters being in Illinois. Now its shrinking faster than you can blink."
good,"Hours were inconsistent. I enjoyed working with the customers, but I had to upsell a very high interest credit card. I was uncomfortable with this and when I didn't hit the numbers (within a month of being hired) I was demoted."
good,When I graduated high school this was my first job and I enjoyed it.  The first couple of years was fun working here until they made too many changes that affected my hours and my checked.  I had to look for a different job to support my family.
good,"easy and flexible part time job. great for students. productivity is easy to meet. company is going out of business, so hours are low for all employees."
good,Pago menos al mismo puesto .  por ese motivo renuncie . por no ser justos y no valorar a sus empleados
good,"I worked at Sears for a summer job, we loaded and unloaded trucks. It was a simple job that required hard work in the physical aspect. I enjoyed it and am glad I partook."
good,Sears was a great company to work for.  It was a real laid back environment which provide flexible hours to it's employees.  They also allow some employees to work on Sunday to pick overtime.
good,Sears is a very average place. It's easy to advance if you work hard but the pay is too low. Way extremely too low. Like half of what it should be. But the work is decent.
good,"waited for customers to assist"
good,Achieve the expectations set daily and maintain effective work atmosphere to accomplish task that is needed. Making sure associates are being held accountable to drive daily goals.
good,Enjoyed for the most part working there. Was a mentally challenging position while I was there to collect from clients on a daily basis. Taught me a lot on people skills.
good,A regular day at sears consists of ringing up customers/folding an cleaning the store. Usually a slow day. Ive learned a lot at my job that will benefit me in the next.
good,"Sears afforded me my first job in a competitive sales environment. It helped to instill a sales mentality which has helped me in future jobs. While a lot of the sales trainings, which were done unpaid, were very redundant and seemed unnecessary."
good,a typical day at work was predictable. I learned to interact with people on a business level. The management wasn't very involved with too many daily routines. The work culture was loose and taxed. The most enjoyable part of the joy was interacting and meeting new people.
good,"Good people to hang around with while at work. The management would expect more from us but it was hard with no customers to sell to. If you work hard and got credit apps, you would get more hours. The thing is Sears had very little customers coming in and getting credit apps were impossible."
good,"It was a commissioned sales job that was mostly fine for a college freshman. I can't say it was enjoyable, but it was good work for decent pay.It's where I first learned how to be a salesman, and where I got a lot of my sales techniques from."
good,fun job. every day was different due to being a roving maintenance technician for 6 stores. Paid travel and mileage. each store had different things needing fixed not including scheduled work for PM's.
good,This job was a lot a fun to work for. It was seasonal however and when spring and summer came my income dropped down to 6 dollars an hour. In winter I averaged 15 dollars an hour.
good,"Overall, there needs to be some improvement in the way that all of the departments operate and interact. The difference in operations is confusing for customers and creates issues for management."
good,"Received new stocks of clothes along with new shoe stocks,daily."
good,I worked at Sear's a very long time ago but remember the family environment we had in our small department. This department was very secluded from the rest of the store.
good,"Despite what many think about Sears Holdings, leadership always encouraged innovation, trying new and different and don't be a afraid to fail   Great way to innovate"
good,First retail job. Sad it shut down. But management was ridiculous. Got out in time before all the major changes happened in 2014. Had a really high turnover rate.
good,"Not the best company as brick and mortar stores are a thing of the past at this point. This is effecting sales, and overall company revenue. I wish the best for my old teammates. \"
good,"This was a temporary job for me around the busy Christmas holiday season. I wanted to work beyond this but was not presented the opportunity. In hindsight, it was for the better as a managemnet position for me became available."
good,"Sears was a pretty fun job actually, I worked in the Dock or Receiving while I worked there which seemed like on the the easiest jobs to do there, just unload trucks and help customers load items into their cars."
good,Some days I really dreading going to work because it was so boring there. Not that many customers would come and shop so that made the time drag so bad.
good,"I dealt with sears customers concerning Sears parts and repair service issues."
good,It was great for a high school student who didn't have many options. My DECA teacher was able to help me get hired at sears. She knew someone eho was looking for a great worker. She referred me and I stayed three years.
good,"I really don't remember much about Sears. I know my coworkers were wonderful, we had a great friendship relationship between all of us. I still keep in touch with a few, great people!!"
good,Good place to work bur company in morrisville closed down I loved to work for sears and enjoyed working with co-workers. I wish this company was still open
good,"Sears was a good place to make connections with other people and customers, and if the company weren't in such steep decline, would offer good advancement opportunities."
good,Sears was an ok place to work but there is little opportunity for growth.  The company does not provide adequate pay and the atmosphere in the business is not positive.
good,Business model does not provide adequate revenue.   Logistics and fulfillment were a constant issue trying to get merchandise to cover existing sales made to customers.
good,"It was a job that was quick and as soon as I started, I knew I wasn’t going to stay for long. I’m not as good with commission and if you don’t make enough credit card applications when it won’t go well for you."
good,Working at sears in Fresno was always challenging yet fun. I would engage with the customers on a daily basis. I always upsell and actually get to know their wants and lean them towards what they need done. Im straight forward and honest with them and give them a fair price. I also worked with auto zone because thats where we ordered our parts for pick up.
good,Assisting cutomers with choosing their appliances. I gained extensive knowledge about appliances. The management staff was continually changing. The workplace culture depended on which GM we had in place.
good,I learned a lot my 15 plus years with Sears. It was a great place to work and shop. They use to train and cross train everyone. It was easy to move from one area to another and make advancement. In the 80's and 90's the company really cared about their employees. I really enjoyed working there. The company rapidly changed into something I don't recognize.
good,Overall not a bad place to work. Company is struggling and has closed a ton of store on both sides.  There is room for advancement and benefits are not bad as well
good,"Job was fun and co-workers were easy to get along with. Multiple job descriptions to learn from or move to within the company, managers were helpful and always there."
good,"There was plenty of work, between online orders, backorders and customers in the store. Inventory counts and reports kept the inventory accurate and helped drive sales. Training was encouraged and associates were able to gain access to training."
good,"I spent the last 9 years working at Sears. This was actually the third time that I worked for the company! It was a great experience, and I am saddened to say that my store is closing."
good,Pues fue agradable hasta que me cambiaron a un área donde no se vende pero el ambiente te con mis compañeros fue agradable
good,"The only thing about retail is a lot of standing.  Sears have flexible hour. work place was okay, you perform different tasks, making sure customer find what they are looking for."
good,"Great place to learn about Retail Domain channels both instore and online and all aspects of Financial Services operations, External bank interactions"
good,"Working in the warehouse, things fall into your lap and suddenly become your responsibility even after your plate is already full from things that aren't technically your job."
good,I had a difficulty with the management and how the sales were running. The job was very stressful and lack of hours. I want to do more so I can be financially stable.
good,"I loved my team I loved all the people I worked with. Although the position I absolved Did not work for me does not mean it would not work for someone else. Would have loved for the position I had would have paid more, but for the position and the duties it entailed it was reasonable."
good,"Es un buen lugar para laborar, en puesto de medio tiempo, las personas son agradables inclusive los superiores, siempre estan intentando enseñar"
good,Was my first job when I got out of high school as a salesman I did learn much from that position and experience there so if you’re into sales or want to start learning about sales I recommend Sears as a starting ground.
good,"Sales oriented company. Constantly busy, organizing floor and assisting customers. Flexible schedules and plenty of work to do during the holiday season."
good,"An Office Associate day is based on supporting the management team, preparing the  cash office, daily store deposits, and clerical assignments. My duties would also include preparing and processing payroll for sears and sears automotive store, talent acquisitions, filing, training, and other human resource duties."
good,Do not wish to do a review due to the work force reduction occurring at Sears at this time with all of the closures and possibility of the company no longer being operational.
good,There is no job security. Unfortunately Sears is still doing business as if it were the 80's. Needs to be more up to date with the competition. Better pay for their employees and go back to being a company that cared about their employees instead of being greedy. Listen to their employees who work in the field and see day to day business.
good,I worked there for a short time and it was nothing extraordinary. Salary was low considering I had almost no experience and the environment was somewhat friendly.
good,i worked doing merchandise pick up for a little over a year the pay wasn't the greatest for what the job required which i left to work in the auto department which was a little better
good,"Good company to work for, laid back job, does get busy but you have time to rest, management was ok, only problem is not enough hours to make a living off of."
good,"not a bad job, just taken advantage of. took my kindness for a weakness, manager took any and all credit. other than that a good store and a great company"
good,worked on the street performing repairs and maintenance. was not harassed about work. was trusted to perform work and was held accountable at the end of the week.
good,Buena empresa para laborar con todas las prestaciones buen ambiente de trabajo
good,would help customers load their cars with heavy items that they bought in the store and made sure that all products were stocked and had the proper labeling on them
good,Job security is a real issue with all the stores closing in retail.  My store closed this year now having to find new employment.  Quotas seemed to take a higher concern than the customers.
good,"As most people know, Sears isn’t doing well financially. Because of this, the stores can’t hire many people, so expect to work really long shifts at least 3 days a week. That can be a positive or a negative depending on how you look at it though. I started out at Sears during my senior year of high school as a cashier, and the company went through some serious changes during that time and changed a lot day to day things (got rid of several departments, fired some longtime employees, took away our employee discounts,etc.) By my last month there (I quit because I was moving for college) I ended up being one of the 5 others still working in my position. I  typically worked 5 days a week, 8-10 hour shifts each day but that’s because I had been there a while. When you first start you can probably expect less. Management wasn’t terrible but, they just refused to hire more people and often made mistakes with the sheduling (like sheduling me on days that I requested off). They judge you based on the number of credit card applications you get, which can be hard since the benefits of getting one aren’t that great and not many customers shop at sears frequently, but it’s also a plus sometimes because  the managers regularly threw parties to encourage/celebrate reaching our goal for the month.I personally wouldn’t work here if you’re looking for longterm just because the company is failing, so you never really know what other big changes they’ll make in the future. Like I said, sears isn’t doing that great financially, so on a typical day, business is pretty slow. It could get boring at"
good,"I worked at Sears Travel for College. I answered phones, stamped brochures and talked to customers. I had a good experience with Sears Travel. The staff there were nice and very helpful."
good,I don't remember too much about this job. I do remember not liking being on commission. It was all I could get at the time so I was content with job then.
good,"le management n'était pas bon, les tâches à accomplir étaient imprécises et les remplacements était compliqués à gérer"
good,"Good job to work for mostly, good bosses mostly.  Notvenough raises annually.  Not enough reveiw's that lead to an actual raise.  Good co- workers mostly.  One or two that did not work at all and got away with it."
good,"It was a great college job.  I learned a lot about reading peoples body language and that, to this day, still helps me out in every day life.  I would recommend it as a temporary job.  It does, however have a chance at advancement and help out if you're interested in law enforcement type jobs."
good,"This is a steady paycheck, management doesnt really pay attention to what you do. you basically come to work do your job and leave they offer popcorn every now and then. It wasnt always like this when I started 5 years ago but now our center is closing and being moved to Roundrock Texas so, yea"
good,J'ai appris a travailler avec les gens et travailler en equipe
good,"Once you are punched-in it is straight to work because your tasks must be completed at the end of your shift. "
good,"Location was close to home and the campus offered car repair, tax return service, 5th Third Bank, a large cafeteria, outside seating with pond, health club, wellness center with private rooms if you are ill."
good,Employees are given too little hours and affects coverage in the store. Poor upper management and do not appreciate employees. Employees do not seem to like their jobs.
good,Buen trabajo prestaciones y dias de descanso agradables
good,Es buen lugar de trabajo solo q no tienes posibilidad de asender de puesto
good,Ambiance de travail cordiale. Bon esprit d'équipe. Excellente relation avec la supervision.
good,This company is /was going down before I started my career here. I seen and learned a lot while at this company. I think the best part of working here is getting to know so many great people.
good,Moving up in this company is always possible just as long as you know how to work hard to achieve your goals.   There are programs to assist you along
good,"This job was a really good job, but after a few months it closed down and people were laid off as well. I was making a decent amount of money and hours."
good,"Great people to work with, met many people who I am still in touch with, unfortunately the company has since closed.  Was a great loss for our community."
good,"Typical cashier job. People try to steal, report it. Make sure your area is clean. Usually slow paced. Find something to do, or the time will not run."
good,"I received on raise the entire six years I worked at Sears and that was only because I switched departments.  Though they did give us incentive, in the form of $1.00 per tire sold, I would have preferred a pay raise."
good,"Some days are so slow they never seem like they'll end others are great. Management style is a ""flavor of the week"" meaning they only focus on one aspect of the business at a time rather than multiple areas for a more sustainable focus (I've observed this at numerous locations I've worked) Sales positions are a commission basis but those can be lost, due to other divisions that are not compensated or penalized the same way."
good,"Nice people but a declining industry.  Work was usually slow, sales were not enough to earn a decent pay check.  Unless one sold the appliances there was not enough sales volume."
good,"Sears is a great place to learn. You gain a lot of knowledge in sales, customer service, cashier and how to get along with people and coworkers. But is a hard place to get a promotion."
good,"This warehouse was a great start got me. It helped me gain experience in material handling, loading, and also equipment operating. Sears has blessed me to gain these experiences and prepared me to be the employee that i am today."
good,Loved working there for the most part. Enjoyed career advancement opportunities. Learned many valuable skills to use during my future managerial career. Took advantage of many of the companies training programs to better hone my job skills. At the end there was restructuring of the company which ultimately led to my departure as my job responsibilities continued to grow but the pay was being reduced.
good,"sears is a company where you do a variety of things. you build seats, you assemble seats, clean your products. The culture is an average hard working people"
good,"I miss the operational policy and process of SHC.  There seemed to be a policy or procedure for just about everything.  I can liken it to a field operating manual in the armed forces, it told you everything.  My current organization does not have the same strengths in logistics or operations and continues to ignore them in favor of advertising.  I miss operational excellence..."
good,"The credit card division was purchased by Citibank so a review of the company would not be fair.  While I was there, Sears was a good place to work with good management,"
good,"When I was hired for SEARS it was supposed to be for a long term position. I liked the job very much and I was able to take what I learned at my previous job and apply it the my new position there. However, the company had down sized significantly and informed me that my position was being eliminated."
good,"Sears is a great place to work, however the pay and benefits are poor. no room for growth, no matching 401k, no sick pay, no pension. Management needs more developing by focusing more on returning the company to profitability and not so much of negativity."
good,Sears used to be one of the great stores U.S.A had to offer but it is a dying business. would not recommend to get into a ship that is sinking. better to look for something else. but if you have to then go a ahead and get a job here but do not  stay too long.
good,Enviroment constantly changing. Managemnt policies proceedures seem to change on regular basis. Focus from management never seemed to align with key position roles
good,it is pretty much a dead end job.  pay raises are really slow or not at all.  Employees are not always appreciated.  Pay is not so great.................................
good,"Well, the place did close...so not sure if this review will be helpful to anyone, but here goes... In the ___ years of working there, there was a high turnover in management and staff, raises were basically non-existent (a lot of the newer recruits were getting paid more than the people who'd been working for 15 years+ in my department) but I guess there's worse."
good,"I would always help and assist customers that needed help, and always offer them things that would help with what they needed. I would also be there for my co workers, even though they could be a hassle sometimes, I would always be the leader and mature person I am and push through the tough moments."
good,Was a good enough place to work before Sears took a hit and started closing down one by one. Fairly good people and room for advancement. Learn a lot of new things.
good,"Working at Sears was actually kinda fun! I loved helping people find what they want, and giving them my honest opinon on certain household products, and other merchandise."
good,room for improvement when understanding employee needs and listening to there ideas in establishing a more functional work environment. its not great .
good,I worked nights and went to school. The end hours were very inconsistent. I couldn't get out at 11Pm and expect to get sleep and focus on school. I had to quick my job.
good,"good job, i worked for a base pay plus commission, made a ton of money working a double on black friday and made good money in general, only worked here for the holidays though."
good,Working for Sears has taught me the meaning of team work. Sear has shown that they have excellent training for their technician. Would recommend Sears.
good,Sears Essential was an experimental store created when Sears and K Mart merged. Interesting combination of the two different stores that didn't seem to quite work as it closed after just a few years.
good,Working at sears loss prevention is absolutely a mixed bag. The main responsibilities are to apprehend shoplifter and to minimize loss of of asset whether it be monetary or physical goods. The job is only as enjoyable as you make it out to be. The compensation is low but it is a great place to get started in the security/public safety field.
good,"Sears doesn't like to promote from within."
good,With the stigma of not knowing when Sears would go belly up was my biggest concern. When I worked there I enjoyed myself and my co-workers. Pay was OK but not great.
good,"Sears is a great company. However, the pricing, appointment set-ups and overall geographic area pose many financial issues. The appointments are set with very little knowledge of what the potential customer should expect. Traveling between 400-800 miles per week throughout Southern California was not only exhausting and time consuming, but moreover, the cost to do business with Sears was and is cost prohibitive."
good,"Flexible positions, friendly managers, store discount 20% in every merchant which is very good and helpful, nice people, nice store, every body likes to help you"
good,the company was a good company to work for but changes came around and employees lost many benifits due to new take over of the comapny. new policies were issues.
good,"As a cashier I did credit duties, greeted and served customers, closing and opening duties. Needed to meet a quota every month to have customers apply for credit card."
good,"Slow paced, Sears doesn’t get a lot of business. Managers and co workers nice. Everyone seemed stressed to make sales since Sears was going out of business therefor weren’t getting a lot of costumers."
good,"Critères élevés concernant l'apparence du magasin, pointilleux sur le moindre détail"
good,"If you're a student then it would be okay. But you will not know when you're working until thursday, if all goes well, for the work week Sunday-Saturday. Which means you cannot plan anything if you have errands or anytype of life to balance. the commission is below my standards and they took away our employee dicount and replaced it with shop you way reward points, so the money goes to the company anyway."
good,"great staff. to bad that was not able to last, as was a long time canadian business.  bad media exposure this past year due to bad business practices."
good,"hours very and sometimes you dont get leads and if you do sometimes they would ne only one and late at night, leads were given to a tight group which sometimes was not fair"
good,it was great but the store i was in was cloosing down so buisness reaalyslacked off lack of customers it was commision based so no customers no pay if not for that it was good.
good,"My grandmother worked at Sears for forty years and I wanted to follow in her footsteps. I worked for them in three states and they allowed me to transfer. I started as a part time employee, and worked my way up to Operations Manager. During that time I really learned the details of the retail world."
good,"- Good technology"
good,"Usually worked as a team to gather merchandise and stage it for when customers were picking up their merchandise. Which made for building a competitive spirit, but worked together for the same goals."
good,"Overall good experience, fair work-life balance, management was fair.  Concerns over way the business was turning with selling brands like Craftsman and Kenmore had influence over reason to leave."
good,My day would start by coming in and count my register for the start of the day. Then I would walk to the dept checking for any missing sales tags. If any missing print out new ones. Then I would fix any display items that needed fixing. Then I would print out the restocking check list and make sure all display's are in order. I would also check the sales dates on all sales and if needed printed and changed out all weekly sales tags.
good,"Ok work environment, fairly easy to move up, rough customers, decent staff. learned good customer service skills and how to lead a department. Enjoyed some of the customers and coworkers."
good,"Working for this company was fun because they give you incentives for doing your job. Some days are tougher than others, just like any other job but you work for your money and that's what encourages you to do your best."
good,Sears was a great Company to work for. Had an amazing experience leading a team who helped make a difference for the company. Our main objective was to ensure accuracy in pricing and providing merchant support.
good,"A typical day was a very rewarding, working with a diverse team."
good,"Decent place, friendly people. My biggest complaint was with a transitioning supervisor not knowing the job but all in all ok place if you aren't planning on staying long since they will eventually go under."
good,Ser encargado del departamento de atencion al cliente con manejo de entrega de mercancia y manejo de personal y atencion al cliente
good,It is an interesting place to work and spend your time.  The core effort is to sustain and only innovate for that purpose. I wish them all the best in their efforts.
good,This job was very easy going. Very rarely did I come across a stressful situation. If you like people and are a people person this job will suit you well.
good,"Overall, not the worst, but not the best."
good,I liked working at sears the only thing about the job i didn't like was that when I had my interview they didn't telling me they were closing. But overall it was a nice place to work even through it was cut short.
good,"A typical day working at Sears, is walking in my scheduled time and clocking in.  Once clocked in, I would go in the warehouse area and report to warehouse lead for work which normally consisted of stocking boxes and moving appliances.  Other times, up in the sales floor we would get calls over the intercom for assistance to carry out appliances or pulling items from the warehouse stock room.  Some of the times, I would do janitorial service such as brooming the warehouse, cleaning the restroom or dusting off shells."
good,Typical day working  with up to 20 Route technicains building and managing their daily routes. schedluling and reschedulilng appointments for existing customers.
good,"Exigencias al por mayor, poca capacitacion; los jefes de piso no saben ser lideres, exigen demasiado, las horas extra laboradas no se pagan."
good,Its a cool place to work. Its real laid back Fun Place to work the boss is real cool its like a family Place Everybody care for each other Its good hours.
good,"I dont remember much about working her, all i did was cashier. It was pretty simple just, made sure the money was correct every morning. Made sure every customer was taken care of in a timely manner."
good,"Very slow moving store in Manassas, VA. We had too many high school kids working there with no experience or maturity at all. Pay was poor for these guys."
good,Sears was a pretty cool job to have back in 2008 it was fun and dependable. I worked a lot of extra shifts that's what I liked the most all the extra money I could make.
good,"K-mart is a great company to work for, but unfortuantely they have had a hard time fighting off the Wally World fiends who are driving good solid business out of town."
good,"good for the short time until my store closed down,also checking to see what my goal for the day was as far as productivity and how closed we were to making that goal possible,the hardest part of the job was dealing with irate  customer that was upset for whatever reason..."
good,It was good environment to work in. Cashier main focus was credit and customer service. No recognition from head managers on being top 10 credit in nation 4 times.
good,Stable hours and only part-time. hours increased on seasonable events. Exceptional crew worked well and with manager. Customer skills improved over time.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet new people every day. Each person comes with a different story, and one gets to listen and learn more about his or her needs. At the end of the day the feeling one gets when you just solved the members needs was gratifying."
good,"I give idea to increase sales.the  store place I mall ,I told him how the person in mall to come to store my idea to put  I to do something in mall..I give the my idea"
good,"Busy days especially due conveyor system in distribution center.  Ability to learn mechanical side while addressing issues of conveyor problems. "
good,"I worked in the shoe department, stocking and restocking shoes. During th holidays was our busiest time and it got extremely hectic trying to restock with all the customers, but we made due."
good,"It was an interesting place to work, but I definately had a few issues with how it was being run. The management tended towards incompetant, other than the leads, whom were often promoted from the departments. Thankfully, there were a few changes reciently, and things have gotten better. it is a very fast paced job at times, but sometimes it is extremely slow as well. Random, depending on the day."
good,I didn't like this job. I rather work in a fast-paced environment that keeps me on my toes rather then a slow-paced environment that gets me sleepy and really bored. Job doesn't keep you interested. Wouldn't recommend working here for the rest of your life.
good,"Multiple duties. Manager staff was well seasoned and helpful.  Problems with the job were set by corporate, with cuts in hours and number of stores nationwide, and the economy, with online shopping becoming more prevalent."
good,Nice place to work coworkers are friendly and very helpful everything is team-based management always had employees best interest and helped in anyway they could to get jobs done and meet the deadline
good,Working for Sears was a typical retail environment. Stressful and faced paced daily activities with sales and goals. However the constant change of District Manager and overall corporate view changes monthly. Very poor morale and poor compensation in comparison to other large retailers.
good,"Customer service, marketing, merchandising, selling and managing team. I learned to interact positively with every kind of person. Our management team was excellent through out the years. Workplace culture was making that sale and making the customer happy. Hardest part of the job was leaving. Most enjoyable was the people I worked with."
good,"Everyone I worked with at sears was very good at there jobs. IT was"
good,"Associates in our Sears Call Centers support our members through their channel of choice: phone or chat or email. Whether the goal is to assist with a simple product repair over the phone, resolve a delivery issue, sell a Home Warranty or appliance replacement part, or schedule a kitchen remodeling project, our goal is to provide an outstanding member experience and offer services and products that improve the lives of our members."
good,"Slow pace work evironment. nice people, very clean, hardest part of the job was working with product you dont really know about. manager never on the floor."
good,meh its was ok but the pace is slow and its boring at tiems and the staff isnt collaborative at all its just a mess and the managers dont know how to manage
good,This work environment was very stressful but do-able. Prepared to be pushed to your limit and still provide good customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking to the customers.
good,"ce fut mon premier emploi, cet emploi m'a permis d'aquérir des experience de travail"
good,Since the Sears Corporation has been restructured I don't like working or being a customer as much as I used to. Many of the benefits that were once offered to part time and full time employees are no longer available.
good,"Tout au cours de ma carrière  de plus de 35 années au sein de cette entreprise j'ai toujours garder le même sens d""éthique et de travail."
good,The company did not focus on improving sales but managing inventory and payroll. Customer service became less of a focus. Sears now is about making profit off of closing stores.
good,"If your're still in school or just need a side job this is a good place to work. They make the work environment extremely competitive to get you to sell credit cards to anyone, you will even get dinged if you can't sell one even if the person already has one."
good,piloted on a new program to use members phones camera to view repairs needed. learned more skills on computers. Learned how to diagnose and repair appliances.
good,Working warehouse supervisor is a demanding position particularly during peak holiday seasons due to human and inventory management exigencies.  Most other opinions are moot in light of store closure in April of this year.
good,Union company with seniority as the highest benchmark for job qualification. Good departments and bad departments but seniority will determine who is awarded the opportunity.
good,got to drive to different towns and install appliances. feels good when a job is done right and customer is happy . fun to put together different products.
good,My skills in customer service began at this job while I was in my twenties.  The other skills were in understanding the sale and presentation of paint and hardware store items since I was a salesman in the paint department.  Sears paint was and still is a leader in its industry.
good,Sears is actually not that bad of a place to work. There seem to be a lot of aspiring young people who are just trying to get there foot into the door and onto something else.
good,"Based on the job  that I did there were no typical days my work load was based on the Escalation complaints that I received daily.  These came in via email, Social Media, BBB & Attorney General complaints, tech manager requests, etc."
good,A typical paste would entail of maintaining merchandise and assisting customers to provide the best possible customer service to have their needs be met appropriately.
good,Just found out today that they are going to close the Ocala Florida and Belleview Florida Kmart stores in April 2018. But they have a job opening on indeed for a cashier.
good,its was always busy place of work with all the customers coming in and the stocking and cleanliness of the store area you were in. the co workers were fun to be around two i worked in two departments shoes and mens clothing. definately interestig learning the different positons.
good,The work is very easy as long as you are thorough. The people are friendly. It gets very busy around 11am to 2pm. The problem is that the job itself is very boring. It's definitely a good place for someone looking for a job for the first time or a place to work on a college schedule.
good,"Good job for college student or part time work, opportunity to adversify your role in other departments if you desire. Offered training to allow you to increase your skillsets."
good,I was a part-time seasonal worker.and definitely needed during the busy season - -the days FLEW by! - -definitely a plus for a part-time job. And made some new friends along the way.
good,"It was ok, Management could have been better including pay. Not enough room for advancement and certain employees could care less about the job and or customers."
good,"My experience at sears was pretty lame. People were never happy, always complaining about something they were never happy. I was feeling like at was in jail. The boss were not respectful with anybody."
good,"Always have something to do with daily tasks. Learned how businesses merchandise and sell product. Management is ok, willing to work with schedule but have to enforce strict policies."
good,"I think the company at one time had a great track record, but as time went on they lost their edge in the retail sector and fell way short of competitors. As a result their employees suffered via bad management and working conditions"
good,"Receive payment by cash, check, credit and debit card. Greet customers in a friendly professional manner.Maintain clean and orderly checkout areas.  Record and count money"
good,Working there is pretty sad. The Sears brand is pretty much dead! Very few customers usually and the ones who did come in couldn't find what they were looking for. It was not a pleasant environment.
good,"My biggest problem with Sears is the fact that they will change your work schedule frequently and unexpectedly. i had to work one day and i didnt show up because they didnt change my schedule to fit the new plan until the night before. Other than the inconsistency, the company is good."
good,"Selling large kitchen appliances was fun. Interacting with the public and filling there needs was satisfying. The senior sales people got all the good shifts, so it was a bit challenging at times. However, overall I enjoyed cutting my teeth in sales."
good,"Too much of the job stability relied on credit applications, If you were able to entice customers to apply for credit, you were rewarded and got hours, but if not..  I got along well with my managers, although the general manager was a bit harsh.  I liked my fellow employees, most were students.  The store was cluttered and hard to maintain, the merchandise was not consistently put in order.  The pay was low and there was little if no room for advancement."
good,"It was an easy job over all "
good,"Good place to work. I am working as a consultative sales associate. Helping people to find out the exact product for them, drive sales, cash register handling."
good,Fine work place worked at Sears for 25 years. Disappointed it's closing. Was a very dedicated employee and had a lot of great co-workers and friends there.
good,That WAS 25 YEARS AGO !    I had a pretty good time working there. The hours sucked and the pay did too in 1992and 1993. It led to me being hired at my next job at Way Service Center where I was employed for 101/2 years.
good,I worked for Sears for 4 years.  Each year there was a reduction in store management positions.  The owner does not have a retail background and could not operate the company to a profit
good,"The company is not doing well, the retail arena is very comparative."
good,Sears was a good job for me as a teen in high school. It taught me basic office and organizational skills. Learning opportunities were plentiful and the company was very fair.
good,"I really enjoyed the pre-opening meetings/warmups before the store opened. Cashiers were able to rotate to other depts. We helped each other whenever needed. Sometimes I've even worked a double shift...didn't mind and the time flew by! Tests keep you on your toes and remind you what may have not been doing. It's a very interesting place to work. I enjoy seeing family, friends, and just a person, as they were shopping together!"
good,"It was a good place to work, I had a fairly descent relationship with most of the employees there. I would ask for help if it was a big ticket item that a customer needed (television, refrigerator, freezer, etc). "
good,I rather not provide a review. Sears was a great company when I joined. Over the years the benefits were decreased and raises/bonuses became obsolete.
good,slow paced environment workers are nice management seems to care about well being of its employees uniforms policy could be a little better clean and nice
good,Sears went from being a Center where customers would call in to request their appliances to be fixed. Then it became the center to call when customers want to place orders or set appointments for Sears services.
good,not much to talk about. came in every morning to do paperwork and take the money to the bank. that was it. didn't have any problems. they could barely give me five hours a week even when i asked for more.
good,"Good company to work with but everything is done at a slow pace. "
good,"Assisted Potential Customers with Demonstration and & Sales of Informational Technology Related Products and Accessories, Asked for the Sale Sale of Said Products & Accessories and Finally Cashed out Said Individual at Register... Assisted Returning Customers..."
good,"Sears around this time in life is controversial, being apart of the Sears team you will find the job to be very laid back and only seeing hard times on special occasions. Only thing that keeps me at work are the co-workers and staff I am surrounded with."
good,Sears has been a decent place to work for. The pay is good for managers but inconsistent for hourly staff. The family atmosphere is very nice but work can be stressful and demanding
good,"fast paced, steady workplace. Unloading store merchandise as the truck sits at the dock. There was really no down time and you had to be well rested when there"
good,"I was happy working at Sears I felt that if I needed time off or was having difficulty with something my manager was open and willing to help. I was able to work with challenging customers who were angry, frustrated and dissatisfied with their product and I was able to provide good customer service."
good,"Company forces strategies down to managers without gaining buy in or allowing for open discussions.  Misplaced management layers are wasteful and unproductive to units that were already well positioned."
good,"Very competitive among coworkers and management."
good,The store was very big so every one did not know every one. They drive sears card sales hard and its hard to get people to sign up for a credit card sometimes.
good,"Long hours on your feet, quick paced, weekend work, and a lot of angry customers to deal with on a daily basis."
good,"I worked from home, made my own schedule. I was able to deal with my children and wife more. The hardest part was just not having enough resources to help the customer, like not able to transfer them to departments that they needed."
good,"I enjoyed my short time at Sears; the people I worked with were wonderful and though the job could be tedious and frustrating, the work environment was good."
good,"Jai aimer travailler labas cetait bien, jai beaucoup aime"
good,"This job was okay, just very boring.  It was hard to stay awake, especially because the job was so repetitive.  My floor manager was sweet and helpful but didn't call all the shots.  The head managers need to better understand the reality of what happens on the floor though."
good,Sears was at a good location that wasn't too far from my house and also took alot of getting used too. Some of the other employees did not understand the job and weren't really able to explain job duties and other basic job tasks.
good,its a slow calm. well paced enviroment and if if like slow but steady this well be for them.the management is well professional. the hardest part of the job is that
good,"Your first priority is assisting customers with their purchases. Other job duties include resetting merchandise flow, restocking, data entry, and sales. A  balanced overall job but few work advancement opportunities."
good,"Fun, room to grow team.Great exposure to new challenges within, e-commerce, Social Media, Paid ADs, and Business Units. "
good,"A typical day at work was: "
good,Started off pretty good but as the company has lost millions every year and now has cut so many positions that it is hard to take care of the customer. The return policy changed and I have lost customers for life because they were one day late returning an item after 30 days. Writing is on the wall for the company time to move on.
good,Sears automotive was a very slow pace facility. With competitors like Firestone and Discount tires all tech are commissioned base and would typically hustle for the next ticket on the board to get that commission for the services.
good,Physically demanding job. In a retail environment it seems the environment is ripe for dishonest employees. Company was good fro the times and brick and mortar.
good,"I really miss the patients it was a great exprience when the store was busy. I learned lots of things along the way. I enjoyed the times when"
good,Work environment was great. Everyone was very friendly. Every time my shift went by fast because of productivity. Customers traffic was very heavy through out the day.
good,"It was a okay place, only bad thing about Sears. The store was closing, and I had to look for another job. The pay was alright, didn't get all that I was worth. Overall, good experience."
good,n/a it's been a very long time since I worked at sears which is no longer open.  Enjoyed working there learned a lot in the service department and auto motive.
good,The team at sears was great. everybody worked well with each other and we all respected each other. The sears corporate management system was horrible at best.
good,"Eight years ago Sears was the absolute best place to work. I would be there early and truly did not want to leave. Sears then focused on their employees as well as their customers. One example was they provided a cafeteria with on the spot fresh cooking for the employees and customers could depend on its products and service. Now it is completely the opposite. Cafeteria torn down, employees leaving in droves along with their customers."
good,"I worked for Sears for several years. Unfortunately, during that time the culture changed and now stores are closing. I cannot recommend the company, as I believe it will not last much longer."
good,I enjoyed the time I was able to work at Sears it allowed me to still be a good mother to my then 5 year old daughter. I would recommend Sears to another mother.
good,"Great place to learn basic retail skills, while selling mid to high quality products. Good incentives for commissioned sales associates, but overall pay could be better"
good,"Solo por que, casi las ventas depende tu sueldo cuando la tienda apenas se calienta"
good,Productive and fun workplace enjoyed working with the older technicians they were very helpful. Sears provided specific training which you could do when we were not busy and then travel to get more specific training
good,I overall enjoyed my (brief) time at Sears before they went out of business. I learned a lot of valuable skills that I can use in future jobs. My manager was a little bit crazy but to be fair she had a lot of pressure put on her. The hardest part of my job was dealing with rude customers. The best part of my job was working with awesome coworkers.
good,The manager she was a terrible manager and thought that everyone was beneath her. Your eight hours were a living nighmarel when she was in the office. The pay was a joke for what your job description was and everything they wanted you to do.
good,"A place where one can gain experience on sale of products and customer service in store, as well as over the phone. Commissioned sales can be tough if the customer flow is low."
good,"Until recently, it seemed Sears had a bright future. Lately, however, it appears the company is in financial dire straits. Sad to say, but I feel very little job security when benefits and hours begin getting cut right as financial experts say the company is dead in the water and on its way to bankruptcy or major merger."
good,It was cool I guesssed but very very slow and didnt pay awfully well and the business itself I think is going out of business so it doesnt really have a whole lot to offer
good,"I was only here for 2 weeks, so I don't know how helpful this review will be. Working there was okay, I only left because my father passed and I had to move away."
good,The clients are usually pleasant. The day is very routine; everything is completed at a certain time. The hardest part of the day was placing all the diamond items into the safe for it to be then taken out in the morning.
good,take calls from customer's requarding their deliveries.. customer calls to say that the fridge has a golf ball size dent on the side. try to offer customer a gift card so that they will keep the fridge. If customer didn't want the giftcard then do an exchange for the fridge.
good,"Training was okay. Co-workers are friendly. Not a great job for someone with children. Micro-managing was an issue, it was very difficult to prove you are capable as someone is always hovering."
good,This is a typical retail position.  As with most retail companies there is pressure to sell extended warranties.  Evaluations are based on this.  Hours were consistent and schedules posted well in advance which aids in planning for personal business.
good,"working  on day to day things its work, good for my first job working hard and help good team working field, unloading "
good,"It was ok. A little un organized. Needed to get people there that can work and not just miss around. I don't know, I always felt work at work. that's why they pay you. but its not my store."
good,micro managed the entire time i was there an on top of all that i worked alone in the warehouse every shift with very heavy and expensive appliances such as refrigerators and stoves and furniture.
good,I liked working there met new people and were fun to work and chat with the team leaders are great and understanding and would teach you how to do the job if you went to a new department.
good,every one was nice for the most part. sometimes the shoppers were the hard part. working in the back was nice and quiet until the holidays came around. the down side about the was you lose hours after the holidays.
good,Deberían tener un poco de consideración con el cliente
good,Demanded a lot of hours from you on any given day and week. No work and home balance. Company closed down because of the lack of input it wanted from its employee's.
good,"I was a sales representative at Sears for a few months. I actually liked working for Sears, but the problem was that I couldn't get the customers to qualify for credit, thus i did not get paid."
good,"I have the utmost respect for retail employees.  It was not my cup of tea.  Between being yelled at by customers and/or managers, some days were miserable.  Other could be quite pleasant especially when let to do stocking and displays."
good,"I technically felt that it wasnt a great place over all. They generally just stock and merchandise. Stock work isn't really pleasing anyway so if its something your into, be my guess to take a shot at it."
good,great place to work but the company seems to not be doing so well so customers were like barely there. overall i would recommend it though maybe not as a forever career but i dont have much negative to say either.
good,It was a great place to work. The hours were great. The work team was fantastic which made for a great culture. It will surely missed as it closes its doors.
good,"Out of Business . It was typical factory work.  Pick customer orders, prepare for shipping. The hardest part of the day was keeping up with the many different functions of the job that took me away from my primary one.  Check for tickets, grab replacement orders, keep the cardboard under control in the machine."
good,"Working at Sears was a great experience for me as it was one of my first jobs. Daily tasks included, unloading the truck shipment, making in store deliveries."
good,"I loved the people I worked with and for most part it was a good job. The hours can vary from time to time depending on the time of year going from little to a long work week. I enjoyed backroom lead as he always tried to get us as many hours as he could while working with you, if you had another job or had a doctors appointment."
good,"this place was a good place to work. loved the people and supervisors, the customers was sometimes a little up and down but, for most part everything was good,"
good,"good management."
good,Great place to start but don't make it a full time career. The people I worked with made the job fun. It was easy work but the pay just wasn't worth it.
good,Unless you are pushing credit on customers they really don't care about customer service. They will cut your hours if you don't push credit cards. Good people to work with.
good,"Small group of people work there, so time off can be hard to schedule. The benefits are good, days can be long, but with a good mix of staff the day can pass easily."
good,Not a place I'm willing to work again.  Schedule too unstable and no stable work station. Benifits unclear and made to work on certain days with penalties if unable to work.
good,I enjoyed working with staff and customers. It was a rewarding experience to build up on customer service relations and to learn warehouse and retail operations.
good,It was a very slow paced compensation job. The people were nice and it was well managed but the pay and slow paced atmosphere was an issue. I did not mind interacting with customers
good,It is a good part time job for students trying to earn some extra money. Hours are flexible. They work around school schedules. Goals for opening new credit cards and enrolling customers in rewards programs was highly demanded.
good,"The typical work day included, folding clothes, pricing items, and applying customers for the sears credit card. Sears was very productive, quick paced, and very competitive."
good,"If you've worked in retail then this place is pretty much like any other retailer. Management is okay, there's occasionally a manager who does a great job. Applications for credit cards are pushed on a daily basis as are sales for certain promotional items, etc."
good,its a good place to work if you have a desire for sales.If your not a little competitive than you wont make much there. Must take advantage of every customer that comes through the door since business is slow.
good,"Excellent work team, good leaders. Orchard park mall is a good place to work. Good employee sales discounts, good merchandise discounts too. Cons: low salary, sometimes no benefits"
good,for the first job it was a good place to work. geared towards younger employees that need some money. Overall it company taught me responsibility and leadership
good,"It's a good start for entry level folks. However, the job with the best pay is commission only. That is appliance sales associate. Other areas the pay is low. No clear career path unless you transfer. Management is easy to work with and understanding if you need time off."
good,"Sears Holdings Corporation lacks a clear vision of the future. They have a poor and very inconsistent culture. They refuse to re-invest where it is most needed, including it's employees."
good,el ambiente laboral es bueno tanto por parte de administrativos y compañeros de venta
good,"Empresa de tiempo completo donde manejan un sueldo acorde a tu puesto no obstante la cultura y el ambiente de trabajo se han degradó por las jerarquías que llevan a la empresa y descuidan al personal, sin embargo para mi fue una experiencia positiva por la cuales me llevo bastante conocimiento y habilidades que explote en la empresa."
good,"Nice people,nice manager store clean and well manage.Like working at sears for a part time job.Wish the hours and pay were better.But overall nothing bad to say about the establishment"
good,this review is anonymous i dont really have anything really bad to say about sears. worked there over a decade ago. was just a job. i cant continue with this until this section is filled out
good,"its a great job, tough work but if you work for the back room you will be busy. there is a lot to do, merchandise pick up, web orders, stages, multiple things to keep busy"
good,Teamwork with some people was not very positive and sometimes non-existent. The team including store management appeared to be lacking moral and enthusiasm for the field I was in. The way store management handled the aftermath of incidents wasn't very responsible.
good,Sears was my first job right out of high school. I very much enjoyed the stocking and inventory and price stickers it was oddly fun to me. My hours became inconsistent and it was becoming very obvious to me that there was not much career advancement but i appreciated the skills and experience I gained.
good,I worked at Sears part time while at Omega as I needed to earn extra income as I had just located to the United States. The sales experience taught me great customer service which benefited me in my future endeavours.
good,"Company is fair, and has great people to work for.  My position was a temporary, seasonal position so I unfortunately was let go, however working at Sears was awesome."
good,"Good customer service, deliveries are mostly on time.  Appliances mostly new from truck shipments.    Delivery techs are knowledgeable and understand installation processes."
good,"I worked part time at Sears many years ago. I worked in the children's department my duties were stocking, running the register and helping the clients. As an employee you were expected to keep your department clean and orderly."
good,"Fast paced environment, lots of daily tasks to keep busy. Mostly will be busy with assisting customers through out the store and assisting coworkers with merchandising."
good,"Good place to work , salary structure as per industry standard."
good,College sale job that worked well with my schedule.  Entry level sales in the electronics department simply hit quota with minimal management supervision.
good,"It is a dying company, but usually its an ok place to work. the customers are the worst part usually because they are old and unwilling to change for anything."
good,"i learned how to complete tasks . and how to work well with others, management was well organized. hardest part other job was not being able to console some costumers."
good,"Sears (the entire chain) is in dire financial straights.  Thus, employee focus is on making the sale.  Their method is not always the best way . . . thus, the poor financials.  But, they are insistent that they are going about it the right way and not receptive to outside  suggestions."
good,"I worked at Sears, but the company is slowly failing.  The particular location that I worked at closed right at Christmas, because we didn't bring in enough profit to be worth being kept open yet somehow we won the W2S fulfillment contest for the year prior, and all of our numbers were higher than stores located in other, more customer filled, areas."
good,Te olvidas de tu vida personal. Buenas prestaciones.
good,A typical day at sears was slow pasted and really wasn't much happening but  I still made sure that my job was done at the end of the day and it was error free.
good,This job required a lot of customer assistance and promoting sears credit cards to customers. it also had a high demand for replenishing the sales floor with merchandise.
good,Sears was good in the sense that it had some pretty decent benefits.  It was very hard work with little pay.  Felt like it was a stressed environment.
good,"Lost job due to store closing."
good,"Great job for young adults, training effective for new hires. Nor a bad place to work if you have customer service skills. They have FMLA for those who need health assistance or mental health."
good,"Not enough pay, rather boring work, managers are always asking what you're doing, pointless computer training over the same 30 topics that you've taken computer trainings on every month."
good,La empresa es buena solo el ambiente laboral es algo pesado y los horarios por cuestiones de descanzo son solo entre semana .
good,I was denied a position because of my age not knowledge of the department. I was then moved over to another department where it excelled in sales and apperamcfe.
good,Tres bonne entreprise et bonne emploie avec belle equipe.
good,"My time at Sears was great considering I had not had a permanent"
good,It's a decent place to work as your first time job. Great place to gain sales experience and also learn to compete for compensation. Management can be improved.
good,"The company has made many changes in corporate direction that don't jive with the employees. Most of this includes low work hours, impossible to achieve tasks, being told to re-do work and in general  wasting time and effort. "
good,Stepping into Sears as a workplace feels like being welcomed into a big family.Everyone communicates well and gets along. When an issue arises it is very easily and quickly solved so everyone is on the same page.
good,"great job for a beginner mechanic. great atmosphere, just not good enough compensation when promised raises. can be fast paced at times and slow at other times"
good,Fast paced retail company that is undergoing drastic changes. It provides great exposure to broad experiences. People there are nice and friendly. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with friendly people from different teams.
good,"Sears is no longer located in the Galesburg community.  My typical day included answering phones and directing customers to the correct department, answering customer service questions."
good,"I worked on the cashier, doing customer service. Management wasn't the best in my opinion. Working at sears was convenient because I lived 10minutes away and I would walk to and from work"
good,Could be slow or busy depending on sales and time of year. Dealing with angry members do to company policy on returns and exchanges. Making members happy.
good,fast pace environment but rewarding. learn how to deal with customers which entail learning how to talk and find out what they need or just answering basic questions.
good,.Demanding workload. Understaffed. ability to multi task will be needed. Flexible schedule required. Constant turnover. Payroll is small. Training needs improvement. Seasonal turnover .
good,"A typical day was spent dealing with customer complaints and motivating sales associates to meet sales quotas for the day.  Also, ensuring the technicians completed work in a timely manner."
good,Really enjoyed fixing equipment and appliances. Middle management was great but the upper management did not provide the support the middle management needed to get the job done better.
good,"Great job for students looking for a part time position, the pay and benefits aren't great, its not very busy some days and if you can't stand standing in the same spot at a cash all day the job isn't for you"
good,most days consisted of helping customers find products or stock and organizing your department. I learned many things about different tools and how to communicate more efficiently with others. the manager at times was very strict but was also easy going. the hardest thing to do there was to relocate departments
good,Not much to say. It gave me what I needed but over all not a place to stay. You'll ended up sad and miserable but a good place to start. I got my second job here and it made me miss the first one. But it was easy and payed more so what am I really complaining about.
good,"i only worked for sears a couple of weeks since i was let go do to not meeting there needs. management wasn't what i expected, i wouldn't want to work for them again."
good,Good job great benifits however compensation is low for the amount of work that is being done i would reccomend this job as a first time job out of high school but thats it
good,If you like making food and working with the public this is the job for you. You will have lots of interaction with customers. Be able to clean your work environment and be tidy.
good,Commission Based pay... You need to know your product... You need to be a good salesperson... You are required to sign people up for credit cards and shop your way
good,Great place to work for if they were gone out of business. Great Co workers management is really caring just wished they would have not went out of business
good,"es un lugar muy tranquilo, buen ambiente de trabajo, aprendes muchas cosas a diario entre ellas a darle un mejor trato al cliente y sobre todo ha ser muy paciente. Ya que hay diferentes tipos de clientes, y nunca sabes de que humor van a comprar o a efectuar algún pago."
good,"This job consists of dealing with customers.  Making sales, making displays, filling counters, making signage for upcoming sales, creating a fun environment for the customers."
good,Management and employees were very easy to get along with. Pay was not very good. And there was no insurance at that time. Still it was fun to work there.
good,"They are not the best option if you are not very good at selling things to customers, they are also very worried about the amour of credit cards that you open"
good,"Its a cool place. inconsistent hours, cant ask for much more. The people are generally nice. Just a bit of an older crowd. The company is slowly failing though."
good,"A typical day involved loading and unloading incoming and outgoing trucks, checking inventory, providing paperwork for inventory adjustments, identifying and logging damaged merchandise."
good,"Although Management was always rushing everyone, the staff manages to stay calm and push the necessary orders in and out while still enjoying work. Selling electronic equipment was a great learning experience."
good,"On a typical day work can be very enjoyable, i have been with the company for 3 years and have not once seen a raise, with the position i have i feel that the responsibilities are much greater than what i get paid for and i also don't see myself being advanced with in the company."
good,"typical work environment, individual customer interaction, decent pay, the building could use a renovation, the overall work environment could be upgraded"
good,I'd like to give an accurate review but it has been over 20 years since I worked there. I have no idea what the work conditions are there now. At the time it was a good place for entry level people to learn the trade.
good,If you don't mind pushing people to sign up for credit cards then this is the job for you. They will demand more and more credit card signups from you than you ever thought.
good,This company no longer exists. I worked this job when I was in college. It was convenient for me at the time. Not hard to do. I just called customer and tired to get them to pay their bills.
good,Honestly I love sears and would love to see this company continue to grow with their new ideas but I feel like they're forgetting their employees and how hard we work for them.
good,It was nice working at Sears. It could be a little demanding at times but I like it. The hour and the training was fun. You had learn where everything was at.
good,They have a large selection of brand name products to sell. good atmosphere to work at. a wide variety of services---oil changes installation of tires and batteries are a few
good,If you could sell credit you were gold.  But when you were having an off month they really hounded you about it.  Pretty laid back environment otherwise.
good,"After all, this is Sears.  Which funny enough is tied to K-Mart.  And how often do you see someone go in either store.  For the time I was there, I was a teen looking for a paycheck.  They provided that.  The work environment was lack-luster and they always want a great performance with little to no incentive to perform great."
good,"the people were friendly and cooperative and very helpful, they took the time to explain dilenmas and were very nice. I enjoyed this job many places to chose from to eat"
good,"I enjoyed my time here. However, they do not give raises. If you are looking for seasonal work or a first time job, this place is a good place to start."
good,It was a seasonal job and it helped me pay several expenses I had. It was fast paced at times and to my disdain I was often left alone against a seemingly endless crowd.
good,"Arrivée,allumer la presse,ouvrir la caisse,répondre aux clients,faire le service de couture prêt dans une heure,pour les bords des pantalons. prendre les mesures avec le client taillé le vêtement le coudre,le pressé le remettre au client.   Faire altérations plus longue.(ex)bord de robe,jupe,chandail etc.manche de manteau,veston.je travaillais seule , le plus difficile est le stress relié à ce poste,le plus agréable satisfaire les client"
good,Haven't worked there in over 11 years but my time there I did like it and the people there. I liked the fact if you did your job and got your task done that was all that was required of you.
good,My first job after moving to Florida and I have to admit it was an okay job. Management was flexible but also oblivious as to what is actually going on.
good,"me gusto la forma en que podía desarrollar mi aptitud de ventas, aprendí sobre los clientes, la manera en que se expresaban para identificar sus gustos, la manera en que los jefes y los compañeros de trabajo me daban ejemplos para aprender, la parte mas difícil fue coordinarme en mis horarios, me gusto el ambiente de trabajo"
good,"it was an enjoyable job.. everyday was a good day. Just being there in hardware dept and seasonal dept."
good,This was a very relaxed job although it could get a bit overwhelming at times. The people I worked with were fun and welcoming and the managers seemed intimidating at first but were really nice.
good,it was a good place to work when we were busy during the winter months it slows down and sometimes we had nothing to do. they will train you so you can advance your career
good,"This job was okay at the time I was working there, from what I heard it is very slow in business right now..... You often got days of when needed. And you got your breaks when required"
good,Sears was a very busy store with online orders and in store pick up. The customer base was primarily long term customers Sears was a difficult job to gain advancement.
good,Challenging times at Sears but I feel it will continue is some modified form.  Associates are being let go in corporate but especially hard hit are the stores for both Kmart and Sears.  Best to luck to all.
good,"Sears has suffered many losses in the recent climate for big box retailers."
good,"Coaching and development for sales parts ad-visors. Negotiating and de-escalating. Call center work atmosphere. Approximately 200 employees with lines of business including parts, customer care, offline, and commercial."
good,I had great hrs. I had great management. I worked solo at my own pace. It was a great place to work part-time. I was a great experience. I appreciate the opportunity.
good,"I was about fifteen years old in this job placement, I was given busy work most of the time, there were usually only two or three of us working at a time, I don't think the studio was ever very busy."
good,"You spend all of your day on the computer and the phones as you would at most call center enviorments, there isn't a lot of interaction between you and your co-workers. Due to a lot of changes in the company and systems issues Sears employee's spend a lot of time rescheduling customers. That is definitely the hardest part of the job, as customers can get irate quickly and be very aggressive towards you."
good,Sears has become a company that has lost there commitment to customer satisfaction. With the new procedures and policies it made interacting with our customers very inconvenient to satisfy their requests.
good,in the automotive world if you dont sell the product your pay checkwill reflect it. summer time you eat like a king fall and winter you eat like your on a diet
good,"everything is good, but the hours are not flexible sometimes, but overall the salary is good, very nice coworkers and nice bonuses. the hardest part of the job is working on sundays"
good,"I had to learn to set my own goals for the day after store goals were met. "
good,Depends on the day. I learn how to sell merchandize and also learn communication with others. Management are a good group of people. The culture can be improved. Hardest part of the job is selling credit card apps. Enjoyable of the job is talking to fellow co-workers.
good,I would work in that environment again but I have to paid better . I like the hard work and coworkers so the regular customers . It just did not pay well.
good,"I worked on the Sales floor at Sears for a few years, the job was so easy it was hard not to get complacent. Management seemed to consistently make things difficult for the employees and customers with constant, and poorly implemented ""sales techniques""."
good,I enjoyed working at Sears I had a great manager.  The workplace was excellent. And most of all I enjoyed my co-worker because I felt like a mentor to them.
good,Sears Optical is a great place to start out with if you are interested in getting into optical. Management has changed a lot since I've been there. Over all ok place to work for.
good,Sears is on the verge of closing all its stores its no point of building a career there. While i was there they just let managers go who have gave them more than 15 years of their lives just to cut back expenses of the store.
good,Applied for TV technician position. Was told in interview that other consumer merchandise had to be worked on as well. Got almost 2 weeks of job shadow training before being sent out on my own. Request for more training earned me almost a half day with service manager for training. Manager was preoccupied most of the time with his day to day items.
good,"working at Sears, be prepared to work in any department. If they need you as a cashier you will be behind a register all day. If they need you to put clothes away, that's what you will do."
good,Sears was a great place to work and develop skills in the workplace.  Management was always willing to listen and were well suited for their positions.
good,Working at Sears is very much what you see is what you get. They don't try to innovate in any field or add bells and whistles. Just learn your products and sell sell sell. Good company but nothing spectacular.
good,"Good part time job and flexible schedule. If you are working towards management, it can be rewarding but I would not look to it as a full time job unless it was temporary."
good,"•	Develop good customer relationships and promote overall store sales goals."
good,"Although it's now closed, I enjoyed working at Sears. I think it was mostly because of the people I worked with and the flexibility of my schedule. I would never try to live off of a job there as my only source of income. Hours were short, even for managers. When managers aren't even allowed to have more than 36 hours of work a week, it's not a good sign. I was great for just a high school kid or a college student."
good,Things were going on in the store  all the way to management and the stock inventory was just a mess .Things come  missing often.I quit soon as possible
good,"This was one of my first jobs in Santa Barbara. I worked downstairs in the men's department, later working in children's and then just being a floater. I enjoyed working with my coworkers, they always had something funny to say. The typical work day involved making sure the sales floor looked clean so a lot of cleaning. The customers were nice (usually Spanish speaking) and the fitting rooms were never a hassle to clean (unless it was the women's area haha). "
good,"Trained newly hired sales staff on customer service, selling and merchandising  skills"
good,"Be expected to lots of work, especially work outside your designated job expectancies. You will be on the floor, in the back, at the cashier's kiosk, and in the racks. Lots of movement, understanding management."
good,"Es un buen ambiente laboral es lo mejor que tiene las amistades que haces alli."
good,Pleasant and friendly place to work that provided excellent customer service. Location of store caused theft issues which was a concern and problem for all workers
good,All salesmen are just what you would expect cut throat and some have been there for years.  Despite many other better paying jobs and careers these salesmen have made it their life.
good,This was a good starter job.  you were expected to learn all different departments and job skills while you were there.  management was great always understanding if you needed time off
good,"It worked well around my kids schedule and my full time job. I worked there part time. I originally got hired on for Christmas help, but then they kept me on and I stayed for a year."
good,"I worked at sear when I stayed in tuscaloosa alabama and when I decided to move to houston they gave me a tranfer to work at the sears in houston. That really means alot to me, because I felt like I was a good enough worker to get a transfer. Nice people."
good,"Its my first company.Basically I learned many technologies here."
good,This shop did not provide legitimate training for me to learn my job so I learned on the fly. fortunately I am a quick learner to pick up these skills but I could not so easily master the high variety of products quickly enough to be an expert to run the floor where I would know all about products and their locations.
good,Good company to work for.  The future of what is to come for the entire company was what made me leave.  Uncertainty was embedded in the culture.  Its unfortunate.
good,Sears was a great place to work not drama and stress free environment. Everything was explained perfectly and the team work was trusting. The operation of the store was very fluet.
good,"Es una empresa buena, como todas, tiene sus deficiencias en algunos de los funcionarios y otros en los manuales y procedimientos que quizás si se tuviera más en cuenta al sindicato podrían crear una mejor calidad en el ambiente laboral de los empleados y esto se vería reflejado en la atención que se le da a los clientes. Es una buena opción laboral y para quien quiere superarse es cuestión de demostrarlo pues oportunidades hay muchas."
good,Working on commission created a competitive work environment. Management had high expectations from every sale associates which caused some tension. Coworkers were nice people.
good,Sears m'a permis d'apprendre ce que le marché du travail consistait et les attentes auxquelles je devrai faire face.
good,"Typical day at work will be a slow pace thing or a fast pace name you never know how I was going to be. They did not have a workplace culture. There was no hard part to this job,, and the most enjoyable part of the job was the mingling with the customers in the sales part of the job in closing the sale."
good,"Sears management sucked, the woman who came in took over and changed around everything. They could care less if you have a family and need to call out or if you ran a few minutes late. As long as you can do phone work you will be alright."
good,Design store layouts to typical plans in order to make all the fixtures and other layout designs fit within the required floor space. Every store has different layouts which makes the work fun and challenging a bit.
good,The commute was really easy. Everyone there was nice to work with. Discount was sort of decent. Could definitely notice the store was on it's last legs.
good,It's a call center with friendly environment and people are as a big family it's really fun to work there However the salaries are not high but the stress of work there is at it's minimum which is a good point
good,"Working for sears was a great experience. "
good,I started off in the receiving department for the store and after a year i got promoted into the hardware sales department. Assisted store in any task required of me.
good,"company status causes stress in everyday work, work given and time given to do was bad, work given by 1 boss sometimes different then other bosses, bad place to work"
good,"Working at Sears was a fun place to work I loved the discounts and the hours were good. "
good,"Stay motivated"
good,"There was 4 week paid training, once i arrived to work i signed into the phone and was prepared to accept calls, got 30 minutes for lunch and sometimes we got lunch brought in, there was very strict management an protocols, but the most stressful part was trying to keep members calm over the phone, however i did obtain great listening an communication skills, i also learned to ask probing questions, there was lots of office morale and we did have down time depending on the season"
good,Overall good job just expensive benefits and management is lacking. The best part of the job was investigating cases because you had so many tools at your disposal to help determine the action to take. The hardest part of the job can also be investigating because some people are pretty good at hiding the truth. Typically we work about 50 cases a day.
good,"Working at Sears gave an opportunity to learn all aspects of sales, from balancing the till, to meeting different people each day, to learning to stock the floors and working all types of sales."
good,"In my previous role as a Human Resources Manager, I gained the knowledge and experience I need to hit the ground running and start making an immediate contribution right away. The following are just a few highlights of my professional skills and achievements that I hope to bring to your organization:   Employee Relations liaison   Talent Acquisition and Recruiting   Associate training and development"
good,I worked at Sears very briefly. It was an okay place to work. My co-workers were great and so was my direct supervisor. I don't think I worked there long enough to provide a thorough review.
good,"As a Merchandising Team Associate, I was responsible for the timely flow of merchandise from the receiving area to the sales floor, ensuring the sales floor is continuously well-stocked with new receipts and merchandised according to company standards.   I ensured proper presentation of all new and clearance merchandise and execute tasks such as the placement of tables and fixtures for promotional events."
good,"even though was successful in my job was ""let go: due to restructuring - didnt matter how  good you were if you were in a position they had decided wasnt needed you were gone - no opportunities to move within the company - years of loyal service didnt matter"
good,"A great place to start in customer service. Was put in many difficult situations which helped me turn my good customer related skills to great ones. Recommend to anyone in college, or that needs the company to work with their hours."
good,Unloading trucks and dealing with customers gives you a change of pace and scenery. Keeps you in shape will unloading the truck and develops people skills.
good,"It is a place I am passing thru till i finish my schooling, but it is kinda far from my home and the times is hard on me for my homework. I lift appliances and is hard on my body. It would be a good place for some but not for me. I get along with everyone I work with, the people are very nice."
good,Good place to work if in school. Not good pay. Management could have been better organized.  Very few hours during the week but weekends and holidays were crazy.
good,"The weekdays are slow, over all the work is easy. However, you are expected to do credit card applications. If you fall under the expected amount you'll be in trouble or fired."
good,Great place to work during the holidays learned a lot about craftsman tools and other merchandise. The hardest part of the job was all the paperwork you had to fill out during a order of a item out of stock.
good,Provide customer service that effectively and efficiently meets the needs of the individual and fosters a long term relationship with the company.  Work with the vision of management to carry out programs and special events that foster an environment that is positive for both customers and staff.
good,Sold consumer goods to customers.  I learned how to deal with customers on a professional level.  Management was nice.  Workplace was nice.  Hardest part was the commission; trying to make a living.  The most enjoyable was also the commission pay.  Every day was possibly a great money making day!
good,"The day to day activities for this job varied, it could be a busy day of watching the cameras for potential thieves to arresting thieves and have to collaborate with the police officers. I learned the importance of detail in this position since the reports that we had to fill out could and were used in criminal cases."
good,"There is no typical day at work, everything is constantly changing and you must adapt quickly. I have gained a lot of valuable experience in a short amount of time."
good,Everyday I was in 3 to 4 homes working with potential customers in helping them with there home improvement needs and wants. I enjoyed this face to face interaction the most. Truly understanding their needs. The driving about 700 plus miles a week is a lot to deal with. Especially when a customer cancels a few minutes before the scheduled time and you just drove 80 miles to get there. I loved the training they offer. I have learned so much from the training team.
good,great for a part time student or someone looking to work little amount and make good money. Flexible hours and no benefits included in a part time position.
good,Love working with internal and external customers. Love coaching and developing associates to become successful. Hardest part of my job is leaving from work because I love the people I work with. The most enjoyable is becoming successful and developing my team into becoming part of leadership
good,"typical sales job meet company sales goals and  has several metrics your to meet"
good,"The job required troubleshooting and repair of lawn and garden equipment such as lawn mowers and chainsaws.  This was a noisy and messy job, but I got satisfaction from repairing someone's equipment."
good,"Aprendí a acomodar ropa,precios ,calidad "
good,"Worked here long ago, at the time it was a great place to earn money during my 20s. It's been over a decade since employed with sears, at the time it paid the bills"
good,"Sears was a great part time job. The only hard part about it was each cashier is given a goal at the beginning of their shifts. As a cashier you have to encourage customers to sign up for the Sears Credit Card, me personally I am not very persuasive. So my struggle was reaching that credit goal. Other then that Sears was a friendly environment."
good,I had a good time working at Sears but the pay could of been better for the amount of time hours and not having anytime with my family to spend with them I feel that pay should of been better for them.
good,I got this job as soon as I graduated. This was my first job. It was a good experience working at Sears Holding Corporation. It was a great learning...
good,okay job...poor management...no raises..no benefits..no retirement plan.... fair pay but no raises...lots of freedom must be independent worker with little supervision.
good,Muy buen ambiente laboral atencion a los empleados y comprencion
good,"Working at sears I have gained so much knowledge about jewelry and customer service. Knowing how to make schedules for you department , changing prices, restocking, I even learned thing about the tool department."
good,Sears was a weird environment. I worked at the one in kings plaza mall which had a lot of kids in the environment so that automatically showed in how messy they made the store. It wasn't really a good look for the company but what can you do. The people I worked with were fun but everything else was a detriment to the job environment.
good,would be a good experience for someone in high school or fresh out of high school who needs to get a job but its just like any other retail job out there. entry level and not much room to move up the ladder. not always profesional either.  but its retail
good,Managers was very nice. A very small office and the agents are trained for perfection .Its part sales well 100% sales but customer service matters more.
good,ok place to work but the pay system is not waged in the employee favor. some weeks are very slow. the weeks that are busy do not make up the difference.
good,"I really don't see the need to review a past employer.  Kmart bought Sears, created Sears Essentials and it was a failure.  I was involved in the transition of stores by surveilling construction workers, backdoors, etc."
good,"•	Responsible for customer service"
good,Sears was a good company. I enjoyed the automotive team I worked with as well as management. Sears paid a lower hourly wage but the employees had the opportunity to make money via commission.
good,I caught shoplifters.   It's amazing what people will risk having a criminal record for.   I also installed and maintained CCTV and alarm systems at several stores in KS and MO.
good,"Many wonderful memories there, and even better people! I met my future wife there while we were still in high school, and still enjoy seeing former coworkers around. Sadly, due to parent company financial troubles, this store had to close. The company was slowly going downhill in comparison to the standards it had once upheld for service, but is truly missed."
good,I went to work for Sears when I moved from NJ to Florida. The people I worked with were very nice and they taught me everything I needed to know. I enjoyed working for them until I moved back to NJ
good,Trabajo arduo y desafiante  con horarios extenuantes
good,50 - 50 % changes that you will get satisfaction from your job. Management is not up to the mark. You need to work hard or keep quit and follow the decisions.
good,Sears has not been profitable in 5 years so because of that pay is poor no great benefits. Very sad but people are very good to work with. Very fast paced environment which is good cause i dislike idle work.
good,"I worked for the CS department aka ""blue ribbon"" aka Corporate. Job security is zero. The move department after department overseas to save money. Its a stressful environment."
good,"It was an okay workplace, I wouldn't work there again or recommend this job to any of my friends. So if you work there it's an okay place to work, its a slow pace workplace...."
good,"The job I am currently doing involves communication with members and providing solutions which I like to do, I get to work with diversified people and share knowledge."
good,I did not enjoy my time working at Sears but it was at the end of that stores life span. It was a temporary holiday job also. Not enough to do to keep me busy.
good,Being at sears has given me the same interaction with people on a personal level as the hotel.  People think that customers in a store are different then guests but they are not.  They way they are treated is the same no matter what.
good,"Good place to be if you need work to do on a daily basis. When shipments come in, you unload truck and categorize boxes by departments, then take boxes to respective section of the store (Kitchen, Kids, Hardware, etc.)"
good,mostly just wake up at 6 am a unload trucks before the store  open to the public and sort everything in different departments and take it to each floor and let them put it up
good,"Por falta de personal en bodega para mantener ordenada dicha bodega no se podia atender al 100% al cliente, ya que siempre esta desorganizada porque todo el personal de la empresa puede entrar y sacar calzado dejando todo desordenado, se pedia la contratacion de una persona exclusiva para bodega y no quieren contratar.... Es imposible mantener la bodega ordenada y atender al cliente al 100%"
good,Talk to all customers when they needed help with something point them out or walk with them to show them where the product is at. also did a Date Integrity meaning ordering thins online what ever product we didn't have in the store.
good,"Sears is a retail business and there are many departments with in the company. I worked at the store. I was trained in different areas and on the register. But I saw myself more in the administrative side so I requested to work in that department. Learned a lot. The only thing I was not fond of, was the work schedule was not consistent."
good,"Work Culture was regular office culture with basic health and dental benefits."
good,No support at all and they just left you hanging. I was owner of the store for 9 years. Had about 6 regional managers that where suppose to help but never seen them and when called never got back to us.
good,Sears has obviously been struggling for a few years now. The work was enjoyable but because of their struggle it was often very slow and I was left standing around.
good,"Has been a great term with Sears with lots of learning, challenges and understanding of retail market despite uncertainty and stiff cost cutting measures."
good,"Very fast paced, need to customers cars in and out as quickly as possible.  For the most part, everyone was friendly. Sometimes there was any costomers and makes job slow and boring."
good,The work environment is average with a very low chance to move up in the company.  I enjoyed parts of the job dealing with other employees.  The job is 7 days a week which challenges a life/home balance.
good,Nice entry level position.  Did not like the fact that you were told to get people to sign up for credit cards.  And your hours were based upon how many you got.
good,they did not offer raises even if you excelled at your position . i wanted to expand my horizons and or move up within this company. I enjoyed working here because it was fast paced and the meetings in the morning.
good,While working at Sears I learned that verbal communication skills is very important. Learning how to be patient and cooperate respectfully with people in the workplace as well as with the customers.
good,"A dependable ,honest fun work place with nice and efficient objective and multi-tasking fast pace company with a lot of team oriented people great to work with."
good,As a cashier my typical shift would start at 4pm which is around the peek hours at Sears. Everything is very fast at this point and keeping up with how much money was in your register is important because we could not have over a certain amount. The hardest part was to keep up with getting people to sign up for the sears credit card.
good,"Day at work on Sears were always a surprise in terms of what kind of customers I would  attend. In my analysis more elderly  people than young ,what made me very happy to deal wit them. At the same time the  hardest part of that was to see that some stores are not prepare to attend very well this kind of costumers."
good,"Not much to say. The pay is pretty mediocre and the store environment isn't too thrilling. The people I have worked with were great, but the business itself isn't something too spectacular. I'd consider this a good first job to get your feet wet in the business world."
good,"Learned a lot here, but didn't enjoy the act of collection. Dialing system is not fun at all. Fast paced and very demanding but you learn a lot of negotiating skills"
good,"Opening store, to run intimates department, when manager wasn't available, excellent manager, multitasking, not enough help, interacting with customers"
good,"Slow paced"
good,I did not have any issues while working for this company. If I lived near a sears i might would work at one again. The pay was okay and they worked with my schedule.
good,"I worked up from part time safe room to asst manager-dept manager. Ioss prevention associate, cashier, hardware asdociate. Like any job it was fun and a challenge"
good,"All the appointments were warm leads but many were not legitimate. you receive 2-3 appointments per day but some can be 3 hours away. Many of the sales depend on credit status and there is a 50% denial rate . Even if you close the sale, you can still not complete due to credit. "
good,Sears has helped sharpen sales skills as well as problem solving skills.  It was a decent company to work for yet very few opportunities for advancement.  Management is helpful and willing to work towards benefiting overall wellbeing of employees.
good,It was great during the Christmas time for work.  Once season is over alot of layoff.  Good pay and great discount for compensation.  But if hired for season remember that all you will get.
good,"Easy job wit many perks but not a lot of growth. The company doesn't really give you much room for growth, They tend to overwork their associates and the pay does not reflect the job required."
good,"Sears employees were very clique-y, and pretty much stuck to their own department. Even outside of work most of the employees were good friends with the other people in their depts. Management always did what they could to accommodate the employees' needs. Customer service and innovating new sale methods was always a big deal, as well as soliciting credit."
good,"Selling home improvement and Kitchen remodel Services for about 1-5 ""Approved"" hours a week in the stores and wait three months for the commissions with hourly rate being $10 per hour being paid every 2 weeks not enough income to live on or even drive to work at the time."
good,its a great place to work when the holidays are around the conner but when its no where near Christmas is no where near it becomes quite everywhere you look.
good,it was a good company to work for wish it would have lasted longer. it is also very stressful. and you feel like no one is listening to you and you never know if you are going to have a job from day to day
good,"Work was goal-oriented, with senior employees always willing to help out new hires. The atmosphere was professional, but not extremely strict where new hires would feel uneasy or nervous."
good,Sears is in a lot of problems. That's why i got out. No time for your family. The Pay is horrible. No raise. The company is losing so money its closing a lot of its store.
good,It is a very fast paced environment .Witch I love.I have learned how manage a group of employees.  You learn how Give and take feedback and work as a team.
good,it was a good first job but they have since gone out of business. they kept us employees busy. wasnt great pay left for another job. they had us assigned to too many different jobs at same time
good,This company was good to work for in the 1980s and 1990s but it went from manger to manager with the work load falling apart.  I wouldn't recommend them to anyone
good,"I really liked it at first, but after the holiday season was over, management put in place goals and sales criteria that had to met that were really unattainable and unrealistic and we were penalized if they were not met."
good,"Moving in a fast pace manner to get  the customer in and out of the cashier line .Assiting customers with questions about merchindise, being able to  give your fashion expertise to the customers."
good,Mon emploi chez Sears m'a appris à travailler sur pression de réussir à atteindre des objectifs dans un temps précis. Le leadership des superviseurs m'a beaucoup encourager a persévérer.
good,It was a fast and fun environment people where nice and friendly I loved my job there I knew everything and I was a great worker but they laid me off because of the holidays
good,I learned about different products and how to help customers with product needs and customer service. I learned how to qualify customers for the correct products.
good,A lot of the people I worked with were good people. Some of the procedures for the company could have been setup better. To many things you need to focus on in order to follow the metrics.
good,"It has been too long for me to remember this job. I remember it was easy and i mostly did nothing. Keep in mind i was young and dumb, didn't know what work ethic was."
good,"My job kept me very busy and it was enjoyable. We constantly had filings of bankruptcies daily. My job was to recover merchandise from our customers through repossession or, at that time, reaffirm the consumers account. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the attorneys."
good,Ok company to work for but the company does not have growth potential. The people were nice to work with but upper management did not have the vision to change the culture to take care of their customer base.
good,me gusta pero entre en un tiempo don no tenia muchas ventas i no ganaba lo que esperaba me agrado el ambiente laboral es una de las empresas que me dio la oportunidad de entrar al ramo de ventas lo poco que se esa empresa me lo dio
good,Working for kmart is all work and not much play. There is a lot expected and  always under staffed. The associates are nice to work with. Benefits are ok.
good,"I had a lot of fun working at Sears, co-workers were nice and so was management until the end. My co-workers and I walked in one day and were told that we were being switched from $10.50/Hr to straight commission and making 1% on sales."
good,There was always work to do when I worked here. I did everything from unpacking freight and hanging it all and putting it all on the floor to helping the customers at the registers.
good,"Some working conditions, in terms of co-workers, seemed  a bit unfair. It was an easy learning process, extremely late on pay, not a very welcoming environment in the branch I worked in."
good,Three day shift periods and extremely overwhelming is someone does not show up on time for their shift. Could not leave until they did. Did not really learn anything because I was seasonal and treated me as such. Workplace culture was cold and not really cultured. Everyone did their job and stayed to themselves most of the day.
good,busy optical office. was able to cross train. enjoyed working there. loved the pts. opened long  on some days and on saturday. which helped a lot of people out.
good,I enjoyed working here also. Everyone seemed to be team player. I enjoyed seeing customers walk out happy. Some days were slow which made for a long day. Management was great.
good,A typical day at work was having outstanding customer service. Helping stock and take care of my department so it meets up to our customers expectations. I enjoyed working in retail.
good,"Conseiller les clients et faire la caisse"
good,"Typical day was short, they only hired for part time. No real means to provide for your family unless you were in management. No room to advance. Management was nice."
good,The management doesn't have an Open Door Policy and will tell you that they don't want one either. It's basically every man for himself. The roles there are reversed the subordinates are the management and management are the subordinates.
good,The support you receive from management both in the local office and from your area manager is crucial for allowing you to do your job properly. Typical day usually consists of an understaffed office and lots of phone and computer work.
good,This job was extremely demanding and you constantly had to make sure that the importance was getting credit applications. You also had to make sure that customers were filling out the surveys.
good,"slow paced environment in the mall, wasn't too hard to keep shelves stocked, and lines were never long unless a holiday. hardest thing about the job was staying awake in your little cubicle of a cash register, management didn't make it an effort to know you by face and name."
good,"I really did not learn anything that I did not already know. The good thing about the job was I could dress up instead of wearing a uniform, and the employees were enjoyable to work with."
good,"Started with counting the registers to begin the day, there were many challenges due to the department I was in (appliances) started as commission base job,  very cut throat for the first year due to the employees that worked with me, once I built up a customer base that returned for other appliances as their household needs arose, it was great."
good,Sears was a good job learned a lot about management you had to learn quick on your feet you do most work with your team or by yourself I gained a lot of knowledge
good,"Electronic sales, sold TV's and Home Theater's and electronic accessories, paid hourly but also receive commission for what you sale. Having good customer service skills and knowing the products can have a great impact on your paycheck."
good,managers was nice employees was friendly a lot of hours  good customers they don't over work you but the pay wasn't as much it was a good job for like extra cash
good,"I enjoyed working at Sears because it allowed me to broaden my skill set and enhance skills that I already had. This job also allowed me to gain new experiences in customer service, retail and management that I had never experienced before."
good,"As a divert worker at sears there was a lot of folding paper, and door greeting. there was always something to do, and I always had fun. Managers here awesome, and always there for yoy."
good,Sears is good company with a create customer and product base.  This allows an easy workplace with most of the time happy customers and management.  Dealing with fairly constant culture changes make it difficult sometimes to be on the same page as the corporate identity.
good,It was a first time experience with working in a factory sort of setting.  I got to meet and work with a very wide variety of people.  I enjoyed the training that we went through prior to being live on the pones with the customers. Very helpfull training.
good,"This was probably the best place I have worked for, co-workers were very nice, flexible work schedule (except Black Friday everybody works) , managers always making sure things were going well. only part time when I worked and didn't get many hours, but it was a fun environment to work in and was treated very well during my time there."
good,Great place to work for... my first management opportunity. Great mentor and people that really care and support all members. Would not change anything...
good,"I don't see any reason to twist a customer's arm to sell them credit for a store they shop at once a year, also the frequent shoppers already have cards but choose not to use them because the benefit is hardly worth it. Mic Drop"
good,"I worked for Sears for many years and then out of the blue, my store closed.  The biggest issue is not having job security along with the constant pressure to perform at 110% when your CEO has no idea what he's doing."
good,"This job was 90% boredom and 10% excitement.  You have to make sure you have all your elements before you even attempt to make a stop.  Over all, this is was good job."
good,"I was always looking for better pay,it is a nice place to work.I worked in the Mens Department I was always getting the deals ,I enjoyed it the pay was not good but I enjoyed working."
good,"Overall I believe working for Sears was a nice job, but there was poor management at the store where I was employed. Management is the primary reason the store and its employees can prosper or not."
good,Competitive from employee to employee due to commission pay. Relaxed environment and slow-paced. Learned many useful skills to apply to future. Well managed.
good,I only worked part time so i tried to stay away from drama & politics Avg week was 16 hrs & most was 20/24 around holidayssom for what I made it was great. High turnover in sales & mgmt & poor acknowledgement for jobs well done. Very cliquish.
good,"A typical work day would be obviously come in, clock in, wait around until about prime time, which would be, if it was the morning, 12 to 1, or if it was an afternoon, around 5 and 6 after everyone gets off work, and basically get stormed by a lot of customers, helping them out, and then basically it dies back down again."
good,The management at this location is very poor one-sided and typically I work week turns into a work month as far as tasks are concerned. Not enough family time and shifts are odd hours for working.
good,"I worked here during the Christmas rush, so my perception is quite skewed. My time there consisted of pre-dawn starts and hectic days with frantic customers."
good,"I work in many different departments in Sears Service Center.  Assisting Manager in weekly and monthly reports. Dispatching, payroll, auditing and parts research."
good,"Was a driving instructor for mostly adults, being able to make your own schedule. There was a lot of driving around places that you may not be familiar with because when you teach adults you end up having to pick them up at their work place or homes. It is dangerous and intense and requires the ability to maintain calm when things can get crazy. Was involved in one wreck while a student was driving, it was not the students fault, being on the road all the time means an increased probability of being a car accident."
good,SEARS is a good place to start out while in school/college and a company where advancement is possible. Multiple positions are available depending on your interest/skills. Previous work in retail is not necessarily required.
good,Great place to work. Only worked for the company 6 months and the entire company was laid off. That would be the only thing that i would say i did not like.
good,Everyday work schedule is having staff meeting before day begins. We had to make sure prices are change on daily basic. Dealing with customer and there needs.
good,Started day by prepping for the day. Worked on work orders as they came in. Organized tires in the back to keep inventory. Keep the garage cleaned on down time. Organized battery room.
good,Chill environment to work at with few problems with management. Bit boring not much to do during the day except for when a customer comes in. Commission is bad any way you slice it.
good,"I enjoyed working with the associates.  I loved the flexibility in hours."
good,"Store is good place to work.  Manager does good job running the store and is easy to work for.  Upper management seems not wanting to help the store succeed.  They only care about the numbers and how many Protection Agreements are sold.  They claim this is the only way to make profit, not a sound business plan.  Instead of trying to help the stores with any problems they just blame the store manger and sale associates for the problems apply pressure to them to turn it around or else, instead of trying to positively help or make suggestions.  Only issue with CEO is he should consider a more national marketing strategy.  We still get people who do not know we are here after 3.5 years!"
good,"•	Participated in product inventory."
good,My overall opinion of Sears is that it's a good place to work as a cashier if you are just starting out in the working business. I worked there part-time and my experience was very fast-paced. I had to learn the rules quick and get to work right away. I not only attended to customers but also helped take care of the store as a whole.
good,"Sears, well what can I say! It has been a very beautiful ride too see. One thing that has been incorporated within the company; is family as well as good friends! I enjoy what I do on a regular basis. But the most challenging and most frustrating thing about this job, is the exponential goals set out by the company!  These metrics are nearly impossible to achieve. But even with all that said, they're no excuses for not being able to complete the job! Outside of this, I love what I do and very much so enjoy the wonderful people I work with!!"
good,"I learned that customers sometimes have vague ideas towards what they want when it comes to lawn care or tools.  Others are very determined not to be ""given the run around"" when they know exactly when they need."
good,I learned a lot while working here It was ok I need more because there are not any career advancements available. Management likes for you to get in a position learn it and stay in that position
good,"I worked at sears in high school as a cashier so I didn't have many responsibilities other than to assist customers checking out. Unfortunately, sears doesn't get many customers so most of the day was spent trying to look busy."
good,It was not my best work experience. Rude managers and no true leadership was given and were drama filled. I was not allowed to be friends with my coworkers.
good,Les postes sont bien pour des etudiants ou des personnes retraité mais ne lest pas pour quelqun qui veux de la stabilité.
good,its a good postion great work day i learn alot ok management no workplqace culture the hardest part of the job is management whats enjoyable is clocking out
good,This was a fun job but a hard one. This was during Black Friday season and people get crazy. Definitely an eye opening situation and a learning experience.
good,"I was only employed here for a few months, but had no complaints. I would have stayed longer, but had to move out of state in a rush. Manager was very kind and open to any questions."
good,they tend to bully people was not a pleasant place to work. WAS NOT HAPPY SUPERVISIOR made others employees cry not tolerable not comfortable place to work
good,A typical day working at sears was pretty much dealing with the customers all day. I learned how to work on my customer service and focus on the customer.
good,"I prefer a job that keeps you busy at all times and because of my position there , I was always busy and it was a very physical job which I enjoyed , and I ran a big tem there which was very enjoyable"
good,"As a cashier, customer service is expected, but the only measurements are if you can push enough in store credit cards. If you can, you have a job. If you can't, you're terminated. If you excel, there are opportunities for management and lead positions."
good,"an average organisation to work."
good,"You will often find yourself working with good people, but a metric driven work environment drives people to cut corners just to meet those metrics in so much that if picking up trash isn't a metric no one will bother to do it. If you are doing anything that doesn't directly contribute to a driven stat expect to be chewed out. Besides that working at Sears can be fun"
good,A typical day would be organizing the photo shoots for the little ones and their family members.I learned about how to grab the best possition for the nicest shot of an infant. Management treated me with dignity and respect they were all very profesional. Most enjoyable moments were when the kids really enjoyed their photo shoot with me good feed back.
good,only position is flex full time which means that you never know if you will be working the next day also more sales oriented then customer service oriented
good,travaille sous pressions employer agréable la clientèle est agréable le salaire est minimum et beaucoup travaille les journées passe vite
good,This is a great opportunity for anyone who has the chance of working here. Great experience. Nothing too bad to say about the company. I give them (7) on a (1-10) scale.
good,"great manager. The workers were not the friendliest. Some were great, others just made me uncomfortable to be around. The hours were good and the job was interesting."
good,Ok place to work. Not a lot of room for promotion. Low pay and never enough employees. If you like picking up shifts for others this is perfect for you.
good,"The company went through a lot of changes, and during the changes their focus on the employees was lost. The turnover was high, and moral was mediocre."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company met a lot of great people, and learned a lot of new things. Working as a backroom associate was the best. Saw strengths in myself that I never thought I had."
good,Going through major reorganization Many changes in all areas No clear direction Reducing number of stores All management positions being realigned. Future is uncertain
good,"As a Sears Cashier my responsibilities were: "
good,"Very productive, yet slow paced. Not many challenges faced through a typical work day. Needs constant traffic flow to increase sales and make daily goals."
good,Nice coworkers. Busy schedule. Low pay. Little opportunity for advancement for the low-ranking workers. Good customer service experience with much interaction with customers.
good,"It was a great first job that taught you a lot for a first job, sad to see such a great place is going down the hill like so many other brick and mortar stores"
good,"Sears auto center was a good place to work. The company does require you to work appprox. 8 Hours of overtime. My job duties, retail sales, "
good,The DC was poorly organized and long hours were mandated. The average work day was 13 hours and I worked 16 hours a day on a more than regular basis!!!
good,Typical day at work was always interesting and full of new things to learn. I learned the Workforce part of a call center which was a really nice opportunity.  I really enjoyed the opportunity to work with out a lot of supervision.
good,I love people there are a lot of interactions day to day. I wish the pay was higher however I have learned loads. I am thankful for my manager there she is the best!
good,"le lieux de travail est très saint on veut travailler"
good,"good place to work. But since its moved into new location, find it hard to commute going to work. Went farther salary is still the same. Need to find a new workplace that's not too far from home."
good,"Its important to get people to sign up with a sears credit card. You save money and very interesting job. Very easy, everyone for the most part work in groups for fast pace. Patience is a big deal for this job and positive attitude at all times."
good,"The day was fairly predictable.  We help customers as needed, but I was more task oriented. We have weekly goals that are set but we work at our own pace.  The store management is great.  I feel that the management team is incredibly supportive and will do anything to help me succeed.  The hardest part of the job is that we do have to pick up others responsibilities due to high turnover on a frequent basis.  Also, the goals can be very demanding when you are not able to focus on the assigned tasks because of short staffing and needing to help customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help customers."
good,"I really enjoyed working with my co-workers and managers, they're some of the best people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. However, the company is on a fast track downward and even with open positions in management they almost never promote from within even when a candidate is qualified. You never receive a raise with the freeze on wages. Your work is almost never rewarded as the system that they rate their employees on is a broken system that rewards working less."
good,This company was supportive and the people were enjoyable.  It was nice to be able to work in a variety of settings.  There weren't enough hours
good,"Responsible for maintaining the women and men's apparel section. Also , Assisted with customer service providing help and understanding to all customers. I learned that many people love when workers are involved in there shopping experience."
good,"Comfortable environment to work, encourages team work but also pushes competition and individual progress. Offers diversity and has a customer based focus."
good,"Hardly room for advancement, pushing credit is a must, not very busy, mandatory lunches, when its slow you van get alot done. I would suggest trying to get the job you want dirat because you will be locked into it."
good,"The most fun I have had working ever.  You become part of a team that allows you to use each other to accomplish the main goal of satisfying the customers needs.  Good compensation, and benefits.  Great first job for anyone in high school or college."
good,"Sears has been a good company in the past, but over the last few years sales have decreased because of increased competition and Sears finds themselves unable to keep up with consumer's demands and expectations. Sears associates are pushed to oversee several departments and tasks at the same time resulting in fewer associates available to assist customers. Customer service is where Sears needs to focus going forward."
good,every one is unprofessional management is bad but the people are fun the hardest part is understaff so nothing gets done or 1 person has to do the job of 3
good,I learned to identify in-home repair risks and best practices.  I enhanced my communication skills and Excel spreadsheet analytical  skills.
good,"the stores are all closing. however, this is a good job for high schoolers. its fairly easy but pay is too low, no one should get paid the absolute mimimum"
good,"I think this is a great company to work for. The company could use some improvement in the areas of management, leadership, and training classes for new hires."
good,a typical day at work was leaving from home ( company vehicle ) and going to customers homes designated on work computer to service and repair household appliances. The ever changing technology was a learning experience.  The most rewarding was the customer themselves. Many became lasting friends which meant my job was satisfying to them.
good,"Company paid very low base pay with low commission rates and lowered commission rates without raising base pay with no advance notice, left company immediately when pay reflected the change."
good,"everyone complain about everyone else and my hours got cut to much,and the mangers like breathing down your back when ever you would stop for a little to talk with someone."
good,"I liked my job here, but the location was not the greatest. It was run down and it showed to our customers. I did enjoy the photography aspect however."
good,"The job was , but good job, but the quota system did not make sense most of the time.  As a new mananger I started Employee of the Month in all areas. Associates had never been treated with appreciation for a job well done. Customer Service and Training found a whole new level in the metrics that we had and the store turned over for new life."
good,"I and my step father would come to work being ready to load our truck up. After loading the truck up, we would set out to drive to other SEARS/houses to delivers SEAR's products. The management for sears was quite to themselves, we both just did our job."
good,"it was ok working there even if there were no benefits to the job, it was just unfortunate that the store had to close down because of no flow of customers"
good,have an order display on a hand held device get the order and bring it to the customer. wait for a truck unload the truck put merchandise on shelves in proper location.
good,The local store management do their best to make it fun to work for the company. The home office management does not help.
good,"Since i was the newest member i had to spend most of my days in the back boxing merchandise and i rarely got any human interaction until my last week of working there, so needless to say the day went on forever and i had to try to keep myself up because every other Backroom Associate was in the Office doing computer stuff or helping customers."
good,"Nothing too amazing about sears but nothing too bad at all either, it's a decent place to work as long as you reach you goals, the management is nice and working with customers can be enjoyable."
good,"From this job I learn the difference in being an order taker and a sales consultant, I was to sale and make my own money and too lead by example by giving customers that great buying experience no matter of the setting"
good,"The job is great if you're going to go to college or if you've been there when they were in their prime(1980s). The workers are unique and more confident in helping than other retailers. Sears has built a reputation to be one of the best places to go if you want customer service, and from working there for three years, it's quite an experience."
good,"if you are comfortable with cold calling customers to try and get a sale, this job is great for you. plenty of opportunity to make extra pocket money."
good,Many of the locations have just closed. That has made it difficult work. The people and members are good. They are always hiring.
good,Basic retail department store.  Learned a lot about different types of merchandise.  Great team to work with in the department I was employed in.
good,Overall a nice company to work with. Some days are better than others but it's all a part of working in retail. Your attitude and effort will definitely determine your day most of the time.
good,Sears was   my first job out of highschool everything was new to me but I learned how to work cashier fast work great with others pay wasn't great but it was my first job
good,"Not a bad place to work, hours where decent, management not to bad. You get commission for sales so that can help boot your paycheck"
good,"Great play to work, great co-workers, great management , learned many things in my position while i was there, the store that i was at was great"
good,"I was hired as a seasonal employee, I had hoped it would lead to a part or full-time job.  The online application misled me though, as I thought I had joined as a part-time to full-time employee.  I did not find out that I was listed as a seasonal employee till about four days till I was released.  This soured my experience because they should have let me know in the beginning during training.  Rather unprofessional."
good,"This was a very quiet and professional place to work. It is a community center where a lot of elderly people came to learn how to nit, exercise, or just because. The people are very friendly co workers and quest."
good,"Since this company was bought out by Kmart AND the online sales trend has rapidly increased, it was not a hopeful job prospect. I just worked here to gain a new experience (in fine jewelry sales), and to gain a little extra income. The location I worked at closed down within less than a year of my hiring."
good,Many aspects you have to know about their system. Need to sell shop your way and try to get people to apply for sears credit card.
good,"Sears was average. It is an ok place to work but do not expect great pay, satisfaction in your job or any real perks. It is what it is and you have to expect that if you wish to work there"
good,"it was an ok job to work , needed improvement in management , need better benefits , flex hours , more workers , better computers"
good,I was hired as the assistant manager of a hometown store. My ideas and ways were not accepted during my time. I was not a part of meetings in which I felt I was to be. The manager was very secretive and was not open to me handling the every day duties. The pay was only $12.50 and only part time. This was very discouraging to me.
good,"We unloaded trucks and provided merchandise pick ups for customers daily."
good,its okay alot of work but okay and fun. managers are nice and helpful but i was only there seasonal but i learned how to do floor mover on my first day
good,"I enjoy my job,but the managers are not the best. I really enjoy all the new people that I get to meet. I also really like making sales and helping people out"
good,"I did lots on cleaning bathroom bay area for the cars"
good,"Loss Prevention was a great and exciting job, but with the economy, Sears down sized and reorganized as a company, I was unable to stay on with unstable hours in a position that was quickly losing hours."
good,"Staff was nice to work with , the management changed a lot so the rules changed quite often which was a headache after you already had your own routine."
good,"Overall friendly environment and loved my co-workers but management was a bit disorganized. "
good,"Employees are nice, flexible schedules. Casheiring is easy and a great way to provide excellent customer service. Great learning experience in the work place."
good,"Work schedule is based off credit card performance. The more credit card sign ups, the more hours you get. I was also always working on weekend nights."
good,Assist customers on the floor and register. Answer incoming calls from customers or follow associates from other departments. Keep working register clean and work on go backs.
good,"It was a nice environment, but the pay started to decrease. I would come in start working, get a lunch, go back to work, clock out and leave. I learned how to handle myself with rude customers and co workers."
good,"I loved the great people I worked with but, Sears doesn't provide even small raises regardless of length of employment.  One of the many people who kept Sears as a side job for 20 years never got a raise, which makes me feel like they don't value their employees.  Plus they have you do the work of four people. I love to stay busy but, I hate too feel like I can't get anything done because you have only yourself and one cashier. Plus you still have customers and they always come first."
good,This company was very busy and all over the place.  They would have you in one department then move you to another department in the same day.  The lines were always long and moving very slow.
good,"I got to be creative and independent. I worked with some amazing individuals, who really made my time rewarding. I learned a lot!"
good,"Sears is not what it use to be, I take pride in in what I sell and in having a satisfied customer. But we are not allowed to make decisions at the store level, if an issued occurs. And the commission per unit has been reduced across the board on all appliances. I do enjoy selling at Sears, but will not want a full time position there."
good,Everyone hates eachother. Half the workers are always smoking or talking. I tried my best to clean the place and work hard. In the end I was asked to leave over small issues in which no fault was mine.
good,there is a lot of work that needs to be completed every day. have to carry a lot of heavy boxed around the store. and have to deal with a lot of customers on the phone and in person.
good,High pressure to upsale certain products. There is no sense of life at the job. Management pushes for ridiculous metrics that are out of your control.
good,Very steady paste during the day with little customers and have plenty of time to remodel stock up new items and clean up area. The hardest part of my job is when there is no business during the day. I enjoy working with honest and good loving co workers.
good,This company is not flexible to the work life value. There is room for advancement but some favoritism. Okay starter company.
good,They're always hiring due to high turnover rate. Work environment is okay if you can get along with people.  Lower management has poor communication with staff. Work is simple but tedious.
good,I enjoyed working at Sears but due to personal issues I had to quit. I did try to go back and I have yet to heat anything from them.
good,"Pitch and make sales on heavy appliances ,with some cashier duties .Very Fast pace job ,with commission off our sales .The best part about this job was the team members ,they are very friendly and helpful."
good,Sears was an awesome company. I enjoyed the people i worked with. Sears shows that they care about their employees. Sears allowed me to take time off to handle some personal issues.
good,Ever evolving corporation and company culture.  Very fast paced and great opportunities for those seeking retail experience across multiple categories and services.
good,"Fue una muy buena experiencia, tuve la oportunidad de aprender y desempeñarme en muchas áreas ademas de ventas.  Horarios flexibles y buen equipo de trabajo."
good,i enjoy working for sears its layed back and little stress hours are flexible and time off is never a problem the staff is also very friendly and fun to be around
good,"great location when management knows what they are required to do for sales to go up, not the best place for a career but good to start somewhere right"
good,this job was a little bit to much you had very little pay for the amount of work. the staff you work with is friendly and the manager at my store was also but other then that its an okay starter job.
good,"Stocked shelves"
good,"I worked for Sears for 6 yrs and never received a pay increase until 6 months before the whole call center closed down."
good,"Their bad equipment was the worst thing, the particular one in the area I was at had lazy management, it's basically only a job that you should stay at until you find what you really want. Other employees said that there would be no chance of pay raise ever there, you basically stay at the same level always, was the general consensus."
good,Everything you would think about big box retail in a struggling market full of other options to buy. If you are in need of a third job this maybe for you.
good,"Repaired vehicles as they came in. Sold auto services. Business was a hit or miss on most days. I enjoyed the work but being dirty everyday was not so pleasant. Co-workers were easy to get along with, we all helped each other out."
good,"I thoroughly enjoy the arena of salesmanship, assisting customers to determine what is best for them by using the features & benefits methods. I also find satisfaction in turning a negative experience or situation into one of positivity. Seeing the customer leave with a smile is the ultimate goal for me."
good,"I gained a bunch of experience in working in a warehouse for about three years. Whenever my manager was gone, I was the replacement manager until she returned. I had a lot of responsibilities as the only full time employee, except for our manager."
good,The store I worked at was well run and staffed. The only problems we ran into came from the corporate side of things. When we really needed help it seemed like the company would leave us hanging.
good,Great employees  to work with .Management lacks team work and commodore .Good  benefits and work /life balance is recognized and practised . The selling culture is one of honesty and product knowledge is passed on to customers.
good,Ive Never had a problem with sears and to be honest i was a very good addition to the work place i was very well spoken and professional at all times
good,A good place to work at the management could improve a lot there is never a pay increase and the danger of loosing job due to company closure is very imminent
good,"Management gets upset if extended warranty quota isn't met."
good,I worked for $6 an hour with compensation. So during the lawn mower season i made good money then when it was off season i wasnt making enough to pay my bills.
good,"Auto Mechanic/ Duties Included tune ups, brakes, tires ,suspension repairs and alignment , HVAC, Vehicle diagnostics and repair"
good,If you Work harder than everybody else and good things will happen. It wasn't really a bad experience and I worked 40 hour work weeks and made almost 800 in a month.
good,"I enjoy serving the public. The people I work with are excellent.  "
good,"my typical day at work i would come in help with install picks, Inventory, Pick ups for customers, dispatch, and Claim (in home and material damage). my co works in swedesboro nj were the best."
good,I was able to start in a low-level position and work my way to a management position rather quickly. Sears has plenty of room for growth and is a good place to start a career in management.
good,"Will teach you the basics of working retail, however more fulfilling opportunities in a company with a future should be sought elsewhere, as I don't see them existing in the future. In short, good spot to get your feet wet, but don't stick around too long"
good,"The equipment was new and well maintained,the people are very nice,i learned allot from the mgmt,and the foremans.the benefits were incredible also."
good,"I have not worked at Sears for almost 20 years, so my review is probably not very accurate for current employment opportunities."
good,as a loss prevention agent my typical day was to open the store with management and get all morning associates up to date on safety talks. then the rest of the day would be as the store needed of us along with apprehending shoplifters . i learned a lot of people skills there with able to read people a little easier as i would watch associates and customers and see reactions to certain things. management had a open door policy which is always good . the hardest part of the job would be all the paper work and dealing with the correct authorities after a apprehension . the most enjoyable part of the job was making a difference in helping the company and associates grow
good,"Asking too many things, but not giving hours to do the tasks. Should give more hours and give more recognition. Management needs to be updated on policies and procedures."
good,They over work you for a $7.25 an hour. They stay in your personal life to much. You will be terminated if you don't get credit applications!
good,Was not given many instructions on proper procedures and how to do things. The store and Backroom are very disorganised. Some workers act like they are doing things to pass their time and leave most of the straightening and clean up for those that are actually there to do their jobs.
good,"Inbound call center that takes orders and sets up delivery. I had to be efficient while maintaining professionalism and making sure the customer knew the company appreciated them doing business with us. The work environment was business casual with a diverse mixture of ages, nationalities and sexes."
good,"En esta empresa si se manejaban los medios turnos, pero era muy dificil que se los otorgaran a alguien."
good,"Dollar general is a good place to work, they are good at accommodating to school schedules, appointments and second jobs. They are thorough when training, not a bad company to work for"
good,Overall my experience was good the managers were not mean at all if you did the work they asked of you. My most enjoyable part of the job was helping the good customers that come through sears.
good,Explotan mucho a sus empleados no piensan en absoluto en ellos
good,"If money is all you seek from your employer Sears is fine if you work on commission and can do your job.  I left about 2 months before the store closed because I saw the writing on the wall.  Informed management and was told that the store would be going for another 5 years.  After my departure, store manager transferred the week after and the store closed 2 months after I left."
good,"The team was friendly and  the coworkers were nice, however it was only a Temporary position."
good,"If you can stand all the oil and coolant which is flying in the air ,you could learn a good trade. Good place to learn to work with machinery."
good,I always enjoyed reporting to work. The people I worked with and for always made you feel like family. I hope the Greenville Kmart never goes out of business.
good,Fun people to work around and not a hard job. management was always nice but the pay wasn't great. I enjoyed all of the people I worked with as coworkers. I learned how to work with other people and use my hands
good,"I stayed with Kmart/Sears for 27 years, in the beginning it was the company to work for, but I believe they wanted to expand too fast which caused the start of the downfall for the company."
good,"Working with the managers was one of the best experiences I've had. They were caring genuine people. However, the company was stressful to work for. Sometimes the different district requirements made it hard to get things done. And the staff was always short which made it harder for the ones who actually worked there to get things done since the store is so large. However, I personally loved working there. I loved the work I did pushing stock onto the floor, and being a backup cashier. Its a great starting position for anyone looking to get a first time experience in the work environment."
good,"Served as a customer and installer liason. Responsible for scheduling measurement, and installation appointments for the Washington State Region. Receive shipped products from the warehouse to insure an on time installation date for customers. Make and file job folders accordingly to type of project. Provide administrative duties, and assist others when needed."
good,I had fun working here. I moved my family. There was no career advancement for me at the time. I was happy for what I have learned and who I have met along the way.
good,"Recently immigrating from the Philippines to live with my family and attend college, I appreciated the opportunity to work part time at Sears as my first American job. I've learned how to work as a cashier, as well as doing the stocking and inventory. "
good,Lots of driving within the area. But can be lucrative if you are a greats sales person. Requires lots individual organizational skills. Job can be flexible throughout the day depending on appointments.
good,"My typical workday starts in the morning where I scan up any sales signs. Afterwards, I request and print out signs that are missing. I look up any plannograms to adjust displays through the department, and print out tickets if there are any price changes."
good,s una empresa qu e se trabaja tranquilo en cuestion de trabajo  pero es una empresa que es pura comiion sin sueldo base n la cual tiene temporadas altas y bajas y esta todo el dia parado de 11 a 9 y en ventas nocturanas hasta las 12 sin  transporte  para tu domicilio.
good,"I worked for Sears Portrait, which is and has been closed for years--- Not much I can really say beyond that lol .  While I was there, it was a decent experience and I learned a lot"
good,Sears Auto has been a main stay in Automotive with brands such as Die Hard for many years. However the company is going through the pains of trying to stay relevant in a time when the competition is at its greatest.
good,"Ensured that employees under my supervision were assigned a project.  That they understood what the project entailed and that they understood that expectations of the final outcome."
good,A typical day at sears as a cashier is very busy and hectic. Managers are slow when you call when a customer needs assistance that is beyond your means to handle.
good,"While some members of the staff are kind and helpful; some make many mistakes and often are rude to customers, which I despise"
good,"A typical day at work (if i work mornings) starts with signing out cash bags for my department, counting registers and making sure the PM crew counted them properly last night, attending the meeting (called a member rally), and basic cashier duties (purchasing, returns/exchanges, processing Sears credit card payments, signing up members for a Sears card or a Sears MasterCard, and the shop your way loyalty program.)"
good,"Need an entire overhaul of the business employees are leaving weekly for other opportunities, bosses don't seem to have employees back and they can feel this."
good,"Local management was always satisfactory or better but upper management was entirely inadequate. My co-workers were the greatest. Everyone shared responsibilities, gave excellent customer service and handled problems for other associates when they were on days off or ill."
good,"This job is fun and can't have potential to make an honest living, the problem is, that its 100% commissioned and I am not a fan of commission"
good,"i learned many things that open my eyes to a whole new experiance and because of that thank you "
good,The pay and benefits were not very good. the management was poor and their wasn't very much opportunities. Great place to help and serve the community.
good,their schedauls were flexible. co workers were greate they are very energetic and friendly. they alse have great customers with exceptional attitudies.
good,A typical day is filling customers orders and then doing returns. I have learned how to work with my co workers. Its fun to learn new jobs and to be able to work in different departments. I like the early start times
good,"Have worked for the company for a long time, and sometimes feel like I care more about the job and the customers then the managers in the company do. "
good,"I situated the sales floor for customer access to the merchandise. Ensured customer satisfaction, and  maintained cleanliness of the store. Monitored products sales trends."
good,I Really enjoyed working here for the period I have. I was given adequate learning on what layaway is really about. The environment was very friendly and the mangers were very helpful
good,Worked long shifts as a cashier. Did move around to the different departments of the store but did nothing but cashier. Was not busy during the week days but was very busy on weekend.
good,"I was able to work with some great people at sears. I had a lot of fun for two years while working there, as good as it is there are some issues I gathered in my experience there. Most days we are on our feet all day which is normal for retail. In my experience I learned a lot and am even responsible for managerial tasks. I gained a lot of knowledge. Most jobs there are really flexible so its good for people with a lot of personal responsibilities.They are really strict on hours, its almost impossible to get overtime and if you do go over hours it is frowned upon by management. I have seen good employees go years without raises or promotion. I feel as you really have to fight for what you deserve. The hardest part of my job is that managers will mostly notice bad performance and reward good performance less often. Happiness and morale is dependent on your relationships with managers so go out of your way to connect. My final thought is that if you are new and trying to enter the company, its better for young students who are ok with inconsistent hours and hard work. If you are an adult who supports a family and has a lot of expenses it may be difficult for you."
good,it was a ok job experience just needed more hands on duty to do the job to a certain accord also the amount of work involved was not worth the pay and amount of hours put in.
good,"Loved the people I worked with. The pay was not good at all, they only pay $7.25 with no chance of getting a raise. They want you to do more work then you are getting paid for. in other words they want you to wear multiple hats but does not want to pay you for it."
good,. Grew my skills as a mechanic and took all training I could get my hands on. Worked here many years. Worked with some great technicians
good,"Call center is closed, however, it was a pleasure to work with the employees and work towards a better customer experience online and in store."
good,Store closings throughout the company.  Not sure if there's longevity if you're seeking a lifelong career.  Great place to work part time if you're a student.
good,Good place to work flexile yet structured. Always looking for new ways to improve the customer satisfaction. Enjoyed working there.
good,I didn't get to work there for too long since I was eventually offered a full time job with Dillards. I was also attending school at this time.
good,"typical day is busy with good results."
good,"Didn't really care for the work place , people and pay at Sear's. They would treat you as if you we're nothing to them ."
good,"Not a career, but it was income. I liked working there, but it seemed like they would hire anyone that put in an application. I never had help and was expected to do other people's jobs as well as mine."
good,"copy was thinking about employees health , had a gym on site with low monthly fee. Good benefits , great co-workers"
good,"Responsible for the execution of all receiving activities, including unloading  and documenting incoming and outgoing merchandise within the store."
good,"when available hours are in effect , work is great at sears. there is opportunity to learn various work experiences , when management allows it to be so."
good,"Truck would come in on Tuesday and Thursday and usually around 3-3:30pm. Once the truck would arrive, I would scan and unload customer or catalogue orders and place them in the customer pick up area. Depending on how many orders were loaded, a typical time frame would be and hour to hour and a half. The worst part of unloading customer orders would be all the major appliances or fitness due to the weight. During that time, customers would come in a pick up their items from past trailers or i would have to go pick up an item from the sales floor. Once that is complete, i would match the correct tag to the customers receipt, file and then contact the customers letting them know that their items have arrived and ready for pickup. Later on i would go and help the rest of the tem unload the rest of the trailer."
good,Working at Sears I learned how to be productive while at work. I also learned teamwork and how it is easier to work as a team.
good,"It was okay, it was seasonal work, so didn't get to work a lot, but did learn a lot. And had fun with my co workers.Also learned a little bit on the sales side of photography."
good,Management worked with my schedule and allowed us to work at our own pace. Fellow co-workers were fun and helped the day pass quickly.
good,"typical work shift would include"
good,Work/Life balance is nice. The job security is always a challenge. Same with advancement. I enjoy what I do in my analyst position. I have taught myself a lot since they give you time for development.
good,"I enjoyed working there. Our store was a profitable store, but it was closed in 2012. Our store won a National contest in the Appliance department, where we had to increase our laundry sales from the year before for 8 weeks. We won and I was one of the top sellers and I won A Kenmore Stream Frontload Washer and dryer."
good,Sears here in Albany is a great job for someone who is only looking for a part time job that wont take up the majority of their time.
good,"very stressful job as there is so many change in the policy of the company , very nice environment , very friendly , very good insurance"
good,"Sears is a fantastic place to use as a stepping stone and that's really what it is, a stepping stone. Management works to an amazing point of freedom when it comes to availability to work, especially for college students. After the huge plus, it gets into a not as fantastic spot by having many moments of micro-managing to the point where not much can get done while a store is having visits by the Higher-ups in management(higher than store manager). Also with said Higher-ups, there is lack of professionalism with some using curse words on the sales floor and doing other unprofessional actions. The co-workers are probably the singlehandedly best thing about working at Sears. Sears has managed to hire many people who will most likely end up being like your extended (but yet dysfunctional) family. Hardest part of the job: Dealing with the incompetency of management"
good,"very good business with the correct management team. you can get a lot of experience from the register alone. one has to pace themselves,some good employees,getting credit applications,the customers."
good,Sears was a great opportunity to learn alot about sales. Such as how to approach customers and what to start off in a sales pitch
good,Store level teams are generally hardworking and engaged facing a challenging environment to operate in.  Best part of my day was engaging with and developing my team.  I value the time I spent at the company as I learned many things about being a leader and how to develop a positive work environment.
good,"Usually calm during the closing shifts"
good,"This was my first job and I held the position of a Layaway Associate at KMart. It gave me good experience in customer service and handling stressful tasks which I still utilize today. The customers can be really rude, but the coworkers make the days easier to handle."
good,"just didn't enjoy working there. very depressing. the staff was kind of nice, some people were mean, i quit fast becasue of exams and school work"
good,Check costumers out and ask them if they want to apply for the Sears credit card. recover the store and check the fitting rooms.
good,I was a full time student and worked forty hours a week. I would have joined sears more if the people were friendly and also I was given more time off
good,"Before the manager who ran the store for years left during the summer of 2014, the store was very enjoyable to work for. Worked with my school schedule and made sure we all had breaks and we got along with each other. New manager treated us all bad and talked down to us when she was only a couple years older than the rest of us"
good,would sale products to new home buyers. the atmosphere was good from the team to the customers. management helpful and very pro team help. so co-workers would complain about work and so would be team players. the hardest part would be finding the right product for the person and not having them satisfied with the merchandise which they purchased. learning about the products was the most enjoyable part of work and seeing the customers satisfied.
good,It's alright. I would rather work at another store location rather than the one I was hired at. The customers made my day.
good,"Work place provides you with tools to make your own decisions and work at a steady pace. While my coworkers have become some of my close friends, we still keep our professional life in compliance with company moral and standards. We are consistently updated and guided on changes and allowed time to reflect and/or question what is needed. The environment is well maintained."
good,"Most enjoyable part of working at Sears is the people I've worked with."
good,I worked at Sears for over 3 year. The highest paid non management position is Home Appliances sales. Other than that it is a great first sales job
good,"The hardest part about the job is definitely the amount of time away from home, not knowing how long a typical day is going to last.  Workload varies from day to day based on how many ""completes"" you get the previous day.  Communication needs improvement as information tends to trickle out."
good,My co-workers were very nice and helpful. They welcomed me with open arms. We all worked together as a team and to get the job done. The best part of the job was knowing that the residents were happy with their meal.
good,"This was a good school for me. Becomes like a big family. "
good,"Working in LP at sears is fun, I have Learned a lot in loss prevention, How to tell if someone is gonna shoplift, the 6 elements, alert signals."
good,The work place was fun and relaxed. I was able to work with the customers one on one and get them exactly what they needed/want.
good,"fast paced,learned all about shipping , co workers were great, great management, lots of fun customers, hard to learn everything quickly"
good,"Sears is a great place to get experience in face to face customer service. Having to create a great sales experience in a competitive, quick paced environment."
good,"Active Work ,mowing,plowing,salting,trash pick up.not long.trimming trees.cleaning out ditchs.eight dollars an hour,couple hours week.maybe more."
good,"I wish not to review this company because it's been so long ago. But, I will say that upon working at Sears you always had a chance to meet and work with all kinds of people witch is one of my greatest assets."
good,this was my first job and I learned a lot during the time I worked there. I progressed a lot and left to serve our country. I learned a lot of interesting things about working a retail job.
good,"Individually managed 9 major soft-line category vendors including jewelry, footwear, food& grocery,"
good,"there is no such thing as an ordinary day, there is always something new you might even be able to work on expensive cars, different problems with customer cars and sometimes you might have repeat customers."
good,Co-workers were mostly teenagers and didn't work well together. Management was very unorganized and hard to find when needed. Pay was horrible. Employee discount was okay.
good,Great company to work for.  Moral gets low but there are plenty of positive and talented people that have faith the company will have a positive turn-around
good,"good job for college student trying to earn some extra cash. Very flexible schedule. Co-workers very nice , inviting atmosphere. I wish there were more hours available however."
good,The environment was very enjoyable. Loved the fast pace of the job. It's a fun place to visit and sit down and relax and have a wonderful meal.
good,"Doing signing ,markdowns,helping customers or what has to be done. A good team to work with but hardest was not having the hours to get things done."
good,typical day you have a shipment and you have to make room for them in the sales floor as well as in the stockroom.Managment and coworkers are usually busy doing the same tasks.
good,"this is not a bad job, they just have a poor compensation program. offer benefits as well as advancement in different depts around the store"
good,work was great had fun unloading the trucks each day seeing different products from all over the world and making sure it got to the next part of the shipment process
good,The most enjoyable part of this job is meeting new and interesting people. Co-workers are reliable and dependable; willing to help any time.
good,Sears is a friendly work place with a family-like mentality towards co-workers. The store is kept neat and employees are helpful to customers as well as fellow staff.
good,Sears has been a wonderful place to gather experience in the management field. It can get extremely stressful though. The company expects A LOT from its management team. The retail store has gotten a lot worse from when I first started there. Forced cutting of the store hours leaves no workers in the store leaving a bad customer experience. I hope for the company it gets sold to a CEO who actually cares about its workers.
good,this position was typical of a retail position and was open to versatility when they needed you to complete a task. there was always someone asking to replace them or stay later than normal
good,"I mainly work in the background and my contribution to the store is not generally seen. I enjoy keeping everything moving smoothly, answering questions, and providing help. In general I work with a great group of people and will miss them when I leave."
good,This is a okay place to work if you just really need a job. They really don't work with your family life. Really strict about performance on calls and dealing with customers.
good,"I was fortunate enough to see transitions of many kinds within the organization, and even oversaw the closing of a store prior to my position as Store Manager for my current location. I learned a lot about how to coach and train staff effectively, and was able to glean much from the management I worked underneath. "
good,Equipment (registers) often don't. work.  I enjoy talking to my customers and helping satisfy their needs. Rest and meal periods are covered.
good,"I simply and honestly haven't seen hourly wages so low since I was a high school student back in 2004-2005. Although it's a job, I would recommend working there and keep looking for something else due to money being so tight."
good,Very boring. The manager and other co-worker were fantastic people. A typical day at work included answering phone calls and preparing broken merchandise to be picked up at the store.
good,"Working in the visual marketing department gave me the opportunity to interact with every department in the store, I also saw the importance of visual merchandising and learning more about the department gave me the chance to be the manager for this department."
good,"Customer service, helped check out customers ,cash and card transactions. Helped customers apply for credit card. Helped customers with online orders and setting up delivery dates.Also managed and helped with over the phone issues."
good,I always had work to do. the management was very reasonable and treated everyone fairly. I worked the register and rang up clothing and other items for the customers. I also advertised credit cards and reward cards for the company which was an added bonus on either my check or just my overall performance. I excelled in that part of the job due to my persuasion skills. The uniform was easy to handle and maintain.
good,I enjoy working with my fellow co-workers.  There is enough freedom at this job to be able to move from task to task.  They are always willing to do their best to work with you in any situation you might have.  I feel they truly care about their employees.
good,"I worked administrative support Ice program, answering multi-line phones, making sales. I was dealing with sensitive &  private information ."
good,"my typical day at sears would be staying near the cash register, answering the phones, repairing ratchets. managment was nice, the hardest part of my job was the demand to get credit card applications,the most enjoyable part of working at sears was my co-workers and making friends with my regular customers."
good,"A typical day includes motivating and giving meetings to fellow team mates and employees. Watch over department and help on the sales floor with closing sales and running increases.Resolving customer issues. All while maintaining the operations of the department."
good,I would unload jet fuel into tanks and drain hydro pits from the airport so fuelers could full planes and assist in fueling .
good,"Nice place to work, but with the amount of traffic and idea of working on commission wasn't always the best place to make a good amount of money"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Sears, and my co-workers were amazing. It was usually a fun place to work, unless it was Christmas time. It was always very busy"
good,Family atmosphere environment and fun place to work with all team members ready to help out if needed. To bad all the warehouses closed in town.
good,"Ordering supplies, cooking waiting on my customers and listening to there problems and so really great stories. A local tavern"
good,"A typical day is a lot of rad ranning around the store, organizing all around my department, and other near by departments. I learned how to us a snick ( I believe that's how its spelled, or pronounced, its a hand held device that scans products and prints out sales tags with a printer.) I learned how to use a p.o.s register, and touch screen register. The management was wonderful, they were all very kind, and funny. Co-workers varied..some were helpful and nice and others were not nice or helpful at all. The hardest part of the job was dealing with all of the drama. The most enjoyable part was working with such a nice management team, and helping them put up sale signs and take them down."
good,"collègues de travail sympathiques, horaire flexible, mais peu de reconnaissance."
good,Full commission. I loved it for a long time until kmart bought sears holdings and they decided that commissions where too high and they cut them in half. Many experienced sales reps left and the whole sales culture changed.
good,a company struggling to create itself anew in fast changing retail enviroment and is in need of fresh ideas and staff if it is to survive for any length of time
good,If you're in the market for a part-time job were you get good commission depending on the department you're working on? This is the job for you.
good,Working retail is no easy job. From the long hours to long phone calls with customers. At the end of the day seeing a customer finally finding something they been looking for is great.
good,"Sears is a nice to work, but the it more focused on credit card applications then anything else. Its a good starting point if you want to be in the retail world"
good,Retail is a busy industry to be in and after 35 years from Ohio to Nevada and back to Ohio again with the same company I found that I enjoyed the office part of my job more than out on sales floor. So I am off on another adventure.
good,"A typical day at sears is basically repetition, you do the same thing over and over every day. Ring out customers, take clothes back to their sections, wait for ever for managers to come for customer situations or overrides."
good,Very poor company to work with which resulted in their shutdown in 2013 from bankruptcy. Very poor rapport with employees.
good,"Increasing difficulty getting branded merchandise, when you are paid"
good,"Challenging and fast-paced. However, your ability to ramp up is based on previous experience and not any formal training or mentoring."
good,I worked here for 14months in a minimum wage job with no opportunities to advance or no raises. The managers are horrible and do not encourage employees properly.
good,"Good structure with some room for improvisation and daily variation."
good,"some days it gets busy some days its slow but my co-workers are really fun people to work with our management is are good people they help us when needed"
good,"It was fun and okay for the most part of working there, then you're nagged so much to get credits and feedback, oh and don't forget the customers phone number for SYW, most of the time no one wants to give it. Manly older people shop there and don't have email, so sometimes there's nothing we can do. Coworkers are great to work with as long as you don't steal anyones sales from them."
good,"The work day started off as a usual one. Login and get to my assigned station. I learned how to deal with customers who would try to scam you out of an item and how to deal with them. My co-workers were friendly."
good,"This was a temporary position taken on during the Christmas season. Duties included assisting customers with any questions or concerns, recommending products, doing inventory on the weekends and, keeping the workplace clean and sanitary. "
good,"I truly enjoyed my time working at sears with the staff and management. However they were very unorganized. My schedule was always changing during the day. I respectfully fulfilled the time they requested me to. I enjoyed working with customers on a day to day basis, sharing my knowledge of products and meeting goals."
good,Learning wasnt that hard just pay attention to what you are doing and meeting new faces were fun and going to the cafertaria to eat.
good,Good company to work for as there is a lot of knowledge on the legacy systems and to be part of complex business transformations is always an added advantage.
good,"Il y a déjà plusieurs années que j'ai travaillée pour cette entreprise et c'étais très stressant, toujours avoir quelqu'un pour nous surveiller qu''on prend bien nos appels pour les commandes de catalogues et l'environnement de travail étais très bruyant, il y avait environ 250 personnes qui travaillaient sur le même plancher séparés par seulement des paravents. "
good,"Very interesting company, I involved a lot in this project.  I also learned a lot in this company.  All co-workers are nice and helpful."
good,Enjoyed building displayed but for the amount of work and responsibility that is put on your shoulders for having accurate prices on products it is not worth the minimum
good,Flexible hours but because of being retail company you may be required to work late and on holidays. Great discount given to employees.
good,"belle esprit d'entraide avec les associé du magasin."
good,it was great just to get the experience but the pressure of putting customers to sign up for credit cards...the co workers were nice.
good,"Selling fitness equipment (eg. treadmills, elliptical machines) and ringing up customers, restocking merchandise."
good,"Sears is your typical retail job, it is minimum wage and hard to get any kind of advancement. People were generally great to work with and made the time go by quicker. The Job itself was actually pretty fun and varied but that didn't save it from being generally a bad job in terms of pay/benefits, also didn't save the store from being shut down due to contract negotiations with the landlord."
good,Great work experience and will use what I have learned for years to come. Overall Loss Prevention procedures were in place and being upheld to the highest level.
good,"overall good learning experience "
good,"The only thing that needs to change in the optical department, is proper staffing. losing customers due to corporate hour restrictions. It takes people to serve people. was not like  this when I started."
good,"Sears outlet was either really busy or really slow. Busy mostly over the weekends and slow mostly during the week. The pay was very low, I wasn't satisfied. Made an extra $2.00 or so when you got a customer to sign up for a Sears charge card, that was the hardest part of the job because the answer was mostly no. This job helped me build communication skills with customers. Coworkers were very friendly and fun."
good,"Job security, great with working around your schedule. A great deal of talented and goal oriented individuals at all levels of the business."
good,"I enjoy the other associates there. They make it a fun environment to be in. We at Sears love giving our members a WOW member experience. We take our members seriously, and provide the best service to them."
good,"Sear used to be a great place to learn how to give a good costumer service. They had really good formation and seminars every year and it helped to focus on giving a good service. On the other hand, through 7 years working for the comopany i have witnessed Sears has losing his quality reputation   by cutting a lot of employees and reducing in the quality of their products. I guess they are just trying to compete with the other stores. Few years back , Sears was the market reference of quality, service and trust. Most of the stores are now empty, as from employees and costumers, then, they wonder why. I just think they forgot why people liked to  shop their."
good,"Good place to work if your not looking for long term employment. The turn over is high and the pay isn't great but the management is fair and it's a good place to build skills. Especially sales skills because we live on commission. Come in, grab the finicky device to run up sales, help customers find what they need, and head to the register for a lengthy check out. Leave. The co-workers are great and the management is always rewarding good work but the hardest part of the job is the pay. If someone returns something they bought it comes out of your commissions and your below minimum wage anyway."
good,Productive and family oriented. Added opportunities for employees to take time out of the busy schedule to relax and enjoy games. Employees rewarded for their job performance.Open door policy.
good,"Sales at sears is very numbers driven, they will advise you how to boost numbers if you are having difficulty and require you to report back so they know your trying."
good,"Working at Sears isn't entirely bad the biggest downfalls are that there aren't very many customers anymore so the earning potential isn't very high anymore if you are still on commission. The company also continues to lower the percentage earned on each sale made which continues to make it harder to make a living. The benefits are also pretty non-existent since everyone, at least at my store, is hired typically as just part time and are rarely made into full time. The upside to the company is that they do give you a lot of tools to learn about the products the store carries so that you can become more knowledgeable in your field."
good,hardest part of job was finding out what people were really looking for and to make sure they understood they have to measure the spot where they wanted to place new appliances
good,"i worked there during christmas and it was crazy "
good,I got along with all employees. I enjoyed working here. I got the opportunity to work out in the field in personal homes and interact with homeowners while cleaning their home.
good,Sears Corporation as a retail associate work very well with co workers and great management.  As retail associate our main goal was to open Sears store card and MasterCard in which customers receive 20% discount on purchase.
good,"Customer service opened my eyes up on retail! I loved my job, but i had to let go of my job because i had to have ankle surgery in june 2014."
good,"during the early years, it was a good place to work. Pay was not always the best, but some of the funded benefits made up for it."
good,"Though Sears has been here for a long time, the quality of their products and their ability to provide, good customer support has decreased.  Too metric driven, Management too focused on self advancement and Metrics to provide associates with solutions to problems, support, and solutions with customer support issues.  Management is given too many incentives and freedom to do as they will to focus on the needs of their own stores."
good,"Never had a problem, just not enough hours. Commission based , could be better but if your looking for a part time job this is the place for you"
good,"Versatile finance professional with 4 years of experience making top decisions in finance, retail, and customer analytics. Hands-on subject matter expert in investment analysis, valuation, growth strategy development, financial planning & analysis, marketing mix modeling and operations strategy to improve business solutions and provide process efficiency."
good,Good company to work with a lot of great people t work with. The pay was ok but the benefits could have been better. The  best part about this job is that you take to different tech everyday and get to know them on a personal level. To hear there story about customer and the homes they work in made the time  go by faster. Working in the different city and learning there culture was amazing.
good,very boring experience only thing i enjoyed was the fact that at the end of two weeks i would get paid. based on my work experience i was underpaid and undervalued
good,"For technical support, I felt there could have been more scenarios played out in the training class. The avoid rate was high, especially in the summer when everyone's refrigerator stopped working."
good,Had the chance to work with a lot of great people in a fast paced work place. I did everything I was told and I was great at what I did. I learned a lot about floor plans and reading them right and making sure all the product was out on the floor in a timely manner. I chose to leave sears because I wasn't making anything and I have a daughter to support and also I was very good about working when it was my days off and I still would come in and get little reconginiton which I think is very important and I was also the only assistant manager who did not get every other weekend off and I didn't think that was right otherwise its a great place to work other then the pay and the recognition.
good,"Work day started around 8 AM and would end late at night, drove to customer's homes all over the state, management was not very helpfu"
good,"I had my ups and downs working for this corporation, but it help me learn fast.  A great amount of my retail skills came out of working for this corporation, and its fast pace environment."
good,"Sears provides a loyal job, with little room to advance. Most of the jobs within Sears, are sales based. I would recommend Sears to people looking for an entry level call center job."
good,"The team I work with is great. "
good,"Meeting, assisting customers along with creating displays was always a plus. I learned the value of team work. Management inspired an environment to achieve goals with positive feedback. The hardest part of my job was not being able to obtain a full time schedule."
good,"The managers are great here and care about their team. "
good,Sears Appliances and Hardware was a good place to work while home for the summer with a wide variety of interesting and friendly customers.
good,"The coworkers were great to work with, but the pay was commissioned based and at a slow store it was hard to make a living. Short lunch breaks for long days were no fun. And the company stressed signing customers up for the store credit card to much instead of focusing on customer needs."
good,Sears was a great place to begin to learn how to properly function from day to day in a workplace. The largest problem with this company was the fact that my managers and co-workers all seemed very apathetic towards their jobs.
good,Sears has a productive atomosphere for supportive customer service skills however there is not much room for personal growth at this company.
good,I would sell and return sporting goods. Handling money. I learned how to sell products to customers. I got along with my coworkers.
good,"when I 1st started at Sears, I enjoyed working there but as time goes by. too many management changed and structure crumbled."
good,The industry is fun and this is a very reputable company. The pay is very low.  No job advancement opportunities.  Not much too it but was exciting to meet racers and be involved in a great sport.
good,Great place to build a solid automotive foundation and learn how to perform basic maintenance services in a timely and safe manner.
good,"great location great sales major warehouse , great employer company and benefits , could have better pay and benefits and room to excel"
good,I like working at SEARS as undercover agent stopping shoplifters. but they had working in the morning. they at least 6 people caught but at this time it was only seniors coming in at that time.
good,Work with team members to fulfill the needs of all customers. To giude them on proper techniques on approach for customer service and continue to keep all merchandise fully stocked for customer selection.
good,"Working at sears was nothing I could not manage. The work pace is pretty slow, and you have a lot of time to learn more about your position."
good,I did learn more about retail. Co-workers were very helpful during training. Hours were reasonable and the majority of the customers were friendly.
good,I always enjoyed working for Sears/Kmart.  This company gave me a great career of 34 yrs and I would still be there if the distribution had not closed in April 2015.
good,There is no such thing as a typical day at Sears.  There is something new every day.  I have learned how to manage all different types of personality.  My co-workers are fun to work with.
good,Giving great customer service in retrieving and selling shoes and other various products sold in the store or in the different department
good,"i enjoyed working with the people that i did at sears, and the only flaw was that my hours weren't enough to make a living so i had to find something else"
good,no fue una buena experiencia respecto al ambiente de trabajo
good,"i was let go due to company down sizing in this area "
good,"Enjoyed being surrounded by people from different backgrounds and different countries. The working hours was the best thing in the job, allowed me to make the balance between work and family."
good,"Productive workplace with supportive management. Loved interacting with customers. Had to train new associates & help them achieve the numbers needed to stay on the team but also take care of my sales, credit applications & reward numbers. Had to translate for associates that did not speak Spanish. Maintain a clean work environment by sending returns & repairs to the correct department. Put Items on the sales floor."
good,It is great work place environment.I love working on new projects for the store everyday.Helping customers as well building new projects and fixing old projects with my colleages to advance the company.
good,"Clock in at the time you need to be in.  Take the register tills to the registers. Make sure the drawers are counted properly. Plus, help out customers while the store is open. Then if the truck arrives let them in to unload shipment. After it has arrived break down the shipment into departments. Then work those departments into the store for new stock. The associates are helpful and help out any way they can."
good,"At sears call center, as a Delivery & Technical Specialist, I had to endure various types of situations with customers, from having great experiences with the company to never wanting to buy from sears again. I learned how to control difficult situations with angry customers, I learned how to properly handle tough situations regarding compensations for their peace of mind. I gained computer skills by working with several different systems at once, along with more accurate typing skills. Phone etiquette was a must, I learned how to properly control the sound of my voice for unhappy customers, and how to ensure them that I was here to help them, that was my number one priority. I worked with wonderful co-workers who constantly were there to help when you needed, if a question was too difficult for them personally to answer, they didn't stop until they found some one who was capable of answering the question. The hardest part of the job is learning to not take customers frustration personally, they aren't angry with you, but rather the nature of the situation."
good,"Consultative sales at Sears requires measurement of too many metrics: sales per hour,percentage of transactions on digital devices, percentage of sales protection agreements, and others."
good,This is not a bad job at all until they push you to get people to sign up for credit cards that may or may not hurt there credit.
good,"the salary was not very gainful, and the legibility of a little hard work without any reward or conpensacion, mediocre medical service"
good,"this places has a reputation that was destroyed by a previous manager, because of that its not very busy. if you have your own clientele though that wont really be an issue. They pay commission with an hourly guarantee"
good,Good atmosphere and great people to work with.  Challenge market due to area which made it difficult to hit targets but managed.  Best part of the day was hitting goals.
good,"Computer proficient-Excellent communication skills"
good,This was a sales position based off of commission for selling product. the position promoted up-selling and pushed employees to leverage services on customers.
good,"Sears was a great company when I started 21 years ago. Unfortunately the current ceos don't want to pay people or fix up their stores. It's ok for part timers, but no career advancement."
good,Sears as a company is great. unfortunately the management at my particular store wasn't doing their job. It is very unorganized. Employees are given no priority whatsoever.
good,I enjoyed working for a company where my employees were younger and full of motivation.  The was a great place to gain Managerial experience.
good,I enjoyed the team I worked with but we needed an upgrade in management to feel more lively. Other than that it wasn't a bad place to work.
good,I would check with management to see how the sales were going for the month.  See what quotas we needed.  Also check with other associates to see how they were doing.
good,Come in before store opens to set prices for merchandise. how to enter information into there systems at a faster pace then before starting. People at my location can be rude but that was just where I was. Management could be WAY better. Not getting enough hours was tough. I did like how easy my job was.
good,"It was a job, it was okay when I started but now everything is not good. Worker have to find new jobs now...................."
good,"Fun work place with supportive management"
good,"I feel like some Lowe's were super friendly and others where very aggressive and poor managed. The company in itself is super fantastic. However, I worked for one location that was super amazing and really fun to work with and the other location was terribly hostile."
good,"I lead the sales team in Appliances sales, warrenty sales. I also was a Assistant Manager. I also handle getting money out and putting money in the safe."
good,"first real job. "
good,"Simple, comfortable workplace environment.  Management did a good job of communicating expectations and instructions to staff.  Staff cooperated well and worked with management to foster feelings of teamwork."
good,Working with team members to make sales goal and find customer resolution. Needs to stay current on technology and trends.
good,Sears is a good place to start a career path. I would not recommend it being a long term goal. Management works well with employees.
good,"Lots of amateur technicians fresh from school, with little or no experience in the automotive field. They do not provide accurate training for technicians as far as torquing down lug nuts, how to not strip oil pan bolts, etc."
good,Sears as we all know is a leading Company in North America. I am rather privileged to be a part of this group.  The working environment in Sears is friendly and there are people from all walks of life . I am gaining tremendous experience as through customer service I met people which help me enhance my skills  and understand Canadian Culture better.
good,"Liked this job very well, but was forced out when building was closed"
good,"Prepared reports for extending credit and lending money."
good,Fun to work at. Pay could be better. Really have to be thick skinned to deal with some different type attitudes. Coworkers are very friendly and helpful as well as most managers

good,"waiting for a customer to purchase a bed or anything that had to deal with a bedroom so you can make a sale and get commission. "
good,Great place to start a retail career.  I learned a lot about hand tools power tools lawn and garden tools.  water heaters and garage door openers.
good,It was enjoyable to interact with so many people every day and to have quotas to reach and learn from others the best way to reach them. I was frequently motivated to always be better.
good,"Sears is a great place to develop your skills and test your knowledge. There will be a lot of decision making, problem solving, inventive and creative daily tasks. I've learned that I can do anything and hard work pays off because you will be challenged in every aspect of the business field working in management at Sears. A typical day consist of driving sales in the store and developing your team to constantly win at their goals they must meet. Management is friendly and available for all needs and questions to be answered. The co workers are fun and supportive. The hardest part of the job is adapting to the different customers you face daily. The most enjoyable part is always finding new ways to improve or trying a new method to win."
good,"A typical day at Sears is like most automotive places not a lot changes, either you know the business or you don't. Same results,different job it's all about customer satisfaction and making a profit. I know to treat clients as if I'm on their side of the counter. Most important part of the day is achieving goals that are set for me, rather weekly or monthly goals."
good,"As a girl with no prior job experience, this company does a good job of settling you into the job world. I was taught many useful skills that will surely help me in the future. My coworkers were very friendly and helpful. Overall great first job."
good,"Acquisition de connaissances et de compétences surtout a niveau personnel. "
good,Worked here for about 3 years. Taking inbound calls for Sears appliances. Troubleshooting and parts sales. training was good and floor helpers knew more then supervisors.
good,"Sears is a great company. I enjoy my co-workers and a number of customers.I love working for the people and I love providing and giving great customer service because its a mutual thing."
good,This was the best job! I was able to work and then go to school without a scheduling hitch. The management was extremely easy going.
good,I enjoy meeting new people and working at sears allowed me to meet all types of people and have acquaint relationships with my regular customers.
good,"Learn how to communicate with customers"
good,Good company to work for. They promote teamwork and have team meeting weekly. Management is required to meet with you one on one once a week as well.
good,Most of the days are fun and sometimes face paces. Checking out customers was really fun. Having to ask the customer so many questions would annoy them and if we didn't we could get in trouble so that was hard.
good,We had to meet a requirement of 30 orders per hour. The warehouse is still under construction. Which made me learn how to adapt to picking orders in a large facility. I averaged a pick speed of 27 oph.
good,We set up ads every sunday and merchandise the items in your area.  My main area was electronics and I priced that area and set plan-o-grams. It is very hard work and a  lot. It could get very overwhelming at times and sometimes frustrating but I loved what I did there and I got the job done.
good,This was my first job after 17 years of being a housewife and at home Mom. I learned how to be the best customer advisor I could be. To treat customer with the up most resect and consideration to their automotive needs.
good,"Part time positions on sales. Great company for starters. High school job. Commission work.All time in stand up position, no time ti relax."
good,"My day started by getting all the sales reports and data needed to do my stores reports. Checked the department for needs and cleanliness. Resets, price changes, remerchandising, markdowns and department standards. Management on the Sears side was to be desired. I had 6 managers in 12 years. Staffing and  attendance  was always a problem. My employees were great! They were respectful of my position and did what was required on a daily basis without direction. The hardest part of my job was to be in my area doing the things needing to be done when the Sears side of the store would want me to do projects for them. I was most of the time understaffed and my department needed my attention. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the customers."
good,"A typical day at work includes watching CCTV monitors for potential shoplifters and internal cases, checking back stocks for quality merchandise control, and maintaining the safety of the store. All the staff is friendly, but at times can be unorganized. The worst part of the job is the pay."
good,a very nice and enjoyable place to work for a large company. the management staff are very supportive with a positive attitude
good,Sometimes it was very boring looking for shoplifters but when we apprehended someone it made it worth it. Cooworkers were good to work with too.
good,"Handled money, customer service, stocking, bagging.  Counted the cash drawer out every night at closing. Assisted customers finding what they were looking for and answering any questions.  Answered the phone and directed to right department.  Only worked for Sear for a short 3 months before that location closed."
good,"the atmosphere at sears was old and musty place need some updating, leaders had no idea how to run their teams, place was a disaster"
good,Sears really taught me a lot on how to deal with all sorts of people.  And showed me I can deal with a high stress environment.  Also taught me a lot about how department stores run.
good,"This job pays 7.25 an hour and do not offer any full time positions. You do not receive a raise. You do receive 2$ extra if you sell over 5 credit cards that month which is really hard."
good,"On a typical work day I would be assigned to a department and would work the register assisting customers completing their purchase and processing online orders and returns. The hardest part of my job was not being able to leave the register area in order to assist customers, we would have to call the floor runners. I enjoyed my co-workers and management staff."
good,Primary responsibility to provide quality customer service by addressing any questions or concerns of the customer regarding customers' issues with company products and find solutions within company policies to help the customer in a timely fashion.
good,My daily duties consisted of phone calls from a customers who needed to purchase large orders. I was responsible for one of the largest accounts but due to the recent decisions to no longer use Sears my job become obsolete so i was laid off.
good,fun place to work. I really liked that fact that everybody there was pretty much like a family. Id recommend it. Great place laid back
good,This job can be calm but also crazy. and i enjoy that. there is always someone to help or a project that needs to get done. id work there again.
good,A typical day would require me to work the evening shift from 5:00-11:00. Then I would go home get into my bed and fall asleep just to wake up again at 7:00 in the morning to go to school. I did this for at least 4 out of the 5 school days. I did all this just to earn $300 every two week.
good,"As an associate, this was no more than a placeholder job. It's your standard minimum wage work with a manager, customers, and coworkers."
good,"During my employment with Sears, there seemed to be no direction both on the store and corporate level. Morale was low and employee turnover was about 35%."
good,Sears use to be a good company to work for but their management is not so strong. They do not work together or are back there employees.
good,typical day is pretty busy but the work flow fluctuates.. this store is in the mall so the traffic depends on the day of the week and whats going on in the mall
good,Generally nice atmosphere with nice personable coworkers. Competitive pay with chances to move up. Lots of training provided in house at no charge. Always a push to further your knowledge.
good,long term growth is questionable. better benefits/pay for hourly employees. consistently need communication on company's growth.
good,"Responsible for opening or closing registers, handling money, assisting members with online orders, knowledgeable of products, warranties and home service based on commission."
good,Good place to learn but unideal for someone to grow fast however good opportunities to earn commission. but managers are rarely on the sales floor
good,"Sears Holdings (Kmart stores specifically) is not the best company to work for. In the Kmart store I worked at, almost everybody was minimum wage, including senior employees. There is little to no opportunity for advancement. However the work atmosphere does promote teamwork and effectiveness. It was great for a high school job, which was what it was for me, but not a good idea to start a career there."
good,"Its alright place to work, the hours can be bad at some point.The mangers can sometimes be hard to work with. Typical day is usual just unloading the truck and putting out new products and helping customers."
good,"I would recommend sears décor, these stores are apart from the department stores and operate differently. The staff is very supportive and we are family like."
good,I was a cashier so I would ring people out. Offer them to sign up with our credit cards and I also was a sales  associates. So I would help customer out on the floor and make sure they was finding everything ok.
good,Good place for the first job. Learned important job skills that can help  in the future. Also very flexible with the hours.
good,"Sears is a great place to work and learn"
good,"Though I have no desire to work retail again, my time at Sears was beneficial. Face to face sales was a very positive experience for me, and a skill I look forward to developing further."
good,Worked very hard outside almost all day. When the building boom was in Las Vegas this company was the best Construction Company to work for
good,"As a guest service person, you come in at 7am to fill out the tills for the store to open at 8. Having to run back and forth from the service desk to the cashiers to help them out all by yourself gets a little tiresome. But the coworkers were always able to help out when its a need. I enjoyed working with them."
good,"·	Complaint Desk."
good,"No room for advancement. Get use to horrible pay, and a store manager who is running the store into the ground, good luck."
good,"At the being of my day I would have to weigh items coming to me from the assemlby line, ticket them with postage and sort in bins for different locations."
good,"A typical day was stocking, creating and changing displays, inventory and customer service with some sales. My coworkers were also my friends outside of work, which made work feel more like fun. When Corporate Sears started letting people off, we lost a lot of great managers. Because of that the store was always short staffed and stretched pretty thin, effecting our service and stress of work load."
good,"A typical day, depending on what dayis, you are putting merchandise on the sales floor.  You are creating sale signs for that merchandise and making sure it is in the proper area of the sales floor."
good,"The office had that competitive spirit, with us trying to undo each other in terms of sale numbers. Management also gave weekly and monthly incentives"
good,"i worked in the electronics department. For the most part, my day consist of helping and assisting customers. in addition i would also help out in the stock room. overall, i learned how to speak to customers and how to provide the best customers service possible"
good,"A typical day at Sear's was slow. We had more down time then anything, during the down time we usually cleaned or put TV's together."
good,"Sears is an iconic company where I have performed excellence on customer service and I was proud of my job."
good,"This is a straightforward retailer.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the sometimes difficult customers.  Also, it can be a challenge to meet some of the PA sales goals."
good,I handled customers and tried to sell merchandise to customers. I thought it was a good place to work and I learned about product placement and sales from this job. I am sorry the place had to shutdown.
good,"Reach out to former and current customers who may be interested in purchasing or extending a warranty for products from Sears, explaining the benefits of an extended warranty and establishing trust so at to reach a valued outcome for the customer"
good,"pues trabajo almance, aprender la introducion de ellos como va trabajo, conocer dos companeros buenos me comunica, la mas dificil es la supervisora y oficina porque no sabe la ley ADA y gracias pormi experiencia"
good,"It can be very confusing, especially as a first job. This was the first job where I actually WORKED. Where I was taught how to work a cash register and did all my customer service. At Sears Outlet, they had amazing deals that I could get behind. I loved working there. Hardest part of this job would be keeping up with the always changing sales and the management was alright. I got along with all of the managers I had. The only problem I really had was trying to get people to sign up for a Sears Credit Card. I'm just not very good at getting people to sign up for something they'll have to pay off such as a credit card."
good,"My day starts out at around seven a.m.  I work with two other associates on the merchandising team who are excellent workers and we all get along great.  We are very independent workers who work with very little supervision.  The hardest part of the job is trying to complete all tasks in a very small time frame, my most enjoyable part aside from my co workers is leaving at the end of my shift feeling I have accomplished all my goals."
good,"Enjoyed my time at Sears. The company financials are causing deep shifts in compensatory areas, so I must reluctantly leave."
good,sears is only for part time and if you dont have responsibilities. force people to open credit cards so cashiers can get commission.
good,Fast paced work environment that challenged me to work towards meeting goals. The hardest part of the job was selling sears cards. The co-workers were nice too.
good,I would walk the area and acess what needed to be done. Met with the leadsand went over it. Read all company correspondence and answered accordingly.
good,"II Inputted all data entry for Sears Repair technician’s routes, and provided professional customer service by answering the phones, inputting customer information, handling customer complaints and directing incoming calls. I learned a lot about excel and other computer functions. My co-workers were great there, I met a lot of friends. The hardest part of my job was keeping up with my repair technicians, because sometimes they would not cntact me when they leave a site. The most enjoyable was being able to create them efficient well coordinated routes making sure they had enough time to complete each job and putting that in the system for them the next day."
good,Sears service is stepping up its technology and innovation. No one will be able to touch what Sears is doing for service.
good,juggling retail floor duties and customer satisfaction. Could use balance of work load among employees and much better management.  Needs leading by example to enhance delegating as opposed to vague supervision with little accountability.
good,Company itself struggles with trying to compete with the changing consumer base. However the people you work with make the job worth all the stress and shortcomings.
good,Its very slow and very boring. I've only learned about the sears master card everything else ive already known. Management isn't to helpful. my co-workers are friendly but seem to avoid actual work. the hardest part about my job is not having anything to do.
good,it was an interesting workexperience here at sears. I enjoyed the job a lot as a senior in high school. The constant need for credit apps is a bit of a drag however.
good,If you're not cmpetative then this is not the job for you. Its a rewarding job and fun based.It gives you great experience because they teach you how to open up credit cards/store cards and how to use a register.
good,"This job offers daily personal interaction, in combination with competitive compensation. I recommend this job to individuals looking for commission."
good,Qualifying and Confirming Home Sales Appointments for home improvement.  The job has a set salary with commission set for sales and appointments set
good,A typical work day started at 5 am and ended at 4 pm. I learned a great deal about logistical operations and managing inventory. I had a great group of co-workers who understood teamwork. The hardest part of the job was holding the import vendors accountable. The most enjoyable part of the job was training other management members and associates on logistics operations.
good,I worked as a cashier but I also had to do credit card sales and clean fitting rooms at the end of the day. It was very hard doing all these tasks especially because i was hired as a cashier only.
good,Not much chance of promotion. Not much job stability because departments constantly get closed down due to outsourcing over seas.
good,"Greet customers, discuss type, quality and quantity of merchandise or services sought for purchase, rental or lease Advise customers on use and care of merchandise Provide advice concerning specialized products or services Estimate or quote prices, credit terms, trade-in allowances, warranties and delivery dates."
good,While working at Sears I was able to become confident while interacting with others and customers. I was able to identify customers wants and needs and match that customer's particular preferences to a product in which they were satisfied.
good,"I have gained experience in project planning, event planning, and providing business analysis. I am a liaison between multiple business teams which has led me to excel in my communication skills."
good,"I entered at 4:00 p.m. right after school, then quickly started my work. They moved me into two section, first the shoe department. There I helped people find what they where looking for, then i went to retrieve it. the second section was the kitchen and bedroom appliances. In this section i cleaned the dusty shelves, tapped the ripped open boxes, restocked the shelves, and helped the customer find what they needed. My co-workers where fun and helpful people that helped me when i had trouble finding a product the customer wanted. I Learned discipline, to be respectful to my superiors, and learned to interact with people more than before i started to work there. The most enjoyable part of the job was break time with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was trying to convince a customer that one product is the same as another product even though both products are from different companies."
good,I did enjoy working at Sears.  What was really hard was getting children to smile when they didn't want to be there or they were not feeling good.
good,"I worked at  Sears from Pasadena Mall. The cashier employees are great! They are so nice, helpful, and fun. The job itself is pretty easy, when there  are no customers you can just stand around. However, management is terrible. I strongly dislike the cashier manager. She is rude and gives too much attitude. Not only is she rude to the employees but to the customers too.  Sears is VERY SERIOUS about 'Credit Apps'  you need to get AT LEAST 4 a day. If not they WILL fire you."
good,"A typical day consists of many transactions and asking every person if they are a member and if they want to apply for a card. Making sure we serve, delight and engage our member as they shop their way is our logo. My co-workers are awesome teammates and I love working with them."
good,My days were busy with ordering jewelry and the day to day running of the jewelry department. I learned great time management skills. My direct manager was amazing and a great teacher. I loved meeting new people each day and helping them with purchases for special occasions.
good,"My days were very busy and I learned great time management. The management had some opportunities. The co-workers were very helpful. I worked a lot of hours in this position, but we had a great team."
good,"Member Rally, conference calls and reports. I learned to multitask. The management is aggressive. The co-workers are team oriented. The hardest part of the job is time away from home. Most enjoyable of the job is the members and mentoring associates."
good,"Every day working as a sales consultant offered new and unique challenges. I enjoyed matching clients with products that met their needs, and providing post-sale support via text, phone calls, and email correspondences."
good,"Every job has its ups and downs days, our job was basically based off of credit, it can be really easy or it can be really hard. Co-workers are okay, it was mixed from young to old so that made it cool. It is a nice easy job to have at the moment, managers do what they have to do as well as everyone else to keep the company going."
good,"Sears is a great place to work for if you really love to work. I've learned a lot of people skills, how to handle all types of customers and issues. Co-workers and management are great and we treat each other like family at our call center location. The only downfall of the company, is that the health care and benefits aren't very affordable."
good,loved going to work just the task where to short and the hours wasnt enough and meeting new people was very interesting because i am a peoples persons and love too meet new faces
good,"In every work area in my life i have been able to look back and see what i have learned and how i have grown as a person and as a professional. I believe we can learn something from everyone.I worked in a very high pase environment, where we worked as a team to accomplish the stores goals. My husband got a new job so i stopped working and helped him."
good,Friendly and helpful people to work with. Learned every dept. and learned a lot about the customer relations from Sears.
good,"They were ALWAYS short staffed. It would never fail. They were always on your case about getting people to sign up for credit cards, and if you didn't meet the numbers then you got fired."
good,Excellent at working around your availability. Numbers driven company that is experiencing an economic depression.  Unreasonable sales goals and undermines customer first sales mantra
good,Lots of management with different plans or ideas that do not fit the situation. Worked there for many years without developing into management
good,"Most of the time, after training, there is only one employee working at a studio at a time.  Mostly the job was pretty straight forward. With the reduced staffing, the company should review the ability for double booking photography sessions."
good,"we worked very hard, you get to work and get your job done.  if you knew what you needed to do there was nothing for anyone to tell you anything.  i thin it was short handed witch put a load on us everyday."
good,"A typical day at work is being harassed by rude customers but always keeping a smile on your face.Working at Sears i learned that patience is key and that there are genuinely kind people out there. My manager is always kind and understanding, the higher-ups don't understand whats going on in the stores but push us to do better when we have nothing to do better with. My co-workers are the best, most of them are always are there watching your back or when you need help. The hardest part of my job is the thought of getting a high priced item you have sold returned. The most enjoyable part of my day is always seeing the pleased look of a grateful customer after a sale."
good,Basically the most important duty is doing credit applications in any way you can. Your routine as a cashier will be asking each customer for their phone number/email and asking for credit apps.
good,I was young and trying to make my place in the working world.  It was a challenge because one manager would assign a task and another would change it with out the proper communication.
good,working there was great just the pay was not to great. if you not in need of a good pay check this is a good high school job. For a college student this job is not so great
good,Being a cashier is frustrating at some points. Sometimes it is fun because I have great conversations with customers and other employees. I like my manager. They need to hire more people though.
good,A regular day at a retail store. The environment is ok. The people and pay are ok. Sometimes day gets boring. I've not learned any new job skills.
good,"it was a great learning experience, being that my previous job was very stressful it was great to be around positive energetic employees"
good,"I've worked at SHC for almost 9 years and I have learned a ton about corporate structures, finance, accounting, marketing, etc.  It's a great place to work to get a feel for all areas of a retail organization.  The culture is very dependent on your individual team and dept.  It's a very large organization with mini sub-cultures.  Overall, it's a fine place to work.  The people are very talented and bright.  There's just a lot of red tape to get through, just like any other large organization."
good,"My job as the first Appliance Selection Consultant in Colorado was to meet with new homebuyers and help them with the selection of their new kitchen appliances.  I would schedule the deliveries with the builder and work with the delivery company to insure proper delivery and installation.  Problem solving with appliances were out of stock."
good,"My day to day activities include, maintaining current customer relations, building new client relationships, problem solving,  bidding projects, contract preparations, Work with the builder to schedule appliances and also work with the delivery company to insure proper deliveries and installation of product."
good,Not to many qualms about the job. Very good compensation package for employees. Work environment was on confrontational
good,"Nice place to work at. co-workers were nice to work with, always joking around and having good conversation while getting the work done."
good,stock and recieve unload and load trucks etc i would do mpu which is merchandise pick up custer service as well i enjoyed here cause i use my hands and do physicall work which i prefer but i like to work period
good,I always have nice people to work with. We always have a project to do and the customers are always nice to be around! I also learned a lot about floor plans and the way departments should be set up.
good,"Lots of driving.Home office changed repair production ratings to sales ratings,also away from customer service.Co-workers worked well together to complete assigned jobs."
good,"Typical Day at work: quiet, Fast Pace "
good,"The hardest part of my job is my pay.  I have not had a raise in 7 years.  The cost of living goes up but my pay does not. "
good,"I come in and put out my Ray Ban frames, open the store using the Eye Net system, open the cash register, count money and start the daily reconciliation envelope. Days without doctor, we are single coverage. I answer phones, use an online appointment book, pull insurances, prepare charts for the doctor, call and confirm appointments. When our orders are delivered I check in the glasses, confirming they are properly made, bench align and call customers. I dispense and adjust as well as trouble shoot any complaint. We also sell and dispense contact lenses. When needed I teach insertion and removals. I sell glasses, collect information needed to make the proper recommendations for glasses, take measurement for all styles of bifocals. We do PA's regularly through the day and are ask to do outreach through the day to connect with customers and invite them into the optical. I do the end of day closing, reconciling cash register to Eye Net system."
good,"I arrive 15 minutes early to do opening procedures which include; signing out keys for jewelry cases, opening up the safe and putting out jewelry, counting jewelry, turning on and counting cash drawers, and opening the gate to the mall. Throughout the shift I would greet every customer in the area and assist those that are looking to purchase something from my department, as well as assisting other customers to find the department they were looking for. "
good,"Though the resent management of my branch has left a particularly bad taste in my mouth, the company is more than worth while.  I just with they hadn't put the wrong kind of person in  charge"
good,Sears cuenta con buen ambiente de trabajo y mucha cooperación de parte de los compañeros.
good,"I sold paint/hardware. Enjoyed interacting with customers but since it was a part time job , there was no benefits. The management was good and allowed flexibility in assisting customers and gave bonus' for certain items."
good,"Great company, you will get to learn a lot! But management sucks real bad here! Overall you will like it since you get a lot of time off."
good,working at sears is good what can be better is the pay rate and the customer traffic which most of the time its fairly non busy which I'm on commision and if you want to make big money it is not here there are not enough customers coming here and the competition is not making it any easier. the one thing sears got going on is its protection plans are the best in the industry and if the competition decides to the same then sears will have a big challenge to stay alive.
good,"Good co-workers and manager"
good,Typical retail work. Dealing with customers and associates. Deal with day to day issues that arise and take care of the customers.
good,"They could pay their associates better for the work that is required, and treat their associates better. But overall I enjoyed working with the people at the store."
good,"Sears has been around forever and everyone knows it.  It seems like one of those companies that actually holds a nostalgic place in alot of peoples hearts who remember shopping there as kids."
good,"Overall the working environment at sears was mediocre, the pay rate was low and management seem to be non existence when things needed to get done."
good,Management take advantage of commission sales representatives. Make them work several hours before and after hours without pay.  For example... 100% commission sales representatives have no way to earn commission before and after working hours yet they are asked to come  early and stay late.
good,"The company as a whole I was not the biggest fan. However the store I worked in had such an amazing team with loving, hardworking, and dedicated associates."
good,As long as you are competitive and know how to sell the job is great! Have to be able to beat other associates for sales and for the change to get to a customer.
good,"My typical day would be customer service, stocking warehouse, problem solving, loading/unloading trucks and shipping out products.  I learned customer service and how to organize the warehouse up to managements expectations, and this was one of the hardest parts of the job.  Co-workers were friendly and pleasant to work with."
good,"I worked my way up to Sales Manager while there. I experience some of the best and some of the worst work ethics and personalities, which certainly enriched my experience.  Able to read customers needs and budgetary restraints almost immediately. "
good,"Handling incoming calls from customers wanting to purchase merchandise at a  sears Full Line Store. Learned useful skills and knowledge regarding retail within sears. Enjoyed my co-workers, got along well with all."
good,"A place that you come in, clock in, hope for customers, worry about making your required numbers and clock out. I learned to work with customers, come up with ways to meet required numbers with little customer traffic, and to learn and research skills when management weren't available."
good,"A day starts with meet and greet with team to understanding and planning each and every day to provide solutions and current status of tasks. "
good,internal workings were a challenge to deal with. it is very much what you make of it though. from a tech standpoint there wasn't a lot of room for growth.
good,"A typical day  at Sears was always full of good humor and some fun where you learned different things all the time due to not having enough people. Example of the latter being my transfer from MCA to Mattresses, but still performing some MCA tasks. "
good,This employer is a good employer. I believe they can improve on the way they do business and treat customers. overall they are satisfactory.
good,"Sears is a true vertical environment, in store initiative is discourage, morale is low and there is a high turnover of lower level positions.  Sears executive level may understand money but they do not understand people and this is why they are doing so poorly."
good,My coworkers were excellent. Very friendly & helpful people. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers.
good,"Minimal hours, pay, and no real benefits except 10% discount on purchases. Offers good ethical working environment with very friendly fellow employees, though many steal sales from return customers while you are away. Must maintain metrics to get bonuses and keep employment though these are not hard if you make an effort."
good,"If you expect to work here you will probably need some sort of teleportation device, because i ran everywhere during my job and was let go for not being fast enough."
good,"""Steady on"" activity level for job was ideal. Sears Store #2043 had a great culture and talent pool of devoted/invested team players."
good,"I worked for Sears for a very short time. I started out working there for the Christmas season as a merchandiser, which I really loved. but after Christmas it was slow, so I was able to get a full time cashier job there. Loved my co-workers, but management was pushy and you are under a microscope daily. they make you push Sears credit and check on you all day long. They want you to lie to the customer to get that application, it is crazy. If you do not make daily quota for credit, you are threatened with termination, over and over. I finally left because the pressure was just awful I will miss my co-workers, because they were awesome, but will not miss most of management. Not a good place to work."
good,"The location is in Friendly Shopping Center in Greensboro, NC.An ok place to work. The slow pace was very challenging at times. Other workers made the job easier."
good,"I was relieved of my job for picking up the slack of other lazy workers! Sears Auto group is a joke, they hire and keep the lazy no good liars and fire the hard working and honest ones lol what do ya make of that??"
good,Action packed when we are in the process of cathcing shopliffters as well as makign sure all high values items are protected correctly.
good,This was a great place to work when the old management was still working.  New management came in in the auto department and since then business has kinda gone down hill.
good,"C'est un travail plus ou moins physique car il faut rester debout et déplacer plusieurs objets au courant de la journée, il faut être sociable et débrouillard car plusieurs problèmes avec les clients/marchandises peuvent survenir ."
good,"But the minimum wage was $7.40 per-hour that's only enough for bus fare and lunch."
good,I enjoyed working for this company for twenty years.  A typical day started with getting store opened and ensuring that cashiers were greeting customers and asking the right questions.  Listen and coach associates on asking customers for credit; selling protection agreements; signing customers up for rewards program.  Ensure that freight was put out and store ready for business.
good,"needed team work.it was good with good customer service"
good,"My typical day at Sears was so busy and it seemed to just fly by.  Everyday I had opportunities to learn something new.  I totally enjoyed the interaction with my associates and customers.   In a business that caters to customers, being positive is an asset in resolving issues as they arise.  My co-workers in management strived to maintain a unified front.  We were a strong team at the store level.  The upper management at corporate level  was usually available for help when needed. The hardest part of my job was dealing with attendance issues of associates.  My most enjoyable part of the job was the developing of relationships, both in house and with our customers.  I have made lifetime friends from my tenure at Sears."
good,Title sums it all up!  No wonder the store I worked at went under!  The employees were no better at my store.  They had inappropriate relationships with each other.
good,"Horaire varié"
good,The company is having challenges and if you are in a small store there are more challenges than normal.  you find yourself on the register more and  not able to lead the team and building.
good,"Not bad for a entry level job. As a college they were flexible with me. The only bad part was the pay. Work there for some pocket money not a lot of chances for a raise, to be honest."
good,This was good interim job but I would not want to do it as a full time career. The people at Sears were friendly & I loved the employee discount.
good,"Most days are started reconciling previous days audits and planning for the day..I learned to manage time with duties..with goals and operational needs.Helped manager and supervisors with information for start up meetings...worked with great people daily. I help direct the audit direction inside the loss prevention department. I assisted in theft investigations and information gathering, the hardest part of the job is negotiating corporate objectives with local operational procedures. The most enjoyable part of the job is improving the overall accuracy of the warehouse to it's customers the stores."
good,Work environment is ok. Either young professionals that are coming in and out or older coworkers that have been with the company for 20+ years.  Huge gap between generations and how they communicate/interact.
good,Great for a college student but there are too many required task during the day for the amount of pay you get. There are plenty other  places you could work at while getting paid more for less stress.
good,Assisted customers with purchases of large appliances. Became well versed in large appliance benefits in brands. Coworkers were always helpful in the learning process.
good,"Hi"
good,Okay place for a job not a career. Work atmosphere always busy. People are great to get along with. Always busy so your day goes by fast.
good,"A day at sears was super busy! I always had calls! I loved how fast paced it was though, it makes the day go faster! the managers were always a big help!"
good,"I like this job. But it was very demanding. business, for most of the time I was there. It was a place I could develop my skills as an automotive tech. only had 45min. launch brakes."
good,Awesome place to learn and expand your knowledge. Being able to work with senior leadership provides a lot of experience on how to review and measure the success of a business.
good,I enjoyed working alongside the other Department Managers and Customer Service Representatives.
good,I'm looking for a management opportunity with a growing company
good,"I usually spend the first couple of hours on tasks.  I complete dispositions, price audits, monthly sales planner changes, price changes, out of stocks, bring new products out to the floor, mark down old products, schedule employees for work weekly.  The rest of my shift is completed running the floor, handling customer complaints, coaching sales employees, selling products if short staffed or busy, cash exchanges for registers, answering phone calls, and ensuring associates are on task."
good,"Retail customer service assist customers with merchasndise selection and location, prepared invoices and work orders , solve problems"
good,"A typical day at Sears would primary start with checking the duties board. Depending on the time of the shift the duties would include set up and take down of company ads, replenishing products on the sales floor, assisting customers with questions and concerns, making price adjustments and maintaining the cleanliness of the sales floor. I gained a great respect for anyone that works in customer service industry especially in retail. The management was supportive but there was a high turnover rate so it involved the staff adjusting to new management almost every year. My coworkers were very fun to be around and was very willing to help me in any way I needed. The hardest part about the job was some heavy lifting that I was challenged by considering my height. The hardest part about my job was having a lot of down time where I couldn't stimulate my brain as much as  I would like to. I'm glad I have had the opportunity to work in the retail industry but I wouldn't choose it as a career move."
good,There are some really great people that work here but there are also some that aren't really concerned with the success of the store or themselves. Overall the moral is rather low. I did learn many new skills as I hadn't worked in retail before and it provided me wit income until I found a job closer to home.
good,Enjoy working and assisting a wide spectrum of people. There is not  a day that goes by that is the same as another day.
good,"Effectuer les transactions;"
good,Learned how to sell products based on the knowledge provided by the company
good,my job at sear is to serve delight and engage in order to give member a wow experience. management is not very dependable when u need them they just kind of hide in there office me and my felow co workers assist each other with new things thats we need to learn the hardest part about my job is im the only one willing to learn new things and do every one else jobs on top of mine
good,"Adequate if you have a supplemental income. Training is medioc e, but is more applicable to a full line store."
good,I enjoyed my time there as a jewelry associate. Some days were busier than others. I liked interacting with my customers. We had to meet many sales goals. Management was okay.
good,The Typical day was fast and great. the people where nice the hardest part of the job was trying to get people to sign up for the card. the enjoyable part was being able to help a costumer find what they where looking for.
good,"i did manual work orders for members of Sears for delivery team to go back in any need of leveling, hooking up, etc of merchandise"
good,"I go to houses and repair equipment in the customers kitchen."
good,"I was started as a Consultative Sales Associate in Fine Jewelry and was responsible for performing excellent customer service with knowledge of the products and additonal ammenities offered by the company. Within eight months, I was promoted to the department lead/coordiantor with the additional responsibilties of handling customer resolutions and handling cash office duties at closing. My co-workers were all hard working honest individuals that took pride in maintaining a work environment that exceeded customer and employee expectations. The hardest part of the job was the language barrier that was presented on occasion. I would have to say that the most enjoyable part of being a Sear's team member was providing customer service that brought customer's back to our store time and time again. It was satisfying to sell a customer an item that they loved and know that they were leaving the store happy with their purchases."
good,"I feel they could be more professional in training their employees, but everything else was as a job should be"
good,"The experience was frustrating. I seriously worked with a girl who was there eight years more than me and she made 5 cents more an hour than I did. Advancement opportunities are pretty abundant if you simply mention an interest in advancement. However, these opportunities exist because people keep jumping ship."
good,I loved working with Sears for 25 years.  The hardest part was the turn over of District managers and learning their style of managing.
good,"Sears was a fun place to be. The company takes pride in being an equal opportunity employer. All kinds of people were on the team. We got along great most of the time. The rules at the company should apply to all employees. A typical day at work felt short. After leaving this position I was prepared for work at any large retailer. I learned a lot of skills and tasks that have helped me in jobs ever since. On the best days, it felt like a big, happy family. On the worst days, it was extremely stressful. My co-workers were friendly and polite, even though we weren't all treated the same all the time."
good,"sold in the hardware department"
good,If my personal life didn't get in the way I would had stayed longer.
good,"Sears was my first job right after high school. It was a part time job, its a cool place to work you get to learn alot of different things i got to see celebrities. Co workers were nice i build outside relationships with them. The hardest part of the job was meeting all the critera of the department expectations. Enjoyable part was the people you meet."
good,"My job was just to maintain the cash wrap and assist customers with their holiday shopping, finding sizes and styles. I wasn't there long because it was seasonal"
good,"This is a good entry level job if you're into interacting with customers. If you're good in sales or convincing people to purchase something they may not need, this will be the job for you. If you're a sales employee, you will need to build good rapport with customers since it's a commission base job."
good,Sears holding was an okay job. There is lots of room for advancement. Once you get a position you train yourself for the most part. There is never anyone that's not busy to help because they were very understaffed. The customers were WONDERFUL! They told us several times we weren't closing but then after it was uploaded to facebook we found out they were. My co-workers were great too just not enough of them
good,It was only to be temporay-part time job   but it was fun to do somethimg different. Just moved here it was my  first job. Was not a busy place at the time
good,I worked in the top tier escalations department. A typical day consisted of 80-100 calls per day with at least 5 different lines of business. I provided excellent customer service as well as account management. I really enjoyed helping our customers with atypical predicaments. Management was always very helpful and tried to provide a healthy work environment.
good,Learn a lot about inventory and leadership.  Was rewarding but didn't pay what I needed to maintain my household.
good,entry level starter job…fun environment nice place to work work high school students
good,"You work with many good people , but as in most retail stores they are short on help so you may do more than your job in a day . You learn to be flexible and how to multi task .You learn how to deal with people both good and bad but, dealing with the good customers makes your job more fulfilling . Management as all jobs has it's easy to work with &some not so easy ."
good,"Enjoyed the job and my co-workers could not advance, they did not hire women on a commission basis.  max pay $4,00 per hour"
good,"I enjoy working as a customer solutions advisor, because I enjoy helping others. The job can be hard when dealing with escalated calls however I have learned and accepted that it challenges me to grow in certain areas, in a good way."
good,"I worked as a cashier. The people are nice, and they really adhered to my busy schedule"
good,"Sears is a very well managed store, from everyone in the management to the co workers"
good,Slow day. You learn warehouse management and running forklift. Management is good and co-workers are pleasant. Hardest part of the job is helping customers. Best part of the job is also helping customers.
good,"Sears is a great company to work for, this was my first job in Human Resources field. I gained lots of skills and learnt lots. I do Pre-Screening of applicant, job postings online, orientation for new hires, internal letters, performance reviews, attendance management, and more. "
good,"The Sears call center Paid well and had fair job security, but it had the atmosphere of a high school.  Most of the time you concentrate on work, but a lot of the time you would be dealing with a high school kind of environment. This was some of the time with but most of the time with other departments.  Then they would drag their home problems into work and not just to talk about.  Other then the high school type environment it was a nice place to work and most of the people would be friendly if their not involved in some sort of drama.  My departments management however kept most of this out of our work area,  Most of the people were good at their jobs and the management would work with you if you had a real problem.  I learned primarily how to work on appliance's  and how to deal with rude customers.  The most enjoyable parts of the job were lunch and the end of the day.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with really rude customers and the day to day drama that was brought to work."
good,"As an accomplished, results-driven executive level project management and accounting professional with years of experience, I offer expertise in project management, project engineering and cost analysis and controls, with the ability to provide creative solutions and strategic planning for project and operational success."
good,"I learned cash handling, how to deal with different customers differently. How to make sales.  the managers are nice and easy to work with"
good,"Responsible for answering inbound calls while maintaining exceptional customer service and retaining the loyalty of our clients in a professional manner. Updated and corrected any errors in our client’s accounts. Accountable for canceling protection agreements after a diligent attempt to retain contracts."
good,Great sales atmosphere with good people to work with. Management at store level was good.
good,"Sears has great culture.  Currently in the middle of an intergraded retail transformation.  Sears is trying to create an shopping environment to serve all customers, at Store, on Line, and at Home."
good,typical day at McDonalds it being pack everyday.to use a cash register. management really treats you really bad. coworkers are okay not too bad. the drama that some of the coworkers kept up in the store. making people happy
good,Many 10+ hour days in a Salaried position. My Peers were all great people to work with. My Direct supervisor was very engaged in the day to day activities. The most enjoyable part was working with the technicians. A good group that really cares about the customers. The hardest part was dealing with outdated equipment and vehicles that were constantly breaking down.
good,"I have to be honest this job was an unpleasant learning experience, very disorganized in every way. the only thing I enjoyed was the customers/employees, In my part I always kept my area clean and organized and was always helpful to customers. I did express my views/ ideas on how to make the company more pleasant to work for."
good,Working for Sears was an exciting experience. My managers were very friendly and so were the other staff memebers.
good,Historic company with beautiful campus in northwest suburbs of Chicago.
good,"Typical of a company in similar situation. Work life balance is best part of company, though not all departments have the same policy."
good,Your voice and tone are everything to the customers as well as resolving all the reasons why they called.

good,For a first job it's good but then it starts getting stressful and it's not worth the pay. We are always understaffed and when we get people everyone leaves. Management is awful been through 3 store managers already and I've only been there for 6 months. It's always hot in the store and we only have a couple of registers working. Love my Co-workers  and will always help when they can. They will work with your schedule which is great. Not a place I want to stay for long.

good,"Very unstable working environment, wondering day to day if you were going to go to a store that was closed, open or bankrupt."
good,I was a seasonal cashier so everything was fast paced and trying. I learned that people can be very ignorant when it comes to retail through the holiday season. The management were not very helpful and unconnected. Co workers were all tired and overworked by the time their shift was over just like me. The hardest part was irritable customers working 7 days a week and not really able to stop long enough to take a breath. The enjoyable times were when that rare and random person that even though it is a hectic time are still nice and considerate.
good,A typical day at Sears would be pretty busy and a lot of lifting. I learned good customer service skills because along with load merchandise i also had to talk with the customer about different products.

The hardest part of the job would be the loading and unloading of merchandise.
good,I loved my position and was excited to work for the company and take on this task and contribute to the bottom line.

good,Executive Management is poor. In store associates are helpful yet not trained well enough.
good,"I would be a the register account, closing and opening, sale credit card and sign up for their points card. everyone was nice."
good,"Working at Sears is mostly your typical retail job. Slow at times, high paced at times, depends on the day. My fellow co-workers would always brighten my day no matter how bad I was feeling. The only thing that threw me off was how their vacation time worked. When I was hired they told me that after one year of employment that I would receive vacation time even only being part time. I was very excited. However I was never given the details of how that worked and found out that after one year you would accumulate vacation time at around 2 hours a month. So in order to have a week's vacation I would have to work there another year to 2 years. But work environment was average and some managers at the time really made you feel welcome at your job."
good,great work environment with great employees. The hours were always flexible and accomidating!

good,"It was a great learning experience as I am used to being in a management capacity. I learned the ""backside"" of a big box retail store. The co-workers at my store were excellent!! Although they were faced with a lackluster management team, they found joy in their work. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping around the store, both with customers and employees. Its unfortunate that the company has the financial problems they do. They have the potential to be the best retailer in the world."
good,I cant complain about the job. had the chance to learn more about the professional world

My co workers were very encouraging. The hardest part of the job was making so many calls. The most enjoyable was scheduling appointments
good,"a typical day at work would be taking pictures of multiple families. I have learned to be patient and to talk to customers. I loved working with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was trying to deal with a family that had a child that didn't want to take pictures and was upset but the parents would reschedule. I enjoyed taking pictures, meeting new people and seeing all the different personalities that came into the studio."
good,"Typical day would be answering customer calls and setting up service calls or selling major appliance parts, lawn/garden parts and tools. Upselling promotional items when possible. Addressing customer complaints and trying to resolve them."
good,"When I started to work for Sears years ago, I would have rated working there a 5, but as the years have gone by the workload has tripled, our pension has been frozen, and we haven't had raises in years. Therefore I now rate it a 3."
good,"I really working there, employees was friendly an nice, best part of my day was helping customers"
good,A typical day at work is speaking with a member who has a washer that was delivered to there home but delivery did not set up put in place and also hook up item. Member would be really upset because they may have to go into work with in the next 2 hours and needs delivery to turn around. So then it is my job to get our member taking care of by calling out to the warehouse to get team back out to our member to complete job. In order to keep our member satisfied and to avoid a return of item must offer member deal. I offered member a $50 gift card for inconvenience. member was happy to know that I was able to get our team back out also very satisfied with $50 gift card.

good,"It's a great place to meet people, however, they have poor management."
good,"I have been worked in e-Commerce at Sears over the past two years. This has given me the distinct edge of knowing how to apply, analyze, and bring internet marketing to be succeeded. In these two years of work tenure, I have assisted Merchandise team with pricing and inventory issues. I have used my analytical and logical skills and my experience in my work to come up with profitable solutions so that ensure the data are accurate and relevance with flyers and digests. Also, I provide sales report for different business teams, summarize website performance and recommend possible improvements. Besides working with great minds in my field, I have got the opportunity of learning and enhancing my skills."
good,"Went from infants clothes to Job Coordinator in a short time, loved to learn everything. But short lived my husband and I found out we were going to be parents. So i left."
good,At first this job was very pleasant to work for. So much knowledge to be had and the other individuals who worked for the company were very helpful and knowledgeable when it came to questions about the job. It is not a bad company to work for but it does need some updates for some technology they use. Handling customers and members was what I expected. They treated them fairly and with an immense amount of kindness. It was rare to see anyone dissatisfied. It is a nice place but it needs some updating.
good,"Its a good way to start your career, you may find it difficult at first but slowly you get used to it."
good,"The day starts early and ends late. More than likely, you will eat lunch at your desk.  There is a lot of work to be done so you would definitely never get bored.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with. It's hard work but the pay is very competitive."
good,"Very good job until the down turn in the economy. I learned a great deal about construction and home improvement, The hardest part of the job was the ups and down of the sales. The most enjoyable part of the job was the meeting of the customers, followup with the customers and the travel."

The most enjoyable part of the job that our team got alone well and always tried to help one another.
good,"Typical day involves running registers, helping customers, and doing projects on the floor."
good,"The day usually starts with a long commute. Just blocks from the Pier, it created a positive view all the time. The time goes by fast.

good,Sold service contracts to Sears appliance customers. Did not pay very well though.
good,"I loved my job and my customers.  It was unfortunate that Sears Holdings as a company is not doing so well financially.  There was a lot of phone work involved in my everyday job as well as computer work (email, Salesforce.com and SAP).  I worked very hard and always received great annual reviews from my Manager.  We had some competitive issues with GE direct and Whirlpool direct where we were not competitive on price.  We tried to sell value but it just didn't work on million dollar deals.  The General Contractor went with the lowest price 95% of the time.  Sears management would not budge on our margin thus causing us to lose the bulk of the business.  The hardest part of my job was dealing with the support center in Augusta, GA.  They just were not very competent at their job quite frankly.  The most enjoyable part of my job was getting out and meeting people - shaking hands and developing long term relationships."

good,On a daily basis I assisted customers with merchandise and maintained a clean sales floor. I loved the managers because they were extremely understanding. I truly enjoyed meeting new people and making friends with my co-workers. The was not hard at all and the most enjoyable part was setting ads.
good,My day here at Sears is set ads and doing plan-o-grams.  My hardest part of my job can be dealing with the customers but as long as a can leave them with a smile on their face then I feel like i have done my job.  I have worked for Sears a long time and I love what i do and working with my co workers.
good,wrking at sears is just like working at macys its just that macys have a more up and go to it

good,Answered incoming calls from customers regarding problems with their appliances.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and the supervisors were very professional and helpful. The hardest part about this job was leaving."
good,Fun to work here at sears. Good Company to work at. Very successful days and the associates are tremendous.
good,"My time spent at sears has taught me a few things. First of all; why this company has not grown very much in recent years and is always on the edge of collapse. More importantly though, it thought me to take on more responsibility as far as personal goals go. On the job you have to keep track of metrics and sales goals all the while giving good costumer service. The costumers I have run across expect the world out of you though. They want to give you an inch but expect a mile out of you; very rood as far as I'm concerned. The hardest part of the job though, is selling ""protection agreement"" along with big ticket items such as lawn mowers and such. Basically a comprehensive 3 or 5 year full warranty.  Said protection agreements are a SCAM. Not only do they scream the fact that you are buying JUNK that sears has zero confidence in lasting, but what if you never use it? You just spent $99-$600 that went straight in to the CEO's pocket. Nonetheless, the co-workers and management are some of the best I've experienced. little to no micromanaging from managers and minimal soap-opera drama between co-workers."
good,A typical day at sears included early morning ad-setting and conditioning of the store and stock replenishment. I learned very quickly that I did not want a career in the retail industry. I was not very satisfied with the overall atmosphere. The most difficult part of the job was feeling really under-valued for the amount of work that went into projects. I enjoyed helping customers find the right products.
good,"I like working here, but I am looking for something full-time. I am part-time for now."
good,Working the Pumpkin Fest at Downey's is a great first job. The pay is decent and the hours are reasonable since it only happens on the weekends. Very fun environment to work in. Great for people who love family entertainment and customer interaction.
good,"Responsible for floor maintenance ."
good,"I had a hard time working here. they promise to work with me school schedule but in the end gave me a hard time. ,y manager was never around and i had to figure a lot of things out on my own. i really didn't engage  much with co worker outside my department."
good,I worked long hours even did over night  I put my all in that job but they made it so hard to give me or anyone a raise
good,"I have worked in almost all depts , my co-workers are cool, my days are long, the managers know their depts, the hardest part of my job is the long hours sometimes, and the most enjoyable part is talking  to my co-workers"
good,"I was employed as a Sr. Manager for the Corporate Contact Centre for Sears Canada.   I loved my job, the opportunities I was provided and the skills and knowledge I was able to acquire.  Working for Sears Canada for fifteen consecutive years was comparable to a five year business degree.  The volume and complexity of the work strengthens your character and you become a more efficient individual with a greater confidence post experience based on the successes you achieved. "
good,"Working in Sears was an opportunity to demonstrate my ability as a team player. Being a member of the finance department in such a big company would lead to a fast pacing day."
good,"Great management, and great co-workers. My usual day was to help customers choose products (appliances), and close the sales/"
good,"SHC is going through restructuring right now.  "
good,"If my work schedule began before store hours, I would be in charge of ensuring all prices and sale items were labeled correctly with the proper dates. On a regular day, I would also be in charge of ensuring stock on the floor was always filled and any new shipment of stock was unloaded and properly organized in the stock room. My main priorities dealt with stock but I would regularly help customers find what they were shopping for and make sales."
good,"Repair appliance, sold contracts. travelled to all around New Jersey and Staten Island."
good,"The job is typical of any other retail/customer service setting. I learned many things just from being around some very interesting people, such as being social and being able to get along with different kinds of people. With respect to Sears, these people were at the bottom of the ""food chain"", they did a lot of the work, and they were seldom appreciated enough. The call centers and the stores were the Board of Directors' proverbial playground, where they constantly changed things to make it seem like they had the ""Company's best interest"" in mind. Some of the managers were very passionate there, and expected nothing short of perfection from everyone. However, I will say that there were many people who had no business being there, i.e. they didn't belong and weren't qualified enough for the job. Some people were very efficient, and yet some people didn't want to work but wanted to get paid handsomely. This goes for agents, as well as some of the managers. The hardest part of the job was the continuous overhaul of critical processes, some of which were critical to your line of the business. You had to be able to adjust to change at a very fast pace. This is something that I will say is extremely helpful for anyone moving forward into any other industry. The friendships I made there will last a lifetime, and I would say that would be the most fulfilling part of the job."
good,"Sears Canada is very flexible if you are a student. The pay is also good for part-time $15 and hour. Before company experience hardship there were a lot of overtime hours. Part-timers got benefits."
good,Stocking and maintaining backroom. Establishing Relationships with customers and attending to their questions or concerns.
good,An ordinary day would consist of many customers requiring help and being able to multitask between them but still providing the best customer service experience. I got along great with my co-workers by using good communication skills to be a team. The hardest part of my job was not having the trained experience and lack of coverage. I enjoyed interacting with people to provide them not only with good assistance but a lifetime relationship with my customers.
good,"Basically my job there was to unload trucks full of new inventory, and distribute new items to the sales floor, and also take orders, and load them to customers cars."
good,"I enjoyed working at sears. This was my first job as a cashier, I really enjoyed working with my group leader name ""renee estrada"" she was really nice. I got gained lot's of experince in stock, cashier, and great customer service"

I learned that customer service is the most valuable asset in retail sales. management at the store level was always available to assist if needed. the hardest part of the job was taking down and replacing pricing signs because of the amount product. the most enjoyable part was having a customer come back to you because of great customer service and follow up.
good,"On a typical day I would have to do put over a 1000 boxes in a truck. I would start off by pulling the product that on the label, than I would have to label every carton with a label while throwing the carton on the truck maintaining a fast pace. The last thing I would have to put the product back where I got it from."
good,"Day shift come to work get returns, sears.com, fill floor, had to learn to be fast at what I do. I have many friends from working 21 years with company.

Assisting customers with any issues that needed to be solved, completing transactions organizing and making sure departments were well displayed as far as the merchandise. I learned how to listen and communicate well with customers as well as abiding by Sears policy and regulations. To be honest, there wasn't anything hard about the job. the most enjoyable part of working at Sears was registering our customers for a Sears Card/Master Card."

good,Working at Sears was enjoyable. I learned a lot about team work and organization skills.
good,"A typical day at work included high volumes of customers, high intensity, and breaks that didn't seem worth while. Most co-workers were friendly, and they were the most enjoyable part of the job besides helping customers. I was not impressed  with the management, and that is partially biased because they stopped scheduling me for no reason."
good,"Consist of selling new products such as, electronics, hardware and home appliances to new customers."
good,"Sears, with its current business picture not looking that strong was an exciting place from a business stand point to work. With the future of this long with standing company looking pretty glim, you would never know it from the atmosphere or professionalism of the employees. Every day bringing a new set of challenges never slowed the team down. There is an atmosphere of ""we can do it"" resonating through out."
good,You will only be a good employer if you make 5 inquiries a day. You have to be golden or else everyone wants to make fun of you or put you down.Managers spend little time with employees.

good,Gave me lots of the basics to grow as a young manager.  Was able to grow with the company and learn several different parts of the business.
good,The team is fun and the manager is very helpful. The most I enjoy is working with my coworkers.
good,"I had the luxury of being apart of the management team, when it was going thru its peek times. Shortly after Eaton's had gone under, Sears had purchased prime Eaton's location and I was involved in building new teams, renovations projects, and Co-Managing and department's. The Overall excitement and challenges of that time period was a lot of work and a lot of fun."

I made that possible with them clicking one button in excel.  I learned how to use Macros and Access was awesome.  The hardest part of the job would have been, me not saving my work as I was building the spreadsheets and have to redo them.  The most enjoyable part of the job was learning so much in microsoft office."
good,"The last position that I had with Sears, I communicated with associates at 142 stores and I got to work closely with our suppliers.  When we would open up a new store, I would be in charge of the inventory that would go into the stores for my department.  I learned to control inventory for the stores.  The hardest part of the job was not having enough time in a day, to do every thing that needed to get down.  I was the go to person.  The part that I enjoyed was the team work, that my department use to have."
good,Work satisfaction comes form working on many diverse projects at any one time.

good,"Good company to work for, for a mechanic just starting out.."
good,I loved coming to work everyday and my co-workers made my short stay worth every hour spent there. The only issue that I had was the rate of pay.
good,Worked there for many years but pay scale was very  low. Barely above minimum wage. Left seeking other employment due to desiring more money!
good,"Sears is a company in deep trouble with losing market share and financial problems, as a result the middle management (District Managers and Regional managers) are out for themselves, trying to prove their worth or getting as much out of the company as they can before it goes under.  The hourly associates are fantastic, they must be to put up with the ever changing programs, no pay raises and to deal with the wrath of the management.  Top management has some good ideas and missions, but if you don't have the support of your people it is going nowhere, and as a result that is exactly where they are going"
good,"A typical work day is a standard day for me.  I take all good and outweigh the bad. I enjoy my job.The co-workers I work with works as a team with an “E not an “I”, such integrity."

Sometimes I have to answer the phone to transfer calls to the appropriate department or call other locations to search for additional merchandise. I answer customer's complaints and concerns regarding any issues they may have, in the most friendly enjoy and helpful way possible. I truly enjoy helping customers find what they need and if I'm unable to find the answers I'll locate a manager to help their needs. I always make sure I do help the customers in the best way I can."
good,"I enjoyed helping customers with their shopping needs and it felt like I was decorating my own home.  People were friendly and appreciative.  Although the pay increases weren't that great, I am hoping that has changed as the years have passed."
good,It was a good job for learning how to do a store reset. Otherwise it was only a seasonal job.
good,"siempre me molesto que en el comedor solo había un horno así que era mucho tiempo el que se perdía para poder calentar la comida, y algunos elementos de seguridad muy déspotas y groseros, pero lo mejor fue cuando se dieron cuenta y me reconocieron mi esfuerzo que es algo que muchas empresas no hacen."
good,"The pay was not very good, you make a small hourly wage plus commission. Ex: I would receive $0.25 per standard oil change which is not very much at all. Management was quick to yell and get angry but not quick to make changes that would benefit the company. I did have a great time working there, the customers were entertaining. Its a good place to work if you enjoy sales and have very thick skin, horrible company if you are easily offended. I left the company due to the fact that I received a job offer I couldn't refuse otherwise I would still be there."
good,"Honestly this was years ago, it was very productive.  I learned how to deal with customer service head on here.  The management team was fair.  I enjoyed my co-workers.  Working weekends missing church was the hardest part of the job.  I enjoyed interacting with customers."
good,"Making sure the store was in company standards before opening.  Setting out new merchandise, rearranging old merchandise, fitting rooms, assisting customers with purchases."
good,they did their best to make working at a call center fun bc it is a strenuous environment
good,"A typical day for me doesn't exsist. Every day is a bit different and while it can be interesting, most of the time it isn't. A day can be either so buisy that by the end I feel tired but accomplished, or it could be a very slow day where ypu'd might as well have stayed in bed. There have been times where I do not get any buisiness for over 4 hours. granted this was durring the holidays and I was there until midnight. On top of that, It's a team effort and if one person decides to be lazy it makes it very difficult for everyone else."
good,It was enjoyable work place. I would come and open the registers and close. I made sales for hardware department. I learned how to earn costumers trust be more involved. My coworkers always had fun but when it got down to work we would work hard. Hardest part was holidays having to fix and fold the clothing even after they are scattered around the store. Most enjoyable was socialism and friendliness.
good,"It was an ""okay"" work environment. The coworkers were very helpful, and the hours were not consistant."
good,"It's been a long time since I worked there, but I really enjoyed my time with the company and the people I worked with were great."
good,"Typically when I arrived at sears I would get orientated as to what has been done and what still needs to be done, from there on in the remainder of the shift would be assisting customers, answering the telephone and completing any tasks that where left for me which ranged from calling individuals to set up interviews or filling out the monthly budget sheet and keeping the work area clean. The hardest part of the job was at times finding something to keep you busy, by the end on the day the store was usually quite and a lot of the required tasks where completed through out the day. the most enjoyable part was my co-workers that they a wonderful group of people."
good,a good place to work. a good job-life balance and a good earnings potential.

good,"A typical day at work would include cashier duties, folding, organizing clothing, folding tables, doing inventory, and other side projects the manager would have us do. Management was nice. A bit laid back at times. Co-workers were very pleasant to be around. The hardest part of the job was attempting to sign every single customer up for a sears credit card and pushing them towards one even if they didn't want one. The most enjoyable part of the job were my fun co-workers."
good,"typical day at work involves taking calls from customers and setting appts, starting cases, handling irate issues etc. hardest part of the job is contact and the best part was my co workers.."

good,"a typical day consist of ringing up customers, answering the phone, cleaning, restocking and helping customers find what they wanted/needed."
good,The most difficult aspect of this position was dealing with difficult customers. The most enjoyable is meeting new people daily.
good,The work was hard labor but it was worth the time I spent at the company and im happy to have added it to my resume
good,"I started as a stock replenishment associate, and left as the Appliance Manager. Working on the floor was fun because of the co-workers, but management had its pluses. Management was a pay raise with a monthly bonus if sales were above projection, but the guys under me wouldn't not listen because they worked off commission, and only worked when there was customers around."
good,it was a good learning experience but it was also hard trying to get credit and understanding how to work everything on the cashier.
good,"variety of customer requests made the job challeging"
good,This was a place that was well organized and a friendly place to work. The managers and employees were friendly and demonstrated a high level of respect.
good,"I enjoy working for sears. It is a very fun place to work, but its really what you make it. Some managers are very knowledgeable and some are not. Good benefits but there isn't much room for advancement. The best part of working here is building unforgettable relationships with your peers and the customers."
good,Great job with great people. Nice place to start out when you're just getting into the workforce or looking for supplemental income.
good,"shoplifers,warehouse ops,great coworkers good hours to work"
good,"Sears was a great place to work..."
good,"Learned how to handle inventory, clearance markdowns, up coming sales displays and tagging."
good,"The management and store promotions, atmosphere could be better."
good,"I go out to clients' homes to provide in-home design solutions for window and floor coverings.  I never get to do the same thing twice, so lots of variety.  My local management is great...couldn't ask for better.  National management is fairly new and going through a learning curve."
good,"When I took up the job I thought I was going to be base plus commission, but instead I was straight commission and my department was rarely business so it made it extremely hard to make good money."
good,you get to see alot of different people everyday and have fun at work
good,"I am in in home service technician, repairing all major appliances."
good,"A typical day at work consist of picking up merchandise for customers, managing the stockroom and some time disposing trash and cardboard. I have learned what it takes to maintain a stockroom and how to use multiple machines such as the baler and compactor. The management and co-workers are easy and flexible to work with helping me balance school and work. the hardest part of the job is being swamped with a bunch of things to do all at once. sometimes it can be overwhelming with multiple customers needing service at once. the most enjoyable part of the job is all of the things i learn throughout the day."

good,"I didnt work here for very long, it had its ups and downs. Most of the staff was very friendly with one exception. The customers were always nice, and it was a good experience to photograph their lives. It was very slow most of the time, but I learned alot about how to position a large group of people for a photo."
good,not enough pay for a long term career great job to have. Even better job to have while in school.
good,At Sears I was not allowed to become friends with the fellow employees as I was responsible for any suspicious activity and would have to investigate them at any time.
good,"Hard work, but very rewarding."
good,"I really enjoy working for the company Sears, but I believe it is just time for a change. Sears is great to work for if you are looking for a job while you are in college. Unfortunately it is very hard to move up within the company. I have worked for the company for 8+ years and it took me 6 years to move into a management role. the management role is great but it's very taxing and I don't have a lot of time for my family. I'm working 50-65 hours a week on top of driving an hour to work one way. I would love to find a job closer to home so I can spend more time with my family."
good,The work environment was great.  Loved meeting new people.  The most enjoyable part of the job was learning all of the different personalities and getting to interact with different people everyday.
good,"It's an ok job.  Some of the co-workers were all right and management wasn't that bad.  Compensation was horrible though and the warehouse didn't have a heating or cooling system, so the work atmosphere could be miserable at times."
good,"Co-workers were great, management was kinda meh.."
good,"For my job, It did not have potential growth and management did not have a handle on the warehouse or their workers.  Right before I had started there, it was on the news for having employees stealing product.  All management kept their jobs, and I am sure it is still happening.  My skills were not adequately placed where they belong not in the back hanging hangers.  It was a troubling experience for me."
good,"Retail operations, overall average environment. The ability to multi- task is very important."
good,Not much upward mobility and lack of empowerment. But co-workers were very nice and pleasant.
good,"Days at work were very busy. I had learned to approached every situation concerning a customer with an objective mind and tried to resolve their issues upon that.Management was very supportive and understanding of my schedule regarding school. My colleagues were warm and welcoming. The most difficult part of the job was being able to spread the time given evenly to various projects and tasks given for that day, while helping customers. The most enjoyable part of the was assisting the customers and ensuring that they leave the store satisfied with their purchase, for at the end of the day it is all about customer satisfaction."
good,"worked here for extra money. it was ok, but very demanding. the customers could be very rude at times."
good,Decent Job working in warehouse. Unloaded 53ft trailers early in the morning from 6 to 230. The hours were good and you had time to be with family. This is not a company you want to make a career out of.
good,"Sears was a position during College where I was able to learn merchandising, and cashiering within a big firm."
good,ceci était un emploi étudiant. Je travaillais dans le département des dames. Ce fut que quelques mois car après j'ai commencé à travailler à l'hopital.
good,"After clocking in I'd head towards the appliance section and quickly look around the aisles. I'd look for customers and if other sales people were on the floor I would check to see if they were helping them, if not, then I'd approach."
good,"I loved working at the mall and meeting new people. I really didnt have sales experience but I was greatful for the chance to learn, so now I'm pretty content on my sales skills."
good,They are not organized is so many ways. Great people that get pushed to the point of hating the job. They are looking at the wrong goals.
good,Responsible for supervision of all truck drivers. Ensured delivery manifests were accurate. Ordered all supplies needed. Trained all new employees.
good,"Typical big company with too many leaders(bosses) Each giving different orders on how or were to do the same job.Good co-workers"
good,"This is a job. While it helped me in certain areas and was a good place to work, there were certain aspects of management that became stressful. The focus became more on numbers rather than helping the customer with what the actually needed or wanted."
good,Sears was a good early job for me as a college student working part time for minimum wage and some commission.
good,"Lot of physical labor, in my department. worked around school"
good,My typical day in Sears is great I love helping my customers I love going above and beyond to make sure the customer leaves happy. When I'm working with my coworkers I like showing them what I've learned in the 15 years of my life in retail.
good,"Driving to customers' homes to repair kitchen and laundry appliances under a time crunch.  Sometimes the routes given by dispatch were not conscious of addresses close to each other.  I'd have a call in Denver, then Boulder, then back to Denver.  That was the hardest part of the job."
good,A challenging  environment where things are constantly changing.  The company has invested a lot of money in new technologies.  Good customer relations are required as most sales are repeat businesses.
good,"This place has taught me so much on working with the public, sales, work ethics, management. I feel this place you can learn a lot from. You have opportunities to work in many different areas to build more growth and gain more knowledge in the work place."
good,"acquired hands on skills"
good,Basic retail work. Not much to say about it. Cashiers are required to make sales quotas for the SEARS card. (credit card) or be at risk for termination.
good,"Sears was a learning process for me"
good,"very competing environment and heavy workload."
good,Not really a job that I looked forward to going to everyday. My co-workers were nice. I learned from this job that all garbage rolls downhill and when you're at the bottom you get the most garbage.
good,"Great people. Liked working in the tool department."
good,"I learned alot, days were hectic sometimes. Management was good for the most part but let too much drama happen in the workplace. Co-workers and i got along great."
good,"Enjoyed working in a commission only environment.  If you learn your products and take the time to relate with your customers uncovering needs and highlighting benefits, you will do well. The commissioned based positions allow a ""go getter"" to earn significantly higher than minimum wage earnings."
good,"Was on the sales floor for two years and then went to the back into the stock room. Worked with a great set of people, we were like family."
good,typical day come in and trouble shoot appliances by dictating the customer on how to do it
good,"i was a sales rep at the Sears Outlet Store , i helped with customer service and providing assistance when needed with management. i was the sales key rep and advanced fast in the sales department. i liked the fact that i helped people make decisions on appliances which would be with them for years to come and the hardest part of my job was actually learning the different kinds of appliances that came in every week."
good,A day at Sears was busy providing customer service to the best of our quality. Technical support over the telephone very exciting.
good,"prepared store before official opening "
good,As a student they were not flexible with my schedule. They wanted you to choose work over school.
good,"-Managed Perfume Dept."
good,"Very fast pace, learned about new ways to gain efficiencies. Co-workers were supportive."
good,"Cashiered, i wasn't the best job but it was an OK experience."
good,"Overall this company is very organized and well put together. Most of there employees are very pleasant and wonderful to chat with. I learned a lot about in store marketing. My favorite part of work was at night with the girls, getting everything done early and being able to just chat or do inventory. But when i was working there the store manager was not pleasant at all and no one liked her. She had different ideas and beliefs and didn't want any-ones opinion on anything."
good,Good pay but hard work dealing with the business culture. Lots of work but the pay you make. Tons of rooms for advancement given the internal talent gateway.
good,unloading trucks ordering product nothing hard about the job all employees good workers working with people who new what to do and just got the job done
good,"Sears offered me plenty of hours which was what I was looking for. I didn't have a challenging time getting through the day and I consider myself to have had enjoyable time with the co-workers as well as a management team that I learned a lot from. The most enjoyable part of the year was the holiday season and Gala events when employees are granted free lunches, days when we can share cultural foods, as well as receive presents from the company as a gesture of gratitude for our work."
good,"I worked at Sears for a brief period and did not enjoy my time there.  I felt bullied by other associates often and Management seemed to be upset about you asking them for assistance.  I will not say that is true of every manager but the majority seemed to be that way."
good,"Performed check out duties which included: ringing transaction, informing customers of special promotions and taking different forms of payment for services."
good,"a typical day consisted of packing/sorting orders for catalog customers. This was where I learned to become a fast and efficient worker."

good,mi dia en el trabajoo es con mucha dedicacion aprendi la responsabilidad en cuanto a la gerencia era muy exigente yo no relaciono amistad con trabajo mi parte mas dificil hacer tramites para tarjetas de credito y lo que mas me gusto en verdad fue todo.
good,"Take inbound calls for orders, cancellations and complaints/solve customer issues. although not always easy I have learned to understand that most upset customers are not upset with me, they are upset with the situation/product etc. My manager is awesome. He encourages us to be the best we can be and though we discuss problem areas and how to improve he always points out the progress and the good areas of work we do. He isn't fast to write us up but does a written warning which doesn't count against us like a write up. He gives us a chance to improve on what the problem is before writing us up. Most of the co workers are hard workers and aren't afraid to help each other or ask others for help. We work as a team. We congratulate each other on jobs well done and help each other with our weaknesses. The hardest part of the job is trying not to solve all issues. I'm a person that wants to help a customer with their concerns. To do this I would put them on hold while I get in touch with other departments. This makes my hold time more than we are aloud in the metrics. The other hard part is to meet the metrics of selling extended warranties and installations. Customers don't always want this added to their purchase no matter how I try to explain the benefits. I'd say meeting these metrics are the hardest parts of my job. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I can calm an irate customer down and they want to give me praise for what I have done or tried to do for them."
good,Sears was just a seasonal job and I needed the extra pay. I knew I wasn't going to be there long
good,I remember feeling like I was not getting paid enough for all the hard labor that I was enduring. There was also a lack of communication amoungst management which caused a lot of conflict.
good,Work with customers that need repairs done or parts for household and lawn and garden appliances and tools.
good,"The job was fun, the management not so fun. And the pay wasn't all that great either."
good,Typical day was salesmen not receiving full commission and I need to go into the system and make the adjustment so they  would receive it next pay period or issued debit card.

good,"At the smaller stores you work alone usually 10am-7pm. You need to shut the store down to take a lunch, go to the bathroom etc. The hardest part of the job is not having help when you have 4 people waiting for you to help them, the phones ringing, and you really need to use the bathroom. The enjoyable part is sometimes it can be much slower paced allowing you to spend more time with each customer meeting their needs."

good,"At sears I was only responsible for working the cash register. I would assist customers with their purchases, pay their credit cards payments. At the end of the day I would gather the trash from the kiosk and if needed I would help others with putting away clothes. Management wasn't the greatest and weren't willing to help right away. Most of the coworkers weren't willing to help when I needed assistance, some of the coworkers were nice and helpful."
good,Typically it is a enjoyable work experience mainly with the customers and job responsibilities.
good,"I appreciated the opportunity they gave me, but half the time at work i would be standing there with nothing to do, they expected me to sale credit cards and ensurance and the more you sale basically the more hours you get."

good,"I managed the jewelry department, I controlled anything that my manager did not have access to. I learned very much about leadership as I do in all my leadership positions. Upper Management were constantly helpful and inspiring, included HR but excluding my departments upper management. I had to learn everything on my own as a new advisor to the department, I learned the basics from a former employee of jewelry. The hardest part of my job was to learn my daily duties from A-Z with no help from upper management. As described in my work experience I had several duties day in and out. The most enjoyable thing about working with this company was my customers. With repairs and weddings year round also birthdays I spent a great amount of time customizing my customers jewelry to their needs and expectations as they would be sent off and out of my hands for customizing and repairs."
good,"If you understand retail and the odd hours, then it is a good company to work for."
good,Worked at a retail store 5 years and the culture changed approximately once/year.
good,"Vary fast working, A lot of customers at one time. Helping customers sometime could be a challenge but you grow to learn that everyone is different."

good,The customer service part was o.k. but kind of boring. Lots of customers were upset because i was in the repair dept. Wasn't much for us to do except for stock shelves. Not my kind of thing.
good,"Going through restructuring, large company, retail, friendly coworkers, traditional structure, a lot of turnover and lay offs, learning possibilities, little possibility for career development, average benefits,"
good,Helping customers from a toaster to a television to a comforter. I learned pretty much the retail basics how to handle and treat a customer with respect and patience. Management was great until an audible was called and new rules were implemented. I'm all for change so I adjusted. Coworkers was very friendly. Hardest part of the job was changing signs to the appropriate price and date. Most enjoyable part was working in mid shift with a lot of customers helping out.
good,"In a typical day at Sears I will assist members with there needs and perform task needed in the back room such as cleaning, managing what we receive and sell. We are the only department that assist members, receive and put out merchandise .I learned through various situations that each person I need of help qualifies th for all your attention because they all have different needs. Management is ok, they are all responsive to the coworkers. The coworkers are very friendly and respectful. The hardest part of my job is handling all the behind the scene task and assisting members while being short staffed. The most joyful part of my job is helping the member and being thanked for it."
good,really enjoy the responsibility of being head of shop.training center was most enjoyable.i really learned a lot.

good,Take pictures and deal with customers. Sell packages to customers and help accomplish what they are here for. The manager was not very responsible and relied too much on others rather than being a leader.
good,"Sears has great job security, but difficult to make plans for your personal life because routing and management always change your route at the last minute which gets very frustrating. I have learned a  lot by paying attention, listening, reading, and asking questions. Some of the management lacks communication skills and a lot of times makes empty promises that they cannot fulfill. My co-workers are great. They are always willing to help each other out. The hardest part of the job is all of the driving and when a part is needed, but is unavailable. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is being able to work with my hands and fix things."
good,Hard working and dedicated store management tries hard to set and maintain standards which company demands despite systems which badly need upgrading and understaffing.

Ive learned how to handle customer concerns and issues in a professional manner.Management is supportive of employee decisions.

good,Enjoyed my work. Management is so so..reviews are worthless. no raises.
good,Sears is and has been a wonderful place to work.  They have developed many skills in me in which I know I will be able to use for the rest of my life.

Repair work.  I learned how to deal with customer needs in a professional manner, learn product knowledge, and how to sale product effectivly.  Managment was proficent, co workers were easy to work with, hardest part of the job was lack of help during delieveries and hourly wages.  Most enjoyable part of the job was getting customers what they need in  a timely manner with no issues. Which would give us great feedback for the store."
good,"Its a very hectic job, the managers are alright, but your co-workers are the best people ever, the hardest part of the job is opening credit and the most enjoyable time is your down time"

good,"This company is cool. Great products, fast paced. The employees are super friendly."
good,"The workplace was simple and manageable, but the sales floor was continuously crowded due to the amount of space available. Customer flow was at times very heavy and chaotic. If offered more space to manage the studio productivity,  customer satisfaction would have improved greatly."
good,Merchandise wasn't kind of hard at Sears cause they some times got over stock on clothing products that wouldn't fit on sales floor so u had to try to make room or try to make room in the backroom. The Manager and workers for cool people to work with 
good,"A good place to work for the up-and-coming salesperson. Commission is the best way to increase your pay. Hourly wages will remain at minimum wage. Credit applications, handling returns, handling payments, customer service, and counting drawers are all part of the daily job duties. The hardest thing about Sears is continuously processing credit applications each day and finding new ways to persuade customers to sign up. Advancement, however, seems to be a rare opportunity within the company."
good,"I started as a regular cashier personnel that did cash/credit transactions. I was moved to the head cashier that consisted of giving out loans to other registers when needed and I collected all the money from the registers at closing time. "
good,"Pretty Steady, Mangagers treated me well, hardest part was that it was repetitave"
good,Sears was a great place to work when I first started there.  They advanced from with in.  Then they changed management and it became a very bad place to work

good,Refilled racks with products. Changed sale signs. Assisted customers.
good,"Product knowledge, including maintaining accurate count of inventory. Consulting with customers on appliances. Assisting cashiers in other departments as needed."
good,"Doing my best at work often rewarded me with little to no satisfaction. My ideas were set aside by management for slower, and more confusing plans. The management would always give the customer what they wanted if they pushed enough. If you want free stuff, shop at Sears. "

good,"Morning meetings, go over metrics, assign tasks to be completed"

good,It was a grea job to start my working career but not something anyone my age wants to do for the rest of their lives. 
good,"Typical day: Start at 8:45 and I finish at 3.  I would work on the register, answer phones, help customers with their questions, price and size clothes, make sure the store looks clean, and stock items.  What I learned was that I need to find a better job that allows me to expand my knowledge on medicine since that is what I am studying.  The management is good.  I didn't get along much with my co-workers but when I was at work, everything was professional.  There were a lot of cliques.  The hardest part of the job was cleaning up after kids at night and the fact that we do way too much to just get $8.25 an hour.  The most enjoyable part of the job was forming friendships with a couple people and learning how to communicate with people."
good,"The company provides me many opportunity to learn different skill"
good,   I help people select fashions and feel good about their purchases.
good,I met a lot of great people and I learned a lot.  It's a shame the store is gone because the area declined so much.
good,i work for that company for about a year and i really enjoyed the people that i worked for and that was around me
good,"I worked for the company overseeing employees as a manager,taking photos, and selling to clients. I also had to order equipment and supplies. But the only thing that stunk about the company is that they were in the hole, and never gave anybody an indication that we were eventually going out of business, since that time it has been difficult finding a job."
good,"Management was very good. Time management is the most important thing I learned. How to be productive and complete our given task in given time period was an awesome part of the work."
good,This was just a job to me. There did not seem to be a lot of room for advancement at that time.
good,The environment was always good but people couldn't enjoy some of the things that were there.  
good,"A very busy working environment, earned alot of knowledge, friendly co-workers, working during the holiday seasons, working as a team"
good,"Greeted students and filled important information daily"
good,I enjoy working with customers and providing quality service.  The job requires standing all day.
good,The store is closed now but I liked it. Management was good except for one bad apple out the bunch.
good,"What I learned is Sears, Roebuck has been in the repair business over 100 years. The work of the NPSC was kind of like working at the post office you could never be finished. You always ran out of time before you ran out of work. The management of the NPSC did not do a good job of preparing us to work in the larger Sears context. The hardest part of the job was the lack of resources provided by management. The most enjoyable part of our work was a completed repair, on time on budget."
good,I love my job simply because I enjoy each and every one of my customers. Their future plans as far a their vacations or a more complex incounter of a horrific event in the past. The best part of my job at this very moment is my cusotmers and the connection I'm able to build with each and everyone of them.
good,Typical retail job. Selling with salary based on revenue. Not much opportunity to advance.
good,Inspect clothing for any damaged merchandise to be removed.  Use PKMS to enter results of inspection. I learned more about how the retail industry and warehouse environment operates. It was a fun department and management was good.
good,"Sears is a very interesting place to work. The atmosphere is exciting, the people are respectful, and the job itself can be fun and informative at the same time. "
good,I went and retrieved merchandise for the customer. Had to have it out within 5 minutes. Sold merchandise and upsold
good,"Fast paced, opportunity to learn about retail, goal oriented business."
good,"I think it is a good place to work.  But the boss I had for most of my years was EXCELLENT, and that makes a big difference. I felt that the group that worked there at the time was a good ""fix."" In the office you had to work well with everyone and it was easy to do."
good,"Management did not take care of issues with respect towards individual workers and their rights as employees, nor were they handled in appropriate manners.  Benefits with respect to employee discounts and sales were amazing, but the overall atmosphere was one of no job security or team satisfaction."
good,You unload trucks about twice a week; unless your working holidays and during the holiday season it is pretty slow and boring.  Sometimes you get 40 hours a week but most times you do not.
good,"Each day at work is a different experience because each customer takes you on a different adventure. Learned a lot about people and myself as a result."
good,"Typical day included a lot of interaction with customers, making sure their needs were met. Great amount of knowledge about the different products and store policies. The management always made sure that we were one of the top stores by doing constant evaluations of each team member. The hardest part of my job was the physical demand of always being on my feet. The most enjoyable part was being part of young team during the time that I worked there that made the environment much more entertaining and fun. "
good,Days were spent trolling for shoplifters. You learn many different reasons why people shoplift and sympathy cannot play a part with apprehension. Most co-workers were content with job. The hardest part of the job was not being sympathetic with children shoplifting while the most enjoyable part was hoping you made a difference in their future. 
good,Provide courteous customer services first and above all else.  Pick up money from vault. Set up cash drawers. Check-out customers. Keep cash wrap tidy and neat. Promote credit cards and Shop Your Way Rewards points.Help customers place orders on-line if we did not have a product they wanted in the store. Work as a team with the other cashiers and managers.
good,"I did enjoy working at Sears because I love interacting with customers face to face, but when I started to realize that the amount of credit cards you sell, determines how many hours you work (and the more credits the more hours) I didn't think that was fair. Why should the employees be punished for not giving customers another bill to pay."
good,I enjoyed working here. I wish that they paid more and offered benefits. I would have stayed longer
good,"Opportunity to build Sales experience and learn good ""Department Store"" style merchandising and presentation standards"
good,Fast paced working environment with constant challenges which offered rewards
good,"This was the first job that I had gotten when I went off to college. It was a good workplace, but not a permanent position for me. "
good,Really easy work co-workers were friendly and fun to work with. management just didn't have their act together.
good,"Greet customers, unload and load trucks at arrival. Enjoy the fast pace environment"
good,"Answer incoming calls to address customer inquiries about orders for home deliveries"
good,Mainly just cleaning up clothes and ringing transactions up for customer.  Not difficult. 
good,At Sears it was all about hard work. Being in a commission based atmosphere it was almost dog eat dog and that at times was tough. For a year and a half I was always at the top of sales in my department and I was able to keep up by learning about all the new items we had in stock.
good,a typical day at work involves reorganizing a section and fulling it up as well as cleaning up after customers and helping the customers with their shopping needs. the hardest part of the job is weekends and major holidays away from family. the most enjoyable part is helping out the customers. 
good,Sears is a large company with opportunity for growth.  Dad to day is different.  Too much time spent trying to get associates to work and not enough time for necessary tasks.
good,Its a typical work environment. It helps you to pay your bills.
good,Start off the work day by opening the register and getting ready for customer to come and help them with any help with any electronics devices at sears electronics 
good, if you are looking for a job and need a job Sears is a place to start out with 
good,I worked for sears for about a year when they closed our store and just laid us off
good,"Solid place to work.  Compensation fine, benefits are poor."
good,not very much training involved. very scatter brained. thy also hire just about anyone that applies.
good,"I had started working a week before a new manager arrived, which caused wide-scale confusion among many employees, even supervisors. I was also never fully trained in the two weeks I worked there, nor was there an effort to train me at all aside from testing on a computer. Hours were poor for everyone, including my co-workers who worked there for over 2-5 years. After the manager arrived I also went from 20 to 3 hours a week, causing me to leave for better work."
good,"A typical day would be busy as usual. Everyone has a responsibility. I have learned organization skills, customer service,and how to quickly find solutions to problems. My co workers are friendly. The hardest part of my job would be not having enough staff scheduled to help out when we have a line at registers. The most enjoyable experience would be making the customer happy."
good,This was a bridge position while I waited to get back into the claims field. 
good,"Not the greatest place to work, but pays the bills. Loss Prevention here is not worth the pay."
good,"very part time job,they hire too many people that way you are sure to not get any hours,not to friendly high employee turn over rate"
good,Fast paced work environment while learning how to take pictures.
good,A typical day at work includes assisting customers all throughout the day about our maintenance services and prices on tires and other products. I learn about different car parts and their purposes for cars and trucks to run smoothly and efficiently. Management is informative and responsible for scheduling and daily operations. My co-workers and I get along and on average there are at least two CSA's working up front. Learning about cars and helping customers achieve satisfaction from our services is the most enjoyable part of my job.
good,"A typical day at work is usually dealing with customer probloms, or just selling and loading and unloading merchandise. Also dealing with any problems Associates have. Co-workers are very friendly and in house management is perfect."
good,"I unloaded trucks,prepared and logged shipping and receiving documents,made weekly schedule.Store management was good.My team was dependable.The hardest,most strenuous part of my job was handling car batteries.The best part was acknowledgement from team and management."
good,"Loading and unloading packages, loading the truck, using a forklift. Always bend and stretch before lifting. Management was sub par. My co-workers were great people. The hardest part of my job was the heavy lifting, the most enjoyable part of my job was working with some of the nicest people."
good,This was my first telemarketing job that helped fund my way through college.
good,help customer check out.
good,acomodar komo vender
good,"Working at Sears was a fun job - employees could take on a variety of tasks and one day was never the same as the next. Unfortunately, they only paid minimum wage, and were careful not to let anyone reach 40 hours a week so that they wouldn't have to pay them benefits."
good,"A typical day work was attending customers and ensuring they get what they want and need for the best price, others needed a review for product they desire to purchase. I was a sales-man for lawn and garden and it was my job to ensure I knew my products well to be able to explain customers what they are buying, and what exactly what they need. I learned plenty of useful sale techniques, tools and what they are used for, and lawn and garden equipment. Management was okay but rarely present and always frustrated and angry, very sarcastic. Co-workers were lazy with the exception of a few. The hardest part of the job was retrieving heavy products to load up. Most enjoyable parts were getting off and socializing with co-workers."
good,Great place to interact with customers one on one. I have learned a great deal about appliances and tools of every shape and size.
good,"I enjoy helping people and helping solve their problems, I do this on a daily basis. I have learned many skills such as sales, retention, customer service among other things. I have awesome co workers, we are a team. Hardest part of the job is dealing with an irate customer and the most enjoyable is working with an awesome team of supervisors and managers who are always motivating and empowering."
good,Call center environment is not for me!Enjoyed the learning experience but the pressure to enhance call volume was not for me
good,"working at Sears was great because they dont check your breaks but on the other hand, they have unsocialble and rude managers which dont motivate me to work when ""pat"" is coming, a district manager im assuming."
good,"Learned the in's and outs of retail, and that it isnt how you sell about who you work around to help you in the environment"
good,"Friendly enviroment, and positive hard working coworkers. Listening to music softly in the backround, was a wonderful addition to the job. Many opportunities for advancement."
good,• Process merchandise returns and exchanges
good,A Typical day at work is working hard with your co workers at a time limit. I have learned to be a hard working individual.
good,I was part of a strong team and enjoyed my profession very much. Interaction with the clients in a professional manner was very rewarding.
good,There was never the same day twice. It was always fast pace and challenging developing new ideals for our customers.
good,"a very busy place to work, team work, all company people and understand your plyte. great family people.nothing really hard about the job. working with cool people"
good,It was a good experience. just had to unload and load the truck . My managers was typical managers. I got along with all my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was lifting things over 300lb. Going home was the most enjoyable part
good,"Was required to work 11am-8pm Mon-Fri for 7 weeks without a single tardy or absence. Could not attend any doctors appointments during that time due to the schedule. A Co-worker was told that if she missed half a day of work for her Grandfather's funeral, her job would be in jeopardy."
good,Easy work place with good coworkers. Dealing with customers is always a challenge but I think I did it with courteousness and helpfulness. Hardest part of job was often inactivity and I like to stay busy. Best part of job was people integration.
good,"I enjoy my work days and my co workers. I treat my employees as if they are my own children, and am there to teach them everything I know in customer service, and meeting metric goals. I have learned patience and I have given some great kids their first jobs and watched them succeed!"
good,"pay is horrible, unorganized, needs help within management."
good,to pick orders for customers out of storage area for customers mostly you worked alone .
good,"They are able to work around school and other jobs you may have but there is too much focus on everything BUT the products. Credit, protection agreements, rewards cards, etc. are more important."
good,"it was a hard job because you would be lifting all day, load and unloading trucks"
good,"I've learned many things while working at Sears. Mainly about team work, and ethics."
good,Co-workers are very independant and not a very team-oriented
good,Its a decent job. decent management. everything is average besides the pay which was below min. wage most the time. the managemant will tell you a different story when hiring though. some dept obviously make more than others but my dept rarely met its sales goals in the short time i worked there and on top of the low amount of customers they want you to meet many different points in a number of different areas. its close to impossible with the customer flow to consistently meet numbers they want. Overall this job was not good. Sears will likely go under in the next 5 years. they lose many customers a day. the co workers are a mix of college kids and people that have been working for sears for dozens of years. all of whom are good people.
good,sears is a fun place to work easy to get along with associates
good,"Lots of great people to work with and for. Never a lack of work to be done. Can be stressful at times, a lot of work given with very little hours to compensate. Sometimes unfair, when work gets done fast the hours are cut but when the work isn't done there are suddenly hours to do it. Seems to reward poor employees over great ones. Hardest part of the job is lack of recognition. Most enjoyable part of the job is the friendliness of co-workers."
good,"The work wasn't very difficult, but that made the days drag. I would check in, report to my manager and open a cash register wherever I was needed. Due to the fact that few to no people regularly shopped at Sears at the time, we spent hours standing at the head of our registers, smiling at customers and offering our services. The few customers that did frequent our store, we would offer the opportunity to apply for a Sears card. Filling out an application and turning it in meant you were a valuable asset to the company."
good,"Generally the work at Sears is a fast-paced environment. There's always a task to be done whether it's working freight to the salesfloor or dusting shelves. There's opportunities for learning everyday as you explore the different departments of our store. Overall the management is friendly and hands-on.Working at Sears you have to be a team player, together we can succeed, but if one of us fails, we all fail. The most difficult part of the job would be the physical demands. As MCAs, we are required to do alot of heavy lifting and moving of fixtures and racks of clothing. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the satisfaction on your customers face when you've just helped them find that rare item or that perfect gift for their special someone."
good,Sold major home purchases from Tractors to televisions.

good,"When i worked at Sears i was a merchandise customer assistant. I helped people find exactly what they where looking for. I also restocked clothes and made sure that the sure looked presentable.

good,Everyday is different. Learned about how department store works. Management was inconsistent. Co-workers are just the best. Friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job: Inconsistency and unsureness. The most enjoyable is seeing how customers appreciates your work and working with amazing group of people.
good,"Working at Sears is not as good of anexperience as I expected. The management frequently does not listen to employees about issues in the store. My immediate supervisor in Jewelry is amazing though. She is an older woman who has taught me many things that I did not know. That is the most enjoyable part of the job. I have also made some good friends there.The hardest part of the job is dealing with retail ""drama"". There are always alot of gossips and such to learn to ignore."

good,typical day would mostly be work and more work learn nothing management is pretty chill co workers are cool and chill nothing really to hard bout the job enjoy the flexibility
good,"A typical day at work is very tiring and long. Ive learned how to handle customers face to face, how to do layaways and how to approach customers when it comes to promoting items. The Management and the co-workers were fair and somewhat easy to get along with. You had some that were all about self and not really interested in getting along with people. The hardest part was trying to sale credit. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people."
good,it's a great place to work but the fact of the matter is that you cant really move up like you want to and get hours like you want to i have been there for 5 years come Feb. and yet still no change

good,It was a lot of work for not good pay. Management was nice and the people who worked there were all good friends.
good,I liked the fact that there was so much human interaction within my job. I loved helping people find what they needed.

good,Enjoy the people I work with and I make good money during peak sales months.
good,"A day as a Sears employee is fun but very busy day it will be. As it was my first job I learned a lot. I learned how to work a cash register. I worked in the kids department so I was incharge of keeping the department clean and safe for all costumers to shop in as well for children to be in. My co-workers were really great people, very nice and respectful. I worked very well with them and never had a problem. Getting along with co-workers helped me get through my tough days and they made our days fun. The hardest part was when I met my first rude customer at the register. I remained calm and did what I could to satisfy her visit at our store. The most enjoyable part is when I manage to put a smile on the costumers faces and knowing that I was a great help to their shopping experience at Sears."
good,Sometimes poor communication between management and employees can make job rough at times.

good,You must stay focused on your job and not get easily distracted. Must be self motivated.
good,"Standing in back of a register waiting for a customer to come for assistance. I also opened credit cards for customers. I learned how to help customers of any age, and give them what they need. My co-workers were not that bad. I have a lot of energy and always like to be happy, but many co-workers were always sad and not in the best mood. The hardest part of this job was persuading customers to open up a Sears credit card. The most enjoyable part of the job was opening the first card of the day when going in for my shift."
good,"very laid back work enviorment, customers was very friendly"
good,"I had a great learning experience working for Sears, I learned how to sell and stock products. Sears managers and employees were very helpful and fun to be around."

good,A typical day at work here is very interactive and fast-pace.
good,I learned alot of customer service skills. A typical work day consisted of learning more people skills and trying to sell the company card.
good,It is very physical work but also an easy job to learn. The general manager is easy to work for. He pitches in when he is needed. My co workers are nice. The hardest part is you work long hours. The most enjoyable part is the customers
good,The environment is very exciting to work which allows you to provide excellent customer service to every customer. Working with more then twenty associates allowes me the opportunity to build a team that proivides awesome customer service each and every day.
good,A typical day is primarily helping customers with anything from a basic sale to setting up service and helping with any other issue they may have. The managers I have had have been great and taught me a lot about customer service. My co-workers have all been enjoyable to work around. The know how to have fun but still get things done.
good,"Great place to learn how to work on cars, light trucks. I became ASE certified in front-end suspension, doing front end alignments, brakes, suspension work, and alot of tires."
good,"A productive work environment, came into the position as a novice and obtained a vast amount of knowledge and experience."
good,"about customer service, different customers and retail presentation"
good,company was a great first start and provided the pooprtunity to advance i loved helping and becoming a team lead with such a great organization until they decided to shut down and outsource the center
good,"Sears is an OK place to work. It is retail and that is something I am not interested in doing for the rest of my life. I enjoy working with all of my co-workers and managers. Sears does not award raises, I make 7.65 per hour which is not much money to survive on. This isthe big reason that I don't want to work there any longer."
good,"A typical day at work would be customer service related. Attending to the customers needs, answering phones, placing orders as well as stock."
good,Not the best management training program. A hard company to learn.
good,"Typically, at work, I would clock in and begin working right away. Coming in so early wasn't so pleasant but I got it done. I learned the importance of product placement and organization. My manager was very kind and she showed me how to do each and every job i was required to do. My co-workers were all lively and fun to be around. I believe they were the most enjoyable part of coming in to my job. The least enjoyable part was taking heavy merchandise off of the wall and replacing back on the wall according to the plan-o-gram."
good,"Sears was once what Wal-Mart is today, America's #1 retailer. Sears became management top-heavy and was forced to attempt to remain relevant to a new set of consumers who resisted the store which the previous generation was content to hold as enough."
good,"Typical day is coming in a counting up your cash drawer for you department that day. The rest of the day is cleaning, stocking and customer service. Running the checkout as well as helping people find what they are looking for. Management is slim, only a couple on duty per day which causes lines on a busy day since you have little aurhority on pricing and other problems. Co-workers changed very frequently, so if you didn't like someone, all you had to do was wait a little bit.Also, you didn't work around many employees, as there was mostly one or two per department on any given day. The hardest part of the job would be the pressure of having to get credit card applications, and frequently changing departments making it hard to master any one department. The most enjoyable was almost the same, in that you got a variety by working different departments frequently."
good,Typically primary job is look for dishonest customers either via Closed Circuit Television or through Direct Observation. Managed time planning.
good,"I worked on cars changing the tires, did inspections to make sure they were running good. The management was good, the hardest part of the job was finishing all the jobs on the board because there was so many, but we got them done."
good,Each and every employees help each other to provide customer service by delivering appliances to customers house.
good,"I enjoyed my co-workers but the management proved to show they are only covering their butts. Attitude, cockiness, just an over all of uncomfortable annoying presence from them. The job is easy as well as the money is good pay, but because of the lack of CORRECT management, and the company slowly dying, it's really not worth applying for. Especially since they JUST laid about 6-7 people off back in May."
good,"I once were a cashier at SEARS for about 2mths. A typical day at SEARS is to open the cash register to ensure that the amount of money were correct, and that there were no shortages, and to also, maintain a clean work area by placing the unwanted merchandise in there correct places. Working at SEARS I learned alot of things like how to fold clothing correctly and how to work the cash register, and also I learned how to make payments payable. At SEARS thier management team couldve been better. Everytime there were a customer in front of me needding to speak with a manager I would have to page them about 2 or 3 different times before they actually showed. My co-workers at SEARS were really nice and friendly but,"
good,Learned how to associate with several people in a positive and friendly way.
good,Learned new things about A/C installations. Assisted the installers in the warehouse in locating material for the job.

good,"I was in overnight stock and I enjoyed talk with the patrons about cooking ideas, and helping them find and item."
good,Very busy location. Learned computer system for cashiers. Management was always available and accomodating within reason. Co-workers were helpful. Hardest part of the job was trying to keep customers satisfied while having to wait in long lines during high volume shopping times. Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people everyday and being recognized for doing a good job.
good,The people around you will help you a lot and the customers will also allow you to prove yourself on how to deal with difficult situation especially in doing returns but at the end all things will become good.
good,Assisting customers with incorrect orders that were shipped. Corrected parts orders and reshipped correct parts. Micromanaged by management and corporate office to the point customers did not receive best of customer service in my opinion. I really enjoyed my coworkers. The hardest part was the veribage that you must say on every call or it counts against you. Of course hearing the customer happy with my assistance and resolving their issue.
good,"a typical day at work, Punch in I was resposible for all customer returns throughout the whole store therefore my first task was to collect all returns from the day before, Process them through the computer, inspect every single piece to see if it was resalable at a reduce price or negotiate with the vendors for credit on the defective items. On the list of items returned there was treadmills, mowers appliances, tractors, Grills, Tools, home goods you name it everything that Sears has to offer. I loved it because it kept me busy throughout the entire day. the people were nice. the only problem is Sears economy is not doing so good for the past 10 years therefore they stopped giving yearly raises cutting down on benefits like freezing 401k to employees cutting peoples hours, eliminating positions like the on I had thats why laid off . other than that is a good enviroment."
good,The job was rewarding at first.
good,Working for a company that is always looking to cut costs is a stressful environment.
good,My experience was ok the environment was friendly for the most part
good,I write for all of Sear's brands and all merchandise. I make sure to take on the voice of the brands and make the copy consistent and compelling while meeting brand requirements.
good,Average environment- good things about the company and challenges also
good,"While at Sears, I learned how to interact with customers on a personal level without coming off as being intrusive. I would still be with the company, my but store converted into a K-Mart store."
good,"Had flexible hours and would work around family, college, and military."
good,Great workplace environment if you are looking for something part time to supplement income. People are fun to work with and management is friendly and helpful

good,The normal day would be working with internal and external customers on making the new home buying experience easier for people.
good,Nice people great job to learn sales. I learn to sale anything. The management was ok. The hardest part was getting sales stolen from co- workers. The most I enjoyed was meeting new people.
good,I enjoyed the customers they always needed assistance and I was always there to give it to them .
good,"It was fun meeting the people I worked with, loved working in the shoes department but I saw no growth nor advancement in the company. So I decided to leave after my summer contract was over"
good,"I have had the opportunity to work in many different departments there, which has allowed me to gain more knowledge of the overall DC operations. I have learned to use the WMS system for inbound, orderfilling, and outbound operations. We are a batch center, serving over 200 stores."
good,In the 20 years there I did many jobs as my resume says. Pushed so I would be the best of what ever it was.
good,"Great challenging place to work, good management. Has a couple of workers that are greedy for money and they really can care less about some customers."
good,Good job because the calls were mostly people confirming service requests. Management was very active and helpful.
good,Learned costumer service. Learned how to work hard and create a good work place.
good,"Typical day at work would include customer service, deligating tasks to other employees, merchandising and processing freight."
good,"An easy way to pay for books while in college however, there is very little room for advancing within the company."
good,Overall it was a fun place to work. The store i worked at was goin out of buisness but while i was there it was fun and a great place to work
good,before the merger it was THE BOMB!!!!....i LOVED it....but NOW...it SUCKS!!!!...
good,enjoyed photography and getting to know customers loved making my own schedule
good,"Overall I was happy with my time at Sears, it left something to be desired with the commission structure however. I earned valuable customer service and sales experience. As an Auto Department sale s associate, I was separate from the main store employees which was odd, but gave us more freedom to work together with technicians."
good,Structured atmosphere which enables to you learn how to set appointments with great detail. Training is excellent.
good,Expectations were clearly set.
good,It was different in retail but i enjoyed it. hate it went out of business.
good,"It is good enough for a first time job. It's usually minimum wage to start, and nearly impossible to advance to management."
good,•Operated cash register for tools and merchandise.
good,"A typical day for me started at 7A.M..I would come in,turn on all the lights,make sure the building was secure.I will check the system to see what sales we were up against,Check the call out line for callouts and anyone who was running late.I would start calling people to fill unfilled shifts.I will disburse the money out to the cashiers.I would see what planograms needed to be complete for that day.I would start to call back customers who had problems or didn't receive good customer service.I would track orders.Assisst customers on the sales floor.I would organize the stockroom and sales floor."
good,Of course there's gossip and rumors with any company. Learning about the secrets of Sears were ridiculous. The credit cards that they pushed us to sell didn't help the customers really. And expected to show up at meetings that aren't suposed to be mandatory to talk about different ways to get on the customers nerves and keep bugging them about credit and memberships. The only people there that truly believe that they are helping are the store/general managers. The associates know what the real truth is. Once I started talking about school they basically let me go with out warning.
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with at the store. I enjoyed meeting people.
good,"I worked in shipping for ten years then got moved to orderfilling for the last five years. I picked orders, loaded and unloaded trailers, and put merchandise away."
good,I worked for Sears Home Improvement. This organization makes split minute decisions and make drastic business changes without thinking through all processes before implementing the changes. Upper Management does not stand by mid level managers decisions.
good,"General customer service duties, obtained more hands on experience dealing with various merchandise. Management was okay. Co-workers were okay. Hardest part of the job was dealing with merchandise placed in the wrong department and cleaning out the fitting rooms."
good,it was okay. not something i would want to do full-time. they always threatened to fire you if you did not get customers to sign up for sears cards
good,"it was a call center for sears customers who called for services such as , appliances, carpet cleaning, and ordering out of the Sears catolog."
good,It was great working for Sears especially in the office setting. I got the best of both worlds. I got a chance to work with customers and the employees.
good,"A typical day at Sears is pretty much ringing up customers and making sure their satisfied. Id prefer the slow days more so than the fast paced days. I love my co workers. Management has a few things to work on but I still did my job. The most enjoyable part working at Sears is meeting nice, heart felt, sincere customers."
good,just started but the atmosphere is not friendly at times there is a lot of distractions when it comes to doing your job and it seems like everyone is unhappy or complaining however it is a job and i am grateful for it but it will eventually cause conflict in my home and i rather find something i enjoy then something i have no choice
good,I enjoyed working at Sears the employees and the atmosphere were nice.
good,"I have had the opportunity to work both in inventory and in merchandising at Sears. Having a degree in Supply Chain, working here has allowed me to utilize my skills and training from college as well as to challenge and apply myself on the job. I have managed two small teams in my four years, which is both the hardest and most enjoyable part of my job. As a manager, you are only as effective as your team's performance. Synergy and cohesiveness does not happen overnight. I have learned to coach and enhance communication skills from both observing other coworkers and mentors and from taking training courses the company offers on a regular basis."
good,"It was interesting ""war room"" situation, everyone was very nice."
good,i enjoyed working here even tho it was seasonal work. I learned how to count down a cash drawer.
good,"Fun fast place to work at, the family night extra discount awesome. Great manager and good place to climb the ladder fast."
good,Its a great place for a student to work because they work really well with your school schedule and are able to find you shifts that make the job less stressful. Because i know that working in retail can be very stressful with meeting any company's goals.
good,hard work but they do try to make it easier for you if they can would love to go back but if you worked there befor cannot work there again
good,I sold fine jewelry. I had to meet daily sales and I also had to do stock and inventory.
good,"Cuenta con un ambiente de trabajo muy agradable, la gerencia lleva muy bien el trabajo en equipo. Aprendes a trabajar bajo presión y la buena atención al cliente"
good,Working as a loss prevention person was a fun and exicting job. It was never boring. I had to always watch over the building. Management and co-works were great. The most enjoyable part of the job is busting a person of shoplifting.
good,this was a very great job to start out working. I loved working with the so many different people and things. So Many different departments.
good,"Ehh, Sears is an ok place to work in if your in need of a little extra cash, would not recommend it to someone needing a lot of money because they dont really give you that many hours to work with."
good,"like logging, running skidder, dozzer, cutting timber, good boss, older equipment, lot of break downs"
good,"Sears is great for people who are just starting out in the work force. Young people with little or no work experience. The hours are pretty flexible, and they usually give you days off when requested in a timely manner. The work isn't hard, no real critical thinking, little to no heavy lifting, and all work has instructions that guide the task. There aren't much opportunities to advance though. And you never get a raise."
good,Commission based job that also had an hourly rate. Needed extensive knowledge about the lawn and garden field to excel in this job.
good,large electrical entertainment equipment and home appliances
good,"While at Sears, I worked as a cashier in the jewelry department. I enjoyed working with the associates and helping the customers."
good,Overall nice place to work. A typical day is very hectic but challenging. The associates are great and the best part of working there is working with the associates. The worst part is prioritizing when I have passion for both Safety and Loss Prevention
good,"Sears is a good company. I have enjoyed my time with Sears. It is constantly challenging. A typical day at work is constantly changing with being over safety and LP. The associates in the DC are dedicated, tenured associates. The hardest part is prioritizing by importance because I have passion for safety and loss prevention. The most enjoyable part of my position is working with the people."
good,lots of people always and the mall.love helping people puting outfits togather
good,I enjoying learning new things and meeting people. I was a customer service manager and loved every single day of it. I am outgoing and easy to get along with. I have learned to manage a team and overcome customer escalations and keep high satisfied. My co-workers enjoyed working with me we both learned and helped each other.
good,great learning experience
good,getting help from others is a task
good,"I only worked for Sears for a very short time. I wasn't employed there long enough to get a feel for the company. I was always treated fairly. However, I was given a job that I didn't apply for. I have applied for a sales job and was given a merchandising job."
good,Maintenir le rayon propre.
good,Slow at times and the managers were not fair all the time but liked the discount and the customers.
good,"It was a nice job, but it had management problems."
good,"Sears can be a great place to work for. Its just too bad, there are people they hire that get away with anything they can. Problem is if you need to take a break, it was hard to get someone to cover you."
good,Typical day of work starts with getting familiar with the sales for the day and handling any delivery issues from the previous day. I have learned that not all people are the same and each situation and person are handled differently. The management team does the best that they can under the circumstances. My co-workers and I get along well together. We all have to stick together. The hardest part of the job is dealing with our delivery team and making sure all appliance deliveries went smoothly. The most enjoyable part of my job is dealing with the customers.
good,I thought the associates were professional and the talented people working within different departments.
good,the hardest part of this job is coping with the speed of the lines while at the same time not know what is coming down the line. you could have a 5 pound item come down one minute then the next minute have 150 pound boxes coming at you
good,"At Sears, I would assist customers in their decision to purchase lawn and garden equipment and shoes. I would also stock merchandise. I learned a lot about different types of lawn and garden equipment, as well as how to explain them to customers in a way that they can easily understand. Though competitive, I worked well with my co-workers and we worked together to make sales. The hardest part of the job was when we had angry customers. Most of the time I just had to refer them to a manager, but it was hard for me knowing that I couldn't resolve the issue and that they probably wouldn't be happy with the outcome even through talking to a manager. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I sold something because it was commission pay."
good,I was a job. I took it seriously however wanted something more so I joined the military
good,Assisted customers in the selection of paint and paint produscts.
good,I enjoyed working with customers and helping them with their needs.
good,Poor customer flow will always lead to a commission becoming a pointless venture. On top of that management would not listen to our suggestions to increase said flow. After over a year and a half the job was more of a hassle than an opportunity.
good,Great way to test the waters in the photography field and learn the basics. Can be a fun environment.
good,"Great ,fun,exciting and friendly workplace.Overall a good job for a student."
good,"Sales, photography, training, schedualing, cash control and customer service."
good,I worked here one summer and I have to say...it wasn't half bad

good,"The work is intense, and physical, unloading of the truck, loading paid merchandise into customers trucks, vans, etc., cleaning and maintaning of the stockroom"
good,not to hard. all about selling shoes. hardest part was little hours.most enjoyable was comeing to work.
good,"Repair refrigerators, water heaters, window airconditioners, central air."
good,"This job isn't for everyone. I learned a lot in this position but it wasn't the part of retail for me. A typical day is doing jewelry checks, learning about shoplifting laws and maneuvering lp devices and monitoring cc TV, filing reports, court-dates and conferring with law enforcement."
good,work conditions were ok. had all federal holidays off. more time for family
good,"My typical day at work are assist customers, check the stockroom if something needs to be done, doing freights, stocking shoes in sales floor, cashiering and before going home, I'm checking of there's expired prices that needs to be removed. I've learned how to manage my time efficiently, how to give great customer service and to finish tasks in time. My co-workers are very nice to work with because they're all hardwroking. Hardest part of job would be if we ran out of sizes and if we didn't meet the satisfaction of our customers. Most enjoyable part is time goes fast whenever we're busy and dealing with friendly customers and giving them satisfaction."
good,I liked working for the company but I submitted a two week notice and it was said that it never was filed.Alot of miscommunication at this particular store.
good,Photographer
good,"Co-workers were great. Management was okay. Hardest part was dealing with angry customers, but the most enjoyable part was helping them."
good,"Sears Holdings was an interesting place to work. It helped to develop a lot of skills that could be used anywhere. The initial environment was a family oriented place to work, a co-cohesive place to work. Management was interested in over-all well- being of employees, however things changed as Sears was bought by K-Mart. Employee turn-overs and job assignments changed, values that had been placed for nearly 100 years changed, this was the hardest part of the job. The cutting of staff and other resources was also hard. Overall Sears Holdings was a decent place to work and grow."
good,"Working at Sears, I learned a lot about mowers, weedeaters and chainsaws as well as how to put together grills and exercise equipment. I was often brought in on my days off when we had something new to put together because they knew I enjoyed doing it. Working at Sears, you had your slow days and your fast days but there was never really anything that changed unless we had an area to change around. The management team was a good team, always there when you needed them and offereing a helping hand when you needed it. The hardest part of the job was when the new product came in and you had to learn everything all over again very quickly. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing I had a very good team of people who would help me at a moment's notice if I had need of them."
good,"retail store, fast past enviornment, great experience with customers"
good,A typical day at work was filled with inbound calls which made the day go by quickly. I learned a lot about computers as well as different parts for electronics. Management was helpful because there was always a time when you may need help and they were by your side. I met some wonderful people while employed with sears. The hardest part of the job was selling additional parts to customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning so much about different products which became beneficial for me.
good,"I remember going in to Sears and seeing ""satisfaction Guaranteed or your money back"", now it just says service desk. That about sums it up."
good,I enjoyed working for Sears when I worked there. I had some problems with a managent change is the reason I am not there now.
good,Sears Holdings is good company and located in EON IT park Pune.

I learned how to approach and express myself to customers in a way that they would feel informed and confient about their visit. I did not agree with managent and their inability to comply with company standards. However, I did form great relationships amongst my co-worker."
good,if you like hard work and under compensation then this is the place for you.
good,In a struggling retail environment a lot of direction trying to find out which way to go. Work life balance is tough especially around the corporate office. Office is out of touch with what the field operations are about.
good," Responsible for day to day operations including increasing profit, commercial account growth, and controlling costs."
good,check buildings make sure in good condition. A day can consist of painting wall repair plumbing etc. Some and minor hvac checking chiller logging in everyday check cooling tower and changing filter
good,Come in and hit the phones
good,This job was a great way to make holiday money. The management was very open and understanding with seasonal workers. It was a lot of fun greeting customers and restocking.
good,Review individual customer service orders to locate opportunities to determine exact cause of service
good,It paid well for a part time job if one knew how to close the sale
good,"Since I was only seasonal, it didn't bother as bad as it would a full time employee, but the work environment was terrible. It changed day to day - which was a plus - but the management wasn't the best and it was hard to go home feeling like you had a productive day."
good,"It was an ok job but really you spend a lot of time just walking around looking for things to do. you look forward to the rush that comes in, at that point it gets really competitive to get sales because the job is really heavy for commission."
good,"work register, clean area, clean department, apply customers for credit, close and open registers"
good,The managers were very unorganized and mixed personal life with work life. Hardest part of the job is having to get your customers to sign up for credit applications if not you'll get fired.
good,"A great consistent workplace where assisting customers set up the media centers provided great pleasure. The latest telvisions, blu ray players, and surround sound systems."
good,"A typical day would consist of anywhere between 3-8 appointments. I sign the customer in, photograph 9 positions and 4 angles, then sell photo packages and products. A few days out of the week routine housekeeping would be done. When there were no appointments I would hook new customers with email sign-ups, coupons, discount packages, games, raffles, and drawings."
good,This was an alright job there was a lot of heavy lifting and the wage was not that great. Good job if your young but nothing to live off of.
good,Was an okay company to work with but pay was not so great. Average work day consisted of processing payments for customers. Co-workers were pretty well to work with/
good,"we analyze our individual business every week to see what we can do to drive sales including examining associate behaviors weekly. we also as managers observe and coach associates through out the entire store including receiving. Our goal is to provide excellent customer service daily. We also ensure associates are utilizing our digital tools to provide another source of ways to assist our customers. If we dont carry it, we will find it for our customers. We also send help tickets to our buyers to get more product in the store to help drive more sales. We also at Sears handle customer issues due to delivery/installation or just their over all experience. Its a great company to work for."
good,People are nice to work they have wonder floor support. But they need to have clock time where it is standard for everybody and not be so picky over 5 min cause everybody's watch is 5min diffrence.
good,Tv electronic... DEAD... Sales a must to keep your job. Great job just dead field
good,The company was a good place to work for. I had fun for being the first job i ever held.
good,Learned in-depth Automotive expense control measures while directly impacting customer satisfaction to maintain a high level of excellence and profitability.
good,cashiering entails quickness and good customer service skills. Get along well with co-workers and management. Always go the extra mile . Physically demanding as on feet all shift. Helping customers find what they are looking for is rewarding.
good,Interesting place to work but definitely has its unique set of challenges.
good,"I didn't mind working at Sears when I first started. It was my really my first real job. I was great with the customers and working the cash register was easy, I also loved all my coworkers. As I continued to work however I became more and more stressed out from the job. My managers were always on my back about selling credit apps to all the customers. I would get written up if I didn't see enough and it caused to me to stress about me having a job the next day. I was getting a lot of hours working at Sears but I was only making minimum wage. But it wasn't enough for me. I used to dread going to work. I would stress that I wouldn't sell credit and I would have a manager tell me I was fired. I felt like I was a great worker and that keeping my job relied on if I sold credit or not was unfair. This is why I chose to leave Sears. It was tooo stressful!"
good,"I work Monday-Friday. I come in every morning and go to every register and collect all the returns and scan them out. Once all the returns have been processed I pack and send them back to the return center. I also pull items that are defected, on recalls, and or have no value. I also help unload trucks and process incoming freight. Management is pretty deceit. But I will say our General Manager is great. The hardest part of my jobs is getting everything processed, while also working on trying to get the trucks finished. The most enjoyable part of my job would be the different activities we have as a store."
good,working as solution specialist take supver calls. had took some training

good,My typical day at Sears was stocking shelves. It was just an after high school job.
good,"Showcased items, introduced new items, and created a positive store image to increase revenue"
good,"I enjoyed the work environment ,however, I was seeking a higher hourly wage so I sought and secured a position at Jcpenney."
good,"On a day to day basis, i'll change tires, do the basic oil changes and other similar functions. The mananger was a cool relaxed young lady whowas on the work floor alot.The co-workers were very informative and of great assistance when i became a hirey which put of a great relationship between us. I wouldn't consider any about the job hard due to the skills i obtained through training. Overall everything about Sears was enjoyable."
good,Dispatch Specialist/Mentor
good,"Fun work with great people skills, learn about ship and receiving merchandise"
good,good job not enough hours worked on engines and anything sears sold
good,the most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you make a difference at the work place everyday
good,"Great management, nice co workers, i learned abut sales and improved my costumer service"
good,Loved working here and I miss my job. This was a fun place to work when I first started then new people came and changed the feel for the job.
good,"learned a lot about jewlery and retail, learned a lot about customer service and customer staification."
good,Ability to repair many different types of merchandise. Maintain
good,Enjoyable place to grow and learn different aspects of the retail business. Very complex organization. Store Manager more engaged into their business than any other retailer.
good,My typical day was always competive . I always had a daily goal or quota that I had to meet by the end of the month. In the world of collections there are good days and bad days. However overall I enjoyed the customer contact and talking with new people everyday.
good,"SHC is a nice place to work, however in recent years the quality of compensation has declined and dulled its sparkle."
good,I worked at Sears for almost four years. I never moved up to anything else and my hourly rate hardly changed. The employees were very nice and I became friends with most of them.
good,"I was able to learn how to do cash and inventory. On a normal day associates are required to help customer, maintain the store appearance and bring out new mercandise."
good,"Selling consumer electronics in a retail setting. Televisions, computers, and satellite systems"
good,"Good place to work, Sears sells great products, Management has a difficult time setting schedules for employee's."
good,"Is a fast paced environment, requiring attention to detail. People were not the greatest help when you asked for help."
good,Sears is not the best place to work in my opinion because of the fact they did not have a lot hours to disperse to associates; other than that it is an ok company to work for.
good,"Fun, great co-workers. Just not enough supervision. A lot of people spent more time on break than actually working."
good,I worked at Land's End in this store. I also was rewarded commission on what I sold plus a base pay of $7.50 per hr.
good,Upper management was a mess. Entirely new crew with no direction.
good,We all could see what we did was shirkin. Becoming out of date. When one can buy new cheaper then a repair. Why? And rebuilt was not much cheaper then new again Why? They could not get a new product to rebuild quick enough. So it closed and 70 plus out of a job.
good,Great place to work friendly people. I met all types of people working for the office
good,It was an interesting intern experience learning about how the store works.
good,"Management very pleasant, but is irresponsible in dealings with employees and commision is not very good. This company has a high turnover rate in employees."
good,"The Managers At This Store Are Very Honorable And Respect All The Time. It's A Great Place To Work But For The Department That I Was Working In, I Believe That They Should Have Paid More Than $7.31 An Hour But Overall It's A Great Place To Work."
good,my overall review about Sears is that you can easily get along with everyone. and your able to help customers and co-workers with anything that is going on in the store. and everyone is so nice to you.
good,"performed number of projects such as helped customers, cashed their purchase out. stocked shelves and racks."
good,Company is good to work for except when they start liquidation process. People that are full time will get severance pay but will be paid according to their benefit rates. If commission their benefit rate will probably be minimum wage by the time the company is fully liquidated.
good,Lots of interaction with customers. mostly warehouse and stocking appliances and products. Great job for a college student who doesnt mind getting hands dirty.
good,Nice place to work with some very nice co-workers. I enjoyed finding out the customers needs and then fulfilling those needs with the right product.
good,It is a good place to meet and interact with different people. Is a great place to learn communication skills due to the one on one interaction with the families.
good,I am a receiver and do open boxes for home fashions and clothes fashions
good,Sear was the first job I ever had and it taugh me a lot on working with others and showing great customer service skills.
good,Working here opened my eyes as to what many call centers need and that is room for advancement. It was a good experience and I enjoyed working with the people but you did not get many resources which you need to help the customer
good,I liked working here when i was younger because it thought me alot about products that I still use today. The management was friendly and helpful and they had bonuses in the dept i worked in.
good,Was a great part time job while I was there. Hours were good for me at the time. Work was hard but rewarding.
good,"I liked my coworkers and conversations I have with them in the break room. The managers are alright and friendly, but can get annoying/ irritating sometimes."
good,"If the store was still open, I would definitely recommend working here. There were many associates of varied ages and culture. This made it, in my opomion, a more interesting place to work"
good,El único problema es el horario. Es mucho el tiempo y más en ventas nocturnas
good,Something is always better than nothing!! Sears is a good company it is a lot of us that suffers from bad management. By the way they forced me to write 150 characters or more so here you go
good,having mangt. yell because casiers did not sign enough people for credit cards.I loved the people I worked with for the most part. The culture was no mangt was supportive .
good,N/a  nothing to tell cared less on workers  no raises. Always looked at the bad things you do and not for the good things you do. Working hard and not getting any credit
good,Sears at one time was a highly desirable place to work. Senior mgmt made it miserable. Often times turning a dead ear to employee concerns and issues. This is part of the reason for their demise
good,"We as a team we’re counting on each other to work in teams.work in pickup dept,stockrooms,fill floor all day and help customer and work doing cashier also"
good,Problemas administrativos y falta de correcciones a empleados
good,"The stores are closing and their business model is old fashioned. Still, the people who work there are all pleasant and respectful. Mid managment is ok for daily operations but higher managers seem clueless to workplace climate."
good,The employees were enjoyable to work with most of them . For the most part you had what you needed to do your job .  Certain members of management could have taken lessons on how to talk to there employees
good,build sales skills or what you want and move on in a few years you have many opportunitites to focus on a particular skill but don't plan on staying because things are uncertain
good,"The work is fairly dreadful unless you manage to make friends, which is easily done given the work environment. Management wasn't intimidating as you would expect."
good,"Great training program. Manager assigned you task to complete during your shift. I was pretty much in charge of my whole department. I was independent and at times had to work a whole floor on my own which made the floor task even harder to accomplish. Even though I liked to work there and the job was challenging, I sometimes felt that no one really cared about the accomplishments I had made in the company like hitting peak performer a number of times. I the time i worked there I saw some many people that had worked so hard for the company and they eventually were treated poorly in the end. It was a great company and one point in time but it seems to me, that is not the case anymore."
good,"easy to see why the company in going under, terrible management above the store, cant do anything without their approval and they take to long to respond. inventory comes in and the truck is never the products you want its always what you already have. they will be gone by 2020"
good,"It was a pleasure to greet our Members and meet their needs..So many Members enjoyed sharing their ""Sears Stories"" with us..several times I had the privilege to serve families that were 3 generations Sears Shoppers..what a history. We had a hard working sales team that would do everything possible to satisfy our Members..as well as meet the company goals. We had a good group of dedicated Associates..the hardest part of the job was when we were told the store was closing..and had to remain positive to our many Members as we told them goodbye."
good,"I’ve worked at two locations the first was horrible. The management was horrible. The managers did not care, I had a death in the family and was told that I should’ve let them known about the death earlier when it had happened 2 days ago and I was giving them 5 day notice before the funeral. I was told that I had to find someone on my own to cover my shift when I worked nights alone upstairs and didn’t know anyone or I would be written up. My second store was amazing the management was great and my time there I felt like Had a true work family."
good,great experience working for KMART. ..Sears changed alot but still a great learning experience................................................. great experience
good,"Sears was great for commissions, but store closings have eroded consumer confidence.  Kenmore brand is widely recognized, which has helped offset this issue."
good,"Fast paced environment, culture of work place was good. Every meeting was like a pep rally. Working with customers was enjoyable. Benefits offered, paid vacation offered."
good,"Doesn't pay enough and always want you to sell credit cards and sign people up for membership program. Very laid back outside of that. Pay could be decent if you sell credit card applications but customers are never interested, understandbly."
good,"El trabajo en la empresa es duro por qué son muy exigente en cuestión de que tienes que realizar solicitudes para las tarjetas de crédito, además los jefes de departamento son muy especiales"
good,Opportunity to assist customers with questions and give recommendations. Environment managing customers with simple easy issues and more those with more in depth concerns
good,"acomodaba la mercancia y limpiaba mi area."
good,Olean Hometown Sears Store was very good and successful. We focused on customer service and satisfaction. We worked hard to make the business work despite some of the hardships. 4.3 stars
good,"es llegar la junta 100 , limpiar el departamento , realizar el ingreso de efectivo a la caja registradora  , acomodar la mercancía , cobrar los servicios de la tarjeta sears  , cobro de mercancía , atención  al cliente  de forma personalizada ."
good,I enjoyed getting inside knowledge of everyday household products most people would not be privy too.  It was easy to learn and helpful for my future purchases of these items as well as helpful to customers when relaying this information.  The only thing I did not like was how forceful we were required to have people join the online rewards program.  Otherwise it was a nice experience.  There are monitor that allow to take online training for your department as well as other departments so you can gain knowledge in other areas.
good,Can’t remember the work exactly but the people that worked there made you want to come back everyday. Everyone was very helpful and was really a team oriented warehouse.
good,"A typical day at sears would be really slow especially on the week days. The weekends would be really packed. I learned that at sears that you have to be really patient when working with the customers and the computers when they are running slow. I also learn that if you need help then say something, don't just sit there."
good,"It’s a ok job , I thought it would’ve been way better then that but when I got there it wasn’t but it’s a good start up job. It’s nothing I won’t really recommend people for."
good,"Before it went bankrupt, I worked there for a few months. I would clock in, and go to whichever department needed my assistance. I started out in commissions, and ended up in store support. Honestly, I became skilled in multiple positions because there weren't enough employees."
good,Managed and trained a customer service department. I created new training programs. I also worked hand and hand with out wholesale distributors. The company relocated out of state.
good,my typical day at work would be to check any production processing i was responsible for and then to develop and implement solutions based on analysis and definition of requirements and business rules.  Hardest part of my job would be when specifications are not complete so many times I would have to communicate with Architect to get it accurate.  Most enjoyable part of my job was when we would get it right!
good,"I worked with the best group of people at Sears. I knew that if I needed help with anything that I could count on my co-workers to help me out no matter what it was."
good,"El único detalle es que es todo el día, todos los días"
good,"The Sears DuBois work environment was worker-friendly and store management was very goal oriented. Their scheduling was very open and management was very supportive of the store staff. "
good,"Sears worked well with my schedule and requirements while I was taking classes. So long as I worked with my team, they worked with me. however, once I got out of school, their system was no longer enough to sustain my lifestyle."
good,Policies and procedures were changing everyday to each specific manager. There was never any consistency for the way we handled customer issues or resets of merchandise
good,There was no hard part to the job for me. As a store manager working with customers was the highlight of my day. I enjoyed my work and I enjoyed my team. It was a fun place to work.
good,"I havent worked there in quite a long time, but I do not expect the company to be around for much longer.  Bankruptcy after bankruptcy without anyone willing to advance the internal workings of the company."
good,"Customer service is the optimum purpose of this job,you need knowledge of jewelry and wiling to be on foot for long hours and help the customers. I worked in good environment and enjoyed helping people."
good,"Worked for the company for almost twelve years. A typical day was very hectic with every day being different requiring quick thinking, adaptability and teamwork.  Management was very good for the most part with a few exceptions.  Management also helps employees to advance and learn new aspects of the business.  Started out as a cashier in the beginning and ended my career as an acting store manager.  Closed the store for the final time after completing liquidation sales and store teardown.  I learned alot of management functions and how to deal with all kinds of different employees and customer issue situations. Workplace culture was very poor for many years until great management was brought in from outside the store.  This new manager made a great effort to  improve morale and company culture over a period of years and also helped me to advance in the company and improve things greatly.  Was actively mentored by some great district managers but at the end the districts were restructured and many good people left the company.  Very difficult to see the company's current state."
good,I was a backroom associate also did mpu which is (merchandise pick up) and the job was really laid back and i enjoyed it but my co workers made the job way more enjoyable
good,"The job was a good learning experience. I would start out my day working in the backroom, unloading over 100lb objects from trucks. I was taught how to stock items, locate, relocate, and handle customer pick ups. I was also taught how to assemble over 50 kinds of mowers, and would leave work by around 6 p.m. The job location was closed so my job was terminated."
good,"Working at Sears it's a good part time job, but doesn't pay the bills. If you're semi-retired or looking for a second job it is fine."
good,"A typical day at work included a count od merchandise in the stock room, greeting all customers and offering Sears credit card. Promoting the store brand and explain the benefits and features of items to be sold. Selling store warranty and setting up delivery of major appliances or electronics. Maintaining inventory, setting display and keeping area clean and organized. Efficient and timely cashiering."
good,Sears es competitiva con otras tiendas pero le hace falta mucha organización y dar mejores opciones cuando un colaborador  se quere ir. Pues no te dicen todos los beneficios cuando entras sino hasta que renuncias.
good,The constant worry of our store closing due to the company not being managed properly was very stressful.  We were a profitable store but due to issues beyond our control we had to close our location.
good,"Management were great for the most part, they were always willing to give extra time to show how to do a fold or open cash, or help.on the computer."
good,"A typical day at Sears was running a register, folding clothes and putting away anything that goes back. Management for the most part okay. The only issue I had was with the credit cards. Every few minutes they would like to call to see if we had any credit apps, if not you was going to get an ear full. I loved my coworkers they were delight to work with but because of the credit cards it became so cut-throat I couldn't stand it."
good,"The people and the environment that I was in, I got to really know my other coworkers. They all made working more fun and we are still very close and talk frequently."
good,"Was a great place to work until the last few years.  Would deal with member issues, inventory, coaching, daily tasks, resetting the the floor with new product almost daily.  Built a lot of relationships with associates.  Positions started getting cut all the time.  Asked more and more of those who were still there.  At the end there were unattainable goals.  Customers asking everyday when we were closing."
good,"Good place to get started in your career "
good,Very stressful place to work. Very competitive and very cuthroat. Sears structure is very poor and not very good at all. They are very misorganized. Management skills is very poor
good,"typical day at work, morning meeting and get everyone up to speed with goals and numbers  from the previous day. "
good,"flexible hours, management is good to work with, lack of funding kills good ideas at sears. there are ZERO benefits. work life balance is great. SYW should be killed."
good,"The day would be relatively slow with a few bursts of people a few times a day. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Sears has been going out of business, and it just wasn't a reliable job to keep because of this."
good,I worked a seasonal contract in the Port Coquitlam Warehouse imports department. It was a good job. The job involved lots of heavy lifting which helped keep me in shape. The management was pretty good and understanding.
good,"Flexible working hours"
good,"Used to feel like family, but now it is a scary company to work for never knowing what is coming next with store closings. Local store was on the way back up, and then blindsided by a closure which put us all out of a job.  :-("
good,"When working at Sears you must be able to multi-task and be prepared to take on responsibilities outside of your own. With an ever decreasing managerial team associates and members will be looking to you to solve issues regardless if it happens to be your area of responsibility, You will need to be flexible and willing to learn the processes, rules and techniques of departments/ areas outside of your own. As a softlines manager you could begin your day with a floor reset, spend the afternoon with the cashiers and coaching on metrics and end your day assisting a member with an appliance sale, all the while responding to manager calls and monitoring package pick-up activities.  Juggling multiple responsibilities at one time can be very challenging but it can also be fun, you're work day is never the same and it's rarely ever boring."
good,"I have built a successful career over the past 12 years working for Sears.  I believe that by working for Sears I have developed  knowledge and skills that will serve me well in transitioning into another successful career or any new role I choose to tackle. Overall I am thankful for the 12 years with Sears. "
good,"Loss Prevention Assistant.  Shop lifting prevention, work area safety control, fraud control, store opening and closing, department audit and supervision of security guard."
good,"good place to work, advancement opportunities were plentiful, job security was really bad.  Had 4 promotions and 2 eliminated positions in 3 years.  Many locations closing."
good,the hardest part of the job was serving and running the repairs by myself when there would be an influx of customers waiting that were rushing for me to finish their watches.
good,Call customers to renew Sears service contract on their Sears appliances.I learned the value of having a a service conract on your major appliances to save mony on repairs.The management staff good and very knowlegable.Workkplace culture was good enjoyed it.The hardest part of job was attending workshop on day off.I realy enjoyed working with my co-workers.
good,"Having friendly faces come in and out recognizing you everyday day. Helping people that will make your day, everyday all day. Cool people to work with kinda competitive too"
good,With it being my first real job I dealt with the things I went through working at sears. My main concerns were dealing with disrespect from older employees.
good,"Way to laid back, If your looking for a job where there really isn't any goals or accountability than this is your place. I'd say its a job not a carrier."
good,The job was very competitive and fast paced. Half the day is spent unloading merchandise and receiving orders for customers and pick up. I would recommend this job if you have no work experience at all.
good,Working as a consultant was very challenging because it is a 100 percent commission. The products they sell is very expensive and the job could be very stressful.
good,no longer in service closed up gone shut down bankrupt see the news look around sears is gone or pretty well is laid off  no longer a company want to buy it
good,Sears was one of my first retail jobs and I'm glad it was. It was really laid back and the sales goals weren't impossible. Unfortunately due to the company cutting corners it started to get hard to make connections with buyers.
good,"I learned a lot about sales and how to push add ons. I was trained to cover multiple areas but had one designated section. Although I was give a specific area to sell in, if they were short handed they would call anyone to a register which often left me feeling like I couldnt meet my sales quota. They set goals and didnt ding you for missing them, but rewarded you if you did make your sales or credits. I enjoyed the food in the breakroom and events to keep the team positive. I loved most of my coworkers but there were some that were there for a year or two who just seemed to make my life harder, I would dread working with them. I had some anxiety about being a sales person and some managers pushed me hard, while some were more understanding. I was hoping to get a transfer to a different store but it never happened. I feel like this could be due to all Sears stores cutting jobs and even downsizing managment. Managers who were making salary were forced to take pay cuts and work for hourly rates which hurt our store and others."
good,My experience with SEARS was ok. Nothing amazing an nothing terrible really about the place. SEARS was perfect for college students looking for a place to work an go to school.
good,sears was a good place to work and the people worked and did enjoy the time of being there. Plus I tried to make the work environment fun but getting the work done
good,"Realmente crecí mucho personal y profesionalmente hay ya que fue mi primer empleo."
good,very good place to work for no complain. hours just past by when you are doing something that pleases you at the end of the day you feel a sense of accomplishment
good,"Limited training, was directed to train others although wasn't my responsibility, supervisors didn't do much but make excuses and had less knowledge of operating procedures, was passed up 3 times for supervisor position for someone who didn't have any knowledge for training others"
good,"some people wouldn't show up but would get paid for it. Some days you would get hours other times you and since the company was going bankrupt they would fire people out of the blue, but other than that Sears was a great place to work."
good,"Great training in Chicago, but needs more.  Hard part about the job was going into people's home.  Dirty people, infested with critters and had to work in cramp areas. Good co-workers willing to help."
good,Cero oportunidad de crecimiento con mi jefa directa.
good,Departmental manager will have to manage the business of the department and you are managing various supervisor. Not a stable company. You are making bigger decisions everyday.
good,"It's good in anything that I want to have succeed to have those around me on the same page, pulling to accomplish the goal. It's also good to know that the people you have to rub elbows with are on an even kill. That common courtesy will be observed daily."
good,"it is a very laid back place work at, managment is great, flexible hours, part time has no pad vacation time, holiday pay is base pay plus two dollars, good entry level job"
good,"The job had its good times and bad times, but mostly good. We all enjoyed each others company, had great laughs and always made jokes with each other."
good,Work is very boring but not difficult. Management isn't too strict and you have a lot of freedom as long as you do your job. Some departments are better than others like footwear.
good,"A typical day at Sears NLC involved, conversation with staff. Addressing concerns of just saying hello. Assigning additional job tasks to various team members as necessary."
good,Sears is a friendly environment however I needed to survive with the minimum wage. The benefits of having friendly co workers made the environment fun.
good,It was my first real job and I started as seasonal getting paid 7.25. I Caught on very quickly and I was asked to stay. I ended up being there a whole year going on two years and I never got a raise even though I did a lot of work. They also cut hours on the number of credit apps you get.
good,"eh it was my first job right out of high school "
good,Being a Sears Automotive Technician allows for a wealth of experience when working with domestic and foreign cars and trucks. This experience paves the way for self-maintenance at home on privately owned vehicles.
good,Worked with an incredible group of people. Was easy to transition between job roles. The atmosphere at work was positive and enjoyed the compassion the associates had for the members.
good,"I can't really compare my experience here with anything else, because it was my first job. However, my parents and I were baffled about how easy it was to get a job there. I worked behind the jewelry counter and enjoyed it, for the most part."
good,"It was a nice in between job. Easy to excel if you had the will and want to. Quick to pick up on the job expectations and the labors. Workers were fun and easy to talk to, to ask for help."
good,"Not usually very busy in there. Everyone working there is very nice and easy to get along with. You'll pretty much be stocking shelves, ringing up customers, and just making sure inventory is all good."
good,Changing rapidly due to the financials declining. Area of responsibility became too large geographically to be effective in the stores. Covered 4 states which was every night-overnight.
good,Cada vez k llegan clientes por problemas en sus ordenes...la empresa confia en k uno resuelva el acontecimiento para mejorar las entregas.
good,working for sears was great at first until the store gm decided to start cutting hours and refusing to give people the days they requested off because e himself was denied his days off. hen anything went bad in the store or when corporate had bad news for him he would take it out on the other managers and employees. then in turn every body would be i a bad mood and the store stared receiving more and more bad reviews.
good,"Great people, company just fell victim to circumstances.  Team members were great, always supportive and goal driven.  Typical day with sales reports and tasks to complete daily flow of the business"
good,it was okay but it was pretty bad pay but dont expect to get alot of hours and getting time off is a struggle. its not very easy to use the system that they offer to put in those requests and its only available instore
good,"A typical day would be answering phone calls, and educating customers on products, making recommendations and going for a complete sale. It helps to believe in the products that you sell and the maintenance agreements too!  I had very helpful managers that made each day interesting. Appliances is a commissioned job, you need to want to sell to make money. Downside is the recent commission cuts."
good,Was a great job but no Job Secrurity.  Move jobs over seas and the closed the doors.  Was not given dates for when my possition would be done.   Told day before.
good,"I appreciate the staff and managers. Just wish I had more working hours and a higher pay. Everyone is pretty relaxed and there isn't much micromanaging. "
good,Pues lo que no me gustó que la supervisora tuviera preferidos
good,I feel that the company at this time is really struggling to stay afloat and that at times the expectations that are put on us are unrealistic. We have been doing the job of 5 people for several years within the store.Being able to multi task and do many jobs that you ordinarily would not do is a must. Lots of focus on metrics!
good,"Primarily worked Loss Prevention, Logistics then with the restructure back to Loss Prevention and Maintenance. Great place to work, A lot of good people and friends."
good,"ambiente tranquilo derrepnte algo incomodo , buena capacitacion ,"
good,It was a good place to work. It was a little slow and there wasn't much to do. I liked the management and the environment. The coworkers were very friendly.
good,The job itself was pretty good and my coworkers were great to work with. The only gripe I have with Sears were my manger and the fact that you don't start accruing vacation time until a year after you are full-time.
good,"Very good company at one time but slow to innovate. Imagine, they had a dominant catalog operation but was left behind in the internet age. Most likely a lost cause."
good,Good place to learn the basics about customer service. Provides exlcellent training . Good place to develop customer service skills in person on a daily bases
good,Bonnes possibilités d’évolution. Grandes possibilités d’apprentissage.
good,sears était  bonne compagnie mais malheureusement il ont fermé a cause du ralentissement de leurs  commerce
good,"If you are in a store with a great management team then you will enjoy your time with Sears. However, as a whole the company puts it focus on profits over its people.  If you are considering management with this company then you need to pass on the job.  As a starter job it was a great opportunity where I was able to grow and develop some great skills."
good,"When I had good days,  I enjoyed it. When I had bad days, I did not enjoy it. This job involved getting customers to have home improvement consultation from a rep."
good,"I worked as a shoe associate for about 5 months. It’s not that bad. It’s just that the store is empty some days, so it can be pretty mind numbing. The workers there were cool which helped move time along. The downside is the low pay and non existent hours. I only worked once or twice a week for 5 hours and a 15 min break. And you get paid every two weeks. This is a good place to gain experience, but don’t expect too much. You’ll be disappointed."
good,"Great place to work for many years Until recently as business declines and stores close."
good,"Sears was always understaffed while I was there, meaning that I would be stuck by myself in the cash-wrap for hours. Occasionally I would have an entire floor to myself. This is regardless to whether the store was randomly busy or not. "
good,"cashier job so part time with bi-weekly pay no benefits for part timers . fast paced on holidays and weekend ,overall job was easy and a good beginner job"
good,"I wish they will be a little bit more selective on the type of people they hire. Because of the limited amount of money you can make at Sears Driving School, not too many people would apply. Unlike other companies I have worked for they don't really have anybody that can replace someone like myself because I am an instructor."
good,"I had fun working on this job with my sister, friends and other people I knew in the neighbourhood. The time went by fast and I learned a lot about ware house work."
good,es una empresa que agradesco haberme dado dicha oportunidad laboral pero carece de caracter en cuestion de los empleados y su cultura o educacion hacia el cliente
good,"The Kmart store I worked at was a nice clean, small store.  Unfortunately when the neighborhood Meijers was built in Williamsburg, many people started shopping there instead and Kmart was forced to close their doors."
good,good work experience a good way to start a sales position they have room for flexible hours and many way to advance on the sears team still I would return again.
good,It was busy because it was the holiday. I had difficulty getting home because we got off after the buses stopped running which meant Id have to walk or ask for rides. Also I told them I could not get there early on weekends because the buses didn't run all the times so that was also difficult. The employees were good and overall nice. I work at my current job with a woman I worked with at sears. It was not a bad place to work I was just hired for seasonal.
good,They were flexible with my avab. Got more hours by helping other depts. The management team did have experience and were easy to talk and work with. Management would help one another get projects and observations done.
good,"I loved working for Sears but the store closed"
good,"A typical day would consist of greeting customers with a smile, ringing them up. what i have learned from that job is to always have a positive attitude when it comes to work, always have a certain goal in mind that you would want to achieve."
good,Sears is a great place to learn new skillsets. Analysts are exposed to technologies they may not have had the opportunity to work with previously. Sears is a competitive and high-paced environment.
good,"I liked working for Sears, it was an overall good company to work for, I did not receive too much advacement, the company overall is nice, good working atmosphere and room for advacement to those who want to grow within the company. Not too popular sometimes no customers going into the store."
good,management is not good but the environment is fun loving and there are lot of things to learn and hardest part is there is no appreciation which is not good
good,"training is reasonable and thorough if a little excessive in some areas. Work hours were good and consistent, backroom employment was good, but managers could be a little testy sometimes if there weren't enough employees back there to keep things running as smooth as possible."
good,The job was fairly easy to deal with but not enough pay for employers. Working with the other associates was fun. Also I learned a lot of customer service working here.  They offered a reward for meeting the sales target. Constantly meeting customers and maintaining the department throughout the day.
good,Typical Day Is Very Slow. A Lot Of Times Managers Didn't Come When Needed. Managers Pressure Employees To Get People Signed Up For Sears Credit Cards. Culture Is Pretty Diverse.
good,"They are a great team, great opportunities for advancement, but the customers are almost constantly verbally abusive and if you cant sell them something youre cut. Job is also mind-numbingly boring and you barely get days off. They also love adding tasks outside of your job description without adding pay."
good,"Fast Paced, great managers"
good,"relaxed environment and rewarding. "
good,"I did not hate working at sears, my coworkers and managers are people I could still consider friends to this day. The job was 100% commission which was pretty scary starting off, but eventually I found my groove. The reason why I left was because I felt at the time I wasn’t being treated fairly. The company was cutting hours so since my position wasn’t paid hourly it felt like we were being used as free labor, which started hurting my sales."
good,"As far as getting the experience in sells and customer srvice , this a great place to start. It's a great summer job and for seasonal. But staying there you eventually get looked over and taken advantage of."
good,"I loved my time ar Sears. The staff and customers were great. I worked long hours, but did not mind it. The company started a downward spiral and jobs were cut. Was not customer friendly anymore!"
good,"Sales in Automotive center.  Started shift by checking in with manager to see what was going on.  Make way to sales floor to help costumers with car purchases or write them up to bring their cars into to shop to be checked.  If costumers looking for tires, you go to car and check tires and make your recommendations of what they need putting it all on paper.  Other work that needed to go into the shop; you would let them no how long it might take to check the car, some would wait and other would leave. Once car was check, I would need to get a quote for the customer getting there approval, keeping the customer informed and when finished putting the sale through.  If working at night needed to balance money and run end of day to close shop.  I enjoyed working with the customers, helping them in them with there car and had people who would always ask for me when they came in."
good,"As a career I would not recommend this as a primary place to spend your time, but as a builder of a resume just to get time at one job under your belt; this would be satisfactory."
good,"More lateral than upward movement is available. Great education opportunity with award winning Segno systems.  "
good,"Typical day starts at 7am and you are assigned appointments. Based on how well you are selling you are looking at anywhere between 1-4 appointments per day. Those appointments can be as early as 8:30am to as late as 10pm in the evening. Appointments range from near to far, they could be across the street from where you live or 60 miles from where you live. Management was good, but a lot of times they are handcuffed by corporate. Corporate makes it tough to be competitive with other companies."
good,"I've been fortunate to learn about all aspects of Retail Store design and implementation, including how to maintain buildings and redevelop them. "
good,this job was ok but the issue was commission and the base pay was low. not many cars came in so i stood around cleaning and stocking shelves and supplies. when there was work the manager never regulated the amount of work per person to take so it could wind up with one or two technicians with all the work and no one else to work on cars. it would get to the point that one person had a handful of work orders at a time and would hide them which is really shady and not fair but management never stepped in and made it right.
good,"Sears is a nice place to work as the employees are all passionate, dedicated, and optimist. This leads to a very nice work environment in which everyone is happy."
good,working at sears as my first job was a good experience for me. the work was easy. you are always being watched so you feel safe. but for the management for cashiers. wasnt all too professional if you as me.
good,"Sears is not as bad as it seems, it a great way to put your foot in the door for bigger and better things. Although it is stressful at times it is a good way to gain basic experience."
good,When I first started working there I loved it. As they would bring in new management things always changed. My newest ASM in Lands End was getting rid of all the older employees and bringing in new employees. She was horrible. Some customers were really rude. I learned how to put displayed up and organize new products in Lands End. The best part of this job was working with some awesome people and having fun at the same time.
good,"The culture of this company from the stand point of where I worked may be limited. But I know from the feedback of other personnel that worked at other sites that this locations representation of the culture at times was okay.  Still there should be a better means to reduce some of the pressure placed on many of the associates there.  At times there were games, popcorn, prizes, and other activities to promote a sense of appreciation and fun.  Too often though, there was a lot of stress to produce big numbers in sales and we achieved those."
good,work harder than others without recognition or raise oppertunities. Learned the day to day in my job title aswell as the others such as cashiering......
good,I was called an appointment setter whcih basically meant i randomely called people to set up free quotes on installing new replacement windows. This job did not get me very far though it did have good insitements to do good.
good,I don't think I can give an unbiased opinion. The negative points are foremost on my mind. I have worked at this company for over 10 years now but from day one I have always felt moderately stressed.
good,"It started off as a good place to work for.  Good management, employees, and products.  After K-Mart bought them out things changed.  Management changed, demand became unreasonable, and products became awful.  Customers were very unhappy."
good,"I worked as a sales associate in a Home Appliance Showroom. I enjoyed the atmosphere and flexibility of my job. That said, Sears was not transparent with how much commission we were supposed to be paid, and the commission rates are stingy. There were many discrepancies between Sears and Sears.com. In which Sears.com always had lower prices and free shipping, and we were not allowed to price match them or provide free shipping. Therefore we were in a constant battle with our own company. I lost countless sales to Sears.com. Corporate Sears does not care much about their employees, and are taking steps to save the company from bankruptcy."
good,"I worked here long term and met some great employees. But also one really bad store manager, now gone. Sears otherwise was a pretty good place to work for. If your a retail worker its not bad."
good,"it was usually a boring day, because not many people come into sears, i did have clothes and other items to put away, but not all the time. the people there were good, but the job was underwhelming."
good,At the time I was employed it was a good experience and quick paced easy to learn the basics and manager were good. Balanced work and hours not many benefits if at all any when I was there.
good,The office assistant position has no potentional to get you into any higher position. The job did offer security however there is no room for improvement. If you wanted to advance you would have to get into a sales position first before you wanted to move up as a manager. Not the best approach if you are trying to stay out of sales.
good,I would say that the overall experience at Sears was great. I learned a great deal and it helped me improve my customer service skills. I learned to use their computer system very well and I learned skills as far as selling jewelry. The management team was very helpful and attentive. The employees and customers were very diverse. The hardest part was dealing with unhappy customers. The most enjoyable part was helping the floor team keep the store clean and organized.
good,"provide great customer service, fun place to work, low paying, flexible  hours, great management, great training provided upon hire, and simple a good place for students who are still in school"
good,"The consisted of getting there and opening the register, having a morning meeting about how poorly everyone in the store had been doing, and then starting the day."
good,Sear was the most stressful place to work as a telemarketer during my two and a half years of employment there. Even though it was fun and fast paced the raises were only in our commissions and the job was stressful.
good,"Make overs skin care consultation work as a team "
good,"Your typical retail store, organizing clothes to selling jewelry to being a tools associate. I learned a lot about jewelry and tools and what each tool is used for. A lot of experience in customer service and sales representative."
good,Work in out bound call center calling customer about their credit accounts past due. Encourage them to make payment the importantance of payments being current. It can be stressful customers can be mean because of what every life situation their going through. Customer feeling stress from the calls make many threats to hurts us.
good,"Sears was ok. The job I had interested me but the work days seemed to drag on forever. Plus I wasn't getting the hours I desired. Overall though, a good place to work!"
good,Good company with passionate and driven people. Unstable at this time however. Highly strategic projects that are changing the company from top to bottom. A lot of opportunity to try new and interesting things.
good,Good place to work until stores started closing and given unrealistic budgets to with expectations to raise operating capital. Learned much about stretching associates and working efficiently.
good,Nice place to work at. You'll learn a lot at the job and there is a lot of potential to grow. the office location is right behind eaton centre which is just perfect.
good,I gained many work experiences. Enjoyed everyone I worked with. Many changed through the years both good and bad but overall it was a great place to work.
good,A good place to work if your juggling school and work. Works with your schedule and understanding to personal preferences to the work place. Compensation could be a LOT better however.
good,Sears sourcing team is very well managed efficiently work distributed. There are some work pressure but this helps you to be more capable and also helps to learn how to organise your work better to be more efficient.
good,Sears is enjoyable when everyone works together in your team and you finish your tasks that have been given to you at the start of your day. Management can be bit hard because there are many sub sections with there own manger and assistant manager.
good,Sometimes very demanding. Work all holidays.  Hours change with the holidays. Seems to be number driven not customer driven. Work hard for a company that might not be stable.
good,"management changed to often.  not enough work at times to keep you busy. "
good,"A Lot Of The System Were Old, Out Dated, And Frequently Went Down Causing Store Operation To Become More Difficult Especially In Time Sensitive Matters."
good,Working at Sears was a great way for me to improve my customer service skills. They had cross training opportunities so that you could advance yourself within the company.
good,Lo único malo es que no le daban mucha importancia a la vida familiar
good,Working at sears was my first job. It was better than I thought at first. I was trained and then given my own wings to do as I could. What I and my other workers did not care for was the over bearingness of the store manage for credit apps.
good,Slow usually and slow paced i enjoyed working here the management was good and i always got fair breaks and hours until sears started going bankrupt and the employees lost hours.
good,Lots of opportunity to grow by being cross trained on other duties.   No pay raises after working there for 3 years with a stellar performance review!!!!
good,"The leadership is focused on process, profits and numbers only.  Employee loyalty and hard work not recognized, only way to get pay increase is to promote."
good,Excelente prestaciones y buenos jefes trabajo bajo presion
good,To many store closings forcing employees to work further away from home (if they transfer) or no job at all. It is a very relaxed company to work for just wish they would restore profitability to keep the store up and running.
good,when working here please do not think that there is any advancement. you do have lunch breaks and this job is pretty straight forward. I enjoyed working there
good,Sears has a very good work/life balance environment. It's a very quiet office and not an extremely stressful job.Flexible hours and great hours of operation. Not open on weekends.
good,"I am glad I worked in the position/department that I did. I would not have wanted to work in any other department with the way the management was, the tasks, and the politics. My department was amazing though!"
good,"I have been there eight years and have not been promoted or even offered one.  My pay has only increased twice, because I demanded it when someone just hired was paid more than me."
good,It's a ok job. Training is pretty good. Being a cashier there is easy until you hear about the amount of credit applications you need to get by the end of the week/month.
good,"If you want job security DO NOT COME HERE. I understand that at a work place it is going to be ever changing but sears is one of the least secure places to work at. With constant changes they either move you departments or let you go, there is no in between."
good,"Ive worked for Sears for almost 10 years, started in the jewelry department and worked my way up to the apparel assistant store manager position. Management teams are good."
good,I liked my co workers and most of the managers. Learned a lot in each dept. Which helped out for all the things i could do to help others in any dept.
good,"It became apparent that this business was not one that you could plan to retire from, so the job security was always uncertain.  The pay was pathetic, but the family created in the business unity was second to none."
good,I learned a lot from working there. Took a lot of the skills I learned with me to my next job.My immediate manager always had my back when it came to doing my job efficiently.
good,"With so many entry level employees/students, it was frustrating to experience the turnover, and what I perceived as unacceptable work ethics.  Our manager was great to work for and very accommodating to the employees"
good,"I applied to Sear and I was put in the shoes department. It wasn't the worst job but it wasn't good either. I liked the managers excepted one that was bipolar. I was by myself the whole time so it gets lonely. Other than that, a good starting point."
good,I worked in the appliance department on FULL COMMISSION.  That's really rough especially when no customers are coming in.  Upper management is not that great.  They are making changed that are not helping. The reason they don't know is because they don't visit stores and they don't take advice from low level employees.
good,Sears was a very good company to work for in the past.  They are having serious financial problems that reduced the opportunities and the compensation that you received.  I would still be working for them if they were more financially secure.
good,"Very demanding in filling floor with production, however work environment was very clean. Hardest part of job was recovering alone before closing . The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to learn duties that a manager would do. For example, making signs, paper work, and running the floor sales. In addition, online purchases help with extra money on the side."
good,"- lots to do"
good,It was great interacting with customers other than that it would be quite slow. Meeting goals every week. It was a great learning experience in handling cash
good,"Sears was a decent company to work for, however, it only served as a job while I was in school. The management was mediocre and I do not believe I was paid fairly for the amount of work that I did. I never received a raise. However, it was easy to get along with people that I worked with and work with customers."
good,"I enjoyed helping the customers decide on products and helping to get them financed and learning about the products was really enjoyable, the down side was if things did not get delivered or product did not come in you loose the sale and they took your commission away even though not your fault."
good,"Es un buen lugar para trabajar, el problema son las solicitudes, mínimo te piden 10 al mes y es algo muy difícil"
good,"If you want to enhance your Customer Service Skills, this is the job for you.  No One comes into an auto repair shop in a good mood.  It is your job to make them happy while convincing them to fork out a butt load of money"
good,"Sears is a dinosaur of a company with many backwards ideas. Fun people are brought in, but mostly don't stick around. The average pay is awful, and the culture for the majority is pretty chaotic."
good,"It was nice at first. Then as a new seasonal I had unnecessary pressure from management. At the time i was desperate for work, so i settled for this job as a seasonal. Week two everyone showed their true colors. Backroom sucked. It was messy but organized. Week three it calmed down but i hated to see employees slack off during the busy time of year but i dont blame them. A lot of pressure for just backroom employees. But overall it was still manageable."
good,"A typical day at work was relaxed in a sense, because (like in most retail jobs) I had my own area of the store that I looked after and it was relaxed and I kept some independence and ease to my job. But as I started to become less and less of a newbie, the management pressured me more and more into selling the Sears credit cards or else they'd cut my hours down to like two 3-hour shifts a week. It was sort of competitive among the staff as well, they would brag about the amount of credit they sold to make you feel sort of inferior; common drama. Your whole job was basically about harassing people into signing up for credit cards in order to keep your job. I learned that if a company asks me about credit first thing at a job interview, do not take the job. It is about sales, not customer service. The management were very on-edge, but good people. I'd say the most enjoyable part of the job was having my own section of the store to work in and really having some independence."
good,"When you take away the actual work aspect of being a part of the Kmart team, you realize that you get the chance to interact with your community and get to know them better. It's an opportunity to connect with the customers (especially the loyal customers) and create a friendly environment."
good,"this Employer was great enjoyed working with the staff, i also learned a lot about the products they sale and the customers we assist on a daily basis."
good,The manager of the shoe department is racist. They ask us to do this time consuming work in a short time and then get mad when the work is not finished.
good,"a typical day at sears is making sure the customer is satisfied 100% of the time your first priority. "
good,"Relaxed easy work environment."
good,"I enjoyed working at Sears headquarters for over 15 years.  The managers were very pleasant.  I spent the day completing tasks per the managers' request, including by not limited to, keeping track of vendor budgets, filing, answering phones, travel arrangements, setting up vendor appointments, special projects for the marketing department as needed.  I was also a back-up secretary in the executive offices.  I never considered any part of my job difficult, but the most enjoyable part was knowing that I have helped make my manager's job a little easier based on my organization skills and great work ethic."
good,I learned how to lay jewelry out to be eye appealing an learned about the many different type of jewellery there is. However the other employees made the job difficult.
good,"Sears is a decent job if you are a teenager or an adult in between jobs. the co workers are great, management however is sad. the store manager makes the environment hostile and many of the leads make snide comments about african american employees. I wouldn't recommend staying at this job for more than a few months."
good,"Constantly looking for business driving opportunities through product, sourcing, business partnerships, and people."
good,"Local Leadership is/was highly effective. Executive leadership is very disconnected and silo'ed."
good,"Great Pay and cool environment to work in. The work was repetitive. Not encouraged enough to fully enjoy my work. However, my coworkers were outstanding and wonderful people making the environment fun and light."
good,"Ensure proper levels of hair care products were available at all distribution warehouses and especially at 1397 stores nation-wide."
good,Overall its a pretty laid back workplace at least where I worked anyway. Pay wasn't the greatest and the benefits were ok but there wasn't much room for advancement.
good,I truly enjoy my team and what I am currently doing. We have a lot of fun in the Auto Center getting our daily jobs done and just being one big team. We work together to get everything we need accomplished.
good,"Having worked for a few teams within the same department, my coworkers have made the transition easy and welcoming.  If there were any questions or concerns, we were able to bring it up and have it addressed.  Not everyone in upper management was as receptive to our concerns.  It came right down to the bottom line and constantly changing our job description based on the needs of the business.  That's not necessarily a negative but it does make it more difficult to complete projects. Even though there was different associate levels within a team, we along well together"
good,This is a good company many different departments to work in however they do have a high call volume and a lot of irate members. but you will get the training you need to help you along the way
good,good place to start to lean about cars. jim is the best. you learn alot. You learn alot from the type of oils to tire weights
good,Enjoyed the short time i worked there it was fun. Management  and co-workers made it very easy for me to completely carry out my assigned duties
good,"The people were really supportive and encouraging which made me work more harder and with enthusiasm. Basically, Sears taught me a lot about customer services and improved my skills of handling them and providing them with the most satisfied service ever. The best part is that you get to meet so many people and learn so much from them. By far, Sears has helped me grow as a person by improving my communication and interpersonal skills."
good,"I was juggling school and taking care of my sick mother when I worked here. They were very understanding of that and when I had to quit to take care of her, they were supportive of that decision and also told me I could come back should I gain the opportunity to do so."
good,"A typical day at work is quiet and face paced, you learn how to sell sears cards and how to organize the sales floor. Management is a little loud but they are comforting and friendly. My co-workers are funny and nice. The hardest part of the job is trying to get customers to sign up for a sears card and the most enjoyable part is working with my coworkers."
good,Good place to work for a starting career. Good work life balance and work culture. Good team management and work ethics.
good,"I loved working at Sears Auto Center, I just did not get along with my boss. She was very overbearing and critical and not in a good way. Instead of teaching, all she did was talk down on employees."
good,"enjoyable place to work, lacks structure and management skills as well as people willing to perform their duties. All fun, no work."
good,"Senior leadership did not develop their subordinates, but expected us to ""figure it out on our own."" Oppositional versus helpful behavior exhibited by senior leaders. Discouraging to us underlings."
good,Typical work day includes moving merchandise via hand truck and pricing merchandise. Two days a week unloading truck from the warehouse. The work process is not complicated.
good,Working in the Auto Center is an different adventure everyday.  Helping customers with auto repairs. Excellent Store Manager who backs us up and works as hard as any one there. Down side is low pay. Minimum wage plus Commission and promises of becoming full time for 5 years.
good,"A day at work is extremely busy from morning until night. Many changes and challenges on a daily basis."
good,"My typical day concluded of checking customers out , signing them up for our many membership programs , and trying to give them the best experience I could . I learned how to use a register proficiently , lead a team of cashiers as well as work well with others in different departments . My Management was for the most part was proficient and efficient , even though at times communication lacked . The hardest part of the job for me was the constant struggle of what you want to do for your customers and what you can actually do for your customers."
good,"Very fast-pace, greeting customers, helping to solve issue, everyone works as a team player, great co-workers and seeing customers return every week. one of the hardest things is getting customers to sign up for a credit card and the rewards program, enjoy working with people."
good,"It was ok to work there, however I don't exactly agree with some company policies. Sometimes I felt like they were art in place to benefit the company and not the customers"
good,The management team at sears is friendly. The associates are friendly too. There flexible with all the associates when it comes to there schedules. Ive grown a lot at sears and Ive learning a lot about the hardlines side of the store. Ive always worked in softlines.
good,Sears call center is a great place to work enjoyed it didn't like the hours so much back then but I also had a little one would do anything to go back there great place to work
good,"very good management at the store level, the higher managers keep changing the format of the stores. So very unstable work stability. The staff at the stores are very courteous."
good,"An average day involves a combination of salesmanship and cashier work.  "
good,Sears was a great place to work and go to school at the same time but they closed down. If they didn't close down it would've been the best job I ever had.
good,"I worked with great coworkers and management was very understanding. We had strict goals that involved signing customers up for the Sears Credit Card and Sears Mastercard. Sales goals were celebrated and praised across the store. "
good,"Overall, a very good place to work, unfortunately in the Home Improvements division back in 2008 the work dried up and the division was forced to cut back on almost all personnel."
good,"Not much to say here. Good place to work with some chance for advancement. Not much in the way of commission."
good,Fun place to work...People was real nice .......Things went while...Somedays was better then others...The management was good...I learned alot from working there
good,"Job Duties included outbound calls and email correspondance with sears management, contractors , city halls and customer in regards to previous installations to follow up with completing state required inspections on service provided from sears. i Learned better ways to keep organized with daily task and weekly follow ups, i enjoyed the responsibility of working independtly but hardest part is i enjoy working together as a team but each team member was in charge of different lines of business."
good,"Co-workers very nice and helpful. Enjoyed my time there. Management was good, all very nice people. A typical day would e fairly easy. I learned how to handle and count out a drawer. Hardest part was nothing it was all fairly easy. I enjoyed everything about my job and would love to have another experience working there just a closer location to me."
good,"I have been at Sears a long time and I've seen a lot of managers come and go. The job itself is what i do enjoy, fixing appliances. The problem with sears is that there is too many directions from the managers that often causes frustration leading to a stressful work day. Once you have become a technician there isn't too many options as far as advancement. A typical day is running your own route but having to continually stop and receive calls from your manager to explain new processes that we just went over from the other manager. I learned a lot from a young age of what a hard work ethic will lead to success."
good,"Sears Canada is a nice place to work for, staff is nice management is spectacular flexible schedule but not enough hours."
good,The hardest part about working at sears is that you maintain the same amount of pay no matter how long you've been working there unless you become a lead and maybe you start getting 25 cents more than the rest of the staff.
good,"The job itself was not bad, management made the job horrible. You're always being driven to produce better when you are already exceeding expectations. And I was thrown onto the sales floor within my first month because so many people left the store."
good,"Not an enjoyable job, ignorant general management who had a steady potty mouth, even in front of customers at times. The worst experience of a job in my life."
good,"the sears holding co was very keen on the idea of an integrated work space. meaning all the associates work together as a team, as it should be."
good,"At sears, I loved going to work, mainly to be around my costumers and my coworkers. We were really a team. However, management was rather interesting, using cameras to record and speak with us, with a suspicious sort of feeling. Other than that, I loved working with sears hourly."
good,It was a great place to work at days would go by fast as lines seemed to be endless. Season for Christmas was the longest I had ever lived through.
good,In my position I travel to different sites each day. Each day there is something different to do which adds a degree of freshness and challenge. I have the flexibility to work my own schedule and make decisions that contribute to positively drive the bottom line.
good,"I was hired while there were planning to close many stores, and i never knew if my store would be next. I was eventually laid off due to their financial situation"
good,"Nonprofit organization focused on providing living and healthcare resources for senior adults.  Provided independent living, assisted living, nursing home care, home health, hospice, rehabilitation, specialized Alzheimer's care.  I supported SMRS mission 100%.  Working there had its challenges due to constantly changing management practices."
good,Great place to work as a first retail job. Theres always something to do. Managers recognize when your doing a good job. You can get promoted easily if you work hard
good,Workers are nice.  Customers are very rude.  The managers are not horrible but the last few that I had are sort of mean.  They don't always try to understand.  The tasks that Sears makes their employees do are very pointless and a waste of time.
good,To work successfully at Sears you need to sell a certain amount of their credit cards and most people shopping their already have one so its usually a miss. If you aren't a pushy sales person this job isn't for you. I liked the staff for the most part and management was okay. I was hired in a group with 3 other people and I believe we all were let go for not selling enough cards.
good,Most of the time is to organize clothes and manage arrangement of the store. The thing I learned from this job is about how to fold clothes and arrange some shelves job.
good,"great for first jobs, or last job, you want consistency with.  Management didn't seem to agree on much, and hard work is rarely noticed."
good,"I enjoyed working there. I learned allot about working there, moving equipment's such as refrigerators dish washers and more . I got payed every hours 10$ .. I works as a night shift . its been good , I had to leave because of school"
good,it was ok working for this company. I learned a lot from working at sears. I am looking for bigger and better things. I am looking for a full time job.
good,"lots of opportunity to grow if you've been in the field, lots of stuff to learn. good team environment, every one is willing to help each other out."
good,"At times will shrug off thoughts and opinions of anyone other than managers. "
good,"This company is not a good company to work for."
good,"Sears is a low job entry company."
good,"They are very understanding about when you can work, and how much time you need for your classes. However, management can bicker like the entry-level associates, and communication can be lacking. They say there are opportunities for advancement, but they come rarely and usually hire from an outside source rather than from within."
good,"Every manager wanted things done their way, they were never on the same page. Management was always changing, had 6 different general managers in the years that I was there. I started as replenishment and worked my way up but due to budget cuts was eventually bumped down to supervisor. Extremely stressful"
good,"Great Job, "
good,management all new with poor knowledge. including store manager. lack of communication between management and leads. allot of associates willing to work for the company a little longer but there is too much pressure to stay.
good,"Sears can be a fun place to work, but I don't always agree with how they want things done. My co-workers support me as I do to them. If someone can't make it in, we will cover for each other. Management was the main reason I disliked the job. They constantly want me to push for their added protection which can be pricey. The main reason I don't push until the customer gets mad is because a Protection Agreement (added protection) is a temporary sale; if the customer leaves satisfied, they will come back for future purchases and be inclined to leave a good review. The second thing that annoyed me was how we must use the iPad over the register. I wouldn't have a problem with that, but it becomes so inconvenient when the customer has to wait for the iPad to connect. Overall, I learned that it is more important that the customer has an enjoyable experience because in the future, they may be loyal with us and our products."
good,"Is a fun place to work for, many employees get along with one another very well. Biggest issue with the company is the lack of better management, compensation (particular departments), and keeping the place staffed."
good,To advocate with the customer based of of both positive and negative customer service received form around the country.  The use of advanced training and computer programs to retain and maintain customer loyalty.
good,"This was a location that was not even built yet. I was hired as Inventory Control Coordinator for this new location. We all went in and really put this store together, from gondolas, wall shelving, product pegs, labeling and pricing, and then all of the product placement. Very tiring, but a good way to get to know people. There was ALWAYS a lot of negativity among management and it was never hidden. Pressure seemed to be always be coming from those in the corporate level. Long story short, the entire company was being ran by some extremely dishonest people, and CompUSA is no more!"
good,"Getting to have fun & act silly once in a while, with each other. Always learned new stuff. My co-worker was cool. Working with the ISS team."
good,"Ehh...."
good,"I enjoyed working with most coworkers and most managers. I was disappointed in the room for advancement and the benefits. after 3 years there were no raises or bonuses, no incentives of any kind really. But I was mostly disappointed being laid off!"
good,"Most of the days worked, the stores is pretty empty. When no customers are around, and no mess is around, you have to dust and that can be very comforting. I learned how to develop my people skills and put myself more out there. Now I do more work than I have ever allowed myself to do before. The best part about the job is the amount of support you get from the co-works around you, some at least. The ones in my immediate department are great, always willing to share and be there for me. Management in general is very unreliable because they don't always show up right away. It is very sloppy with how they handle certain things. Sometimes there is only 3-4 managers throughout the whole entire store, which isn't ideal. The hardest part is getting people, for me personally, to sign up for credit cards and provide their emails. I feel like I can't do anything right when I am constantly told about associates who get a lot of credit applications, especially when they are in busier departments than my own. The most enjoyable part is having an associate around when you need it the most, and not having to close alone."
good,Good place to work kinda like high school tho. If you do your job and show up you will have job security.Nice place to have lunch at and friendly people.
good,I was very proud to lead a team of wonderful associates with the sears organization. We worked hard as a group to achieve set goals and metrics.
good,I manage and work with my teams to satisfy our customers daily. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with people. I have vast knowledge in warehousing and transportation and the key to success in this field of work is people and not to over complicate things as in the end it is just a box with stuff going in and stuff going out.
good,"If I was the person to open the store it was my responsibility to make sure all departments were organized and customer ready. Also hold the store meeting to let everyone know where our numbers and margins for the day, week and month before the store opened. Also acknowledge an employees accomplishments. I would also make sure each employee was organized and ready to open their department on time. Once everyone else was ready to start their day in their department I would continue with my projects and other tasks at hand for the day."
good,"Sears is a good job and there are plenty of positions open, however the management leaves a lot to be desired. They are unreliable at times and most (not all) don't seem to care."
good,"Flexible hours and decent pay. The slow season just started and lay laid off a bunch of people, so sadly job security is not a factor. No prior warnings."
good,"Enjoyed working with my colleague, teaching and learning new ideas everyday. I mostly enjoyed helping the customer find the items they were looking for, or if any of the customers had a problem help them find a solution"
good,"Selling appliances to customers. Management is good. Co-workers are unique personalities. The hardest part of the job is working through the constantly changing rules and requirements. At times it is all about the numbers it like not what great job you did yesterday, but what are you going to do for us today. Best part of the job is the fulfilling customers needs."
good,"Great learning experience, but understaffed and overworked. If closing, would often stay an hour or more later than scheduled."
good,they only care about their metrics and for some positions you get 6/hr and 1%-1.5% of what you sell so if it's slow you get next to nothing
good,"Pretty good typical morning working on the deck unloading the truck. I learn that at times it was a every man for themselves type situation but will help when need too. Management was horrible wasn't really doing his job, pretty lazy. Co- workers were pretty helpful with getting the job done. Trying to meet the time for unloading the truck with 5 people organizating and 1 people unloading 600 to 800 heavy piece of equipment. Break time and going home."
good,"A typical day at work will involve fast paced work. Costumer service, maintaining a neat appearance of floor merchandise. Meeting a goal of opening store credit cards and rewards cards for costumers to encourage them to save money while shopping. Management was encouraging and always made sure employees remained motivated. Coworkers like to work together as a team. The hardest part of the job was when we weren't able to reach out goal of opening credit cards by the end of the day. The most enjoyable part of the job was that it kept me motivated to make more money, the more credit cards we have costumers open we get a commission."
good,"Sears was a good place to start as my first job. It taught me time management, organization skills, the importance of team work, and costumer service."
good,"Typical paper route really, a van would drop off lage amounts of Sears catalogs with directed addresses to deliver to. A great workout no matter what hours taken in a day."
good,I learn that each company has different requirements as a job such as signing customers up for sears card this was the hardest part of the because I was not inform about this in the job description or  wasn't taught properly on how to sign customers up
good,"too many sales people for the amount of traffic management needs to be present on the floor.can make good money on old pay system"
good,"o	Lead for 3 member team."
good,"Working at Sears was actually a great place to work, The incentives were great for credit apps and other compensation sales. However, the pay wasn't great and hours were limited. However, I did score a full time position Tuesday-Saturday, Unfortunately, the pay wasn't great enough to support a family."
good,"When I first started the business was running well, the crew was fun and easy to work with, and sales were through the roof! In a matter of a year we lost both our store and assistant mangers, the head mechanic, and was moved to a new district with a new district manger. This was about when things went south, new DM made no effort to fill our ranks and constantly criticized our failure to meet sales goals. Only had 2 salesmen and 3 mechanics so had to work 6 days a week making our own schedules as we went. Constantly had to contact Sears store manger for authorization for supply orders and sales overrides. Would have never left if old crew was still intact. They taught me everything I needed to know, I learned a lot about the auto industry and made going to work fun and very lucrative. Was making $1000 every two weeks which wasn't bad for an 18 year old!"
good,I enjoyed working with customers. I enjoyed helping others. I learned about customer service. I loved going to work everyday.
good,"This was my first job so you can imagine how i felt, didnt know the first part of having a job. but after a day or two i had the thing in the bag."
good,"Lots of work, they are always listening to your calls, and are always adding new work orders. But did learn how to interact with other people in a friendly manner. The management was understanding and whiling to help."
good,the job is very stressful and demands a lot of you with the credit and shop your way but overall if you have your co workers to help you out and make time go by faster the job isn't so bad.
good,El ambientes entre compañeros es buena por que contantemente nos proporcionan cursos de superacion personal y de trabajo
good,"very metric driven company is very hard to get promoted within. I learned to be very patient person working at Sears. Some management are horrible and do not know anything but some are very nice. Co-workers are great made the days go by quick. Hardest part of the job is getting people to be motivated at the store because moral is very low. Was working with the people there, many have the heart of gold."
good,Enjoyed the people at the store. When given the freedom to do the job my team clicked. Store manager was one of the best people to work with and a great business partner.
good,I worked as a cashier but it was way more to my job description then just ringing people out to be only be being paid a minimum wage of $7.25 a hour.
good,"The typical day at work consists of dealing with customers by finding the right appliances for their needs. It is interesting to see how everyone deals with the buying process differently. I've never had a commission job before therefore this was a new experience for me. I knew nothing about the appliance business but got the hang of it as soon as I began training. In the first month of commission, I sold over $100,000 in appliances, making me the highest selling associate in the department. I did really well for myself and I enjoyed the competition. The fact that the company is somewhat going down the hill has had me job searching and looking to start off my accounting career. I knew this wasn't going to be a full-time job for me but the fact that Sears is making shopping online that much easier, puts everyone's job in jeopardy. They offer better incentives when a customer purchases online. Also, they started cutting commission on several items to increase corporate profits. I would like to work for a company which is growing instead of failing. I do appreciate some of my co-workers and my assistant store manager. It's a great part-time job but one certainly can't make a career out of it."
good,"A typical day at work as a beauty advisor would be sitting down our clients in our makeup chairs, giving them makeovers as we guide them through the process and teach them fast and easy techniques. Beauty advisors are also required to recruit clients from different departments and introduce them to our products all while keeping in mind what they would like to enhance in their complexion. Most importantly, a typical day at work would be to sell and reach your daily goals. At the end of the day, closing cash and cleaning your surroundings is necessary to complete your shift. "
good,"Great first tech job. Learned some new skills and progressed in my technical abilities. During slow times, work can get very stale with many techs waiting around for cars to service. This was bummer since you make most of your money on flat rate. The hourly pay is very low, so you need to stay busy to make good money."
good,"I was trained in different departments of the company. I enjoyed that my job was never boring. We had lots of customer service training and updating our skills. Training was always very enjoyable. My day consisted of taking a variety of different kinds of calls, scheduling repair service, escalations, problem solving, taking recall repairs or replacement of parts from the Consumer Product Safety Commission.I sold service contracts to customers who had no coverage for a repair. I enjoyed working with my co-workers. Everyone got along with each other. We all tried to help each other if we needed a question answered or needed some help. The team managers wanted their teams to be close, so we had potlucks, little get togethers, we had team meetings. What was fun we would have them outside on a nice day. Management was always doing something fun to make our day enjoyable. "
good,"Typical day would be going in and checking on stock, assist customers and sometimes i would also put aside stock for customers and phone and let them know they had a specific time period to pick it up. Being able to work with the associate who trained me. Hardest part of the job was not enough hours to work with. Most enjoyable moment is being able to assist the customers with what they were searching for and seeing the smile on their face that they had found what they had been searching for."
good,"management was both good and bad. Managers kowledge was first rate, but huis leadership and controlling employees was terrible. Employees were great except for one who was dishonest and the manager would do nothing about it. At the end there was a poor attitude of all the employees due to the cut-backs."
good,"Daily routine included updating merchandise prices and inventory counts, ensure accurate account of delivery via manifest and organizing of store merchandise. Occasionally work as sales representative and merchandise pick-up unit. Acted as ""Lead"" Pricing Associate. "
good,"It wasn't really a fun job and I probably wont ever work there again, they gave me hours but too boring of a job. Very slowed past and wasn't very exciting."
good,"El salario e lo que cabe en bueno, danprestaciones y seguroo, vales de despensa, pero lo queno me gusto e que avia que llenar solicitudes de tarjetas"
good,"sears is a large retailer and there is no one looking over your shoulder, they trust you to get your work done. It can be a fun place to work, but there have been no raises or incentives for their employees in recent years,which is very discouraging."
good,"I am constantly busy with tasks, which I enjoy.  We are currently under staffed which can make for a long and busy day.  Management staff is doing a great job with the staff we have."
good,Good Work Environment. Just want to start new. Seeking better opportunities. Love my coworkers. Teamwork. Enjoy out many potlucks.
good,Sears is a good place to work for but when you are not selling at least 10 sears credit cards to customers per week you will not get the hours you want.
good,"Sears had a great team and my boss was very nice and helpful.  However, the store was really going down in business and hours were difficult to come by as a cashier and were very sporadic.  I dealt with cashier transactions and customer service involving selling credit cards.  I would open the registers and close and balance out the registers daily.  I cashiered in the following departments: hardware, fitness, men's and women's clothing, kids, and home fashions.  I love handling money and communicating with customers."
good,"It is a great job, but they really need to get a new set of management in there that cares about their employees. The job was to unload trucks and stock shelves, also help with customer issues which was all easy, but the definitely needs new staff that actually would help their employees with some stressful situations. Also, even if you work your hardest day in and day out, they will not give you a raise and I was going on my third year."
good,"The work environment was always great. The job was easy however made stressful. Weekly you would have the District Manager come in and you always had to change something to his liking. If I work in a store for 22 days out of the month and you visit for 4 days out of the month, you would think I know my customers and what they like. I liked the old Kmart  where you had to think outside the box and do your own merchandising. Things changed drastically and so did the people."
good,"Typical day included greeting members, sanitizing work area, creating a fun work environment, remaining cheerful in difficult situations, assisting members in anyway necessary, organizing merchandise and others. I have learned to put the customers first always."
good,"The employment environment is a good one. The employees hired are kind and lovely to both their fellow associates and to customers. The only real issue is that the all workers at my store who aren't management are working for minimum wage. This is true even if the employee is full time and has been employed at the store for years and years. Overall it's not a difficult job, but perhaps may not be one you would want to make plans to stay in for an extensive time. It's probably better as a second job or for perhaps high school and college students looking to make a little extra money."
good,"I only worked for about a month, because of seasonal employment.  I do not wanna go to far into the work environment there because I was not there long enough to truly rate it."
good,"Worked with the public, which I enjoy. I was able to expand my knowledge of cars and truck way beyond what it was when I was hired. Co-workers were great, everyone helped each other. Management was fare and consistent. It was a great place to work until business started to fall off.  My wave of layoffs was the third and included seven of us."
good,working at sears i was more people friendly and managed more things i enjoyed the workers around me they helped with a lot of when i got there.
good,"The day starts with getting to the warehouse, loading up the delivery truck with appliances that are scheduled to be delivered that day. Removal and set up of new and old appliances and providing excellent customer service"
good,"Good company to work for part time.  They will work around your schedule especially if you're in school.  Time flies because I am so busy with making sure that the inventory gets out on the floor, and that everything is kept indecency and order."
good,"•	Provide financial variance analysis and reporting around operating profit and expenses for over $200 Million in budgets."
good,"Overall this job was pretty decent. Management was wonderful, well experienced. Co-workers were also good people, hard working, very driven."
good,Cashier work. Learned about retail. The management was bad due to the pressure to get more credit. co-workers were fun to work with. Hardest part of the job was getting more credit.
good,"I start my day off by checking the returns in PMT area.I test everything to make sure if its able to be fixed to re sale.I learned all of the backroom duties and even some sales floor duties.They had gave me the Lead position to run the backroom.I only had the position for a month before I was told to either get written up or step down.Keep in mind this store was already a mess before I transfered to it.The person that took Lead position,i guess feared that I would take it over again,because he keep giving me write ups for every little thing,when the rest of his team was doing worse. My co workers were great some would help while others would just slack off.The hardest part of my job was dealing with my lead before I left.The most Enjoyable part of my job was when i was when i started up to the point they transferred all the managers from a closing store.I did love the fact that I was able to do my job,I had my own office and it was neat and clean."
good,"You won't be worked to death, and you get what you ask for. Minimum wage unless you get management, and they usually don't promote at all."
good,I help customers with jewelry purchases. Assist customer with P.O.S transactions as well as online orders. Process cash and debit/credit card payments. The co workers that were in the surrounding area were funny and very helpful when needed. The managers were ok as well.
good,My coworkers in the backroom is like my family.  We go through a lot but we are there for each other. We get together and often do our own luncheon just a little something to take the stress away. The hardest part of the job is when we get two trucks on the same day and we have very little hours to perform our job effectively.
good,"I work at this job currently. I'm a sales associate and my pay is mostly based off of commission wit ha base pay. My paycheck depends on if people are buying on any particular day. The store can be packed sometimes, and other times there is not a soul in there. My sales associates are great but I am not a fan of the management here. They are clueless as to the true problems Sears suffers and unaware of employee concerns. They seem like they have good intentions but at the same time they are completely out of touch with reality."
good,Handling online purchases and delivering to customers vehicle when they came to pick it up.
good,"Sears as a brand is great but the senior management will not fully commit to anything other than hardlines."
good,"I would come in and check the section I was in, check bath schedule. I would then check on each patient and make sure they didn't need anything. Then I would bath my residents. Get the other residents ready for dinner. Make sure that they were clean and dry. Then I would Help assist in the dining room. Get my residents back to their rooms and get them ready for bed. I would do my ADL books. Check my resident one last time take out the trash clean up and give a report to the next can that came in."
good,"A typical day at work involved creating product displays during liquidation at one of the corporation's key locations. I learned how to work under pressure to perform basic tasks such as folding clothing and assisting customers. Management was strict and pressured to ensure that employees performed, but lacked communication with employees. I was trained under another employee without supervision and was not taught all fundamental aspects of the job. The hardest part of the job was being on my feet for over 8 hours a day. The most enjoyable part was seeing the difference I was making in the store each day."
good,"My typical day was working in Jewely, being manager on duty, I would close the store.  Had to check in money bags at end of night.  I enjoyed all my  co-workers."
good,For a first job the pay and benefits were very good.  Job demands of physical work that keeps you moving. Learned a lot from it being my first job.  I would recommend it.
good,"I loved working there but they would cut my hours to one day a week and I was employed part time and promised at least 20 hours a week. They cut me down to 4 a week. With the pay, it was not worth staying. Some managers are better than the others. There is a lot expected out of you with little pay. Coworkers made the job more enjoyable."
good,"Good place to work, nice people. Company is doing poorly financially"
good,"Typical day would be auditing Merchandise pick up and catching shoplifters. Learned how to deal with a lot of different personalities and verbal judo. Management was great, I can count on them for anything. The hardest part about Loss Prevention is seeing the same kids not learning their lesson. The most enjoyable part is detaining shoplifters and writing out the police reports."
good,Great people that work hard. Daily Sales meetings. Good management that want to do best for the company. Old systems that were hard to understand. Love taking care of customers and finding the best things for them.
good,Did not like the position.  I did not enjoy retail work.  Seasonal position
good,"A typical day at work would be opening the warehouse and receiving office. Usually there are 5 to 6 members waiting outside to pick up merchandise as soon as the office warehouse opens. You are busy all day stocking, unloading freight trucks, or taking out customer orders. I learned to work under heavy pressure in Sears. You have a total of 5 minutes to find a customer order and deliver it. If not done on time you must give a coupon to the member and these numbers reflect poorly on each employees stats. Dealing with management was the most difficult part of this job because it requires backroom associates to call managers to open the electronics lockup. Some would be busy and others would not like to go back to the warehouse so they would take a long time to open the lockup causing the associates to go over their 5 minute limit. Co-workers were friendly and helpful and that made the job enjoyable."
good,The Tires center used to be very busy until the horrible day of 9/11.  Management were easy to get along with.  Its a high rate employment turn-over because its like a stepping stone for people that want to move to a full service station.  The best part of the job is to see smile on customers leaving happy when they leave and come back asking for you because you treat them right the first time.
good,beaucoup trop de meeting pour promouvoir la carte de credit sears
good,"Got me threw college, but a lack of communication and education flows threw Sears"
good,"my daily job is assist customer with their need and make them happy before leaving the store. When I saw customer is so happy with the service I gave, it makes my day so good. I am always working as a team with my co- workers."
good,"I have a lot of resposibility, which I like. My day consists of several diffirent things. There is always something to do. My favorite is merchandising and putting up the Christmas shop."
good,Des gens ayant le sourire  et toujours prêt à aider son collaborateur.  Les gens sont facile d'approche et l'entraide devient plus facile.  Ce qui rend la journée de travail beaucoup plus agréable.
good,"Offices are very impressive, but too far from the city if you want a downtown life. Very nice people & good benefits."
good,"On any regular day working at Sears is great. It was a great environment, and the people I worked with were pleasant. Additionally, I felt that I was paid very well for the amount of work I had to do. However, whenever a problem would arise it was always from third party vendors that did business with Sears. This would be things such as installation, or delivery, and half of the time the associates and even managers had little to no power in fixing the issue."
good,My job is mainly about customer service. Making people feel comfortable about the clothes they are buying and assisting them in finding the right apparel is my main focus. So far I've learned a lot about womens ware. My manager has been very helpful in my education of our merchandise  and very supportive of me overall. All of my co-workers are fun to be around and we make our work environment a fun place to be.
good,Plenty of room to advance in the company but the managers sometimes bring down moral
good,"During a typical day of work, everyday wasn't the same. Each team member was in a different location throughout the day. As a picker, the goal is to pick accurately. I would read off tickets to pick the correct item off a shelf or pallet to place in boxes. The job is strictly team work. I learned that communication is very important because the person who needed the ticket after me needed to know what I picked. As a team member we all had to be organized and clean up as the day went on. Sears management always had a plan for things. We had general meetings once a month and discussed many useful topics. The hardest part about working here was that it was never a set schedule and very unsure what kind of hours the employers would receive. On the bright side the best part about the day was that it was always a fun job."
good,"I am very grateful with Sears Holdings due to the doors it has opened for me and for many of my peers. There are plenty of opportunities for everyone as long as you put in the work."
good,"When I started the company had a well established culture, however, that all changed when they were bought out by K-Mart.  The quality of service and the merchandise presentation went down considerably.  I had hoped for so much working with a reputable company but was disappointed with how far down the company has fallen."
good,"Kohls Over hires, so even if youve worked there for 6 months, once seasonal hires come around, they dont know when to stop hiring. Your hours get drastically cut back. GREAT coworks and management."
good,"Sears is a place the doesn't alway value its employees. They wouldn't give you very much time off and you work just abut every holiday, I guess  that's retail.  Managment wasn't very good and the pay wasn't the best either. It's a good job to start at but don't plan on making a career there."
good,"its okay here to work. i love to work on cars so that's the plus. i hate the pay. i like that fact that they pay both commission and hourly but if no cars are coming in there no money really involved. people who does come in are older people which is good because you can learn a little from them as you work on there cars. I've been working here for over 6 years and they have times as a company where you want to pack and run but sometimes they want to make you stay is a gallon of coolant (50/50) when it comes to this company. they do want to education you if your not educated. moving up in this company is a no no unless you moving from tech one threw master mechanic but as far as a manager you won""t"
good,not enough hours and the pay is not suitable for what you are doing threw out the day
good,A typical work day involved answering phone calls and assisting customers with placing orders fro parts. Everyday i learned different ways to solve problems with customers. Management was helpful and encouraging at times but more often they were non-existed. Working with the people around me was fun and made work enjoyable.

good,"This was an amazing place to work, and if they did not under pay, I would still be there."
good,"A typical day includes checking email followed by a team meeting going over what you are currently working on each day.  I learned how to work in a corporate environment. Very inexperienced manager, in first position in workforce.  I really enjoy my co-workers, all very hard working and collaborate well together. I enjoy the flexibility of working remotely every other week, rather than commuting up to 3.5 hours each work day!"
good,"This is good company based on culture. It mean working style with US people. People can learn lot."
good,"If you are looking for a job, and you seriously need cash, like I did when I first started, then I wouldn't pass it up. When accepting this job, if you don't have thick skin, don't bother. Be prepared to get suffocated with quotas and goals. You have to go above and beyond, considering that you will more than likely be getting paid minimum wage, which is nowhere near enough for the responsibilities you will have."
good,"Sears is a very nice company to work , it's work culture is very good , transport facility , cafeteria are very good maintained. You will get a very healthy environment to work here. Also People are very co-operative here."
good,I did not really enjoy this job as much as I would have liked to. Considering it was my first retail job I assumed it would be easy and not strenuous. I got along well with my co workers however not much with managers due to lack of communication as the store was very large and had a number of managers. The most difficult part of the job was adjusting to the change rooms. The most enjoyable part of the job were short hours.
good,"I was able to learn a lot about the retail environment, and what it entails.  I found that I greatly enjoyed dealing with customers and serving their needs."
good,"working in different departments, cash register transactions, promoting the credit card. Got along well with management and co-workers. Enjoyed the close location to my home."
good,"Working at sears automotive you gain knowledge about cars and learn how to sell services and products. The job is very high pace, customers are always in the building. You learn how to work with others, and learn create better communication skills."
good,"A typical day at Sears is fun, motivating, and inspiring among coworkers. A usual day consist of speaking with customers and resolving their problems whether in my ability or me reaching to my manager."
good,"25-40 hours per week"
good,"A typical day at Sears is chaotic! One must be able to jump between tasks and be  flexible in their time management to adjust to changing priorities and deadlines.  One moment I could be working on in-store marketing communication and the next be told flyers are due in one day instead of the week you thought you had or forecast for direct import team deadline would change. "
good,I liked the job the only thing was they didn't pay much but other than that managers were nice and friendly and so were co-workers.
good,hardest part of the job was finding things in the stock room. coworkers were friendly and welcoming. learned great retail/customer interaction skills.
good,"Managers expected to be  on the floor working with associates , answering pages  to assist at all Cash desks , responding to Duty Manager calls both in-store and outside customer  calls ,  carrying Department phones , in addition , to daily paperwork .Work load at times too heavy ,   Manager and co -workers were very supportive of each other in the store in which  I worked  . "
good,Sales sales sales know your product and you can make good commission....dont keep up with sales and U are fired.
good,"Honestly I've learned a lot during my days at Sears. Colleagues are nice and kind. Projects are decent and worth my time. But the management of this place is a joke. It's usually the case when they ask for a meeting on Monday, but it ended up on Wednesday. The facility here is not that good either. Wifi constantly lost connection and they are still using Win XP."
good,I learned how to maintain how to control office evoriment i worked hands on with a Human resource manager which I went back to school to get my DEGREE
good,Work closely with cashiers in ensuring that the proper stocking and pricing for inventory to resolve pricing discrepancies involving our purchase while verifying proper product rotations.
good,"Sears holdings was a great company to work for. this was busy work i must say! I was taking alot of phone calls, but if you like helping people then this is the place for you. My manager was a constant source of knowlege and help me in any way that i needed."
good,"High pace job, requires to get credit cards for the store, and not so good with being evening out hours. I had really friendly co-worker and I had an awesome managers. I disliked get credits the most, that was not the hardest part but the part I disliked the most. I liked being around my co-workers the most and interacting with the customers."
good,"A typical day at worked consisted of many duties that included networking with potential clients, closings sales, conflict management, customer service, and potential training opportunities. I learned many things from participating in this business. I learned to be able to communicate with many different types of people. Working in a retail market can be quite interesting sometimes. Some people come in very friendly and ready to be consulted on a purchase, whereas others coming in very unfriendly or not very forth coming; I learned how to penetrate those stonewalls and exceed sales goals and generate business growth. I also learned how to keep my cool and succeed in a fast paced goal oriented sales atmosphere. I have seen many sales team memebers come and go because they could handle working on a goal based pay structure; I however have adapted to this type of workplace, and actually strive on it. This position also taught me many lessons in time management and how to make your time work for yourself. I am able to complete tasks efficiently without direction or order from management. I prefer to get the work done before it becomes work to be assigned. Staying a step ahead of these duties allows me to have more time to track leads and network with clients. Management was very poor in my workplace. They were mostly just unexperienced and merely just moved up the chain at our location over the years. This management staffed lacked the motivation I would have liked to see in a metric driven sales setting, because the management staff was not very strict and sales driven; I believe"
good,"The store it self was well run, and I had a great manager who was receptive to thoughts and input.  However with the smaller pay and the company struggling and closing many stores, as well as an inconsistent regional and district management structure (three DMs and two RMs in a matter of months), I am unable to rate the company as a whole very well."
good,"restructuration apres 29 ans de service"
good,"Great company and awesome coworkers. Work long days, holidays and weekends. The hardest part of a commission based job is never knowing how much money you are going to make."
good,"Greeting customers to ensure safety on the road. This may include inspection of tires.  Tire recommendations.  Light and battery evaluations,etc."
good,"get into work punch in go straight into the warehouse and start setting up the main floor for checking in delivery tems. Then go to the back where the bailer is and finish all the trash that's was from the night before that wasn't finished. Take lunch, come back and get ready to check in 16 teams with merchandise that's coming back, exchanges, damages, store pieces, haulaways, reschedules and ect. At the same time try to replenish totes that have parts for the teams. All of this is done inside a very small warehouse while supervising everyone on the dock, about 35 people who do not listen easily. When its time to leave clean up the dock area for third shift and punch out."
good,"Starting with Sears I was very open because I knew I had to sale credit but I already had the customer service and retail experience. A normal day at work, I am usually in one department at the cashier register for my entire shift. I take calls that come to that department,  i check all of my customers out and also sale credit at the register. Also, at Sears we have an rewards program so I ask each customer for their telephone or email to see if they are in our program if not I sign them up. At Sears I have learned different techniques to sale credit and also get people to join our in store rewards program which can help me anywhere I plan to go because a lot of companies now have reward programs for the consumers. Co-workers are very friendly, we are like a big family; our Sears family. The hardest part of working at Sears is making sure you keep your metrics where they are suppose to be because we are judged on how many people with check out that has our rewards program, gets signed up, or that does not have it nor signs up and also we are judged on how much  credit we get. The most enjoyable part is the customers I love retail and love coming in contact with a high volume of people."
good,"This job was ok. For the most part I spent my time ringing customers. The only thing about working there was in order to maintain my job I had to push credit cards. This could be challenging from time to time. It required me to not care about the customer I was dealing with, only my own personal gain. The only good thing is I earned commission for each card I sold. Furthermore, I was the best card seller in the store, which gained me a lot of attention from management and hours. Sometimes I would help open or close the store depending on my schedule. In either situation, it was my duty to count my drawers to ensure I had enough cash for the customers. During those shifts I would also have to make change for the money in my drawers. This gave me plenty of experience dealing with cash including ringing for the customers. Sometimes, we would have sales where everything was ridiculously cheap. On those days the lines are non-stop which can be challenging. Especially when each person has multiple baskets filled to the brim with stuff. People become very impatient and verbal under these situations. Especially if I'm able to sell a credit card. That only prolongs the wait of the other people in line. Keeping the other people in line calm and patient took a lot of coaxing."
good,Sears is a place where you will never get bored. Opportunity await   to learn all areas of the company.
good,"Only a seasonal position, handled all the merchandising and ad set ups for the Electronic department."
good,Co-workers in my department are very friendly. Managers are very disorganized and lazy. It's hard when a customer wants to speak to a manager and you have to page them ten times just for them to come.
good,Overall good company.Have good work culture and work life balance.You can do even work from home if you don't wanna do work from office.
good,"I have worked in the same conpañía for 20 years. "
good,"No OT allowed, un-valued & under payed."
good,"This position is an ongoing change of events each and every morning. There is never a day that is identical to the other days. This fast pace, motivated company keeps me on my toes all week long."
good,Days weren't to stressful. Management really doesn't know what they are doing and they just spew out whatever corporate tells them to. If you can let things in one ear and out the other you will probably be able to stand working here but if you can't take peoples lack of knowledge... good luck.
good,"High pressure sale enviornment. The main thing I had to do was customer service, You have to hit your sales numbers. On frieght day you have to stock the shelves when not helping customers, Sometimes you help rearrange displays. I found a huge lack of communication from management to employees, I also found alot of the requirements placed my the managers were not achievable based on the amount of new business coming into the store."
good,help co workers unload trucks organize all product delevired daily.
good,i learned alot at this job. the job was a nice place to work at before they shut down
good,"You normally go in and cashier and then go and pick up clothes. You open packages and take out clothes and put them on the sales floor. The managers are nice, my manager was awesome and she taught me everything i needed to know. Co-workers where normally nice and understanding and the hardest part was getting people to apply for credit cards. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to take out the shippment because it keeps me busy."
good,I became a supervisor in less than one yer with hard work and determination. A few months after recievedanother promotion to visual merchandiser and was able to attend an event during NY Fashion Week.
good,"A typical day at work would have to be helping the customer getting what they want. I learned that the store doesn't carry enough plus size clothes that many people are looking for. I also learned teamwork is very important in this field."
good,Was not the best work place. Did not focus on employee satisfaction.
good,"I supported the company in a 24/7 enviroment. I worked on new projects or necessary changes and did quite a bit of documentation and some teaching. I learned much about the business and technology."
good,"A Typical day at work was simple. Go to the job get into position balance your register and go. I learned a lot about cash register operation. Management was amazing, the Cashier manager personally cared for everyone and made sure we were all treated well enough. My coworkers were a decent and interesting bunch. The hardest part of the job was Credit sales, this is what honestly soured my opinion of the place, there was such a focus and pressure about such sales that it ruined the environment entirely. The most enjoyable part was the customers"
good,"Sears was enjoyable. I loved the customer service part of it, and helping others find things and save money. I disliked the fact that selling Sears Credit cards was so heavily pushed upon customers. My co-workers were friendly and helpful and management was attentive at times. The hardest part of the job was signing members up for store credit. The most enjoyable part was meeting members needs and interacting with them and making them happy."
good,I covered all aspects of the store so there really was no typical day.  The most enjoyable part was solving a problem so that the customer was happy.
good,"While Sears is a pretty easy-going company, it is sad that it does not get as much attention as it should. They focus more on drawing customers back to get more money rather than focusing on just bringing new customers in. The American-made side of this company should NEVER fail as it is the greatest part of the company. In fact, I think the company would make much more out of selling Craftsman only. Also, I worked here for 3 years, never once did I get a raise. I only made minimum wage."
good,"My typical day at work was to provide fast, friendly customer service, which included: ringing up customer, bagging items, and pitching credit all in a short period of time. At the beginning and end of the days we had to count the drawers as well. "
good,"Strenious work place, no proper management training, coworkers were easy to work with."
good," I would prefer to speak with someone directly to answer any questions they may have regarding the ins and outs of the job. "
good,"In this position I am always engaged with members and I try to provide a perfect customer experience for them. That requires me to be knowledgeable about my department to provide customers with adequate information. I work in the jewelry department and this has been an interesting experience so far since I need to interact with customers every moment and try to increase our sale and of course customer satisfaction. That is the fun part of my job because I am a sociable person and this job brings this opportunity for me to engage with people all the time. "
good,"The Store would often be busy for a short while, but there was always plenty to clean/fix around the store, so we were always busy. "
good,"8-4:30, Monday through Friday, learned how to manufacture clothes, worked with very interesting people, enjoyed working with people that I still keep in touch with"
good,"I loved my team. The workers at sears were great . The only thing I didn't like was they weren't very organized, I got fired for not meeting some numbers that I didnt even know I had to meet. But besides that I really liked being there"
good,"•	Provided excellent customer service by connecting with customers and finding their needs"
good,I enjoyed the idea of doing something different. Driving a tugger was kind of thrilling but if you are not use to the temperatures in a warehouse you had better prepare yourself. Once you surpass the temperature you'll be just fine.
good,I would go to customers homes and inspect their appliances. I learned how they operate and how to fix some issues. Management was good we talked once a day to ensure everything was going well. The hardest part of the job is to keep the customer happy and confident in your work and their machine. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to meet new people and fix and do check ups on their machines to make them happy.
good,"A typical day at Sears is very busy. I learned to work as a team, have good customer service skills and how to operate a cash register. Management at Sears is great although some things should be worked on as far as managers letting some employees get away with certain things. Most of my co-workers were very friendly while others weren't but I got along with everyone. The hardest part of the job was maintaining credits and shop your way rewards which I personally don't think it should be a major issue. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting and helping customers."
good,"Open or closing, working around a wide variety of people, running a cash register, learning to problem solve, interpreting throughout the store-- I enjoyed working with the co-workers and meeting new ones.  The hardest part was dealing with customers with bad attitudes."
good,"A typically day at work would be organizing the jewelry counters. Assisting customers. Count inventory. Management lacked structure. Some of them showed favoritism with other employees. The hardest part of my job had to be when it was time for our yearly evaluation, knowing that I would not get a raise due the management saying that they are on freeze. The most enjoyable part about my job was helping the customers "
good,Sears used to be a great place to work. When K-Mart merged with Sears the management and work conditions weht down hill fast. I was injured on the job and the company did not want to take care of problem.
good,You are pushed with getting people to sign up for credit cards and rewards programs.
good,"If you work hard, you will get hours. The environment was pretty standard for a department store, and some management seemed grouchy, but overall the experience was pleasant. I guess it depends on how you interact with others."
good,"Great place to learn , co workers were great. Management was ok could have worked better with staff. "
good,"They have a habit of making promises they can not keep. Very unorganized, bad attitudes, and unprofessional. The job itself is enjoyable, and customers are generally great."
good,Manager training seems to be needed when I was there.  Different managers and better skills than others but that is probably the same at other stores.
good,"Fun place to work at, easy to make friends at the call center.  Management is easy going."
good,"I order all hardlines. Hardware everyday and order dept (sporting paint, vacuums etc) on order days a week. Stocking everyday,dusting  and front facing as I do ordering. Planning sales events, clearance out for the weekends. Eat somewhere in there."
good,"- horaire flexible"
good,Being a Manager at Sears provides ample challenges to overcome and requires extensive time management. It also requires long hours.
good,"Fast paced job in which up-selling services is a key aspect to company revenue, and building genuine customer relations is what keeps them coming back."
good,"I have been with Sears for 8 years,started in the Sears department store,than transferred to the customer service department out of the store, I stayed in customer service for 6 years until I was promoted to Team Lead, promoted again to Quality Department in the corporate office for 2 years, got very ill I had to leave."
good,Customers were challenging to deal with as each presented a different problem to fix.  Management was not as accessible as I thought.
good,"My manager was great, she would give me breaks when I needed them and be understanding of time off when I needed it. The workplace however was very depressing with country music and other depressing songs being played on the radio constantly and depressing workmates and customers. Sears also does not value the quality of their product more than they value the price it sells for."
good,"Sear, is a company that is really trying to change its culture by hiring young and bright individuals.  However, ""old habits die hard.""  Many workers have been there for over 15 years and its very hard for them to change their habits."
good,"A typical day at Sears was dealing with many different customers, making sure they are satisfied. I have learned that you have to work hard for what you want, Sears have given me that drive to do so. Management was good, co-workers worked together as they are suppose to and we got what ever task that was given done. The hardest part of the job was keep everything organized throughout the, making sales some days. The most enjoyable part of the job was making each and every customer happy."
good,I learned a lot about the retail business
good,"It was a great work experience, had very good mentors and enjoyed the inclusiveness that we had."
good,"It has some decent benefits like access to health and dental and vision care benefits, legal benefits, paid vacation and paid personaly days"
good,"K Mart in Honesdale is not as busy as its competitors, but this store was a training store and we always had district management and visiting management from other locations. Team work was an essential factor here and management worked right along side staff or crew to get the jobs done. I enjoyed the flexibility of duties. Along with my regular Managerial position, I was able to fill in around the store where we might need a hand. I got to assit the Pharmacist and fill prescriptions, work in all the departments of the store, and manage over nights as an Add manager."
good,The great part of this job was being able to help customers with there needs and seeing them smile an leave with what they came for in one way or the other.
good,"Long Days, Micromanaged Daily was very enjoyable in the automotive department but the regular store could use some help with teamwork."
good,"At the begining of every morning the staff would gather for an informational meeting. Most of the time they would give me a gift card for good customer service. Next, I would go to my register count the money and open my register. While waiting for the store to open I go and clean the area around me. That was done throughout day when business was slow. I always tried to give the best and friendly service to every customer."
good,"A typical day starts at 2 pm and end at 10 pm for me, I learned a lot about customer service, being resourseful, and improved my verbal communication skills"
good,The company was good to work for during college. I would say that working for a large corporations has its highs and lows. The lows would be he hourly wage that was earned. I know a lot of people that work there that would say that they were not being paid what they should have been. The highs were that the people were fun and it was always busy.
good,"A typical day at work is to get our orders from the receivers, and made sure all orders were put in the correct sections of the warehouse by using an RF scanner. What Ive learned was to focus on what your doing without having mistakes."
good,"Wake up early, check my Company Computer to check my routs that I will have for the day. Call my first Customer and let them know a time that I will be at their house to fix their Appliance. inspect the problem and fix or order the part that I need to fix the Appliance. Check warranty on unit. Sell warranty if customer has none. (PA)"
good,"My typical work day at Sears would start at 7:30 am, i would open than count the draws, than put them in the register. And print on daily sale signs, Also check email for sale updates and DM, SM or ASM.. i would also check for the sells plan for the day and run that by the other mangers in the building and also my co-workers. we had a great team of mangers and we all worth very well together. The hardest part if this job was traveling, since i lives in Queens and sears was in long island. i would wake up at 5:30-6:00 am just to make it to work for 7:30. the most enjoyable part of working at sears would be help the customs and the great team that we had..."
good,I would open and close assigned registers. Help customers decide which product would best suit there needs and quickly ring up customers.
good,malheureusement il y a un manque d'heures de travail pour moi
good,"Typical Big box work enviorment, co-worker great , hours good, pay acceptable."
good,"I worked as a retail associate for three departments that included base pay and commission. Management would have us all meet a sales goal daily and made us mention a rewards card for every sale. After all of the ""sales talks"" were done, my work experience was fun yet focused due to the awesome friends/coworkers I made working there. After making friends with everyone there, I excelled as a sales associate and had a blast every shift. I won three seller of the month awards and owed it to the positive vibe and morale I felt on the sales floor. I learned that when in a team, I progress faster and more efficiently than when I work alone."
good,Sears was the best place the work during the holidays. It was very exciting during the Christmas season.
good,"Its a great job, you get to play around to get children to smile and laugh, and use creativity to make the best photos you can for client. My co-workers for the most part are pretty great. The job is great for the most part, but some days it is much too quiet and can make for a long day."
good,sears will stay where its at but can always be changed to be better
good,A typical day at sears would consist of me putting all me belongings in a locker and clocking in. Then i would go to my assigned location where i was need for the day and begin to check out customers.
good,"Tasked with all aspects of coaching, training, and development of between 25 and 42 associates in a call center environment. The hardest part of te day was keeping up with management expectations tha changed frequently. The most enjoyable part of my day was seeing the appreciation of my direct reports when I told them they were doing an awesome job."
good,"The beginning of a regular work day starts off with getting information from my manager on what the days' tasks are. I then begin to check to see if my area is clean and when it is, I must finish the tasks by the end of the day. While performing the tasks, I am also a sales associate for the mattress department."
good,"the employees and management get along great, opportunities to learn the entire restaurant from bartending, cooking, serving, and handling the responsibilities of management.."
good,Sears was a great company to work for. unfortunately the compensation was commission and seasonal.
good,It was a great experience dealing with customers. Knowing there need and ensuring their full satisfaction. Sears tought me very great values in dealing with people especialy when I was on floor clerk. In addition to that I had great time learning the cashier systema and learning how to close the cash to the exact penny. The working environment was good. I was two times employee of the month when we had to prepare for two special events.
good,"- I know that we must move on , but I miss the old 129 IBM machine. Expecially the numbers on the Keybord, they were upside down and I still have that old habit of typing the numbers that way, (I have to practice how to type numbers!)"
good,"Working for sears the short time i worked there was kind of a fun experience. you learn how to deal with customers, and alot of times you get a lot of wierd ones. what i did was i was in charge of merchandising and i took care of the clothing and the fitting rooms in my section which was the men and the boys section. sometimes you are given a task to complete a project for your area, I was fairly new and didnt do my first project well and ignored it thinking someone on another shift would finish what i started. i later learned that you have to finish what you start. At the time i worked there i also blew up on the wrong person , due to some inner issues i was having at the time, resulting in my termination from that job. Looking back i know i could have done better and it wasnt a hard job. it just wasnt the right time for me to have that kind of job."
good,durante mi estadia en la empresa aprendi buenas cosas aserca de las ventas y atencion a clientes
good,It was a great place to get into automotive its very family based.
good,"I was always busy with lots of work everyday. There were a lot of changes the last couple of years such as management, staff, hours, benefits. The hardest part of the job was dealing with all of the changes. The most enjoyable part was knowing what I was able to accomplish on an everyday basis."
good,good job to have. mangement was hard to ger use to but at the end the job is easy.
good,I like interviewing for possible new cashiers.
good,There are numerous work-life benefits that can be used. Flexibility is given in ways of using the gym during the work day or participating in intramural sports after work. There's a very useful open door policy among all senior level executives.
good,Sears Canada paid above average wages with benefits to its employees. The hours could be tough depending on the store you worked at and its Saturday and Sunday hours. the management backed its employees and usually had good communication lines with the floor staff. Unfortunately this could be difficult with the merchandising staff because of the unusual hours they worked.
good,This job was not the best job. Management was horrible. They were unfair. They handled things wrong. Management is why I left. I never want to work in retail again
good,"The price of gas and car maintence ate a large % of your take home pay. It's face to face sales, there is no greater reenforcer of good sales technique. The job is an on call possition, you don't go to work if you do not have a sales call, it's nice to have an oppertuinty to close."

good,My typical day sometimes can be fun with the employees but the best part is dealing with the customers that is what makes my day to help them and see them leave happy.
good,"I worked with nice enjoyable people for the most part. I mainly worked in the childrens department. Kids have always been one of my passions so being around children and seeing their reactions to different clothes they liked was a joy. I learned different clothe lines, whats the best and whats not. Hardest part of the job was dealing with some of the mangers who weren't very friendly at times. My most enjoyable part besides the children was counting money. Just something I've always enjoyed."
good,"A good place to work part-time to get through college. The only way to advance in this company is if ""Daddy"" worked at head office or if you had ""Mommy"" already in managment."

good,"Overall this has been a good company to work for. It is a huge company with a lot of growth potential. They are owned by Luxottica, which is a big player in the optical industry."
good,"Working at Sears provided my ideal first work environment experience. It allowed me to experience a multitude of situations that can help me in the professional working world. A typical day involves regular checks on the fitting, customer returns, and assigned department area. During my shift I maintained my department and tended to any customers that had questions or concerns. While working at Sears I learned how to properly cater to customers in the working world. The management at Sears varied; on a department level, the management was wonderful. My boss was more than accommodating. However, the store manager would not fall in the same category as my boss. Then the coworkers I dealt with is the one aspect of Sears that I will miss most. The people I worked with made the job somewhat enjoyable. The hardest part of the job is being able to fully neaten the department area because the customers seemed to undo whatever was just done by the sales associates. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely the coworkers and being able to interact with them."
good,A very hard job to accomplish what was required especially with the econmy as is.
good,helping customers find what they need. putting up stock and making sale signs and also putting them up as well
good,No opportunity for advancement. Worked there for three years and haven't received a raise. Pay is horrible for the amount of work expected of us.
good,"Enjoyed the job but Dept manager was not always available and didn't provide good direction, wasn't very hands on."
good,Sears is a company of strong integrity. Staff are all so friendly and helpful with customers. Good company values.
good,So many department's to choose from but choose wisely. Some are commission based others commission + salary. Try to get into the electronics department though. Comm + salary and most rewarding if you do well.
good,Great place to work - startup like environment. Very diverse teams from different industry experience
good,"Although it was a great place to start working, it did not offer many growth opportunities. It did offer a work-life balance which is very important to me."
good,"Can't complain, made a lot of money on Black Friday. Management could be better, sales could be better. Benefits weren't terrible."
good,As resolutions representative we would take calls to resolve customer issues with their products and many times it can be an unpleasant experiance as customers can be irrate. Some managers there were very unpleasant and irrate themselves and did not help thier employees cope with the adversity that a high stress job can require. Perseverance was key to do the job.
good,Many changes in work flows. High turnover due to poor results due to economy.
good,"The store is no longer in the mall, and the mall isn’t there either. I was laid off due to the closure. There is no actual review I could give that would benefit future employees."
good,I learn much and enjoyed working with people and getting to know there needs. Sears gave the chance to grow. There was always something new everyday  and learning to over come.
good,"Typical day starts with checking your emails, prioritizing your workflow task through the Salesforce portal. Daily conference calls. Supportive management. Hardest part of the job is not being able to control needed inventory."
good,Nice management  people help out a lot great company.always helpful caring.the company are flexible with the schedule .great benefits as well .please apply
good,it started out as a wonderful company to work for then it started to go downhill. They closed all the memphis locations and they were profitable stores
good,Although people are very nice to work with but store is very empty and it seems very dead place to work. Company gives you vacation hours after 1 years
good,I enjoyed working here until certain things got out of hands with an employee. However it's a great first job a recommend it to anyone who is in high school or who is looking for a part time job.
good,This was my first job so the work place was new but it was fast and crowded a little stressful around Christmas time. I enjoyed the environment overall
good,The work was fairly easy. The staff was great in that they would help you if you needed help. Everyone worked as a team. The pay was just really low. No one was getting above minimum wage even if they had been there 5 years.
good,"After almost 14 year at Sears, the metric stayed the same but the company continued to fail due to increased competition from the internet and specialty stores."
good,"A typical day can be setting up displays, planograms, sales. The hourly pay is bad and the commission is low. There is very little incentive to moving up the ladder in this company. They are cheap with the hours its rarely a full 40 hours.You have to put together most of the display merchandise, this includes exercise equipment, outdoor living tables chairs, lawnmowers, grills etc."
good,It’s an okay company to start in but it’s not for everyone and I didn’t look at it as a long term place and the company is really falling apart day by day
good,"It's retail of apparel, hardware, outdoor, some furniture, small and large appliances, etc. This can be the most fun job in the world.. especially if you enjoy being around people. But then there are other people who just drag you down way, lower than you need to be. Not to mention how dirty and inconsiderate people are. I have been in the fitting rooms on many occasions,where there are 20 plus items just thrown everywhere instead of putting it back on the hanger."
good,I didn't really enjoy my time there mostly because I was bored out of my mind. Barely anyone shops at Sears and there isn't much to do. I highly wish for jobs where people regularly shop and there are things to do.
good,the one apple was an orange there was one to be if you could see for yourself then you wools know that there was no one faster than the lady herself if you could see.
good,"I really enjoyed my time in Sears and it had allowed me my introduction into call center management.  Although the department I was in had since outsourced, it was a relaxed environment and gave me tools to succeed"
good,es un buen lugar para trabajar si no quieres dedicarte mas que a trabajar y sobre metas no hay tanto crecimiento laboral si no eres conocido.
good,My employment at Sears was a temporary / interim job while waiting to enter the Police Academy. I was hired as seasonal work and I left shortly before entering the Police Academy
good,"I was part of a trainee program which was very good."
good,"I loved working for Kmart, and I would probably still be there if the store in our town had not shut down.  I haven't kept up with news regarding Kmart/Sears Holdings, so I don't know if they are even in business anymore."
good,I worked here seasonal I worked in the bed and bath department management was ok hardest part of the job was dealing with a lot of unsatisfied customers and the most enjoyable part of the job was making sure I solved all of the customers problems and sent them home happy.
good,"It was okay,  management needed some work badly and treated us like trash sometimes but we took it and powered on. Honestly it was bad majority of the time but now it's gotten better but not like its gonna make a difference anymore."
good,"Es Un Empleo Como Cualquier Otro, Buen Ambiente De Trabajo, Buen Personal."
good,TYpical warehouse work unpacking boxes and bringing the merchandise to the right area.  Great management that would leave you to your own work. Pretty good holiday celebrations.
good,"Sears was a very interesting place to work in on the mft department. we were dealing with daily deliveries from tractor trailers. Unloading and tagging merchandise. The only bad thing i have to say about the company was the manager of the MFT department was a very sexist man and was very much on a power trip, almost never let you call in sick for anything family emergencies or not. He was full of demands without talking like a team member of the MFT and not a lot of people had good things to say about him."
good,"Sears challenged me every day that I worked there, but never more than I could handle. Never bored, no 2 days alike. I learned a good deal about global sourcing and establishing those overseas partnerships."
good,Great job with many benefits including good management. Sadly its a dying business and my particular store closed its doors during my employment. Although other stores are open I would recommend to avoid a long term career decision in this company for your job is not promised to last.
good,People working there are great! Relaxed atmosphere and positive management. Everyone helps and everyone works in a great team effort to get the job done.
good,"Good job, relatively fair pay but constantly stressed about job status or store open status.  In the last year and a half the company closed all eight locations in the Rochester, NY."
good,the most enjoyable place I have ever worked at .  managers were great and the employees the were there were great also . to bad store closed its doors .
good,"Working at Sears was actually better than I thought it would be. The culture and workers are actually very easy to get along with.  When problems arise, they ALWAYS do so because some idiot at corporate has no idea how to actually run a company (or does and they are killing the company on purpose)."
good,Worked at sears automotive for 2 years. They had classes to go to to further my career as an automotive technician unfortunately the shop was shutdown due to company bankruptcy
good,"Not much to say really, worked part time in the Medicine Hat Branch whilst I was living in Canada.  Enjoyed working here, but not challenging at all.  !"
good,"The store I worked at was NOT a cohesive team.  Two or three of us worked as a team, however upper management did not relay correctly what was happening, nor did the Last Store manager care, he actually knew what was happening and left the store for another position just before liquidation began."
good,Good opportunity to learn. Collaborative work with as many as many as a team of 4-5 members. Quick-paced environment. There is always word to be done. Never boring.
good,"My experience at Sears was definitely a learning experience.  When I started my career there, I worked in the Third Party section, I would make appointments for authorized services to provide maintenance/repair/replace appliances.  Then I was promoted to the Executive Customer Service area, here I would take calls for the executives of Sears.  I also handled BBB complaints, from there I was promoted to One Source.  One Source is the area where I would work directly with store managers and technician managers to resolve customer issues."
good,The management was very nice and the hours are flexible. It's a great place for a first job. I would definitely recommend a young person to start their career here.
good,Everybody knows Sears will be going out of business - probably in the near future.  Many of the decisions made by the CEO and Head Office were poor.  The last manager I worked with there was one of the best I've ever known.  Some of the others were very good or poor.
good,Its great for students. Many people don't like their jobs. Its a sad working environment. Great pay for teens. Equal opportunity employer. Sears was a great first job.
good,SEARS Hoe town stores are a different animal than the big stores in that you got to know your community and you tend to have regulars that make the overall experience nice
good,The work experience is good but the only thing bad were the managers which were lazy and always commanded the employees to do everything. There were a lot of hard working people taken advantage of by the store managers.
good,Enjoyed working at the store. Store management was great but corporate was not. Enjoyed working with customers and coworkers. Flexible scheduling and room for advancement.
good,"It was hard to randomly approach people, many of whom did not want to be approached, to ask them to consider a home improvement project even if they did not own a home or could not afford such service."
good,Its okay they just make you sell credit cards a lot and that’s probably the thing that bugs the employees as much as the customers and also they are big on their Shop Your Way Rewards as well
good,"Poor job security. They have to pay to much to the CO. Office so store employees are poorly paid, over worked and they still close stores left and right. I went through three stores which two closed. The third one was going through the same transition as the first two so I hade to get out and find something more secure"
good,"great company long hours, when I was first hired it seemed like a very family oriented company and which it was great people and management to help with whatever you need and guide you."
good,"Buen ambiente para laborar, lástima de gerentes con poca empatía por el trabajador, los horarios son desgastantes, no hay cupo para la vida social."
good,"I was just part time but did full time participation. Could have had more time to rest after inventories. No Take a minute to review Sears."
good,"Sears Canada was an amazing place to work, especially the HR Operations area as the teamwork was amazing. Even when the company was failing, people went above and beyond maintaining service levels to all associates."
good,"There are endless possibilities with working for this company as it is a 100% commission based position. Everything is measured on integrity, commitment, and your ability to properly assess the homeowners needs which may lead to a sale. Was offered top notch training that prepared me for customer interaction in the home and everything was based on the 10-step sales model that the bridge to making a sale depending on how well you go through each step and that particular customer. Management was a pleasure to work with and I always looked forward to weekly sales meeting to see all my fellow sales associates as they were a pleasure to work with as well. Even though, we were competing among each other it still felt like we were all family. On the flip side, what is challenging about being a SPC is that there is a lot of travel time that will put a ton of wear & tear on your vehicle which you are no where near fully reimbursed for and again I must say emphatically that this is a 100% commission based position so it is important to make every lead count although in some cases it is not always easy. Appointments are not always confirmed by the appointment center so I have gone to a lot of customer reset(No shows by customers) or the appointment center has to meet a quota so they are not too concerned about the travel time and inconvenience of the Sales person where as they give the customer misleading information over the phone just to set the appointment. Also, it is hard to balance you personal life with work as this position required me to work Monday-Saturdays and it is always"
good,"There was one manager that would be really rude to customers sometimes and would ask me to do things outside of my job description, sometimes for my entire shift."
good,Sears has been a great place to work but has closed the local stores.
good,The work isn't hard. They provide decent work hours. There's a good team work atmosphere. They give great employee discounts. Some what laid back at times.
good,"Sears had an excellent working environment. Manager, supervisors, and coworkers were all supportive and helpful to one another. Most work days were slow-paced and relaxed, even when there were a ton of tasks to be done."
good,"Horarios muy extensos, sueldo y comisiones bajos esquemas de incentivos poco claro y baja afluencia de clientes en el área asignada ( ferretería)"
good,"La cultura de serás super bien organizados , los jefes muy atentos en todo momento hay mucho compañerismo y eso es muy bueno tanto por que uno trabaja con más gusto"
good,I enjoy working with multiple people to get the job done. I got along with everyone of my coworkers. I mainly enjoyed moving around throughout the warehouse and loading the trucks with merchandise.
good,Sears is a corporation style business focused more on profit than employee well being.  Sears has since sold most of its rights and closed most of its stores.
good,"Overall it was not a bad job, not the best but good enough to start and get back on your feet if you need a job. Sometimes it could get a little chaotic with a bunch of customers in the store but you just got to remain calm and you will make it to through the day."
good,Employees are allowed to work from home when needed.  They treated you like responsible adults and did not micromanage your daily assignments. Many amenities onsite.
good,"I loved working at Sears.  Great team, good caring management, supportive co-workers, flexible shifts. But it was so long ago that I do not think my opinion can help this days."
good,"Worked a 4 hr. shift, rest of my time I would measure peoples homes. I learned everything you need to know about flooring and installation. Management for me wasn't at store level, my Manager worked for the district. Work place culture was teamwork. The hardest part of the job was following through to installation and making sure everything went well with installation. Also, making sure the customer was happy and satisfied. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to control the hours of my day. Getting leads spending 4 hours in the store and the rest of my day was scheduling for measurements. It was like having my own business and I loved the independence!"
good,I liked working here because I was learning a lot about optics which I thought that was the career path I was going to take at the time. I needed more hours though so I had to move on.
good,"A typical day at Sears in the shoe department was just making sure the shoe department looked cleaned and organized and at the same time helping customers find shoes they were looking for. I learned most of my customer service experience here and how to help customers to the best of my abilities and make sure they left the store happy. Management was very nice and they would always hear me out if I ever had a problem. My manager was very cool and understanding. The workplace culture was very fun, my co workers were great and we had a lot of good times. The hardest part of the job was some times there would just be too much to do at one time and we couldn't always get everything done in one day. The most enjoyable part of work was definitely my co workers. They made everyday a blast. Overall I really enjoyed my time at Sears."
good,"The work experience was just okay. We had to do credit card applications just to get hours on the schedule. I remember I only completed two applications in one day and the next week schedule, I was only scheduled for two days. The pay wasn't enough to live off of."
good,"Sears was a relaxed environment. But also competitive because it is a commission based job. I enjoyed my time at Sears. However, the pay was not enough to sustain my needs so I was forced to go elsewhere."
good,"Good place to worka long time ago. Now they're takin grasping at straws. Disorganized. Change their mission too often. Employee discounts are only 10%, which is terrible."
good,"It was an ok job. It started off going well but ended badly. It took them forever to order my special chair for my back. Also, they didn't want to accommodate to my school schedule like they said they would."
good,Not much would go on in the store. It was a quiet place most of the day and was only busy on the weekends or few days before the holidays. The rest of the day would be slow and steady.
good,"La jornada laboral es larga."
good,"This was my first job out of high school, and was overall a great experience.  Everyone was friendly and worked as a team.  There were always people available to teach you skills and to encourage you.  After being there for 8 years, I found out how hard it was to advance into management.  I loved the staffs in all departments and it felt very much like a family."
good,They made us (managers) buy these gift cards with our own money so we could meet the gift card sales requirement.  Had to work to many weekends and holidays.  I preferred the Home services end of Sears over the Retail
good,"Management needed more work on communicative skills .I asked a manager if i was sick, who would i call , She told me to just call the store number but nobody answers the store number."
good,"it was usually good, hardest parts, was standing outside during rain and snow, management was really good. made sure all outside workers were prepared an doing good."
good,mon environnement de travail etait tres calme et instructive
good,"Very nice and hard working Manager, he always jumped in to help if needed. Hardest part of job was not enough help to complete task a lot of the time, making it stressful. Most enjoyable part was time to enjoy talking with fellow associates and helping them if they had a need."
good,Todo estaría muy bien si manejaran horarios corridos y con un poco mas de sueldo.
good,"Working at Sears was a family.The staff worked together to make every shopping experience wonderful for our customers.That was always number one, looking after the customers."
good,"A great environment to work, however, the salary was not competitive. Most employees at the time were eager to find other employment due to low pay. However, it was a nice environment."
good,I worked here as a summer job two summers in a row. It is a solid business but with an underqualified upper managment. This led to a lot of redunancy and irksome ideas because of unrealistic corporate goals and policies.
good,"Working at Sears was a fun environment. The staff team was friendly and fun. We worked together and helped each other out. However, I worked in shoes at Sears and the place I worked at got liquidated."
good,"i worked at SEARS Calgary during the closing and Liquidation  ,it was a seasonal job."
good,Was offered many opportunities to do different types of work within Sears.  Worked with great people and was able to bounce things off one another and learned from one another.
good,Ii am a hard worker so I loved my job and went to work everyday without using personal time unless deathly ill. Unfortunately the company is in a bit of a downfall and due to downsizing it came to an end.
good,"Very helpful management and coworkers, laid back atmosphere, relaxed work pace, over all a very enjoyable  staff and over all environment.. would recommend"
good,I loved working under my direct manager. I'm unsure if I would work for the company if I had to work for anyone else because he was the best manager within the store that I worked.
good,"This place keeps you on your toes. You are always learning something new in this field. Taking photos of babies, children adults and groups. Cutting film and maintain equipment as well stocking rooms and selling product to clients. The hardest part of the job is staying on time."
good,"Work started out slow in morning,  then picked up in the afternoon.  I started out learning how to do batteries, tires. Then gradually worked my way up to be a mechanic doing brakes, alignment, front end work, etc,. All employees got along with each other and helped one another.  Hardest part of my job was having to wait on parts to fix cars. The enjoyable part of my job was the very friendly customers."
good,"Liked working during the holidays. Kinda rough during the holidays, but felt good to make customers happy. Good management to work for. Reasonable to work with your schedule."
good,A typical day was to put out the incoming sock each week and tare down and put up all new promotional adds within the store. Employees were the best helping out other departments went needed
good,nothing special about working at sears had to deal with alot of customers and assist stock team load and unload trucks and returns pretty easy job and good coworkers
good,"Sears was a wonderful store.  I met some great people.  The work was hard, and the pay was not the greatest.. Lack of hours made it hard to make a living."
good,just stand by department to assist customer whatever they need. Help them and show them how things work. Keep clean and maintenance department. Help customer to buy or return item.
good,"Great company to work at as a student, customer service was a priority and constant change. Manager assisted their cashier whenever they needed help ."
good,Positives: Flexible hours and reasonable compensation for entry level positions. Management is friendly and accommodating. 
good,"Sears was a good stable job. Sadly they pay at a base rate and don't offer raises due to commissions. Relaxed environment. You never knew when the store might go out of business,"
good,"aquí aprendí .muchas cosas, y él hambiente de trabajo en muy tranquilo"
good,"A typical work day for me consisted of greeting an engaging with various customers throughout the day to assist with any issues or questions they may have. Also, I would apply my extensive product knowledge to establish reliability and trust with the customers I engaged with so that they might come back and shop with us on a regular basis."
good,Hours at Sears Call Center are great. It is too micro managed. Commission has gone down in the last years. Lead call flow has lowered. Team managers are great.
good,Must learn about the different types of paint.  Learn how to mix paint. Assist customers with the types of paint they need.  Display sales signs for the department. Stock shelves. Keep department neat and clean. Complete sales transactions.
good,"I didn't work at Sears for a long time to fully get the scope of the job. In the time that I worked, it was alright. Management was not the best. Work culture was good, we all had teams but every time looked out for their own."
good,overall my experience was at times negative but more recently it has been somewhat positive. The daily routine included opening and counting the cash register interacting with customers maintaining stock on the floor updating and following up leads  which was hard sometimes and not always worthwhile
good,"Good people, good pay, bad company situation / strategy"
good,"I was a cashier and the pressure was on to get customers to sign up for the Sears Cards. I really loved working with my customers/coworkers, we all tried to have a good time."
good,"I worked Sears part time while I was finishing up College in Naperville and I was able to see a big turnaround with the overall culture in the store once management changed. I learned a lot of communication skills and talking to customers. The hardest part was the physical labor, but a typical day didnt consist of too much labor unless it was a big sale going on"
good,Emploi valorisant face aux clients car toujours de bons commentaires de leurs parts
good,Work was exciting as the culture of the company was encouraging. My passion for my job also motivated me daily to go to work and work was exciting and fun for me.
good,Voluntary resignation . Company undergoing restructuring that created job insecurity . Schedule was reasonable. Room for advancement was limited and selective.
good,The company is in bad shape and is going down fast. They are making cuts to positions that are vital to the company. Great stores and promotions but lack of advertisement to the younger generation
good,Rude manager. Left alone to do multiple persons jobs while they were outside smoking or goofing around.  Had to work long hours and didn't get paid for my overtime
good,"standard pace. "
good,"it was a good working environment. friendly workers and staff. nice customers; although, some would complain about the structure of the lines to check out with the cashiers."
good,"A typical day at Sears, was a slow paced environment and the management was inconsistent with helping. My fellow employees   were fun to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new customers and helping them with their purchase. I learned basic customer service skills. I did not experience a hard part of my job."
good,"I am proud and consider myself privileged to have worked with so many great people at Sears Holdings Corporation for the past 33+ years.  Those that I had the pleasure of working with, were hard working, dedicated, focused, team oriented, determined and possessed a strong work ethic.  We all worked together and did whatever it took to get the job done."
good,"Sears is a great company and helps promote a team work environment. It's a great place to start working for as your first job. It teaches you the basics of retail, punctuality, time management."
good,"I enjoyed working at sears had great management and great co-workers> I learned a lot about retail. My day would start depending on my task that were assigned by our corporate office.  The hardest part of the job was the holiday season it did get a little stressful as I'm sure most retail jobs were during the holiday season.  "
good,"Compañerismo bueno,  administrativamente es un area de oportunidad y falta de ceecimiento dentro dela empresa"
good,"Enjoyed the job, sorry they closed down my location or I would still be there. Management was good, expectations realistic, and overall a good place to work."
good,"I enjoyed Sears,enjoyed the atmosphere and flexibility of my job.I worked as a sales associate in a Electonics but poor sales performance will result in termination."
good,"Sears is a company where you had to meet a certain quota in signing consumers up for credit applications and signing consumers into ""Sears Reward Program"".  These two ""quotas"" basically determined your annual performance rating of:  (1) satisfactory or (2) unsatisfactory."
good,Company is a great company to work for if you are new to the work force. Flexible hours which is good for someone that is going to school. Pay is not that great.
good,As a whole was an okay company to work for. I was in the automotive department so we were sort of on an island by ourselves.The contests and prizes we received for winning the shop contests were a major plus.
good,"Offers casual environment and some advancement opportunity. Constant change, which makes the job somewhat unpleasant.  Has high turn over rate which can be difficult to the senior associates."
good,The leadership / management team is too top heavy.   There are many layers of management and directors.  When a company is going through tough times management cost need to be contained.
good,I truly enjoyed working there. The management team was great and I really had a great work/life balance. The only issue was the lack of customers. As a commission sales associate it was just too hard to make a living
good,"Working at Sears for the past 3 years was a nice experience especially in appliances. The staff is amazing and they don't discriminate at all. Since you are a commission based associate they give you flexible work hours as well.  However,  the commission structure changed over the past years which makes it a bit more difficult for not earning the same amount as always."
good,"Sears can be a good place to work, but only in certain departments."
good,The enviornment was very balanced. We had alot of work but we were paid fairly and treated well. They were very reasonable and understanding when it came to schedules
good,I loved working here for a first job but i didnt stay long due to no available way to progress in the company also people kept quitting so the managers would pile their work on top of what you already had to do. Not enough time to do it all.
good,"The job itself was good, management was willing to work with students on availability, regular lunch breaks and a pleasant working environment. However due to the companies financial status there is little to no job security. After months of being told we would not close we suddenly found ourselves being told that the store would in fact be closing."
good,"Gérer les ventes, promotions, stock."
good,"I learned more during my tenure at Sears than I have in any other position in my career. Always challenging, stretching, demanding, very high standards. "
good,It is nice to work at Sears Canada.  The people are easy to work with and you can balance Job work and life.  I learned a lot.  Plenty of work to do but manageable.
good,"Sears is a good company to work with especially if your part-time because their flexible if your a student. In addition, the staff is fairly nice and everyone gets along with one another. Plus, the job positions aren't hard at all."
good,"Making less and less money all the time. Customers are buying online, and less in stores. This reduces the customers coming in to pay for goods, which reduces the sales, and employees."
good,There where some day's and not so good all I can say I work with some very good people and certain managers were good I had a very good supervisor and a great operation manager
good,"The people really make coming to work enjoyable.  The culture is one of community.  Everyone is more than willing to help each other out and that definitely makes a difference, at least at my sight."
good,"There isn't much of a drive to motivate you to work there. Equipment barely worked properly, products remained stagnant and didn't evolve to fit the newer generation of customers, fixtures broke on occasion, not enough staff members on during selected shift hours, no repercussions against employees unless they committed a heinous act, customers would trash the floors and fitting rooms and was difficult to maintain proper etiquette of a two floor building with minimal assistance and abysmal pay that didn't garner the drive to press onward. Excuses were made constantly just to keep the building afloat but the mindset was only short term, and not long term in regards to how the store could improve. Other than that, the workers were all pleasant despite the overbearing environment and made working there tolerable. We worked as a team or one unit, and got many tasks completed until the end of the store's lifetime."
good,good place for someone who is barely starting off and wanting to grow in the industry. company has training for all levels and different types of workers to learn from .
good,I loved working there. Changing tires and oil. The only complaint it the head mechanic was a scammer. He would tell people they need brakes and they didn't. I take pride in my work and thats pretty low. other than that everything els was great.
good,"My first job was at Kmart then I was transferred over to Sears later on, within the 13 months I worked for Sears Holding company I found myself enjoying the cashier job of Kmart and hating the mca work as a Sears staff since I felt belittled by my manager and overworked for my pay grad."
good,Relaxed setting. Good place to learn skills in retail.Co-workers were great to be around. Management was great. Recommend to anyone seeking their first job.
good,"You do learn a lot here with customer service,it is fun but when it came to black Friday it was horrible i had to learn how to cashier in less than 4 hours and had to do cashiering the next day when it was black Friday, and no one cannot not work that day everybody has to go in. Customers were very understanding and patient with me though so that was a plus. Management kind of sucks though and are very rude. Overall a good place to get your first job though."
good,Worked in shoes everything for the most part is okay just higher leads in the department don't really make it an exciting experience  but they do push you in a way so things can get done faster I was shy first going in and now i'm not so much great team other coworkers will understand if you talk to them. 30min breaks for lunch
good,working at Sears there was something always to do rather it was checking people out or re folding clothes to cleaning your work station the customers was very friendly and polite
good,"Dealing with customers and technicians"
good,Great people. Fun environment. No raises. Stay there 3-4 years and get along with everyone and you might get a manager position. It's a cool job to have if your going to school also.
good,"Started out on the phones, was promoted after 8 months to adjustments(Lead adjuster) then 9 months later to Screening Supervisor.  I was the 3rd supervisor for that department in a year.  I didnt like that they didnt give me any supervisor training first"
good,It is fast paced and requires a lot of focus. Hours are dependent on credit. People are friendly and there is a lot to be done around the store. 30 minute lunch breaks.
good,"I enjoyed working at Sears for the most part. My coworkers were great and the customers did not cause much of a fuss. Management could be a bit of a pain, always pushing for credit card applications and demanding that at least two be done a day by each cashier. It was the middle of a management change too and you could sense that many of the seasoned workers had no respect for the new manager."
good,Typical day at work involves assisting members and helping them find what they are looking for as well as things they may not realize they need. Never a dull moment always a project or something to clean or do. Management are understanding when something comes up but would like you to realize that they are running a business. The hardest part of the job was that you don't get holidays off because those are the biggest sales days. I really enjoyed getting to know my coworkers and that everyday was different.
good,"At Sears, I have helped hone my communication skills. As a case manager, I would deal with up to 80 corporate issues a day. By the time I receive the customer, they are well irate. Empathizing with customers while they explained their issues became a reflex. Deescalation was the focus point of my job. I have great managers but growth isn't currently available with the current business model."
good,"As an intern I had few responsibilities. This at times made the workday drag on, as I like to be kept busy. I had a temporary manager during my time there but they did not communicate with me often. This became an issue later in the internship as my mentor's ideas of my project conflicted with theirs. Culture was nice. Dress code was relaxed. 17$/hr as an intern is as good as it gets. You could get away with wearing jeans and a t shirt if you wanted. Internpalooza was an interesting end to the internship."
good,"A typical day at work would require me to help people find the proper appliance, mattress, or footwear for their lifestyle. I learned excellent customer service skills. The establishment consisted of all different cultures of customers and co-workers. The hardest thing about the job was I never had enough time to be with my family. Every holiday and weekend had to be worked. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people everyday."
good,A typical day at this job consisted of working with freight and interacting with customers. I learned how to work with directions coming from corporate and how to work with large amounts of money. The management at this job always helped get the work done. The most enjoyable part of this job were the incentives and other work related activities.
good,"As an associate at Sears, I was tasked with cashier duties. This included processing payments, returns/exchanges, and credit card payments. Managers were nice and down-to-earth, and colleagues were easy to get along with. Interacting with my colleagues and customers was almost always enjoyable. Biggest criticism is corporate policy of prioritizing credit card applications above all else (including customer service). Cashiers were given (low) commission based on ability to persuade customers to sign up for credit card, and hours were also assigned on this basis. Entire power structure was based on who could ""sell"" the most credit card apps. This created an unhealthy focus on purposely slowing down operations in order to harass a customer into signing up for credit card. Rewarded ""sales"" types over more dutiful workers."
good,"Sears was a great place to work starting out. I was able to acquire a plethora of hours early in my stay due to illnesses, vacations and departures from the working environment. Towards the end things were less desirable due to the store going out of business and coworkers having to search for new jobs."
good,"i have enjoyed working for sears but I do not enjoy being capped out with my commission."
good,"At positive place to work at,everyone seam to get alone very well. The culture at sears were a very good one everyone worked together very well. The only complaint is that management was trying to manage so far away, at that time they were 125 miles away and had know idea of the geographic location of travel..."
good,"In most situations, management can't be relied on. If you need help with anything, the only place you're going to get it is from other CSAs (sales people). Hopefully it is not that way at every store or we're in more trouble than we think."
good,"The employees and management of this company, at least at the lower level, were great, but the pay wasn't so great and the benefits were not very good until the later years."
good,Company has a high standard and ensures all associates follow the processes and procedures to ensure it remains. Does not ensure fairness between management and associate disputes.
good,"I worked at Sears for a long time, but was laid off- I'd have stayed if it weren't for that.  There are good things and bad things, just like every job.  I liked the people I worked with for the most part.  The dress code and overall vibe was fairly laid back.  My work load was huge, but I like that- if you aren't ready to work hard, then don't bother.  My boss was cool.  They try hard to keep morale up, too, with contests, events, etc.  The downsides- the pay isn't great and the benefits are pretty lousy, if that is important to you.  The call center where I worked is pretty run-down as well, if that matters to you.  Overall, I give working there a 3, only due to the facility itself and the low pay and benefits.  ."
good,Was a stressful job making sure payroll was done on time so the people who worked there would get paid. Getting schedules done and hiring for the company. Loved meeting new people and staffing them in the job they were best suited for was fun. Working as personal I was able to get to know the employees and helping them with the training for the jobs they had. The hardest part was when they left. Sometimes for better jobs within the company or for another company.
good,"A typical work day for me started at 8 on the weekends until 5 that evening. I loved working there,but some of the people were only there for the money I believe Sears could have stayed open if there wasn't lazy individuals and thief's. I loved the manager she made coming to work a joy."
good,Everyone i worked with was a amazing group of people. Super kind and made the atmosphere very friendly. When first starting off the company made a very great training system. Probably the best training I've got especially just starting in retail.
good,"The commission structure is not great, the company is falling behind hand having difficulty getting back up on its feet but hopefully they will get more options and better equipment soon."
good,Enjoyed the time I spent here. I was given chances to advance in my career and worked towards doing so. I was promoted and given multiple raises that reflects the work I have put in.
good,I would rate sears on a 1-10 scale bases about a 5 overall there are to many departments that need improvement all the way around from mgnt to the everyday employees the culture is supposed to be own it      and it seems as if no one does so.  Sears is the type of place where no matter what who and when your dealing with them it's a complete hassle unless your  making a payment of some sort.
good,"At one time a very strong company, but with the growth on Amazon and shopping online the company is struggling to survive. Expense cuts have taken their toll on the workforce morale. I have learned how to increase productivity while decreasing expenses."
good,A typical day at work can range from very pleasant to not so pleasant. This varies due to daily demands as well as member encounters. The most enjoyable part of the day is knowing that I have made someone else's day brighter due to their interaction with me by providing an outstanding experience.
good,The store in which I work is a very positive environment. the manager is hard working and honest. I highly respect my DIRECT superiors IN THE STORE. corporate direction however does not seem to favor physical stores!
good,"worked as a cashier and sales consultant"
good,Working for sears is a great job opportunity because of the ability to move up in the company. It promotes from within very often. I've learned a lot of customer service skills and teamwork skills from being at this job. The best part of the job is the ability to move up and the overtime options.
good,If you are ok with customer service and don't mind wearing a headset while working then this is a good option for you.  It was a good place to work at that time in my life and helped me reach some goals I had financially.
good,Stocked product as necessary and advised customers of the proper tools to do a job. Made suggestion about warranties and extended protection agreements.
good,"I would be floating between sections of the store, having to learn all of the products and services SEARS sells.  I learned good people skills, and how to handle my superiors.  Not always guaranteed certain number of hours.  The most enjoyable part was delivering good customer service and making friends with the coworkers.  The most difficult was the workers and management wouldn't always agree."
good,"I worked at Sears for 8 years while I was in University. Great part-time hours, management was always supportive the workload was fair."
good,"This job was very slow pace, because there is also a call center where people can just order parts over the phone. The other employees were great, but the store had out of data registers that annoyed the little amount of customers we did get"
good,"Good short term employment, while i was there the store was going through a lot of personnel changes in both managment and reps, this lead to quite a bit of leadership problems. I am not sure that this still applies."
good,There are not enough people to work at the required times that the store is open. You may have to do things that are outside of your job description more days than none.
good,"As a backroom/warehouse person, your job would be to load up customers orders into their vehicles and exceed their expextations in carefulness. I learned how to scan, price, display, and use all functions of the register to find orders of all sorts. Co workers are usually very fun and agile since its hourly and you need to move in this environment. Hardest part of the job would be the moving stuff by yourself sometimes; the easiest part would be the amount of pricing you will have to do."
good,"This job is a fair job. Managemet is ok . No complaints. You get lunches 2 15 minute breaks, holiday time, and vacation time."
good,Fun place to work.a lot of car stuff was learned while employed there.fast pace work enviorment .fun working on different cars of all types
good,"This company gives lots of opportunities for learning."
good,Decent area to work at needs more staff staff there are friendly but needs a lot of help and technicians barely turns cars fast enough with full staff
good,A good job to get sales experience. This job can be really slow at times but if youre very patient and are a faster learner you will suceed at this job.
good,"This is a extremely fast pace, high volume inbound call contact center, that provides professional support to field appliance technicians. Flexible full time work schedules."
good,Answered incoming calls from customers.  Worked with Probate helping Customers deal with the accounts of lost loved ones.  Made Collection calls on past due accounts.
good,Work days are pretty average. Unload a truck and put stock away. Hardest part of the job is working alone all the time. The most enjoyable part is the people who work there. Although it has become really customer based and not very employee focused.
good,"I loved everyone I worked with,  management included. Very easy to talk to, willing to compromise when it came to days off. However when it came to the training of new employees on the sales floor it was poorly done."
good,"I enjoyed being able to have a flexible schedule. During my time I  "
good,"Showed up and got the facility up and running, some days I did the closing shift which meant making sure all the shop was good to go for the next day; including changing floor plans. I learned to treat customers with equality and not to judge wealth by appearance. I enjoyed working with management especially my second manager. They challenged me to work hard through some basic commission incentives. I enjoyed the challenge of meeting a diverse group of co-workers and developed some friendships along the way. The hardest part of the job was the turn over. After the first six months I had the seniority and was working one-on-one with training the new employees. The trouble that came from this is I was stuck doing a bulk of the work especially the physical part due to the fact that most of the new hires were girls who were ""unable"" to do the heavy lifting which made me get burned out. Further more due to my deeply held religious beliefs I am unable to work Sundays. Management used this fact to keep me from getting promoted. Which basically meant I would be training my own boss; a new assistant manager."
good,"Direct management very motivating, hardest part of job is not giving credit to those who keep us working everyday.  My fellow managers are bold and knowledgeable."
good,"Sears is a great company. There are just a few minor things that could be better, like device and software for daily task."
good,"Too many management changes, management rarely engage with employees. There are various ways to earn extra money especially during the holiday season."
good,Sears is a good place to work if you are family oriented. Everyone treats each other like family. There is no drama. Managers are easy to get along with and talk to if there is a problem.
good,"I worked in the shoe department. My day consisted of cleaning, sweeping, straighten and making sure ads were set for the week.  The freight came in and my job was to place the shoes in the right place."
good,"Un dia tipico de trabajo esta en atender a los clientes que acuden a la tienda por consulta aprendi diversas cuestiones relacioandas a credito  facturacion logistica etc, buen ambiente laboral, la parte dificil tratar con clientes molestos por diversas cuestioneslo que mas me gusto fue el relacionarme con personas nuevas, y aprender cosas nuevas cada dia."
good,Le service à la clientèle de Sears Montréal a fermé ses portes en mai 2014
good,Great employer to work for although wage can improve.  The management was fantastic. Co workers were great to work with.  I've gained experience working with the company.
good,"Great in-store culture while corporate culture is lacking."
good,I loved working there enjoyed the work environment. Managers were great. It was sad when they closed the department I was working in.
good,"This was my very first job. So it was pretty exciting. Enjoyed seeing all the customers come in to shop or either pay their bills. Always on your feet. A lot of down time. Always hiring new people so you get to meet a lot of new people. Balanced the drawer, asked customers to apply for credit cards, processed payments and returns, as well as regular purchases"
good,It feels like your treated like your high school not an adult plus it has not windows so seems like your in jail house when come out.
good,"Sears was comfortable but slightly unorganized. The Management Was Great But The workes were lazy and did not complete due task ,which left some of there over pilled work land on me."
good,"I like the work environment as it's a 'hands off' management style. "
good,"A typical day goes by fast"
good,Nice place to work. Management do a nice job attending to their workers need and also provide good benefits to help you Co workers are nice and its a fun atmosphere.
good,"My favorite part of working there was the ability to move around. We could move from different departments to gravitate more to the tool department eventually. That’s where I stayed at most of the time. That was my favorite part. And the people who worked in that department, because we got to work with the sales associates. And they weren’t behind the register; they were just there selling things. So, we got to communicate with people rather than being at the other cash wraps by yourself."
good,"Overall a ok company, Great management and a good place to work if you like to work contract positions. If trained properly, you will be fine working here to gain more experience."
good,"On an everyday day basic I would go into work, sit at my desk and sign in to began work. Once I sign in the phone would start to ring and I would answer the proper way, and beginning asking the questions as to how I could assist the member with there issues."
good,"A very demanding job were the costumer is a big priority and expects full attention. I learned that retail can be a very demanding job, but the pay is too low well at least in Sears it is. The management expects you to meet your demands as usual, but at Sears management is a mess and it is very hard to please the standards given to you. At the job you tend to meet lots of people and co-workers tend to see the problems in management. I think the hardest part is getting paid eight dollars an hour with a very demanding management. I think the fact that it was my first job and I learned a lot in retail business."
good,As of now great management. Have to be aggressive at all times. Sometimes there is no foot traffic so it can drag a bit. Have great co workers. Hardest part of the job is that if there is no traffic there is no sales. You must be confident in yourself and know how to sale the product correctly if not it will be a headache.When you sell a lot of things that is when you get the best checks of course commission is key.
good,When i work at a place i figure out how to get the job done and see how efficient i can be to get the job done in a safe and timely manner.the hardest part of a job is when when people can't come together as a team to finish a task that needs to be done and if this happens the task will take longer . at present i am working less than full time hours at a warehouse  from Walmart and I am try to acquire full time hours .
good,"enjoy working at sears, great relationship with the entire store team and management. family oriented. prices are fair"
good,I learned the basic skills for retail jobs and how to successfully assist customers and be a back-up cashier. The most enjoyable part of the job was the fact I was surrounded by the best co-workers anyone could ever ask for.
good,"I truly enjoy my current position as Assistant Store Manager Hardlines, the family atmosphere of our little store in Florence, S.C, and appreciate the opportunity and lifestyle Sears has provided, I am not secure with the viability of Sears as retailer in its current form."
good,I was just moving to Georgia and this was my first job I have no complaints. I remember the co workers being friendly and everyone worked as a team.
good,I absolutely loved working at Sears. The only downfall is if you don't open any credit card apps you do not get hours. That's terrible especially if you have bills to pay and if you ask for hours they don't give it to you unless they need you.
good,"As a pharmacy Technician, I have to say that If I didn't absolutely love my job, I wouldn't be there. It's hard to stay with this company and not know the future of your status."
good,"I have worked as a Merchandising and Pricing Associate starting in October of 2015. Although I am technically an employee as of right now, I have not worked in 3 weeks. I was not told this job was seasonal, but since the week after Christmas, I have worked a total of 3 hours. That is why I am currently seeking other employment. That being said, it is not a bad place to work. The management is very helpful and understanding when it comes to working with your schedule. You are given all of the tools you need to get started, but you will not know everything when your training is done. This is not a bad thing though, especially if you learn by doing, like I do. As a merchandising and pricing associate, I worked less with customers than other employees in the store, since my main responsibilities were setting up and taking down ads, merchandise pricing/department cleanup. I guess the hardest part would be getting stopped by customers asking questions when I had a lot of work to do, but that is part of the job description, and I did not mind helping customers; that is what my main experience working in retail for over 10 years has been, after all."
good,"I generally liked Sears, but pay was not that great and when you work on commission light foot traffic is pretty depressing."
good,"With all the businesses under the umbrella of SCH, you can touch each business unit and broaden your business acumen.  I interact with many beyond the four I work with directly. It's much more than the retail stores. It brings together a diverse group of associates and leaders committed to succeed no matter the bad, uninformed press."
good,"Great staff to work with and opportunity to learn various positions.  "
good,"the business thrives so long as consumer drivers come in for daily routine checks on their vehicles or come in with driving issues. Sears auto center employees are very strict with safety and regulations. The management could use some work, like having more organized and fixed schedules. sometimes the managers go out and break some rules of their own just to get away with services. Above all as long as the technician knows what he is doing then I know you will have a good experience."
good,"Drives revenue growth by using selling and customer service skills and abilities. This includes completing sales through ringing of sales through our point-of-sale systems."
good,"My review on Sears is that its a great store to shop at, and when I use to work there I met a lot of great people not just the workers but the customers too."
good,This was a call center and it was a fun job and I enjoyed my time there very much. able to make my own schedule and work when it was good for me to do so.
good,"A computer is assigned to you in witch your jobs for the day are down loaded onto it."
good,It's good to work here. I learn many things with the help of my partners and manager. I enjoy what i do. The hardest part of work is the company bring few hours and pay the minimum.
good,"Although the company itself was going through some challenges, we were seeing great success within the B2B division of the company."
good,"Sears had an amazing training program for the management team."
good,Good stepping stone company to work for lots of advantages and perks the staff is amazing and the benefits are ok. I would get a family member or friend a job here for the experiance
good,It is a Great place to learn and work. Work with college students regarding scheduling. Was a great learning experience.
good,The culture here was very friendly and easy to get used to. Employees were helpful and kind. The job itself was not very exciting or fun and their was not much room for advancement so I had to move on.
good,"en un dia normal llegas y hay junta para informarnos cuanto se vendio el dia anterior y caleficar al mejor vendedor,"
good,"A typical work day would involve assessing our wins and opportunities to impact daily business decisions.  I interviewed, hired and trained all associates for various departments. I was responsible for meeting sales goals, visual, implementation of standards of operations."
good,"This is a job that as time goes keeps on adding responsabilities, and raising metric but without a matching pay.  Very complicated and confusing commission structure.The hardest part of the job is keeping your commission due to a confusion in the directory and always getting customers in wrong gates, causing more wrong connects and as a result being very difficult to attain a good commission. A good part of the job is the friendly management and coworkers."
good,I loved selling Jewelry and helping people when someone buy something that  makes them happy. Learning a lot about sales and Jewelry. I loved people I  worked with. I did not like having to work holiday . And after Christmas did not get enough hours.
good,The managers and coworkers are awesome they are a lot of fun and very enthusiastic. The work was easy till they outsourced our department overseas then we got randomly thrown into another department with minimal training . There is room for advancement if you have connections or good looks otherwise forget it. The pay is decent though I have no complaints about that.
good,"Mornings would start off around 6:20. I wouldn't have to clock in till 6:30. I would be there early at 20 mins every morning just to reset for the day properly. However, the quality of the managers would not support the quantity of the staff. Meaning, the support had no clue at time to what I would need help with. Often, I taught myself and asked questions whenever necessary."
good,"A typical day at work was resolving customer needs constantly. It got frustrating to be the only manager on duty and have to run around the store with your head cut off like a chicken. You definitely get overworked as being a leader in the store. There wasn't any ""managers"" besides the store manager for 8 months until a new assistant store manager was hired."
good,Fairly good place to work. No major ups or downs involved. I would work there again if they had better work/life balance.
good,"We loaded and unloaded trucks with stock and customer vehicles with purchases.  The workers worked well together in the warehouse   "
good,"•	Prepared sales slips and sales contracts."
good,"It was a really good job, except for some rude customers making it harder (but that's everywhere you go). Managers are always hassling you about selling smart plans (replacement plans) & keeping a green arrow (SHOP YOUR WAY PERCENTAGE) which is very ANNOYING. You will NOT make more than minimum wage ($7.25). I've met plenty woman who've worked there 3+ years & are still making minimum wage. Its pretty slow so you don't have much to do. You only earn a quarter or two for every smart plan to sell which sucks! Not everyone wants a smart plan & they're offered on the dumbest items such as: purses, plastic toys, etc. You're required to perform tasks you weren't hired to do (which is pretty much everywhere you go) Otherwise that it was an ok experience."
good,Managers would have made my job easier if they would have accepted calls from customers who requested them. For the most part I really enjoyed my job but I believe there should have been compensation for the additional responsibilities.
good,"Day to day tasks include helping customers, doing floor resets, helping customers, helping customers and helping more customers."
good,"I enjoyed working at Little Caesars for awhile, until the new store manager started giving me trouble. It was a relaxed work environment, yet I still accomplished all of my tasks. The hours were great, the hardest part would have been on the busy days where 20+ customers would be in line. The best part of the job was being able to talk with other employees."
good,Arrive early and leave late. Sometimes have to work Saturdays but the people that work there are very kind and fun to work with.
good,"A typical work day would start with checking the metrics for the day previous and setting goals based on the present day projections. Goals would then be set for individual cashiers, and guidance and encouragement would then be given to assist the cashiers in reaching these goals. In addition, the cashier lead would help facilitate excellent customer service per company standards. "
good,"Alright if you want to be an over the phone salesman. Offers good benefits and they spend alot of time training their sales reps, and that is awesome. Unfortunately in my experience, after the training and initial nurturing of the newness of the job, the management has a slightly more cutthroat attitude towards its associates, in which it feels like you are left to sink or swim as a sales rep. The Culture is getting a lot more Customer Service oriented, and its not a terrible work environment, although you might think that for such a long running company, among fortune 500 names, that they would have nicer insides for the building."
good,I was usually behind the register getting customers if not I was in the back organizing things or putting stuff where they belong. It was fun seeing everyone I worked with and talking to them and helping them out when needed
good,"j'étais seulement à temps partiel permanent, c'est pourquoi que j'ai changer d'emploi"
good,A typical day as a Loss Prevention Manager involved pursuing a task to prevent the loss of the company assets with merchandise and employees. I learned how to be discipline due to generating action plans for the pros and cons to match my metrics. Management goals were to drive for success and nothing less. Coworkers were great they was always willing to support my action plan to prevent shrink in the company. The hardest part of my job was initiating apprehensions for company merchandise from shoplifters not knowing if or what type of weapon they may have in their position. The most enjoyable watching my team support me to reach my metric numbers and know I had something to do with aMillion dollar store profit inventory as being good
good,"Unfortunately kingston, ma was closed due to poor sales. However the work environment couldn't have been better...Friendly and helpful associates that always helped one another. It was a sad day when kingston closed : ( !!!"
good,"A typical day starts off by locating inventory while retrieving items for customers and loading said item for them, while in between I'm cleaning, helping other associates, and unpacking items that are to be sold. I learned how to operate a work assist vehicle(WAV). The management is fair but strict. Most of the coworkers are very relaxed and friendly but a couple report every single thing that isn't done to code, yet break code themselves but do it so they can't get caught by management. The hardest part of the job would be the few associates, though in all honestly they are very easy to deal with. The most enjoyable would be the other associates that I enjoy working with."
good,The company was ok and doing my job required non-stop telephone service.  Meet quite a few characters over the phone (funny).
good,"took care work orders all around SF bay area including coastal town, Napa, Santa Rosa."
good,This is a great job to start earning experience at a call center. The coworkers are great to be around. As far as management goes it could be ran better.
good,"Sears Holdings was my first job. I started off as a cashier and moved around to learn different positions and hopefully to advance with the company. I worked at four different locations and loved it. My last location the store manager did not like me and would use gay slurs around me and blame me for stuff that was not in my job section. This manager could not find anything to properly terminate my employment and because I was younger and less experienced I left the company, instead of stayed and tried to work with her."
good,"This is a fun place to work, but expect to stand for your entire shift.  The co-workers that i got to accompany we very easy-going and competitive at the same time."
good,Excellent training program.  Opportunity for advancement.  Many employees have been with the company for up to 35 years.  Hiring is from within the company first.
good,"Sears is going through important changes that bring opportunities but also a lot of challenges. Because of these changes, Sears is a great place to bring new ideas and to embrace technology.The company is doing a great effort to move to digital world as fast as it can."
good,"Many learning opportunities.  Good team work and collaboration.  Good employee recognition, diversity and commissions programs."
good,"I enjoyed working at Sears. I wish I could have stayed longer, however, they were not offering me enough hours. That was the hardest part of my job. The management is nice and easy to get along with, as well as the other employees. I love being able to interact with people, which this job allowed me to."
good,"I started at Kmart in October and did enjoy being a cashier. When first hired my first few days was watching videos and taking quizzes/tests the entire 4-5 hours. It was very exhausting and you will yawn. After the videos, I started training on register. I first watched and the next day they expected me to know it and put me on register. I asked to watch one more time because there computer system was definitely different than from most registers I worked most my life. After watching and actually being on register got easier. I did happen to have trouble remembering certain keys, so it helps to write it down. I did enjoy the work because I'm a people person and love interacting with customers.  My shifts usually last from 4-6 hours. I'd sometimes get 10-20 hours a week. It's best to apply around the holidays because u will be working everyday so more hours = more money. I left this job because I got a new job that paid more,  but I was told by my supervisor that I'm always welcomed back because I was one of the best and fastest workers there."
good,"Greet coworkers as I enter the building. Sign in to my computer start answering the phone line. Booking appointments for carpet,air duct our garage services. In the down time we might need to look for pick up for the technician also check voice mail and perceptionist and make sure you get back with the customer. Management would check in from time to time make sure everything was working properly. The hardest part about the job was not having insurance through the company. The most enjoyable part was the coworkers and the laughs and evnviroment."
good,typical day at work was going to work at 7 oclock in the morning before the store opens at 8 to change price tags and fold clothes throughout the day. Pay was not good.
good,"I worked at Rite Aid for 4 years, when i started i was just a cashier and later moved to Loss Prevention. I had several good managers who were friendly and professional about my time there. Rite Aid was a good place to move up in the company to have a better life for myself."
good,"Sears was a great place to work. A lot of people that you interact with each and every day, many friendships made."
good,Company provides ability to advance your career through promotions or relocation. I was promoted from a Supervisor to Manager within the first year of working through my results and leadership skills. Promoted from a Manager to Operations Manager within the next year. Career development is a major plus with this company.
good,"I have been working for STAC for 5 years, assisting field techs with mechanical/electrical troubleshooting, parts issues etc. I am consistently a top performer and give them what they want and then some, but I never receive compensation. Feels like a dead end. However they have been great with schedule changes. My managers have also been pleasant to deal with. There is almost zero stress here after muscling through your first year (quite a bit to learn) Co-workers are down to earth, Hardest part of the job is sitting in a chair all day. Most enjoyable part is receiving gratitude from the techs when we smash brains together and fix something on the spot, Honestly, I would stay here for a lifetime if they would give me the pay boost that I have earned and deserve!"
good,"Outstanding Management"
good,"The work is easy but the pay is not good. If you are a hard worker and show initiative, advancement is possible. The job requires a large amount of teamwork, so building a rapport with your co-workers is necessary."
good,"As we have no general manager and the store is closing, the morale has taken a downward spiral. Many people who have been here for years are losing their jobs and a couple of them don't know how to do anything else."
good,"Not the greatest place to work at, better than McDonald's and any fast food company."
good,"productive place to work"
good,"•Successfully forecast call volume and average handle time for multiple skills using eWFM Aspect software and excel, trend analysis, while meeting forecast accuracy goals of +or- 5%."
good,"The work was typical for a department store, but my coworkers were outstanding.  Our teamwork made even the toughest tasks a pleasure.  I was sad to see the store close and will call many of the employees friends for years to come."
good,"un dia normal, llegar a una hora puntual para la junta antes del inicio de labores, llegar al area de trabajo, hacer aseo. Y en espera de clientes. "
good,I've worked for Sears for a while and I don't have anything negative to say about my experience.
good,It's a great opportunity and good starting company. The management are laid back at times but can be okay to work with. My coworkers are all good to work with they are entertaining and trustworthy.
good,"I learned there are different rules and way's of doing thing's at different jobs. I loved working with my co-workers, it would seem like they would make the day go by. Everything was easliy to catch on to and even with the customers that was my joyable part of the job."
good,"Fun place to work"
good,Sears has been a place that I was able to grow quickly. If you are self motivated and hard working you'll be promoted. There's a million plates in the air so time management skills are a must. Co-workers are what you make them being a manager. People will treat you how you treat them. Perception is the key to customer service and Sears is on point with that.
good,"Great place to gain experience when it comes to ""up-selling"" or sales in general."
good,Being a Cashier for Sears was rewarding in the ways that the culture was very customer centered and positive. The teams I worked on were very positive and friendly as well. I learned more about how to train coworkers and how to anticipate the needs of customers and the team in which I worked on.
good,"Sears Parts sales dept. is a great place to earn good money; However, beween the sales metrics and the extra hours they mandate you weekly, the stress can become overwhelming. Factor in not really being able to enjoy the money you're making and having quality family time because of the hours you're working (10+ a day), It's an ok job."
good,"Flexible scheduling, diverse employees. Great contests and awards."
good,"Sears could be always better as before. 10 years ago the company was completely different in terms of taking care of the employees as well as the customers, most of the departments don't have any associates to help customer's making decisions and close the sales, no stocks, stockrooms are all empty, work load is full but employees hours are cut to 1/3."
good,"At Sears my work days varied. I often set up and took down sales signs. I worked with customers to help them find what they needed such as, shoes, mattresses, clothing, and bedding accessories. It was a great experience that taught me how to approach customers and help them in their shopping experience. My management was wonderful. If I ever needed help, or didn't quite know how a display should look, I could always turn to my manager and get the help I needed. My co-workers were fun to be around and helpful should I ever need extra assistance. The hardest part of my job was trying to sell mattresses, since not many people came in looking to actually buy one. Many were in the browsing stage, comparing prices. My favorite part of my job was interacting with the customers. It was always fun to talk with the regulars and meet new people."
good,"Tends paint-mixing machines that mix paint, lacquer, and stain: Attaches powered mixer to barrels of unmixed paint and starts mixer to stir paint for specified time to obtain specified consistency.

good,"A typical day work lifting, unloading and loading trucks for customers. management was ok, my coworkers were good people, and the hardest part of the job was it conflicted with school. The most enjoyable part of the job I would receive tips from customers for my good deed."
good,Was easy job not much room for advancement and pay isnt as good as it could be.
good,Help customers complete payments for their Sears' Credit Card as well as retail transactions. While working at Sears I worked with a wide verity of customers. I learned a bit of spanish  to better assist our spanish speaking clients. Already having experience in retail made things very easy for my supervisors. I loved the atmosphere
good,I enjoy coming to work. Everyone in the office worked very well together as a team reguardless of what department you were in. The hardest part of the day when it happens would be not being able to meet every customers needs or techs needs based on company guidelines.
good,"this job takes from your home time with loved ones"
good,benefits great hours set great come to work do your job i like the management team for pep ups
good,They are great at giving hours but they don't understand that we have a life outside of work. Some people have children and school and they seem not to care at all.
good,"i love the job i really do meeting new people and bringing them a joy and satifaction to the peoples home and businesses. i work alone all day in a truck. so i only see my co-worker in the morining when we get our rout for the day.but management only care about the money you make them. thier is no advancement opportunities, and they dock your pay if you dont meet thier weekly  percentage. somthing not told when hired. sometime it is a hostile work place in the office. but it pays the bill until i find a new job"
good,"Loaded and unloaded trailers with electronics, home and office furnishing, clothes, rugs, mattresses and all other sears Canada products and stuff. Sometimes a lot of heavy work involved."

good,"A typical day at work began with unloading the truck, scanning, securing, sorting,  and organizing the merchandise for floor readiness."
good,"Lack of dedication, employees seemed bored, training was a joke. Based solely on my experience it wasn't a worth while employment opportunity."
good,This job was good for work experience and had some good benefits.
good,Every day is different which keeps it interesting. I love the people I work with both in the store and as a district team.
good,"personally it is not a welcoming place to work. the sales team are stuck up and act like they have no idea what they are doing , lazy at it, and are apparently unable to keep the store under control at closing. along with that i was allowed a single week off after my gaurdian passed away ."
good,"For Sears to be one of the largest department store they really do not spend any money or time in training their employees for their jobs. Management have their picks, which is not always the best pick of the bunch. When I was hired to work for them and help clean up the mess employees, I found there was one employee who was creating all of the drama in the department. I took it to the General manager who in returned took it to his boss the District Manager. Instead of them backing me they accursed me of being the one starting problems. "
good,Sears has been good to me over my career of 30 years. great worklife balance.
good,I've been with the company for almost 11 years. I'm looking for new opportunities to move up with in a new company.
good,a typical day would be go into work get straight on to the telephones and sit at your little cubical desk all day! I learned how to use different software multi task several different courses at the same time great communication skills and patients! My management was alright i have better ad i have had worse. my co-works wasn't that friendly and didn't make me feel welcomed at all! Hardest part having to earn how to use six or more different softwares and have them all flow nicely together at the same time! The most enjoyable would be after each long work week with lots of long hours my pay check every other week would have be mine top pick over it all..
good,"As a jewelry consultant, I had a lot of higher security clearance. A typical day of opening consisted of counting down registrars and placing out all high priced diamonds from a safe.  You handle huge amounts of money.  Working in jewelry you learned a lot of different computer programs, placed online orders, sent in repairs digitally, and had to look up a lot of information. Closing as a jewelry consultant consists of accounting for all diamonds and then putting them all back into the safe, cleaning displays and counting down registrars. The mangers were always helpful and nice if you ever needed anything. The job was very simple."
good,"Could not keep a manager in the store, operations manager had to step up, but a steady place to work."
good,"I learned a lot about sales and working one-on-one with customers."
good,was just your ordinary cashier position but was fortunate to work with and around great people.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo , buenas capacitaciones a personal."
good,"Sears is a very professional job that puts its customers first, Sears goes above and beyond for customer service and is a very welcoming work environment. The work is fast paced with a lot of face to face customer service as well as over the phone."
good,Very sales oriented. Great supervisors. Provided paid on-site training.
good,Management would make you feel like you could not do your job properly and would not answer questions that you had.  I learned a lot about trusting people that you thought you could talk to about concerns you had (Human resources)
good,"I was a cashier at Sears in Barboursville, WV. A typical day of work consisted of opening my cash register by obtaining money from the vault and putting an even amount in the register for the day. I would then straighten my area up until customers began to arrive. Then I would care for them to the best of my abilities. At the end of the day I would close my register and return a certain amount of money to the vault."
good,a typical day at work would be boring if there are no costumers around so basically you have to call in customers if there are no walk in customers. My co workers were fine i guess.
good,I loved working at Sears and helping the customer. I was very proud of working their.

good,"customer service make sure they live store happy ..."
good,I started working at Sears as a sales associated. I used to work for the shoe department. It was a really busy department to maintained cleaned. But I enjoyed keeping my department neat and organized.
good,"In a typical day I open the store, count the cash drawers, turn everything on, check signing and prices vs the current ad to ensure accuracy. During the day I help customers find the products that best fit their needs, while cleaning and maintaining the department."
good,For the most part I enjoyed working for them but the store was sold as a franchise and I had to take the early retirement in order to keep my benefits. It is no longer a corporate owned store. I earned $10.00 an hour when I left the store.
good,Sears is an average minimum  wage paying job that asks a lot of someone but under pays. Typically the work days are very slow. I've learned that some jobs aren't for everyone. Management was pretty fair as far as overseeing their employers. My co-workers were decent people from what I remember of them. The hardest past of the job were dealing with customers who were wrong but thought they were right. The enjoyable was working because I love working.
good,"Christmas is a very busy time in the photography business, sometimes you didn't get a lunch break, or get to go home on time. In the end, it was always worth the look on people's faces when they picked up their portraits."
good,sears at westoaks is a more dull place then other electronics but great place and people.

good,Working here taught me a lot about a CCRC (Continuing Care Retirement Community). Enjoyed the chance to chance the reputation of Meadow LAke and grow the business 34% Sadly the financial restructure kept me from continuing on with the success and was laid off in February.

I learned to work hard and always do the right thing. the management always gave employees the benefit and support us. co-workers were experienced and fun to work with. the hardest part of the job was standing for many hours at a time. the most enjoyable part was working with nice people.
good,Great place to work for if you love to learn new things through constant change.
good,"I have worked various jobs in call centers, Sears was my least favorite after the first year. They are a good company, pay well and have good bennefits, its just the management as a whole wasnt too conserned with the call center reps,."
good,"When I started at Sears Home Improvement, they had no one there that knew Kitchens and Baths, so I enjoyed setting up the position of project coordinator. From hiring the trades that were needed to helping out with the design training of the sales team. The products I installed were Kitchen cabinets, refacing cabinets, lighting, flooring and countertops and backsplash. Without the knowledge of the cabinet design there is no way to do this job with the success that we recieved. In customer service we recieved awards that allowed us to have party's for our installation team. Without good cusotmer service a company can never have high success, our district led in the almost 5 years that I worked for Sears."
good,Not there long enough. All i did was push lawn mowers around.

good,"a typical day of work would be slightly challenging, overall a great company"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of deciding which products would be put on the sales floor, and then putting them out. Also, assisting customers with online purchases, as well as locating and purchasing items, was done on a daily basis. I learned more about suggestive selling, and why certain products sell faster than others. The management was okay, the only problems were with scheduling. I was scheduled outside of my availability sometimes, or the schedule would be posted at the last minute. My co-workers were easy to get along with, and for the most part, everyone worked as a team. The hardest part of my job was trying doing the price integrity because a lot of times, the signing was not done correctly, and I would have to start over. The most enjoyable part of the job was that it was overall easy, and that they worked around my schedule."
good,"I have had the opportunity to work for Sears Holdings for 12 years with a two year lay off. My first 10 years I work in the credit department, starting with collections, updating of customer's accounts that fell behind and ended it in what they referred to as Detail Control Center. At the DCC I handled customer disputes on all credit card formats not just the Sears Card or the Sears MasterCard. I acted a a liaison between the K-Mart or Sears store and the customer and made sure that the customer was credit if they were doubled charged or over charged or charged if they were not charged. After a two-year layoff I am currently a Field Operations Specialist working in the Audit department and assisting in Parts recovery, the audit department make sure the Technicians are making their deposits from cash collect service calls in a timely manner and reporting discrepancies. What I have learned at this company in independence, the ability to maintain your workload without supervision. The hardest part about this job is coming to work and our systems are not functioning the way they are supposed to and having to make due with what we have for a full shift, I enjoy busy work and a challenge and it is very hard for me to sit and wait for the phone to ring. The most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to be able to help whether it be the technician looking for a missing deposit or a customer wanting an extra part picked up from their home. It is always a great feeling to know that you were able to solve someones problem the first time they have asked."
good,Co-workers and management are a joy to work with. Typical day as a cashier would be to get as many credit apps as possible.
good,"Very busy cool team members, Supervisor was easy to communicate with. Understanding, horrible pay"
good,Fill store floor from stock 3 times a day
good,Mind your back if your staff screws up yo can loose your job. I iked it for the first 4and a 1/2 yeasr but the last 6 months was unbearable
good,Stocking and Merchandising for Lawn and Garden and Tool Dept.
good,"Overall, a good place to work. They are flexible with the schedule. I was a cashier. The have high standards when it comes to signing people up for the Sears Credit Cards and Shop Your Way Rewards. It all depends on how many transactions your ring but I generally needed to get at least 1 every 3 hours worked. It can be stressful because you are customer service so you handle not only purchases but returns, credit payments, customer problems etc. I gave my 2 weeks notice after 4 years because I could not take the stress anymore."
good,"Depending on what you are looking for this could be a great opportunity. I have worked at Sears Franchise Businesses for many years and other areas of Sears for an additional 3-4. Having said this, it must not be too bad. I have learned a lot and been given a lot of opportunities to challenge myself to get to the next level. I love supporting our franchise businesses and the relationships I have built during the time I have worked there. There is a great amount of flexibility which has been much appreciated as I raise my family. I would like to find a business that can offer me the opportunity to grow and continue to be challenged and learn in my current field. Like anyone, I would like to be paid for the services I provide and well enough that I can support my family during these tough economic times."
good,Working at Sears was pretty good. I enjoyed working with the people that were also employed. Departure from the job was due to our dept. being closed.

good,Great for social people. I enjoyed meeting different people on a daily basis.
good,"work is overall simple but the shop is being shut down by sears because it is ""expensive for the company to maintain."""
good,"I dealt with retail products, inventory, and sales with customers. I learned how to represent products and how the company operates. Management was supportive and helpful. Co-workers were hard working and supportive. The hardest part of my job was working long and busy hours during the holiday season. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers and co-workers."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of a numerous amount of transactions being processed while providing the best customer service one can offer. Unfortunately, the management needed improvement when training new workers and scheduling on days that workers ARE able to work."
good,Few nice people work there but it is a shame that there wasn't more of them. It was a nice two years before I called it quits. The customers were daily customers. Your typical retail department store environment. I'd work at Sears again probably not the one I left though.
good,I learned to deal with hostile customers. I had wonderful co-workers. I enjoyed being the youngest employee. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers.
good,"a typical day at sear for me was first signing in then going up the stair , folding clothes and paceing them neatly on the tables are on hangers.

good,"service tech , at the time i was working there it was very slow no work just sloppy shop if u ask me but at that particular time not sure about now maybe new management"
good,"My day starts by idenifying what's most important for the day. I'm a goal oriented person who performs his job to the best of my ability. Most people see me as someone who leaves a strong impression on them. I'm a team player with an extremely friendly and out-going personality,and use it to its utmost. The hardest part of the day is when you you haven't finish everything you set out to do. The most enjoyable part is when you are able to accomplish your goals with great teamwork with your co-workers"
good,Fun atmosphere to work because the co workers and managers where nice individuals.
good,Went to work latel night pulling orders. Learned how to use attachments on forklift. Management was great to work for. They cared about the employees. Co-workers were great to work with. Lots of fun was had all night long as we worked. Hardest part of the job at times was getting inbetween the rows of appliances with the forklift to retrieve product. Problably the most ejoyable part of the job was working with the co-workers.
good,"Worked at cash register, tool sales floor, occasional, stock room helper."
good,"As my first job, Sears Outlet has taught me a lot about both the workplace and the retail environment. The culture and co-workers are what made being an associate enjoyable, and I would highly recommend it as a place to start earning experience. It's an easy place to get trapped in, however -- many of the employees have held the same entry-level positions for years, or even decades."
good,Sears is a good place to work. Management always supports me. I am concerned that Sears will go out of business
good,"Most of the people were pretty friendly, you could take your breaks whenever you wanted, the pay was okay, there was no guarantee you could get any days off that you wanted, even if you requested them really far in advance."
good,"People are nice and work is fun, good place hope Sears the beast."
good,"The people here are great, we have goals to meet and expectations to uphold. This store in particular has great employees but sometimes the team work and management from other departments and overall is lacking, which at some points make the store look bad from a customer standpoint."

good,we peformed repairs on cars and trucks.I learned how to enhance my repair skills
good,"There was no organization when I was there because the old manager that hired me was later terminated, while I was there they were mostly looking for a new manager, which they got that terminated me within a week. Before then there was organization and it was okay for the time being."

good,"Sears es una empresa con buenas prestaciones, opción de crecimiento y ambiente laboral bueno."

good,"It's a fairly typical retail job, the people is really the reason to stick around. All of them are wonderful and very respectful. Over all my experience at Sears was a wonderful one."
good,"A typical day honestly waiting on the system to work, my challenge was learning a system called ""click"" which track techs and jobs,  system could be fast past or slow depending if system working. This made my job hard to do. My manager was awesome, good group of people fun at time.I really liked by job getting to know the techs, other associates and multi tasking."
good,"Working with day to day deadlines, fast paced office. Learning technicians terms for parts and repairs. Helping customer complete their order process."
good,"If you're good with moderate to high amount of pressure for credit goals, then this is the job for you. Hourly salary of $9 an hour, so it's not a bad base hourly wage, but credit goal is a big part of the job culture, and low performance means less hours. So keep that in mind when applying."
good,Sears was a great starter company to get your foot in the service department... gained a good amount of experience the starter pay was OK but no races were given.. my recommendation is to stay for 1-3 years for experience then move on to another company for better pay
good,"typical day busy, competitive . Hardest part of job making sales.  Enjoyed fellow employees. Management always encourage  worker.My Supervisor was the best always willing to coach and assist."
good,Una empresa que si recomiendo ampliamente porque te dan estabilidad laboral.

good,"During the time i was working there we spent the whole time either stageing, prepping, loading, unloading trailers and recycling using heavy compactors."
good,"This job is great for a student who just wants some extra cash in their pocket. Sears is a fun, relaxed environment but no room for advancement and awful pay."
good,"Repaired washer and dryers, loved my job there. Enjoyed meeting different customers everyday! Sears provided good support for the technicians but honestly they could have ran a more profitable company if they had better management but of course  that trickles down from Corporation. One year I sold the most  protection agreements among all the10,000 technicians nationwide @ $40,000 and still hold the record today."
good,"Empresa buena al igual como primer empleo "
good,"Large Client base, good traffic every day due hot location. Very good loyal customer buying here. Very stressful sometime because manager have no experience dealing with customer issue."
good,"very large company with many employees, learned alot from the designers, good work life balance, good management, busy schedule, difficult to change departments"
good,"Good place to work with good management. Learned skills quickly and was taught well. Not much opportunity for advancement or promotions. Did not pay very well compared to other companies. Overall, productive and okay place to work."
good,Working for sears there are many ups and downs and lots of high expiations of this demanding job. but the people you work with make it worth it. I am talking about the associates. best place to work in appliances to make the commission.
good,No room for career advancement and no raises given yearly. Store is productive and very successful. Low pay for hourly associates with no raises. Hardest part of job is dealing with customer issues and the return exchange policy.

good,"I had a very good experience working commission+base sales. I had a great relationship with my hardlines manager and my coworkers. Managers take complaints very seriously and arrange meetings to ensure all needs are met. "
good,"I really hated pushing credit card applications on people, my hours would go from good to horrible, the people there were not very friendly. not much break time"
good,"Good salary for freshers"
good,"Although Sears is such a huge store and you can learn so much about the products there, it's quite a boring place to work. The location at Brookfield was very empty and quiet most of the time. I expected the store to be more exciting like it was when I first got the job."
good,"If I am to be honest about my experience at Sears, it was more than just full of stress; there was drama between several of my fellow cashiers, and I did not wish to be a part of it There may be some great people there, but I did not enjoy my co-workers. The managers are friendly and help you figure out problems, but you have to have some patience."
good,nice place to work. but there is a catch. it seems like i was just going to be a simple cashier but turns out my main jobs was pitching credit promotions.
good,buena aunque ha oportunidad de mejora en los salarios
good,I would work with the online buyer and go over our marketing actions for the month.We work on a weekly basis to make sure that all of our marketing channels are fulfilled. It is a fast faced but very friendly and relaxed environment. The hardest part of the job is sometimes there not being enough hours in a day to get things done. The have had the greatest management of my career working at Sears. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to look on the website and see my work.
good,"A typical day at work would start off by looking at the daily control sheet so you know what associates will be working. So you can plan out the days plans. I would walk around the store make notes on what departments need help before the store opens. Get the right associates in the right spot to get the tasks done. As the day goes on you are busy going around the store answering questions, helping customers, over seeing all tasks in the store."
good,Got paid 5.50 an hour plus commission on sales but it was only 1 percent and 10 percent on the protection plans. pretty easy going most days and very busy the next
good,"Working at sears as a service technician they are more worried about you selling the home warranties than actually fixing the appliances. There tech assist line is very helpful if you get stuck, also the provide your tools"
good,Do you need good cashier skills to be able to multitask be able to speak to customers give good customer service greet customers and take payment over phone.
good,The management wasn’t the best and the hours they gave you they wouldn’t change even when I asked multiple times for school. I needed certain hours and they wouldn’t let me so I ended up quitting.
good,"Suite à la fermeture de tout les magasins sears qui se fera en janvier , je dois me trouver un autre emploi"
good,"this is more of a temporary job for teenagers, retirees, or part time military personnel. There were hardly any full time positions and did not offer any benefits. Flexible short schedule made it a good second job."
good,"Learnt a lot about ecommerce, was given opportunity to work in different areas of Ecommerce. Got opportunity to work with very smart people. It was good experience working at Sears"
good,I liked selling appliances but the management wasn't that great. I felt like it wasn't very professional there & they made me work hours i didn't want to work.
good,"As a sales associate you must do inventory and change the price tags every week. Be aware of every offer and know every product in store and to come. Do as many sales as you can in order to hit your goal and do your commission. "
good,"It is a equal opportunity company, which is a plus. My day's at Sear's were demanding throughout the day. I learned just about everything about retail and inventory. Management I feel could have did something more to retain the employees they have already, instead of constantly hiring new people. I hire just about any culture, which is a plus for the company. The hardest part of the job was to make the quota for signing up new credit card customers. I like the fact the hours and work was guaranteed."
good,Working at two different Sears offices (Dallas and Hoffman Estates)  I can say that the environment in Hoffman was more relaxed.  I worked with a great group of people.
good,"No two days are the same, because deliveries vary throughout the week. Some days have trucks to unload and others have outbound shipments being picked up. At Sears, We provide curbside pickup for customer's merchandise and this is done while multi-tasking on pulling orders,inventory control and warehouse maintenance. The focus is always on safety and customer satisfaction."
good,I enjoyed the work I did but I felt that I was required to work in different areas without proper compensation. I liked learning the different areas but I would have been better prepared if I had gotten proper training.
good,Loved working here until they closed the door on the store. Great training and Benefits. Pay was really good for the hours put in. Team work between stores was awesome.
good,"I don't care for Sears Company as a whole, but I enjoy the people I work with at my store. I don't agree with them not giving raises to us due to sales performance. I think thats very unfair, especially for the people that don't even work on the sales floor."
good,I enjoy the people I work with. Due to Sears shutting down all over it has taken toll on the ones still open. Management could do better in helping their employees out by giving back more hours.
good,"The job was direct; take the shipment off; unpack and set it up for it to go on the floor; clean up. Once finished with that I would just go off and clean up our area or go to the floor to see if anyone needed help. Management got a little peculiar when they didn't higher the store manager from within in. Especially since we had an awesome assistant store manager who applied for the official job after she had already been doing the job herself. Other than that, the people were great to talk to. The hardest dealing with people not doing the job they should have been doing. Though most of the time i was able to do my own thing."
good,As a Sears Telephone Sales Representative I handled outbound sales calls to newly acquired and established customers. I learned how to read and react to customer information in real time.
good,"call center setting, out bound calls , making appointment for service offered. had to make 10 appointments a day , lots of customers were not interested you have to be pushy"
good,This job is slow paced on most days. You mostly spend your time cleaning and organizing different items. On the holidays it is definitely fast paced. It will keep you on your toes.
good,It was hard work but It gave me the needed experience to balance a heavy workload! I enjoyed working with my team members to help ensure that the customer received the best possible experience.
good,La flexibilité travail/famille était super et horaire constante.
good,"Sears is a very nice company, but it's very slow all through the week which gets a little boring from time to time. The management is ok; They don't really come to your need when you ask them to come to where you work, they rather just call on the phone."
good,Working at Sears was not the best job for me. I was a soft line cashier to different departments. I was always on a cash wrap by myself and it was always hard to get a backup cashier if the line got to long. Sears did teach me to have more interpersonal skills. The hardest part of my job was shrinking my line and getting through credit card applications on a very slow computer system.
good,"A great part of the time Sears was the place to work, the employees and Management was always pleasant quick to help out and be a friend. Mostly I think Sears however has lost some creditably in the general meaning."
good,"It was always slow at work during the weekdays so you found yourself going out of your way to do extra by cleaning things you weren't asked to clean, or organizing shoes and shelf's to help make the place look pretty etc.... I really learned how to give good customer service and how to deal with situations you probably you wouldn't have imagined you ever had to deal with. I also learned how to properly offer credit cards to customers. On Sundays it would typically busy so we were always moving during rush hours."
good,"Overall, my coworkers were awesome. I was constantly feeling pressure to pitch credit cards to customers by the supervisor and if not, I was considered discriminating and other times my hours would get cut."
good,"The store manager was a very hard person to work with. All but 1 manager under her are no longer with the company due to her. I like to enjoy where I work as well as what I do, this was a task."
good,"Loved working for the company in the past. It is a very different company now. For years I was able to spend most of my time working on the floor with the associates, now I am doing tasks and on conference calls."
good,Always something to do or someone to help. Learned how to manage a department. Management is fair but rarely seen. Customers seem to be satisfied with purchases most of the time. Enjoyed the chance to learn retail sales positions.
good,"Learned about a few different areas in Sears like lawn and garden, tools,  retail and you develop friendships . You also earn rewards for getting a lot of people to get the warranty on the product"
good,"The work load is nice, but at times, it can be very slow and become boring. The pay is low, but that can be made up by earning commission on customer sales. The hours were flexible with my school schedule and management is very understanding and kind. The base pay of around $6 / hour seemed way too low and should be increased. The commission rates are too low and don't make up for the money lost from hourly pay."
good,"Great cashiers, very friendly "
good,Pros they are willing to hire regardless of experience level. However i did not enjoy working there because I felt the company or it may have been the managers where not organized.
good,Like any job every day you learn something new and Sears always made sure we advanced with the changes by giving different levels of training. The hardest part was not having enough help.
good,"es una tienda y empresa muy dedicada, desafortunadamente estamos pasando por tiempo dificil donde no es muy redituable el ingreso y las comisiones para nuestros colaboradores, y eso nos lleva a pocas ventas y/o servicio. pero es una tienda nueva y prometedora que pronto alcanzara los mejores indicadores"
good,It is fun to work here. There is an opportunity to learn a great deal if you apply yourself. This is a good place to earn extra money or jumpstart a career.
good,you have to restock shelves and do price check all day. you also have to put up display sets and pull items from the back to place on the shelves. easy to move up
good,"Worked for company while in college part time, later worked full time and then into management. Steady employment for over 30 years."
good,"I grew up going to Sears with my family. My mom worked their when I was 3 years old, I can remember getting our family photos taken and buying school clothes there. But sadly that chapter in American retail is coming to it's end. It's time to move on."
good,"typical day at work is to just Run register, Fold clothing on sales floor and provide customer service."
good,the job was 0kay they were way to cheap to have more people come in and work the weekends our most busiest days. pay sucked also! they make you reach credit card applications or youll get fired
good,Good work environment and positive people. Opportunity for advancement along with competitive pay. Great system in place with a flexible work schedule.
good,The job itself is easy and there is lots of chances to advance the only problem I had was it felt like the job could be gone any day. They were having financial issues and I always felt like it could just be gone any minute.
good,"For me, it was an opportunity to be acquainted with the field of retail sales and merchandizing."
good,"You can essentially pick your hours as a part timer, the managers are respectful and knowledgeable. As long as you get your work done on time you will enjoy your shift. However, the pay is low"
good,I work for Sears in home appliance for over five years the good thing I can say about the company is that trained me in a trade that I was able to take with me to another company.The management team that knew how to actually do the job.
good,I love working in the warehouse .The warehouse is the core of The a store.warehouse is the foundation of any retail store. Although the store was very unorganized I did an excellent job with the help of the hard-working crew and a knowledgeable manager.
good,"Sears was a great job. It had great management, and I was getting great hours. For the most part it was a clean environment, and I enjoyed everyone who worked there."
good,"At the time when I worked for Sears, the environment was pleasant.  The only reason I left was because the position was part-time and full-time positions was not made available. 24 hour work week was the limit."
good,"les echanges quotidiens avec les clients favorisent de nouveaux apprentissages du sens de la communication et la satisfaction ."
good,"great environment to work at, awesome associates. every day i can count on my team to get the work done and not have to worry about any problems or issues."
good,"el ambiente de trabajo es muy bueno existe una cultura laboral muy buena, ética y profesional se te provee de los que requieras para despeñarte al 100."
good,"The average day at sears consisted of a variety of customers. Old and young, foreign and American. I learned to become a better communicator with several different backgrounds. Working at sears taught me several different sales techniques. A lot of the co-workers I worked with were great. Most of us actually became really good friends and we even met up outside of work on several occasions. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the few customers that were rude and difficult to sell to. Lastly, at the end of the day the most enjoyable part of the job was the pay. For a 19-20 year old kid at the time, $600-$700 every two weeks was great."
good,The workforce and external customers are very diverse.  Within the corporate office there are a lot of different types of jobs to help you be able to gain a lot of knowledge.
good,"Its always busy, theres always something to do. Iv'e learned many things like operating the cash registers, handling money, training new cashiers and customer service."
good,"Good management team, friendly co-workers, up-beat leaders. Jobs given to employees may be a little too much at times though."
good,"Working at sears was great. However while working there, the customers were great and loyal; but the managers and supervisors were not so enjoyable. They seem to be very private and sulky almost. I still enjoyed working there being that i interacted with a diverse amount of co-workers and customers."
good,Its an alright place if you dont mind getting yelled and cursed at all day by customers. So of the stats are impossible to meet as well
good,"working for sears call center is a great working environment, they allow you to pick up overtime and also take VTO which is volunteer time off. there's pro and cons working for call centers if you like dealing with customer or enjoy talking this is a great opportunity for you."
good,"llegar a la junta del día"
good,"The job is very easy w/ decent pay. It can be mundane and repetitive, You can learn a great deal about Major retail products, parts, and customers service. The hardest part is dealing with irate customers several times a day as part of the position.The work environment is relaxed, everyone knows everyone therefor it's friendly, and so are most of the managers. The most enjoyable part is solving problems, helping customers and getting positive feed back."
good,"Me gustaba trabajar ahí, pero estar todo el día parado y con muchas horas cuando es venta nocturna y por poco dinero, no tanto."
good,"the auto center was great the management was great to work for, but  the problem you run in to is they treat a service business like a retail business and that not a great way to have a auto garage work."
good,It's an alright job while going to school. It's boring and not very challenging but everyone that works there is very friendly.
good,"the compensation and benefits were good, the work life balance needs improvement as wells as advancement. The job culture and management were good. Company also plays favoritism."
good,Often working at the warehouse in sears you were undermanned or under-equiped to lift certain items on floor. They often required more associates or machinery to lift.
good,"Supportive management, challenging workload but is able to get things going. Enjoyable part working alongside my colleagues."
good,"Sears Auto Center of Laguna Hills Mall had helped me sharpen my mechanical skills and general knowledge of automotive since I graduated with an AS degree in automotive. Work day started by opening up bay doors to a plethora of waiting customers for their vehicles to be serviced. The work was face paced and stressful many times to get the customer in and out with efficiency. The auto store had a database that technicians could use to properly diagnose and repair a vehicle per National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) and vehicle manufacturer standards. The manager was good at leading his team but also stressed at making a profit for the company. The technicians' salary was mainly based on commission with a base pay depending on technician level and ability to pass company automotive tests and training programs. Slow days, even weeks affected pay checks. The most difficult part of the day was getting the customers' vehicles repaired in a timely manner based on what services came first, difficulty of the repairs and availability of parts. What I enjoyed most about the job was the positive and sometimes negative interaction with customers and co-workers, but at the end of the day, customers had their vehicles properly serviced, and co-workers doing a job well done."
good,worked a lot of different shifts and days.  gained variety of automotive skills.  good group of diverse employees.  hated doing tires and batteries but loved alignments.
good,I was provided opportunity to work in all different channels of business throughout the company - from sales to support roles.
good,"Nice place to work. Not so many hours they'll give you, but overall its very clean and has a nice enviorment. Co workers are nice."
good,The staffs and the managers are friendly and patient. I really enjoy working shifts and even talking to the customers. My schedule fits to my school. I'm contented with hours that they give me.
good,Answering calls fast paced environment. Assisting customers with technical issues with their appliance. Loved co-workers overall great place
good,Co-workers and Job are great if it weren't for Offering Credit and enrolling customers in shop your way and if you don't hit the store goal they can terminate you. GM is very rude to associates and doesn't know how to properly run a business. They promote the wrong employees and the one's that work hard are blamed for everything and get told they are not competent to work there and are constantly pulled off machines if they don't get it right. Training is minimal and then you get yelled at if the GM doesn't think you're trying.
good,Its slow but you have to push sales. When its a busy day you have to keep calm because managers and customers are pressuring you to work faster while still able to sell credit and rewards. If you do not meeting the credit sales you start to feel the pressure.
good,Working for this company is great the employees are great the managers were good and understanding. But didn't like when they had to cut hours. Great place to shop.
good,Sears is a great place to develop on one's customer service skills as it avails the opportunity to meet and understand people from diverse backgrounds
good,The pay is what you make it and there is potential for growth. The main problem is the retail schedule which is not the best.
good,Each day I would come in and check with the area sup to see what sections of the warehouse needed the most attention so that in my down time I could improve the function of both the warehouse and product stocking team. Twice a week we would unload a truck of 300+ pieces. While a majority of the remaining week was spent prepping merchandise and increasing the productivity of the warehouse
good,"So much to do in such little time. That is what makes it fun."
good,"it was always fast paced, you never knew what was on the other line, and it was rewarding because i always felt as if i helped someone"
good,"Sear in Rapid City, SD has great management which is what kept me waking up in the morning to come to work every day. The company overall is losing the quality they once had by making their tools over seas now instead of upholding the craftsman made in the US name.  Also the company holds a very high standard for you as a salesman which they make it near impossible to meet your metrics month to month and expect you to practically beg the customer to buy their protection agreement.  If I had to do it again I would work for sears in Rapid City only."
good,Day at work is always try your best at meeting quota. Learned a lot on how to speak to customers and find trends of fraud that was happening. Management was okay. Felt they could have done better with hiring supervisors and create different job titles within the department. Co-workers were the best. Probably because we were young and was fun to talk with them and be silly. Hardest part of the job was not getting recognize for doing the job well. Best thing about my job was getting assigned different tasks but wished the pay went with it.
good,Sears is excellent in providing customer service training and basic cash register training. Management is also very nice and easy going
good,"As a part time employee, this was a great job for an entry level position. I learned  a lot from the company while i was there"
good,"meet as a group then go to trailer to load ,break, load trailer, lunch, load trailer, last break, load trailer till batch is done"
good,Everything about the company is outdated. Thats why sears is always being one-upped by its competitors. Fortunately my store had a great work environment and i had some great coworkers but as far as the company as a whole its just not solid.
good,"Sears Canada is a wonderful place to work. The environment is one in which colleagues are encouraged to be fully engaged, and are offered many opportunities to participate by contributing to the betterment of the company. There are a lot of fun, and team building events within the company. It really does feel like you are part of one big family all striving toward the common core values. Once a week you will have an opportunity to engage your team members and discuss successes, and ideas. I've learned that the environment you work in makes all the difference in the world. The people I work with within the company are caring, understanding, and very talented."
good,Learned a lot from management. They were very helpful and had some good relationships with coworkers. Discounts were good in the store.
good,"Challenging and supportive work environment. Long work hours and including travel time, the average day is 12 hours long."
good,"I've been working at sears for over a year now and a I was a cashier and I am currently a backroom associate. I've learned a lot of skills when it comes to customer service/transactions and I've learned to adapt to new environments rather quickly. It was good while it lasted, but with the departure of our experienced and trained backroom lead, the backroom team has a hard time adjusting to the new lead's rules and expectations, since he has never worked in the backroom prior."
good,Great opportunity to advance within company. Very hands on training.
good,"i worked a seasonal job at sears over winter. as a cashier i was responsible for, Customer service , managing thousands of dollars of revenue, managing returns, and helping with merchandise care. the management wasn't terrible here just a bit confusing i had many managers and could never figure out who to go to for questions. my coworkers seemed very well trained and helped me with questions a lot more then the managers did. the hardest part of this job was selling the sears credit card but i soon realized once you got your sales pitch down you just never give up and well your sure to get some buyers. the most enjoyable part of this job was probably the coworkers they were very nice and easy talk to made some of the management easier to handle."
good,Wonderful people. I have worked for the company for over two years now. They offer development and work with you if you strive to be succesful. I would like to move further in the company if possible.
good,"Busy day on the phones all day; learned to be quick with calls and evaluate the customers concern in order to provide a resolution in a timely manner; managers were always busy in between meetings, team management and making personal calls to valuable managers; co-workers were diverse from many backgrounds and made the workplace fun and enjoyable."
good,At sears I had a very flexible schedule that was molded around my school. I got to practice sales and work with a cash register.
good,"i learned to be on my feet and learn everything myself because management was not able to help me. The worst thing about the job was the management because they could not help you and never took responsibility for their own actions. The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers. They made it fun to be there. There was nothing hard about the job, just the time they give you to get a certain job down."
good,As an employee in Sears you learn the importance for going over and beyond for your job. This job taught me that in order to succeed within your outside life and work you need to give and do your best in everything you do. Not only did that help to do my job it made me want to always want to go over and beyond in serving my community in and outside of work.
good,Learning experience plus management there was no downside to this job other than compensation.
good,"Got good exposure in managing inventory, merchandising and handling customer inquiries"
good,"Helping customers with every need that they might have including assembling their merchandise."
good,"L’expérience de travail chez Sears est agréable, mais les problème financiers de l'entreprise ont nuis ces derniers temps."
good,"very great associates, horrible management, horrible scheduling, everyone doesn't get what they want or nearly what they want, managers choose favorites, nothing gets done on time, poor communication, i would not recommend working here."
good,Sears was a nice place to work for the people were really nice.  However the pay was horrible. For the amount of experience I have they wanted to pay me $8.50
good,"Management and maintanence is who you must watch at all times.."
good,"My tipical day here would start at 9:30pm to 10pm.i would clock in, say hello to my coworkers and to see wheremy manager would post me or have me roaming around the nightclub. Put my ear piece and walky talky on."
good,"Company was okay, Management was great. The salary was not the greatest."
good,"It was a good job and I would go work there again if need be, but I would prefer a job with less management shift and uncertainty. Easy enough job as a salesman, but you are required to add to try to push programs and credit cards that aren't helpful to the customer. Talking with the co-workers was a good time and I really enjoyed getting to know them and there are a lot of good people working there. Overall it was a good experience."
good,"Meeting and greeting customers. Making sure that the standards of the store are within guidelines at all times. Keeping management intune with what customers are saying and working together to come up with how we can accomodate what customers were asking for."
good,"Receiving clerk. Checked in merchandise and deliveries as well as put items out on the floor. "
good,"Resurtir la mercancía, hacer display con esta atender a los clientes que llegaban al departamento, recibir mercancía."
good,"At sears, i was able to grow as a sales associate. Plus, the management team was qualified, and they had the best coaching skills. Which created in return a productive work place. The hardest part of the job, was dealing with escalations: Such as complaints due to poor service by a new associates or damaged parts during delivery. The most enjoyable part was making sales, doing trouble shootings, and having lunch with my co-workers."
good,"Typically the afternoon team would unload and load as much small ticket (housewares, clothes) as we could in a set time frame. It was my responsibility to judge how much we could do and encourage and work with the associates to achieve the target. I learned valuable management principals such as the service model, whereby you treat everyone as though they are your customer. All the way from your newest subordinate to the VP of the company. The hardest part of the job was having to discipline and coach adult workers on their attitudes. The management of the warehouse are open to your questions and willing to help you learn and become better at your job."
good,"Bon environnement de travail "
good,"Good job, just not enough hours for me right now. Looking for a full time job with benefits and right now I'm only part time and not sure when I will get transitioned to full time."
good,This was my first commission job and handled all the pressure that comes with a very up and down pay check.
good,"A typical day consist of selling and doing stock."
good,Fast paced service industry. Multi-tasking daily routine for both business and customer comitments.
good,"liked company a lot. there were great managers, and great ways to service customers."
good,"Sears had a wonderful training program, it was a time when they truly valued their employees and customers."
good,"Arriving to Sears clocking in with fellow workers,planning routes to making customers service calls, calling customers to make formal arrival arrangements and discuss work/repairs to be performed and arrival times.Management made all expected arrangements to techs. to complete their jobs.Co workers were helpful in meeting the needs of fellow workers if help was needed while in the field and in the office.The hardest part of the job was not being able to complete some of the customers jobs due to scheduling restraints.The best part of my job was being able to repair the customers equipment and seeing their happiness and complementing me on a job well done."
good,"a good learning experience, from sales to serving clients, management very friendly, co-workers always a helping hand, I'am a fast learner, so nothing hard about my job. most enjoyable about my job, everything"
good,"Typical day at work would be done typically doing busy work like cleaning the cash registers and organizing the floor while waiting for customers to come to the department. When you get a customer you ask them the usual explorer questions to find out what they want, need, and can afford and try to find the right Television/Game system/Audio system for them."
good,"Security/loss prevention has, indeed, been my favorite job title to date. To come in to work to contribute in helping protect the companies assets, along with the safety of our customers and employees. Every day, it is my job to maintain a visual on, not only shoppers, but our employees as well. My coworkers in our department are very friendly and easy to get along with. My manager is strict, but at the same time, is lenient and knows how to make our job an enjoyable workplace. The hardest part of my job is not knowing what each apprehension may hold. Whether the subject may have a weapon on him or not, never knowing if my life could be in danger. Certainly, the most enjoyable part of my job is when shoplifters are prosecuted."
good,"I worked with the company for 30 years, the company has changed alot over the last 10 years. Each store is different depending on the management staff . At Mount Dora Fl. the team was excellent. We all worked hard together to have a great store. The hardest part of my job was working within a tight budget and covering the sales floor. The best part was working with all of my coworkers and customers. "
good,"I have spent 9 years of my life at Sears Teleserv.  I began in the Parts Sales department and quickly advanced to the Customer Care organization where I excelled at meeting and exceeding the needs of customers that were oftentimes already disappointed in their experience.  I made it my personal goal to ensure that I turned our customer's attitude around and provided them with the knowledge that our company stands by its products and customers!"
good,"A typical day was working on many different types of vehicle systems. I am state certified in the areas of: brakes, steering and suspension, electrical, heating and cooling, and engine systems. Those were the main areas I would fix on vehicles."
good,"Go to work  set up and answer calls all day."
good,"Opening of the cash register,the processing of all transaction that involves the register though out the shift.There is a on going of training on  work processers and company policies. The management is ready to help with any area from help with a register issure to the locateing of an item for a customer.My co-worker a great at helping  each other in need of assitance.My most enjoyabe part of my job is working with customers to make sure that they have a WOW experience while shopping."
good,"a typical day at work- is helping the customers"
good,"Start at 7:00 am,count the safe and set up registers.Have quick meeting with starting employees.Help with any dept that is short handed with customers.do deposit,and reports. learned to multitask and come up with solution to any problems. Know your employees treat them with respect, and you will receive respect and help with  anything you ask them to do.The hardest part of the job was knowing and when to draw the line between business and friendship.The best part in working as a team,and enjoying joking around on our breaks,on nice days passing a football,or having cake for birthdays."
good,On typical day it is slow but during weekends and holidays it is hectic. I learned to become a better communicator as well as a overall great teammate. Management does their job great. Co workers are fun and get down to business when it is time to work. Hardest part about the job is dealing with customers who are the just the weirdest ones and you just have to put up with them always with a smile on your face. Most enjoyable part about my job is meeting the most interesting people that come in to shop.
good,"A typical day at work starts with myself clocking in. I then wait around for customers to show up which happens pretty fast. Then when I do tend to a customer I enter their information into the TPOS system and look up their vehicles Maintenance service interval information to suggest other services before the technicians actually tends to the customers vehicles and offer their own suggestions. Once the technician looks at a vehicle, they then report back to me to tell me what suggestion they may have for me to relay back to the customer. However before I see the customer I need to create an estimate for the cost of the services suggested, this is when I have to call around to get the best prices for parts, and log into AllData to apply the appropriate Labor for these services suggested. Now once I tell the customer what was suggested then the customer decided whether they would like the service done or not. If the customer agrees to have the service done, then I proceed to order parts. Once the entire job is done I then contact the customer assuming they have left to let them know that their vehicle is done, and then when they come in to pick up I bill the customer out of our system and then repeat this process with other customers."
good,I have worked at Sears for over 8 years and I have advanced several times and have been given opportunities for further advancement in the company. I have been satisfied for the most part with my time at Sears
good,Sears is a good place to work. Learned alot since I've been there. Overall I do enjoy working there
good,"my department got better support from higher including having new fixtures which helps a lot more better in keeping the area tidy, lot of old people who works long in a company as well and thus decrease the effectivity of them as a worker.Management people is fun to be with and very helpful but i don't get good training as far as i concern. My pay is lower than i expected for the volume of the area im managing."
good,Sears was a great place to work . I learned so much each and every day of working there I was egared to learn more about the company. I love helping people with trying to decice the right color or the perfect outfit. The management staff were so caring and love to find ways to help out their emplyees.. The Hardest part of me working there would have to be that I never could not learn to much.
good,I was a merchandise and customer assistant during my time in Sears. I learned the process of receiving and displaying merchandise in order to satisfy the general public consumer needs.
good,"While in this position some of my duties included unloading inventory, taking inventory to the sales floor, and providing customer service. While at this job I learned that I want to be able to have a job with a salary and full time benefits. This job was an overall learning experience and great for a seasonal position."
good,"I really liked my job there and most of the people. The only thing I didn't like was my manager. She was extremely rude. I let her know I was 6 months pregnant during my interview. However, on my 90 days, about 3 weeks before I was due, I left early to go to the hospital because I had terrible back labor and I thought I might be in labor. While I was at the hospital getting my contractions monitored, I received a text message from my manager saying not to come back to work because I didn't qualify for maternity leave. I was devastated. Despite the fact I had to deal with my manager daily, I loved my job and it shows a negative on my resume and applications because technically I was ""fired"". I would definitely work there again given the opportunity though."
good,"A typical day at work as a MCA includes price verifications, cleaning up and setting up the floor, restocking, occasionally using the cash registers, helping customers order or find products."
good,Good job to start at. It was a family friendly job with wonderful co-workers and managers. I learned my multi-tasking skills from this job plus my patience.
good,Great and friendly coworkers
good,A day at Sears is like a business with its goals and hopes set high with disappointment at the end. We made through each day with the little business with customers who were sometimes at pleasure to be around. Co-workers were nice but we were all focus ; focus on one goal at the need on the day we could make our store wide company proud of our success but it was never enough sometimes because we always had one goal that never got succeed so we were focus on what was next but never final. It was nice to work around so many aspiring people.
good,It was an adjustment having to move from Kmart to Sears it was an overall positive experience learning the company. I liked my co-workers they were like my second family we all worked as a team. What i had learned is that every company has a way of running there business there was always a change of doing things that sometimes would be hard to adjust only because sometimes it would be a weekly thing but always kept that positive attitude. The best part of my job were the customers some were really really nice and it was always nice to see them everyday and also helping customers who always had a nice story to share. The hardest part was knowing that after working with people for over 20 yrs that our store was closing and that i wouldnt be seeing this people in the mornings but we still keep in touch.
good,"Typical day at work - fast paced, friendly customers and co-workers."
good,I learned the equipment and computer skills needed to do the average work in a warehouse setting.
good,Management was easy to get along with but were very hard to please with the everyday goals set by them. Co-workers were some-what easy to get along with. Lots of drama with several of them and it reminded me of a high school at certain parts. Had good hours with them. Worked around my schedule so I could work all of my scheduled hours.
good,low pay for alot of work. Liked my job didn't like that i work long hours and my pockets were not benefiting from it
good,"Arrive 30 minutes before shift begins to collect all needed supplies to insure smooth work flow for the day and also count currency drawer. As shift begins greet and thank customers for choosing specific retail store to purchase merchandise. Assist in numerous departments during my down time to ensure all staff was comfortable through out the daily shift. Assist customers with merchandise look up weather on the sales floor or having to order online with our Store to Home software. Relieve staff for lunches as well as cash drops for shift change. Keep a clean, and pleasant atmosphere to ensure customers feel they are receiving sincere customer service."
good,Research and Development for seats for large construction and mining equipment. Help develop a new chassis for construction seat.
good,"Overall work would always be interesting, we always had new challenges. I learn how to talk to different people and still give the best customer experience to each and every customer. I learn so much from my co-workers as we always work as a team. Sometimes it would be frustrating when management would not be able to help you in different customer issues or cutting staff which would make customers really mad. What made all this better were the picnics we would have or the gift cards we would received for creating more sales and avoiding fraud transactions."
good,i enjoyed working at sears management was great they really care about their employees great if your looking for something part time hours are part time and pay is min. wage
good,"Though the pay is not competitive, I will admit that the training is pretty thorough. Starting out I knew about loss prevention due to my previous experience in the field but at Sears I was able to go beyond a basic job description. As I wanted to learn more and get deeper into the investigations and building the partnerships needed to succeed it was all supported by my manager. In other jobs I have been told to ""not worry about that"" or ""that is not for you to get into"" and felt that I was being held back. With my manager I was able to learn and take upon a leadership role without resistance. I was given the opportunity to train new hires and develop a culture in the office of mutual respect and a camaraderie that I wish to bring to my next place of employment."
good,"I have only worked their 3months the co-workers are so nice everyone is very helpful and try to progress in the business the management is very helpful the only thing that is more important to them then customer service is credit card applications and their shop your way if you are not at their goal they drop your hours, even if you are a reliable worker are there on time everyday dont call out cover for other people i think it is unfair"
good,"Working in consultative sales, I have learned how to deal with difficult situations in a professional manner, as well as reaching the customers overall needs. I have learned how to interact with customers and raise my interpersonal skills that will benefit me greatly in my career."
good,"I learned the insides and out of the Retail business, it's hard but can be handled with honest work and great customer service."
good,Becaus of the uncertainty of their future cannot get enough hours to make job worthwhile
good,Low pay with fixed pay rates covered expenses by working 2nd job
good,"It was fun, High energy and very professional, I would recommend this to people. It was a very nice place to work and I would say the people met from when i was a cashier were very fun."
good,I have never enjoyed a job or workplace more than at SEARS. The people were awesome and the work was fun. It just needs a more solid structure.
good,The only time you really see customers was on Black Friday. Otherwise you see a max of 3 customers a day. Alot of the job was cleaning displays and reorganizing.
good,"Sears is a company that can be a bit demanding when it comes to its Sales Associate positions. For starters, they use a commission system for pay (was not fun being my first job), and you essentially need to strive ahead of your coworkers in order to get a good profit. Its interesting to me though how they had utilized iPads and other technology to simplify things for both customer and associate, giving personal sales statistics and a portable checkout system for customers. Besides this though, this is job well suited for people with social tendencies, as reaching out and communicating is a key component for success in this job."
good,They closed down in Canada so doesn’t really matter. But working there was great. I was part time and a student and my manager was nice. It’s slow paced depending on the city you are in. Unless they are having sales then it’s crazy. Changing rooms are always a mess. Overall not bad.
good,El ambiente laborar no es nada sano no tienes oportunidad de crecer ya que dan preferencia a personal nuevo que a los que cue tan con más tiempo trabajando
good,I like working at sears because of the working environment.  it was fun and sometimes there have games for productivity. They like you to be productive at all times.
good,Collaborative Work with Team members to get the job accomplished. Culture of Co Workers was excellent. Pay was good and benefits. Learned more of the financial side then previous emloyer
good,"The people at Sears were great to work for.  The management was understaffed, but very nice people. I tried my best to help out where I could, even if it wasn’t in my department."
good,"My store manager was great to work for.  The area managers and higher was another story.  I am sure they Had to follow guidelines themselves and it wasn't entirely their fault.  "
good,"It is like any other retail job out there. The managers I worked under were nice and understanding. Once I became a manager, not a whole lot changed. The culture is ok, but being retail means a lot of nights and weekends which I simply did not want."
good,Inside and out side sales. scheduled measures with new customers for carpet or hardwood flooring. going to customers homes and measure for carpet or flooring.
good,cut hours in department had to go. one of my favorite jobs though. no experience was minimum wage. exhilarating experience. just hours and pay were lacking.
good,Very hands on I did sell but I did not get hired as a comission base pay employee so the urge for me to sell was not there while other employees was there to sell at high desire
good,es una empresa que re quiere hacer mas por los empleados
good,sears has changed alot it was a great place to work but cutting crew to the bone not getting people help the need. I loved working at Sears under the mangement they had.
good,"Friendly and knowledgeable staff."
good,"Good company, but went out of business. Hours were cut and it was hard to maintain sales goals. Staff was also cut greatly making it hard to take care of customers in a timely manner."
good,"i would clock in clean my register and start helping customers, clean workplace and persuade people into signing up for credit cards then take lunch break. during closing time i had to count up money"
good,I was only at Sears on a part time basis my schedule flex waited Bay water me to work holidays a lot would little to no time off. Series did a good job walking around my full time schedule.
good,"We were vigilant in our duties, always watching out for customer opportunities to attempt to steal merchandise from the store. We made apprehension and processed when necessary."
good,This was a seasonal job for me.  I enjoyed the relaxed pace and it was a friendly work environment that offered me the flexibility to have time off for family activities.
good,"This job was a good working experience, however management could have been more on top of things and willing to help customers more. I found myself reaching out to customers who desperately wanted someone to help them with their merchandise and answer questions about returns, something management lacked to do."
good,Ugh.....not the best place if you really want to be paid well.  But a great place to gain experience.  The talent pool is shallow so advancing is quite easy
good,"Come in open store, help customers with point of sale. Help customer find what they came in for. I learned lots working for Sears and would have went back if they did not close all their stores."
good,"I had a wonderful time working with this company. Managers are great and genuinely care about you and your success. Fast paced call center, over 60/90 calls a day"
good,"Typical Day at Work: Usually slow paced work allowed for a very diligent effort with maintaining professionalism with focus being primarily on the customer satisfaction. "
good,I didn't like how they trained you you it was all computer based. I didn't like how they just threw you somewhere with no training but you have to be a fast learner. it was all commission. I love the employees there but you have have your days there. with the new manger things have gotten a little better.
good,"I liked that the staff was nice, most of the time. They worked around your schedule when you needed and they make sure you get your breaks. It’s a regular retail environment and nothing super special or bad about it. Sears in general had their ups and downs because of business going bad."
good,Had to handle cash and work with customers. While working with customers had to suggest signing up for rewards program and credit cards. Had to keep a clean area and move to different parts of the store.
good,The job is stressful and they expect a lot from you with little pay. I didn't mind it so much because I knew I have to start from the bottom to work your way up. I needed to gain experience to be able to work in place that I want too.
good,"Overall role, managers, and coworkers have been outstanding. Great experience and exposure to new and quickly changing business needs. Ultimately the company remains unprofitable, causing a somewhat stressful environment for employees and management."
good,"My job was part-time.  Overall I enjoyed my work and my associates.  Unfortunately,  the Sears Store at Macomb Mall closed."
good,sears is a very family friendly environment with very stable job security but at them same time benefits  you have to pay for and the pay scale until you advance high is not the best.
good,"Great place to work, depending on your skill level, and again, very flexible in regards to scheduling. A great place to work and management is very supportive and understanding of their employees' needs."
good,"I would walk around fixing the clothing, greet customers and sell products. The hardest thing was selling credit because many people did  not want to open a card. I enjoyed talking to customers when they came in."
good,"Have a good management, a very good place to work. Good communication, good customer service. Good managers, they have a very flexible schedule. Loved to work there."
good,"It's iight. But the hours aren't there that much. I mean I applied for full time, and it's like I'm a on call employee. It's kinda hard to balance with your everyday life because you don't know when they'll call you."
good,typical day at work involved working on vehicles and diagnosing the problems they had.  I learned a lot through this company and how they have helped me grow as a person and a automotive tech.  Management was ok.  Nothing really to hard about this job.  Most enjoyable would be working with the people.
good,Not much to do here boring not well paid. Overall didn't seem like the job for me. The hours were flexible but didn't work too well with my school schedule.
good,"I work in appliances with several other salespeople. Depending on who you work with, it could either be a very nice job, or a cut throat sea of jealousy, distrust, retribution, back stabbing, and acrimony.  Your pay can depend on the weather, how your reaction time compares to the coworkers surrounding you, what shifts you work, and of course, your own talent and experience.  Your paycheck can drop in half from one check to the next.  Pay has been seen to decline substantially over time, and the company is steadily evaporating as stores close.  Store management has been generally good, but the corporation sometimes seems to be run by out of touch lunatics."
good,"friendly environment"
good,Nice place to work if you are good at talking on the phone and able to deal with situations to calm people down. There are alot of nice employees once you get to know them.
good,"el amiente es agradable, aunque aveces es un poco estresante ya que ay personas que hacen que el ambente sea pesado, en cuanto al la cultura de la empresa lo recalcan continuamente"
good,Good company to learn and a fun environment to work in. Have to work with customers to resolve issues. Hardest part is talking with management to understand problems
good,"As a cashier a typical day for me consists of checking out customers for purchases, returns/exchanges, card payments etc, assisting customers with questions and helping them find items, going out and cleaning/organizing items on the floor and promoting the rewards program. Management is very friendly, the hardest part of the job is definitely the high pressure/emphasis on promoting the rewards program. If you don't hit at least 80% rewards usage (as in 8 out of 10 customers using or signing up for the rewards program) you're basically told its unacceptable/you're failing at your job. The most enjoyable part I suppose is chatting with other co-workers and the associate discount."
good,Sears in my experience was a great place to work even tho they get a bad wrap.. I was able to work hard and prove that I deserved a promotion witch I ended up getting
good,Good experience being that is was something that i actually enjoyed. Being a salesperson working on commission made for a competitive environment. Great culture for those interested in sales.
good,"Sears has a great corporate culture, but is struggling to succeed. The work-life balance is good, but management decisions are short-sighted. If they can transform themselves into a stronger online presence, they will do well."
good,"La empresa como tal cuenta con medidas de seguridad implecable y excelente trato, sin embargo los descuentos realizados sobré el salario llega ser demasiado excesivos."
good,"Empresa extricta y justa en algunos casos, apegados al programa crece, cien por cierto cultural."
good,All basic tasks take longer than they should. Too many places to pull information that is required. I have never worked for a company that makes everything so complicated.
good,Easy job. Easy system to learn with minimal problems. The management could be better in terms of hsndeking situations. But overall an easy job to gain experience.
good,sears was not a suitable work place for  me .i would tell anyone to get hired there especially KMART might be the reason they were closed down.the managing there was crazy and out of order .i just never knew what to expect from them.happy they are closed if you ask me.the most enjoyable part of kmart was working in little ceasars . the hardest part was being blamed for something that we CASHIERS couldnt control.
good,"Processed online orders and warranty replacement on appliances."
good,es buen trabajo aprendes a lidiar con el cliente y manejar tanto dinero como mercancia ofrecer creditos y superacion personal.
good,A typical day for me is coming and setting the ad to make sure that the prices are right for the customers. My day also consists of making sure that the department is cleaned and presentable for people to shop.
good,"Las actividades del puesto auxiliar administrativo son muy variadas van desde ver muestrario, dar de alta artículos, realizar cambios de precio promocional y fijos, realizar devoluciones, trasferencias,etc, el puesto en general es muy bueno sin embargo el ambiente laboral no lo es."
good,Sears is a great environment everyone greets you. managers are helpful they all come around and speak to everyone. you get on 15 min break and a 30 min lunch.
good,Giving an up to date sales report to all associates and a score on customer service was not the only was to start a day at the company. A warm spirited thank you for their hardwork was always given before hand.
good,"We scheduled work to be done on lawn and garden,snow removal, and vacuum cleaners, etc. Also provided parts to walk-in customers and answered questions regarding products."
good,"Clocking into work, I would get on my safety belt for heavy lifting and check the forklift to make sure it was safe and operational. During the day we would run customer orders to them through the bay keeping it under 5 minutes otherwise they would get a 5 dollar coupon. I learned that teamwork is key when it comes to customer service because there isn't one person who knows everything. My coworkers were friends of mine after a while and I really enjoyed hanging out with them outside of work."
good,Place is good to work for when your in college however when you don't sell anything you don't make money and traffic is not the same in the store anymore.
good,"learned sales techniques "
good,"As I loved the job I did, It gave me to opportunity to make a difference in working environment that I affected. My ability to interact with the working staff and associates allowed me to share my work experience as well as my knowledge. "
good,Pues aprendí mucho ya que fue mi primer trabajo en donde aprendí el trató directo con el cliente y aprendí a manejar registradora.a haser inventarios y muchas cosas nuevas para mi.
good,"Typical day- Delivery and Logistic Issues that need to be solved. "
good,"I didn't feel like my job was secure as it could have been. As a cashier, you have credit card application goals that have to be met, or you will loose your job."
good,"Great Co-workers, 9-6, enjoyed customer interaction, the management team above store manager were average."
good,"Little growth potential unless you are will to relocate to corporate in Hoffman.  Good management team, great co-workers and each day has something different to offer."
good,"I enjoyed my time here. The pay was not great at all. The medical was very expensive, but they did pay half.  They were always able to work with me on my schedule, and most everyone I worked with were great people."
good,"Each day was different, the customers were faithful and most families came in every year. Co-workers helped each other and if there was an issue another location could help. Working hands on with glasses and insurances taught me how to code and file claims in a timely manner. The hardest part was the stress level, if an order was shipped wrong or came in late people would become irate and it was our job to smooth those complaints or concerns."
good,"Working in coordination with the entire management team, you oversee all aspects of the daily store operations.  It is a challenging but enjoyable position."
good,sears call center is a great opportunity if you enjoy talking to customer and giving great customer service also if you enjoy making sales dealing with retail.
good,"I enjoy my job however we haven't had a raise in years and we keep closing stores."
good,"Ive learned alot since working at sears, alot of the skills ive learned there I think have helped me gain more experience in warehouse work"
good,I advanced quickly and efficiently the training was quick which sometimes left you out of the loop but overall i like the people i work with
good,take inbound calls about product availability and schedule appointments. Offer add on sales or warranties. learn different software but mainly worked off the website just a customer would if they were at their own house.
good,"I would go an review our numbers from the day before. Check my work email and get caught up with any changes that are going to be made. Then we would have a store meeting and after that we would start our day. I would go and check all my departments and let everyone know if there was any one thing I need them to work on, Next  I would work on merchandising the floor, price mark downs and help the customers. I learned that you can not please everyone but you should always do your best to make customers happy. The hardest part of this job was just missing a lot with my kids. I do love the customers."
good,Great place to work and learn but Not Staple. Great people with great attitude. As long as you do your job no one will ask you any questions. You can work from home many times a month.
good,"fast learner, get along with peers, great with people, never late, always staying busy at work, learned to work with computers as a tool, always get along with management, hardest part of the job is to handle escalated call (angry people) and the most enjoyable part of the job would be my peers"
good,It was a amazing job I just at the time couldn't work it do to family oriented reasons but other wise I would work it again if I had the chance to work at sears again.
good,"I very much enjoyed working on the sales team at Sears Outlet.The management team was more than supportive and I feel as though I learned a lot of quality job experience there.My co-workers were of all backgrounds which made each day fun and educational as well. I was in commissioned sales therefor my daily routine consisted primarily of providing excellent customer service,one on one contact and care to customers needs and always closing the sale!"
good,"I loved the people i worked with, but the requirements for cashier can be very painful. Checking people out requires lots of questions that often irritate and bother customers, and some get vulgar/ upset at you for this."
good,A typical day at work is easy. Your co-workers help make your day go by faster. Management is great at times. The Hardest part of the job would be having so much to do and so little time because your hours are cut.
good,Overall I enjoyed working at Sears. The management team was pretty awesome. They are ALL about culture which makes the job more fun! One thing I did not like about it as the unexpected changes. They could switch your pay structure with only two weeks notice. And also you may have to deal with a lot of upset customers for something that delivery or the repair team did. I loved how they always made you feel like a great big family though.
good,"There is opportunity to grow within this company. I was promoted from store level to corporate level, and now given opportunity to explore various channels of the business from a health & safety stand point."
good,Giving customers the best customer service. Greeting and being able to interact with people. Holiday time was the best to me and the rush for all the customers. Handling large amounts of money with no shortages or overages.
good,"A typical day for me would be checking emails & sales reports, working freight, and providing customer service. "
good,Took inbound calls and handled changes in schedules for customers. Great work environment and training was very informative. Wasn't that strict on dress code but had one you had to follow. Sat down all day but job had windows to look through that lit the call room up and made it a bright energetic place to work.
good,"good company to work for. reliable, management good. good coworkers. good work life balance and steady work flow. big company"
good,Sales job is always frustrating but it helps to deal with people in future. This job is actually a life changing experience for me. Co-workers are usually very supportive and the hardest part of the job is dealing with management. The CEO has little to no knowledge about the company.
good,"A typical work day at Sears in the footwear department would be making sure customers are well taken care of and sales are efficient. I've learned a lot working in the footwear department like completing sales, knowing how to stock and arrange shoes accordingly, and search for shoes as well. The management at Sears provides a good workplace. The managers are caring and reasonable and so are my coworkers. The hardest part of the day would be getting a shipment of shoes and unloading them into location. I would say the most enjoyable part of the day would be satisfying a customer and being able to get them what they need."
good,Call centers only have so much to offer. The pay was great and so were the people. Hardest part was talking to upset customers and trying to keep sane. Overall it was a great job for someone who isn't very active and loves people.
good,Sears is actually a great place to work. The people there are mostly nice and friendly. A typical day at work is pretty busy as you're trying to assist customers with their appliances. I learned a lot about kitchen appliances and how to fix most of them. The hardest part of the job would have to be convincing people that it was in their best interest to let me assist them with fixing the problem over the phone. The most enjoyable part was helping that customer and not sending a truck out.
good,"A typical day at work consist of Sales I did not have a problem with inform and educating customer of some the opportunities and benefits of obtaining a Sears credit card. However I did not appreciate having to drive customers to apply for them in order to keep my position as a Cashier. I learned sale strategies to increase sales within the company every month.My co-workers were always helpful ,and we worked as a team to achieve company goals. The hardest part of my job was not over achieving my goals to become a manager. The most enjoyable part of my job was being apart of a team oriented workplace."
good,"As a cashier, you start off the day by opening the cash register and/or ending it the same way depending on the time of your shift. I've gained experience on how to deal with customers in a cordial manner. All co-workers were very helpful in training and even afterwards; there's a very friendly atmosphere there at Sears. All co-workers of mine never failed to help with a question or concern. The only thing I've had difficulties with were contacting the manager in regards to some issues customers had with their merchandise and dealing with rude customers. Apart from that, I thoroughly enjoyed handling the cash register, packaging the purchases of customers and communicating with customers as well. Everyone there pulled their own weight and was responsible. Overall, Sears is a great place to work."
good,"Sears was a great place to work, with a productive and friendly atmosphere with great benefits  and good opportunities  to move up in the company for the part time employees.  The management was easy going and worked well with all of the employees to try to fit the personal and professional needs.  A typical day would count the registers to open,  make sure the store was nice and clean, help unload the truck, and set the displays and assisted customers in to fit there needs."
good,Hard to advance in the company as well as see future with poor management decisions.
good,"The job work/life balance was great was able to have flexibility with the hours we worked"
good,"J'occupe le poste d'adjointe ressources humaines depuis juillet 2011. Ce poste comporte beaucoup de tâches et responsabilités. Cela me fait plaisir d'occuper ce poste, car chaque jour je cumule diverses expériences et connaissances."
good,Overall a decent place to work. Easy work.....however pay is low.
good,"it was a really good company to work for, the job atmosphere was stready, everyone kinda just did their own thing."
good,"The best parts of the job were the environment and level of autonomy. "
good,"I learned how to assist costumers when shopping, also how to mark prices down and organize all the store. My co-workers were really nice and considerate. The hardest part of my job was being able to assist many costumers at the same time, but this was my favorite part of my work as well."
good,"-Unloaded freight trucks. "
good,"aprendi a actuar de acurdo a lo correcto, es ese caso para la empresa y para beneficiarme a mi por medio de mi trabajo por medio de la comunicación y el trabajo en equipo."
good,"pick up 53 ft trailers and deliver to the stores"
good,"I did enjoy this job, however I had to commute from Greensboro to High Point on the city bus and that became very stressful towards my health after so long. I enjoyed the people I worked with and my manager was always fun and easy to talk to. The hardest part of the job was trying to convince an irate customer that they need to purchase a protection agreement for an appliance that needs to be fixed."
good,"Customer call in wanting service for their garage door/garage door openers set up times to go and repair.  Customer call in complain about techs, appointments.  I call customers with dates for us to go out their cancel appointments..  Listen to irrate customers"
good,"Fun place to work.  Not good on pay. Management was great and there were opportunities for advancement.  When you discover you can make almost double for a similar job, even advancement does not seem appealing."
good,"worked at Sears part-time for a year, gained the best retail experience. Friendly environment, best co-workers. Although management occasionally spy on the employees in groups. Very good structured business, amazing in training."
good,I really enjoyed working at sears but I couldnt pay the bills.
good,It was not bad once one figures out the way everyone worked . At first it was confusing. I did like working the stockroom best. The time to get the merchandise to the customer from the back room was a bit short if the coworkers could not be found when needed. My first mistake was trying to do it my self because I did not know how to page anyone. That was a learning experience.
good,"coming in perparing my station for customer's, cleaning and purging so the paint can come out perfect everymorning. learned exciting ways to mix paint, change colors get to pick out colors or suggest paints. the assitant managers were sometimes not very easy to work with. we always worked with eachother to make our days better always works as family we built so many relationships with one-another"
good,worked as a footwear sales associate/cashier. pay wasn't significant but managers and coworkers were fun to deal with and had reasonable hours during the day. had to ring transactions and keep offering credit cards which was my least favorite part bc its part of your job performance quota. plus you get a very good discount on clothes as an employee if you shop and work at sears
good,working everyday delivering its fun I learned how to installed stoves fridges washers dryers treadmills the most enjoyable part of my jod was driving.
good,job was very good. management was very helpful but the volume of the stores were to slow.
good,"See the excitement in my Team Manager for us workers to make money for the company. Talking to customers and ordering parts, learning new parts, as well as listening to a story they have to say is an amazing experience. Therefore, you have a great day. Co-workers are amazing, energizing and fun. The hardest part of the day is when you are making the sales that you fight your hardest for. Making money for myself, the company, and being competitive with my co-workers is always the fun part of the day."
good,"Management had a extreme lack of knowledge of the brand central department. When customers are unsatisfied, management will make associates handle issues in which they have no authority of improving.(Example: Customer wants to return product because of failure but the associate has no authority to do so without management approval) Co-workers were great. The most enjoyable part of the job was lunch time. Corporate decided to cut funding for cleaning crew and would try to have appliance sales associates clean there area consistently when associates are paid on commission only. "
good,"-Flexible schedule"
good,"Went through a management turnover.  It was my first sales job and I chose to break myself in doing a commission only position.  I caught on quick; however, Sears in general is not doing well.  That is the hardest part of the job...customer turnover.  I have worked there for a year now.  "
good,"Look up daily sales and company goals for the week."
good,"Sears was my first job, a job that I worked, on average of 20 hours per week during my college career. I've meet a lot of great people there, but since graduating college, i am eager to start a real civil engineering job and show a firm my true abilities."
good,"es una buena empresa me gustaba trabajar ahí, te condicionan tu delfín (dos días de descanso) el salario un poco bajo, trabajan todos los días del año sin esepcion, tiene todas las prestaciones de ley,"
good,"The 3 years I've been working for Sears have been a great experience with customer service, overall people skills, and fast paced work. My manager has always worked well with my school schedule and been fair to all employees. Now that I'm finished with school for now, I need to make a higher wage than minimum wage and Sears can't accommodate this so it is time for a change."
good,"permitian el desarollo del personal, con capasitasion constante, y buen ambiente de trabajo inter departamental"
good,Sears is an great work place. Sears is full of opportunity and a pleasure to work for!!!!
good,Great incentive program! You were almost guaranteed a pay out each month.
good,"Management seemed to be slow and unproductive but helpful at times. Pay was minimum wage. Hardest part, selling credit cards at 25% interest."
good,Sears was a lot of new learning and paperwork that I didn't have much experience with. But it was good i learned how to do shipping recieving.
good,"Sizing merchandise, placing inventory merchandise on salesfloor, waiting on customers, communication skills, and making friends whether it be in the workplace and/or customer aknowledgement."
good,Typical day at work was good.
good,"Call Center,Customer service on inbound calls for retail support,answering questions, placing orders over phone, checking product inventory."
good,When i come in help out customer's if we do not have the product in i order online.Management is good i get along with my co-workers very well.the hardest part of my job is when the product is no longer available. the enjoyable part of my job when all of my customer's leave.
good,"It is a great place to start. I worked during the holidays so it was either very face paced and busy, or extremely boring and slow. Don't recommend it if you can't be on your feet."
good,"I enjoyed working here and met great people. I wish I could have stayed longer, but had to leave because of family issues."
good,I was a sales person plus sale lead where I had to open and close the store. Making deposits and especially making sells and helping customer with their need for appliances
good,"A typical day at work would have been scanning and organizing shoes according to the checksheet. Scanning and stocking whatever freight came in, and as well as helping cutomers in need with shoe sizes and location as well as online orders. Lastly, filling out and correcting weekly reports and shoe plans. My coworkers were quite nice and friendly, the hardest part of doing this job would have been finding the missing shoes and correcting them on the weekly reports. The most enjoyable part of this job would have been the challenge, experience, and growth it gave me and the sense of work ethic it installed in me."
good,I learned a lot about how every sell is different as is each customer. I learned the process to efficiently and successfully make a sale. Management was great and coworkers are great. The hardest part of the job is when there are few prospecting buyers which leads to low paychecks. I found that talking to several customers every day and meeting new people every day was the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,Sold a wide variety of products. Had to learn about everything. Co-workers were great to work with. Management always had my personal interest in mind. It was hardest to have to work by myself so much that when we had a high volume of customers come in
good,I enjoyed my seasonal position at Sears. The hours was good and although it was seasonal I enjoyed my fellow employees as well as managers. Even the store manager interacted and made us all feel welcomed and apart of a team.
good,Sears is great company that offers multiples different career opportunities for full-time and part-time empoyees. It's a great company to switch around departments and find the one that suits you best.
good,"Not too much I can (allowed) say about the company. But I will say, I learned a great deal of insight from working for this company. And that I have a great passion for customer service."
good,Sears was an interesting place to work. The company's focus on employees and their families was admirable.
good,"You get a discount card. I think it was only 10%.  It was fun to get some experience, but the pay was still fairly low, maybe even minimum from what I recall. Different positions should be paid more than minimum."
good,Es un ambiente muy sociable y amigable con los empleados de la tienda.
good,"Sears was a job that really helped me form my communication and customer satisfaction skills. The managers really cared about the work they did, as well as the employees"
good,"The company was failing, despite that I really enjoyed working with my fellow employees a lot! Everyone was very supportive of someone so new, and was willing to show a newbie like me the ropes."
good,before sears merged with kmart it was great place to work after merger original job site closed  lots of people where let and lost they're jobs some  did'nt  eventually what we did was shut down all together
good,"As stated in summaryit was a great place to work. Unfortunately Sears will soon be closing all of its locations, so I could not recommend it as an employer to anyone."
good,It was usually a lot of standing which I didn't mind doing and a lot of stocking and looking for the products in the back for the customers. However it was not a bad experience and I hope for another job for experience.
good,t was a great company to work for. Very talented leaders. Unfortunately all the hard work did not pay off as it was a little to late. I took away a ton of great learnings.
good,"The supervisors were very laid back at the branch I worked for. The work was based more on accuracy than speed and you were given almost free range on what times you wanted to work as long as you got your work done in a timely manner. Everyone would gather and have lunch together and we would have some fun while we ate as the supervisors would read off some trivial pursuit questions. The supervisors for multiple departments would have competitive, but fun challenges for their staff for the week and the supervisor whose team came in last would have to do something for the other supervisors. Overall the workplace was really a lot of fun and it really made me as an employee want to work as hard as I could for my boss."
good,"it wasn't bad it was a good place to talk to people about the job they had very few breaks but within those breaks, the people that worked there were kind and friendly"
good,"It was never dull working at sears. The first manager had an affair with the assistant manager right in the back room in many occasions. People got arrested for stealing, and the employees had fun selling appliances at pretty much any price they felt like. Then management got fired, and the new managers tried to recover the place, but now out of business."
good,Es buena empresa  hay e  visto que lo que  me gusta hacer
good,"Work to keep me busy everyday, i learned safety and awareness working in the warehouse. Management was great, very approachable. Workplace culture was very diverse, mostly kept to myself as i didn't work with warehouse members. Hardest part of the job would have been having to work with others that bully. Most enjoyable part of working there was not having more than one boss."
good,"Meeting sales goals, assisting customers with what they are looking for, interact with workers in other departments, complete various task, maintain a clean work environment."

good,"The Sears that i was working at, the store was closing down in July and they needed new people so i decided to apply and i got the job during the interview. The store is very fast-paced, very friendly coworkers, and it was fun to work at. Overall, i enjoyed my time over there."
good,"in sears i was good experience.task ,fun,lot of to learn and very enjoyable job."
good,"Too many stores closing. Love my job. Fearful of store closing and losing jobs. The staff is great. I love working there, human resources is a great place to get to know everyone."
good,"Company appears to be failing as a result of senior management decisions.  My job was a consultative sales associate in Home Improvement.  I enjoyed most of my customers. Many, many customers were repeat customers and soon became friends.  I really enjoyed the people I worked with and the customers that would come  back to see me about additional products or home projects/issues whereby they needed my help. I still come upon those customers in various places in town and they recognize me or I them and conversation ensues."
good,Started as warehouse quickly advanced to salesman. As for benefits when working for a hometown store there are no benefits which is the only down fall.
good,"loved this job when i was hired years ago. still in college however hours were very flexible, after i went full time and enjoyed the very busy store and gained lots of experience. sears had their own training classes for employees to gained ASEs that was paid for by sears. throughout the years during sears downfall employees took a loss at well, many cuts and forced retirement caused many opinions of the shop to change. If you're a young new auto mechanic in school looking for training and decent pay this is good for you, if you're looking for a career this many not be your cup of tea until the company itself can have their issues resolved."
good,Often had to walk on egg shells around a certain Employee. Was really hard to be comfortable at work at times. Seemed anytime that I was present she was never fully happy with me being around and having to share the same office.
good,"Très bonne expérience de travail."
good,"had a good time working here, friendly staff and management its a shame that the work was slow and the company is going under but overall a great environment"
good,"I worked here for about a year and if you go and handle your business. It is a good job,but if you go to pass time might want to look else where. Its a very productive warehouse."

good,"I thoroughly enjoyed the customer satisfaction aspect of the job. I stocked the shoe dept. and provided great customer service in the shoe dept. Everyone helps each other stock, clean & put out sale signs. My manager was the best!"
good,Good place to work. Seniors are more supportive. CPO support is good. Need to change few things when it comes to hiring process.
good,"Great job starter for high school students, for some one who needs work experience in retail the industry to also learn great customer service on how to handle customers."

good,"Sears was a fun and very challenging place to work, management was easy to work with, the training of working for a big box store was a well worth experience , hardest part to beginning was learning about all of the merchandise Sears provided, most enjoying part training of staff to provide great customer service and to make sure  we meet the company's gold for the day"
good,"C'est entreprise est mal gérer trop de laisser aller, il mettre pas les efforts au bonne place"

good,"Decent hours. When people don't show it is easy to get extra shifts. Busy during holidays and weekends. Not too many difficult customers. Management praises you when you do well and really tries to boost morale. Only good for 28 hours or less. No real benefits. Minimum wage pay. Pushes credit, you have to get 1 app for every 17 customers."
good,"I have learned that working hard to get the job done is an great feeling. Management is ok certain managers taught me a lot about how to be professional in the work place. I loved my co workers, I find it easy to get along with people."

good,I liked it when I was employed there. Management was ok. Pay was not all that decent. Overall it was a nice place to be employed.
good,"Sears is a fantastic company and when I was honored to become apart of their staff. However, with only a few days of training, I was basically thrown into a pack of wolves to fend for myself. I had so many questions that had not been answered and I felt bothersome to continue to ask questions. I was cashier, days were busy,  but I enjoy the fast paced environment."

I learned how to communicate with customers while working effectively and efficiently on the computer. Hardest part of the job to me was selling warranties and asking for home improvement when the customer was asking for assistance on their appliance. Management didn't organize meetings or stats well. They also didn't communicate to their employees at all either."
good,"•	Analyzing the business requirements and functional specs documents."

The hardest part of my job had to be memorizing all the camera positions and numbers. also being able to connect them to be able to follow shoplifters around the store (cameras were not in numerical order) I learned it quickly though. The most enjoyable part of my job was the satisfaction that i got when i caught a shoplifter because i know i made a difference and saved the stores merchandise and money."
good,"Sears is a great place to work, but they do not give raises and they also like to drastically cut hours. But I did learn about patience and the value of a job.

good,This was by far my favorite job. An outstanding Manager and great people to work with.
good,the beginning of my work day i would call customers that had appointments set for the following day to confirm or reschedule the appointment. i would count out the registers make sure our photo studios were ready to go as soon as our customers were to show up. If there was time between customers we would call customers we had before and let them know we would have discounts if they would like to come in.

good,Pleasant Company to work for and great management. Needs improvement with technology and outside sales in the Home Improvement Remodeling Services department.
good,I worked at sears in Chicago Rigde for a month & was never trained nor did i do what I was hired for. Pay there is $8.65 can’t make a living with that. I did like the employees and I knew what I signed up for but if you plan to work here make it a side job. Nobody there had Sears as their primary job.
good,"The more extended warenties sold the more in commiasion you could make.  The job is extremely relaxed, but basic knowlege of machines, equipmemt, and tools is key."
good,"On a day to day basis its not completely busy,but their are people in the store throughout the day, When having a sale more people will be in the store itself. Managers are great and know how to do their jobs and know how to run the store and the hardest part is just knowing whrre things go as well as stocks."
good,"I started off working here seasonally and then was asked to come back for my college breaks. I felt as though the job was very boring and did not require a lot of effort due to the lack of customers. One thing I did love about this job was the fact that they were always open to learning different departments. I worked as a fine jewelry consultant and was able to work in the warehouse downstairs, cashiering as well as a sell associate in electronics."
good,"Sears Holding Center was a very interesting life experience, as well as a decent job. The job was a common call center job, however for the amount of work that is required to be put forth, the compensation is on the low end, (compensation refers to pay). As far as management goes, I personally believe Sears keeps a close eye on their leaders, and does a great job of ensuring employees are treated fairly. Terrible CEO decisions unfortunately top it all off."

good,I was allowed to advance with the company because of my performance. I started in an entry-level position in a department that was later discontinued but was allowed to advance to another department.  The company provided the training and I advanced to the top 10 of the department because of my customer service skills.  This allowed me to choose my own schedule and break times when reviews were performed.
good,"An amazing company with a great work environment. Love coming into work, management and staff are all friendly. The only con is that our company is going through some financial problems and therefore hours are being cut."
good,"Sears can be enjoyable however, it totally depends on your fellow management staff. They employed me for over 10 years and I made okay money. They keep changing their focus though on different metrics. Almost like we are out of touch what makes us money and what customer needs are."
good,"Most of the job is desk/office tasks"
good,Sears was a job with a lot of learning experiences. Its was a fantasic place to get to interact with the customers and get to know them through our shop your way program.

good,"Good management"
good,I enjoyed my co-workers at this job and made many friends. I found this job to be quite slow. The management was ok. The products sold at Sears are ok. I would have to say that Sears was not one of my most likeable jobs.
good,"A typical day at work is full of new experiences, the environment is realy friendly. I have been able to learn in a very stressful environment, co workers are very helpful. Hardest part I did not have to experience that because I loved what I was doing, fun part was to be able to help, serve, interact with people, customers."
good,A typical day at work would be to clock in and provide customer service to any and all calls received while working. Management was great and I was guided towards a promotion received during my years as an employee. It was only difficult but not impossible to handle an unsatisfied customer. I enjoyed being able to share and utilize my excellent quality of customer service to all callers.
good,"My typical day at Sears was answering the phone, doing data entry, handing out paperwork, counting tills and customer service. Sears worked great with my disability."
good,"I really enjoyed the fellow employees, however the customers could be very rude, and ruin an entire shift for me. The management was nice and the scheduling worked out fantastic."
good,Well rounded company but offers no training. Good Communication with managers.
good,Sears employs some of the most driven and talented people in the industry
good,"Working together in teams and competing against each other made a fun environment to work in and seemed to up productivity. A typical day at work consisted of out going calls to promote estimates for major home improvements such as siding, kitchen cabinets, and vinyl windows. What I learned was that each member of the team can learn something from one another and better them self from constructive criticism. The hardest part of the job was deciphering information from the perspective client and presenting the appropriate products to better suit their needs."
good,great co-works and management team. very open and friendly work environment.
good,Co-workers are friendly and you feel like you're really part of a family.
good,This job was very interesting and i learn a lot when it comes to dealing with retail
good,A typical day at Sears sometimes started out pretty slow but around lunch time it picked up and became very busy i learned alot at sears like great customer service and register operation skills. Management was really good they were always there to give us a confidence boost and encourage us to puse sales. me and my co-works at sears became more of a family like brother and sisters we were there for each other to support and teach eac other how to perform our jobs better the hardest part of this job was learning how to use the register but once i got the hang up it i became a pro. i was told on multiple occassions that i was one of there best cashiers by my manager and store manager i have also recieved rewards for having great customer service. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that i was doing my best at it everytime my store manager would come and tell me what a great job i was doing.
good,"I was not with sears long, my younger brother had past away a week after i was hired in. I really enjoyed working there i was in the tool dept and I learned alot while i was there."
good,"making sure the customers were taken care of the proper way, and selling products such as refrigerators. I learned a lot about the cash terminals. Management was great, very reasonable and understanding. The Hardest part of that position was earning the customer feedback because most of them forget all about it. However, I really did enjoy the feedback I always recieved."
good,everyday my job is to make sure the over and shortages are done properly and to keep and eye out for shoplifters
good,I enjoyed to experience in working with employees and customers I also enjoyed the working experience to communicate with employees and customers everyday
good,The job was slow paced due to the closing down of the store . It was never that many cashiers open so i was always Jammmed pack with scanning and putting my all into helping the customers end there shopping well
good,I enjoyed working at my store location in brunswick. Management is excellent and they really work with me on my schedule. Most jobs will not work with you on scheduling your hours but Sears was very accomodating . Good place to work I hate it they are going out of business.
good,loved working had an amazing team everyone was friendly and worked with you never had any issues they thought me alot with sales and learning about the tools cared about our safety
good,"i likes working in sears as a representation at the customer services and it taught me a lot and i've worked on the floor, backstore, inventory and alot more and i loved it because i feel like its my domain and i would do it again if i could but i left because it was closing and its just not organized anymore i did my best but also it putted alot of stress on my epecially on my study life ."
good,"Work place and co workers were helpful"
good,"The job was very fun lets say, but it got stress full when working under a counter manager that wasn't very organized and good at replacing items, meanwhile I was organizing and setting appointments, also doing stock and cleaning the counter I lost on a lot of sales which I wasn't well trained in nor the products (which I had to teach myself on my personal time)"
good,The most enjoyable part was working with people from different backgrounds. Everyone gets along well and we think as each other as a diverse family.
good,Manage my team in pricing. Work on pricing clearence and days of ads change prices according to sales of the week. I learned to manage and make schedules. I enjoyed working with an energetic team. Hardest part was trying to finish ads during the holidays. Had stacks of price changes.
good,"A pesar de ser de tiempo completo, hay el apoyo por parte de los jefes para las personas que estudian, hay crecimiento dentro de la empresa, un ambiente algo pesado por las ventas pero en general todo es bueno, los compañeros etc. La parte más difícil es convencer al cliente de llevar otros productos debido a que la mayoría llega con la idea de a que va a comprar."
good,"dirty work place, long nights, management is great to work with"
good,"great place to work"
good,"Running around getting everything straightened and looking nice. Putting up the new ad prices, and doing the PCN's. Everyone there is good to work with. I don't have any problems with anyone. I just wish that everyone would work equally."
good,The store manger was cool but the one I worked for was not fun at all the store is a really a good place to work I just had my personal reasons why I wouldn't recommend it to anyone
good,"The work environment wasn't my favorite. There was a lot of drama and fighting between managers who would in turn make associates ""pick sides"" so there was a lot of unfair treatment. Other than that, it was a fun place to work. There are so many different areas to work in it was cool to learn about all these new items and areas."
good,"Working at Sears I think would be amazing for a job start. It is a place I love to go and I know a couple people who work at Sears. So why not work with people you know right? I mean they could help you or anything. And honestly I am an easy person to get a long with. I can clean, cook, count money very well, and I can keep well-organized. Also if I work here I am pretty sure I will learn a lot from Sears, because it seems like such an amazing place to work at. I have been told that I am a great listener, and that I have an amazing career goal that I am chasing after, which is cosmetology. I am also a great worker, I work around my house and do dishes, fold close, keep everything organized and just do so well around the house my parents usually pay $20 by the end of the week when I do my chores that I need to do."
good,A day was fast pace. I learn how to have most fun. No management. Co workers were fun very up beat. The hardest part was sometimes getting the babies to stop crying but could be adorable pictures I would take and get a sale. The most enjoyable part was a good day of all my sales.
good,"A typical day at Sears Automotive is greeting the customer(s) as they walk in taking care of the customers concerns about their vehicle, also ringing up merchandise from the sales floor. Also keeping the previous customers updated about their vehicle, if needed receiving parts if any from our local vendors if parts were ordered. I have learned so much in the auto shop from tires to brakes and alignments and balancing tires. I adore my co workers I am the youngest and the only female in this department and they take good care of me, my co workers and bosses are nice and wonderful people. The hardest part of my job I would say is dealing with an angry customer you have to keep it professional and try to find a way to solve the problem that they are having. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with wonderful co workers and bosses and meeting different people every single day and, also knowing that the customer(s) are happy with the customer service that I provided for them."
good,"If you are not cut out for a call center environment then I do not recommend working at Sears call center. As fare as my experience, It was very challenging. The soft wares alone could be very complicated but once you get the hang of them, you will actually appreciate the knowledge"
good,"There was a lot of opportunity at Sears. There were numerous departments that you could move between, and also opportunities for climbing the ladder of success. Unfortunately in Sept of 2016, there was a company lay off, and Sears in Highpoint at Oak Hollow Mall is no longer operational."
good,Wonderful job it pays nice friendly staff!!!! I enjoyed it I wish I was still there!!!! But if I could go back I would!!!!! Like I said wonderful atmosphere!!!!!
good,travail très ardue travailler sans aides un manque flagrand de personnels
good,"Great customer service"
good,"Really boring place, little traffic. Your mainly working with customers over the phone sending orders to their home. It was a showroom so people would usually come look then we will order and ship."
good,It is a very positive environment and it's a place full of teamwork. The customers and the co workers are really positive. A good environment. Overall a good work area
good,I loved working there it was a good working experience. I learned how to maintain the register and worked in the morning and evening so i closed and opened the till.
good,Enjoyed the delivery and the route just not enough and they eventually stopped having catalog deliveries. I would take extra routes if they were available and really enjoyed the deliveries
good,Loved to work on registers and to show my excellent customer service skills.
good,"poor environment, poor salary, poor culture, not great benefits, not a great work/life balance, quite a bit of pressure and overall not a great company"
good,I was not satisfied with this job because of racial profiling. They treated certain races better then others used mean nicknames for other races. This job was not fair nor was it workable without being just like them.
good,"I liked working there it was a great first job."
good,Good company just bad ceo and upper management. Should be concerned with customer service and happy employees. Like the different styles and jobs to do all day. Sime days are boring thoygh when there isn't too much to do. The people that work there ate the nicest people around. I enjoy the different things that go on each day. Some days are more difficult than others but all in all its nice.
good,"It was just a seasonal job. They started a lot of us out like that, then after the season they would keep you based on points. It was always busy, and the environment was fun."
good,Stocking was great. Early in the morning and you can get alone time and get paid. Easy and organized. Sales was ok too. I worked in the children department so no drama.
good,"A typical day at Kmart would include helping customers reach the highest amount of satisfaction. I interact and create conversation as I complete their visit to the store. I  make sure each customer leaves with a smile on their face and a motivation to return to the store."
good,Didnt get many hours and the pay is not enough. Worked with some good people. Management is okay but very hard on their workers.
good,I was a photographer. I would make daily calls to customers to schedule their next appointments and let them know their photos have arrived. Sold portraits to customer that had pictures taken of family.
good,"Working for Sears was great, but manager sometime need more work. It would be nice if all managers are on the same page. Some Managers act like the own the stores and make up they own rules. I like team work, but not all think that way everyone sure be train in the same way so all workers do the job right. Sears used to be family orientated work with the employees. Now it is just a business always pushing for us to get credit and if you do not get enough credits for the day you get written up. If it continues that you do not get enough for the day you will get fired."
good,Inestabilidad no es garantía te pueden terminar tu empleo sin razón
good,"typical day included answering phone, assisting mgmt. and learned to run a back office. management was very helpful and workplace was fun , nothing hard about job and enjoyable was staff"
good,With this employer I could start work at 7 am and sometimes not be complete until 10 pm at night. For this company I was working under a sub contractor who fail to pay employees on time and or have a means to continue developing in the industry. Since working for the employee  the hardest part about it is not being paid on time or fairly. The best part  about the job was providing the appliances to my clients with high valued customer service.
good,Its a grate place to get started with the job seen and get some cash rolling in. It is a good first place to get some on the job training too but it can be tedious too.
good,"I started out my retail career here and the managers had no idea who I was. When I left they were in the beginning of changing things, like providing more training. Hopefully improving."
good,Poor quality of management and its more towards customers experience with managers is horrible. Would not recommend to speaking with a manager.
good,"A typical day of work would consist of re-folding clothes around the store, returning clothes that had returned to the store back their places. "
good,Company poorly ran and went out of business. Sales were pushed to hard and less was placed upon experience. You know there is a problem when company is collecting email addresses to spam.
good,i worked here for a while but was not empressed with how store was run by what i call a very retalitory based management. i would not recomend this company to anyone i know.
good,"I love to working  in team, I like people in general. I have a good relation with my co-workers, I am responsible."
good,"Training was outstanding in the different facets of customer service, Learning to approach a customer and assist was a good skillset to learn. Coworkers were pleasant and friendly and as I was hired in the start up of a Cosmetic and fragrance line, cooperation was key."
good,"No longer the stellar example of retail. Was a great place to work but as the store got closer to closing, problems developed. Management on all levels resigned and customer confidence disappeared."
good,The job was fun while it lasted but I was let go when I needed to put school ahead of work. You will also get in trouble if you don’t make for credit card sales a day
good,"focus more on selling credit applications and protection plans more than anything else. Favoritism was shown during work shift, i did gained a lot of experience dealing with cashiering and customer service."
good,"Acceptance of change is difficult here.  Management (below president level) have been in place for several years.  Many have ""grown up"" at Sears so it's often difficult for them to know how to change/do things differently."
good,"In ability to get full time status in spite of my work was disappointing. "
good,"While I loved my job here I was there for 2 years without a raise and without a promotion even though I was over qualified for any position there. You create family out of your coworkers. Work life balance is great, you could work 10 hours 1 week and 45 the next."
good,I liked my job it was slow at times but i liked it. I worked in the jewelry department and I learned a lot and i like learning new things so that was a plus. I would definitely say its a good starter job for those who are seeking experience  in that department. the hardest part of the job was selling or credit checks. the most enjoyable part of the job was customers and my co- workers .
good,"Management was okay enough to run the store, you only get your full hours by getting customers to apply for credit with sears. resulting in much needed work hours being cut down to two days per week depending on if they like you or not. however you do have opportunities for cross training depending on store needs. this offers great chances to get work experience."
good,"In the very beginning during the hiring process, it was told that what news corps say about Sears is incorrect and that the company was doing well and there was nothing to worry about. well, after 3 months of employment the words we were told to ignore were actually true and a massive layoff occurred without warning and no severance was given."
good,It's a great place if you are a teenager and just starting to get into the work place but not for adults unless you have other sources of income. It has moments where it's fun but not all the time
good,It was a good company. but the manager was all about his commission so he would make you to do anything just to get his commission. everything else was alright.
good,the people at sears are great to work with. love being involved in the customer service aspect. the hrs where not enough and the wage was no adequet. could have defenitly used more hrs
good,My job was customer service as a cashier. I had to learn how to deal with complaints and if they couldn't' be resolved ask for a manager. Most people were helpful and my direct manager was wonderful to work for. I left due to hours being cut and I loved helping the customers and interacting with them.
good,"Very busy at the cash desk, which I loved."
good,"This job was okay. Management was lacking in empathy toward workers, which made it hard to have pride in our jobs. My fellow coworkers were great to work with! The possibility of getting any incentives such as days off or pay raises were promised but rarely given. Decent breaks were given to employees regularly."
good,I learned to operate cash registers and take credit card payments.  I had a manager that was very patient and knowledgable and she transferred her skills to all her direct-reports.
good,"Management sets standards for it's employees, which is good as it drives purpose, however employees that are under-goal performing or incapable of meeting other, higher expectations, are terminated and then replaced occasionally. The people are nice,  I enjoy interacting with customers and having frequent customers that remember my name. The two types of employees are apparent there, the ones who have been there forever and the ever changing new-hires."
good,The job was easy. We were our own boss. customers were very nice. work day was typical everyday. co-workers were enjoyable during company events.
good,"This was my first job ever, and it taught me a lot about customer service. I learned how to talk to people in a different manner, and how to merchandise and look at retail as a whole. After that job, I learned even more about retail and it moved me to my future at Brighton."
good,"I worked as a salesperson, selling tools and supplies in the hardware department. I also sold paint and supplies in the paint department."
good,"I work in the jewelry department at Sears.  Which consists of taking care of jewelry, cleaning and maintaining jewelry for sale and for our customers.  In a day, I will ring out customers in various departments, take repairs for jewelry, clean jewelry, reorganize tables and fixtures as deem fit.  "
good,"a typical day at work would consist of daily safety checks and constantly working to maintain a safe environment for customers and employees. Management was helpful in their departments."
good,Going to customers homes and repairing appliances. Taking really short breaks. Liked my co-workers.
good,"I liked Sears, but it wasn't quite the place for me. Typical day included the maintenance of salesfloor while also tending to the checkstand. Management was decent, but very biased. There was a lot of discrimination which eventually turned me off to working their."
good,"working with the public can be stressful, but meeting good folks make the job worth it.  learned alot from the other associates, worked with loss prevention, shipping and hardware."
good,"manager at the time of the store, acted like he was scared to talk to customers when there was a problem"
good,"Typically, you would arrive at work, sign in, and do whatever jobs were left for you that day. Communication is awful-there is no real system in place to relay messages. My co-workers have been a life saver for me in this job. I have gone to them more than anyone with question, comments, and concerns about many things with this job. The management there is by far the worst I have ever seen. There is hardly any training given through them; we are expected to do research on our own time to learn. They do not listen to feedback from customers or employees, and their sole focus is money, money, money. Even so, the job is enjoyable. I have the opportunity to meet so many different kinds of people, and help them find the products that best fit them. It is difficult sometimes to keep up with sales goals, especially when management feels it necessary to have us sell things to people that they don't need. All in all, I only stay here to help pay the bills. "
good,"Worked long hours, 6 days a week."
good,Imaginably like any other retail store in that there is a collection of over-zealous managers and underpaid workers
good,I do not get excited to go to work although I perform this job to the best of my knowledge I can not say I am happy to work here since it is a part time job there are no benefits and most times the work schedule is out of control. management is not what I expected. I wish it could be a more friendly work environment. I have trained most of my co workers and it seems that they do not have the attitude or energy to perform a job well done maybe because of the work environment and plenty unhappy customers. the hardest part of this job is not being at least acknowledged or promoted for all the hard work and efforts arriving to this job i do not find enjoyable and everyday wish it can all change.
good,Help Assist the Teacher and help with shore
good,Was at work on time. Always ready to work.Love working on car.
good,"A typical day involved walking around the store in plain clothes, attempting to blend in with shoppers while watching for potential shop-lifters. I also sat in a completely dark room watching the closed-circuit monitors watching for potential shop-lifters. I used point, tilt, and zoom cameras has a tool in assisting me to catch shop-lifters in the act. I would apprehend, detain, and work with local law enforcement officials. The hardest part of my job was maintaining alertness and patience during down times."
good,"I worked there for a short time, knowing that the store was going to shut down within a matter of months. It was good at the beginning, the people were nice and the customers were alright. But then the associates started to leave their positions for better things and I was one of the only people in receiving and there was alone most of the time."
good,walk in to a friendly work enviroment were you are greeted by other co-workers clock in check with area supervisory to find out daily task.
good,Running around making sure my job was done plus the 3 people I was training by myself. No one else would help train people and the manager didn’t care.
good,I worked parttime and the company was in the process of closing when I resigned my position. I prefer not to give a review at this time. Will document at a later time. The company is closed.
good,El personal y los colaboradores siempre fueron amables conmigo.
good,El trabajar por metas y superarlas cada mes hicieron d mi una persona con nuevas ambiciones de crecimiento y desarrollo.
good,Job is easy it's just that some people are getting placed in positions they have no business being in. Typical day involves doing store processes before the store opens to ensure members are taken care of throughout the day. Best part of the job is helping people get what they want and working with good coworkers who become family.
good,"Responsible for merchandise orders that were being picked up by customers, unloading trucks on a weekly basis, stock the inventory once its all accounted for and keep warehouse organize and clean."
good,It was alright. It had it's good days and bad days. If you like standing the job would be for you. It's a friendly place and some of the people are nice.
good,Home delivery is contract work. Depending on who you work for the pay is not always fair. There are drivers who are lazy and expect their helper to do all the work.
good,"It was slow and boring. Most of the managers I had sucked and didn't know what they were doing. I did have a few good managers in my time though and your coworkers are always great and fun people to work with! The pay sucked, but they were always very flexible with your hours."
good,"Work was contained to new store brand"
good,"If you work there for a long period of time, you see a lot of the staff changes effect your work and relationships. It gets very tiring trying to keep up with all the fresh faces of the employees"
good,"worked at sears for almost 2 years, have had some decent managers although most of them were useless douche bags...pay sucked  due to lack of business....co workers were great"
good,Sears was a seasonal job and it was fun to work at. Me and my best friend worked together so it was a plus. Sears was my second job and I enjoyed working at the mall.
good,Loved working there everyone was nice and friendly always willing to help just bad part was part time and wasn't lots of room for advancement. The raise was given like onec in a great while and only like 10 cents
good,The job is very quick paced but all the co-workers are very friendly and make the job worth it. The hardest part of the job was sometimes being short staffed.
good,"My typical day at work i'm cashing out customers, straightening up fitting rooms, folding clothes, marketing clothes, handling returns. I have learned a lot at my job. Managers at my work environment are awesome people they are understanding and they always try to make sure that everything is set in order. My co-workers are very nice, they are strong at team work. My co-workers are awesome at their jobs. I don't have a hard situation at my job I make sure I handle everything to the best of my ability. The most enjoyable part of my job is being at work all together."
good,"Aprendí que siempre hay que hacer la diferencia, que quien quiere comprometerse lo hace y que siempre hay que estar disponible para la empresa."
good,Great job if you need to get sales experience under your belt. Otherwise this job is more work than its worth. Its nice for someone just starting out.
good,"I thought my managers and co-workers were very nice.  I liked interacting with the customers.  At times, it could get really busy, but I didn't mind.  I like to keep busy."
good,I took this part time job mainly because they accepted my time constrain. My hourly wage is much less than I deserve and I don't see room for improvement.
good,"The store itself did not keep up to the standards that they are required to be at unless we were having a visit. If you didn't make a sale during a period that there was also a return, the money you initially made off of that sale would still be removed from the next pay check so you could end up making only 50 dollars for two weeks worth of work,"
good,"Rotated tires, did oil changes, cleaned up shops, took care of clients,  and did small engine repairs. Changed batteries as well"
good,Good job for people starting out in the work field. Flexible job hours and management will assist you when you need to change your hours around.
good,Sears is a very bad place to worrk. The work conditions are horrible. Management does not care about the workers. The employees are mainly felons who dont care about what they do.
good,"The day started out on a computer, looking at the route made for me that day. I learned tolerance, as most people were upset with sears. Management was poor. We were directed by an out of town person only worried about completes and sales. My co-workers were mostly very good. Willing to help on difficult jobs. Hardest part of the day was after 4 pm. Company had a habit of adding up to 3 service calls before I could go home. Most enjoyable part was getting the customer to relax after I had repaired the problem."
good,"This was a fun job at first, but then it became tedious. There was a lot of repetition everyday, but you knew what you were doing. There was no room for advancement in the job and sometimes the bosses were not as understanding as they could be."
good,"Flyers are sent to your doorstep,its your responsibility to hand out the flyers on time and make sure they're delivered to the correct homes."
good,"I started there as an in store marketer, approaching people as the  shopped for shoes or tools and asked if they needed new windows, front doors or siding. I did enough business that when they opened the Lands' End department, I interviewed and got a full time job as a cashier and  merchandiser."
good,"A typical day at Sears included assisting customers with their questions about desired merchandise. I learned a lot about the merchandise that was sold. My coworkers and I worked together as a team to complete certain tasks such as, putting away stock, and inventory. There was nothing difficult about the job. I enjoyed interacting with the customers more than anything."
good,Was able to work independently without direct supervision.
good,"This was fun during the time I was there. I was part of the holiday sales staff. "
good,I wish I would've known the stress they put on cashiers to get credits and shop your ways! They will go as far as threating to fire you and they actually have fired people. I love the fact I was able to meet people from all (because I worked at Sears Westshore in Tampa) over but the stress for $7.79/hr was not worth it! By the end I did really well with credits but not everybody does and they did play favorites a lot ( people got away with a lot of stuff) and when I was doing good in credits I got as little as 8hrs a week and they kept me in home fashions (slowest dept in the store). Over all its ok but they need to have more compassion because not everybody wants a credit card or want to give their email out! 
good,"A typical day at this part of Sears consisted of answering calls in a call center taking service orders. I learned how to do data entry, take service orders, resolve customer complaints. My manager was very nice, but those over her wasn't willing to make the ""good workers"" full-time, although we were working full-time hours. My co-workers worked together when necessary. The hardest part of the job was being told that I needed to work 40 hours with NO benefits and NOT  a chance of becoming full-time. The most enjoyable part of that job were the duties and the recognition for outstanding customer service."
good,Learned the sales side of the auto industry... well the sears sales side.
good,we bring smiles to kids everyday creating new memories for family. i learned how to calm down kids and how to enhance pictures. I get along with my co workers they are like family. Hardest part of my job is getting 9 or more kids to sit and smile but i love the challenges and always get at least great pose.i enjoy making memories for each family and hearing their stories.
good,Very busy with the work load of daily operations. Management is not very helpful for the planning of what is to be done that day. It is very enjoyable to work with all of the customers that we have in the store.
good,"Retail Management is tough. I'd say this is one of the hardest jobs I've had. The difficulty is in trying to please a host people whose goals could be best be termed ""a moving target"". Sears has a long history of treating it's people very well, I'm saddened to say it isn't living up to that anymore."
good,Too many turn over due to unrealistic job requirement and expectation.
good,"Sears is a company many people go to because they trust the name. Once working there it is very hard to explain to the customers that the name is more popular than the service. In order to help many customers coming into the store, you have to call outside departments and contact managers that simply do not make it easy for you to assist that customer. Benefits are great if you are hired full time, part timers get the short end of the company benefits."
good,Worked there through my 12th grade year of high school. Went to college and had to give more dedication to studies.
good,I worked in management here and this is a very difficult place to work. Nothing is ever good enough and it is long hours away from your family.
good,"They over work their techs, they expect hours of driving while trying to complete on average 12 jobs per day. Force techs to be salesman of home warranties. Rarely do you do what you are hired for, I was hired to do refrigerator"
good,Sears Auto is a great place for the beginner to get their feet wet in the automotive industry. The hours and advancement opportunities are literally up to you. Complete your online training to qualify for position advancement.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Sears. I love working with money. I never had my draw come up short. My co-workers and the customers were great, I enjoyed interacting with everyone."
good,"Loved my coworkers. No opportunity for advancement. Alot of backstabbing. Loved my regula"
good,Sears Jackson was an excellent store to work at. Unfortunately with the restructuring plan we were on the chopping block. I believe with the new restructuring endeavor that sears will once again be an outstanding retailer.
good,"It’s a nice job, but lacks management. Great coworkers, flexible with hours, but always stressed because managers don’t help out when needed or called several times."
good,Most of the retail department worker were all very nice and fun to talk to but if you need help and you were working a shift alone nobody from any of the other departments would come to help you and if a costumer wants to speak to a manager the wait time is like 30-45 minutes. Because there is only ever one manager in the store to deal with all the different departments and most of them don’t want to help you anyways so they take their time to get to you.
good,"Sears is a fun place to work, and I really loved it. However, the work really slowed down to the point where my hours were cut after 5 years of working, I had to find a new job. They continue to cut positions."
good,This was my first job when I was in high school. The hours were flexible and they were a great company for a first time career. They had a wonderful training class.
good,"Fun job, great commission pay. Slow at times and fast at times. It was a great part time job for me. Apparently someone higher didn’t take enough pride in their stores and allowed it to shut down. Great place"
good,"Assisting customers and going about my job. I learned that there is no I in team, the management was very chill.The workplace culture was very nice. The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers. Working with others."
good,"Sears sent me to a training seminar in Raleigh, NC to learn more about the products they sold and/or carried. They wanted us to know the ins and outs of every product they sold."
good,It was closing so it was kinda tough. We have to move fixtures and they were so heavy to move from the first to the second floor. Didn't receive a lot of hours. I got to make some friends. Some days were boring and sometimes super busy.
good,The job holds a good starting position for new students who wish to get cashier and sales experience without having a huge workload and a daunting amount of tasks to be accomplished.
good,"Contrary to what we saw in the news, upper management kept telling us all is well.right up to the time they announced that we would be closing our store and we would be looking for a new job in six weeks."
good,"Nice place to work at, perfect part time job. Easy going and great co workers. Management is good, could improve. Pushed to get credit a lot which gets a little frustrating. Flexible schedules."
good,Depending on who the manager is during your shift you will either be stressed or relaxed. You have the cool managers that you get along with and then there's the managers you don't get along with and that's where it became stressful
good,Nice place place to work. Got along with all coworkers. Customers were usually regulars and very nice. Hours are flexible. Operating computer was easy. Loved the staff parties.
good,Lots of opportunity for people who want to learn and try niche technologies. Work atmosphere is friendly. Management is quite good and always willing to try new things.
good,Was my first job cant really complain manager was great employees was  bit far and had to deal with rude customers but it built character. I used it as a stepping stone definitely wouldn't mind doing as apart time job or soomething
good,There are to many upper management changes with Sears. The work was good and steady. With job cuts makes for a work life balance for the salary managers.
good,"Monitored footage from surveillance cameras, assessed and maintained store safety. Learned how to spot shop lifters. LP Manager created hostility between agents. Store management wasn't able to fix it. Work Place culture was was good. The hardest part of the job was the hostility between the agents. The most enjoyable part of the job was catching someone stealing merchandise."
good,This I a wonderful place to engage your creative side. You get to meet a lot of fun customers and also help to create fun collages.  Fun place to work.
good,capacitan muy bien y te enseñan lo necesario para atender al cliente como se debe
good,Encourages creativity for aesthetic value and shopping ease for customers. Allows for employees to learn every aspect of retail processes. Plethora of positions available for all-around experience.
good,Sears is a great place for a student. I started at age 20 it was a great experience. I loved helping customers. Wearing nice clothes. The hours were terrible.
good,"I started this job as  part time and ended up working full time hours some days.We didn't have a floor manger that we could report problems to in the department that I worked.Things was getting out of hand during holiday rush. I thought about quiting,but the store manger let me know that the manger of my department had quit in the middle of the big sale rush and they we're short handed in floor mangers and he said he would like me to stay because the costumers gave him good sale reviews on me and he love how I took pride in doing my job and keeping my area clean and never complain about help others when need"
good,"Being around friendly and kind people all day is the most enjoyable part of the day. It's always great meeting new people and finding ways to make sure they leave the store with a smile. The management is nice but very persistent. On a typical day at work, my main focus is to process transactions at the register and maintain a clean department. On average, myself and other co-workers are pushed many times by each member of management to get credit card applications. Credit applications are the most challenging part of the job but you learn in time ways to sell them. Sears is different from other department stores because I can tell, personally, that each employee honestly cares about customer satisfaction. Each employee goes the extra mile for their company. With there being multiple workers in each department, every customer has their needs met without having to search for it. You can't say that for every other company or retail store."
good,"I loved working at Sears however I did have a few issues. For one, I was working 25-30 hour work weeks as a student who was taking finals. Also, I was not aware I was a seasonal employee until I was fired after the holidays. However, all staff members were friendly and shared the workload."
good,you have to work a lot and sometimes dont get recognized for your work. there isnt much staff and many people quit because they expect you to do alot of work but dont want to recognize you for your work
good,"Workplace was Peaceful, great co-workers. Not very good pay rhough and only part time. If it was full time and had better pay with Benefits it would be the perfect job. Everyday i would do my job with no problems. I learned about different appliances and different variations of those appliances. Learned how to organize merchandise in number groups to keep track of them in the store and out of the store. Met some great people working there. This is a good job for someone looking to get experience under their belt."
good,"Good company, lots of potential growth, but management needs trimmed from the ground up!"
good,Come in the day and fill out an audit for a specific department. Then monitor the store from CCTV or you could walk the floor in plain clothes. Sears has a hands-off policy.
good,"i got to drive and delivery appliance for customers, its nice to work outside of a building. meet new people every day.i could always be done on time and delivery on time due to my strength. i mapped out a plan before leaving the job site to be more efficient."
good,People are nice and mind their own business.  The hours are good during holidays and then drop drastically afterwards.  Good for college students.
good,"When at work, the fellow employees were nice and management was always understanding. Response time when calling for help wasn't great and would often lead to frustrated customers. I only worked part time due to being a full time student, but I received very low hours. There was a month that I only worked 1 day a week, and they were always short 3-5hr shifts. I found that I couldn't even pay a phone bill on this kind of money. The closing duties were the most challenging as the management trusted each cashier to cash down multiple draws and perform closing cleaning duties within 15-30 minutes after closing by themselves, but customers were often still shopping in the store after closing and had to still be provided with service."
good,"cashier, clean/dust, organize, return stock, clean/empty fitting rooms.  when your busy...your very busy and when its slow the clock drags on."
good,Fast pace sale company to work for with a decent work enviorment. Must be able to watch out in fitting rooms for high theft.
good,"The backroom at Sears was a dangerous place to work, but you could easily build up strength there and learn how to manage the computer system. The hardest part of the job was often just finding things, but even that was not much of a problem. Co-workers were good and management was helpful. I learned how to stock locate, create cardboard and plastic bails, work a two wheel dolly, and load merchandise. The most enjoyable part for me was simply always having work."
good,"Great place great management great coworker."
good,"Meeting new people daily is very fun, and even better when you have return customers that you have built connections with."
good,I liked that I was able to help people and set up weekly ads in the store. The management staff was nice and helpful and worked with me to help me through out my work days.
good,A company that is constantly cutting commission rates and terrible upper management. Could grow with the company if you can make little to nothing for 3 to 5 years.
good,I have learned how to be a better people person and how to handle abrupt situations. The most difficult part of any job is time management.  The most enjoyable part of my day is the customers. to be that wow factor out of their entire day really means a lot.
good,"I was only there for a short period, but the time I was there was not good at all.  I loved my actual job.  I did not, however, enjoy my immediate supervisor which placed strain on my work duties."
good,i liked the people i worked with but the management was not very good at the time there was a lot of changes going on at the time the leadership team was not very good they were not very organized
good,I work as a merchandiser so every Sunday I reset the floor with new sale signs and any new floor planes that need to be reset for the month.
good,"not enough hours."
good,This was a minimum wage job with little chance to advance. However they had great employee discounts. They have a small benefits package.
good,Very enjoyable place to work..Management makes you feel welcome as well as other employees..Training is easy and well informed..
good,A typical work day consumed of gettting people up for breakfast. Helping feed and then making sure their all set up to to go to therapy. Helping the nursing staff and comunicating good with them. Getting the showers completed that were asigned that day. Answering call lights. help to get lunch ready. make sure you making rounds and checking on everyone constently.
good,learned new register systems and enjoted the people and co workers
good,Decent company to start but bad company to stay.  Worked in management for years and worked long hours with six day weeks at time but success at work was rarely appreciated.  Employees are not valued for customer service but for selling credit card applications and Shop Your Way cards.
good,"Typical day at Sears usually began with printing signage for housewares (that was my section), checking other items where there was no ad (but most of the time had a sale price), once finished with my section I always helped others with their departments. Then as a team we would check clearance merchandise and organize it as such on the rack. My supervisor was sweet and a great person to work with.  The hardest part of my job... shoe department, love shoes and I couldn't go by the shoes without wanting a new pair of sneakers! Most enjoyable part of the job working with a great group of people."
good,"Obtained great customer service skills"
good,"I loved my job and most the people, this location had very poor leadership and management in this store. We were all commission almost, and I barely made enough to barely struggle by."
good,"Sold appliances to customers."
good,"Install all assigned parts. I was taught to solder, evacuate HVAC and refrigerators and freezers. Install timers, evaporators, compressors and related parts. I worked primarily on my own. Working in the elements, conditions were some times difficult . I enjoyed repairing the customers product and seeing them satisfied with my work ethic."
good,"My typical day at work, like with my other call centre work was being on the phones, assisting callers with their orders, be it placing new orders or fixing orders that went awry.   The hardest part of my job was telling a customer that they wouldn't get their order in time for the holidays.  the best part of my job was helping them straighten out a complicated situation to receive a satisfactory conclusion."
good,to be honest they are like any employer they need to make money how ever they ar going to great lengths to be fair
good,"coté système de camera numero 1 avec 52 cameras 360 degré système complet."
good,"Selling credit card with high interest rates was a top priority. And as time goes by they add other things that you are demanded to persuade the customer to sign up for, such as reward programs. If you did not meet your credit or reward program goals that they set for you,eventually you would be terminated."
good,It was a decent place to work for. I learned the skills to be a good salesmen. I also learned what it takes to be a good delivery driver.  Management wasn't good at all. They knew little about Sears and little about how to treat and pay employees.
good,Try to have fun when I go to work by enjoying talking with my co workers. I have a excellent boss who motivates me and helps me out with any problem I come across.
good,To many managers and not enough communication between them.
good,"I enjoyed working here. The atmosphere was very calm and my managers and co-workers were all really friendly. The store was really slow as far as mall traffic, but overall I had a good expereince with this organization"
good,Loved working there. Some of the bath and body works have very judgmental managers. 
good,"On an ordinary day, I would run the register and we would get a good number of customers. When it wasn't too busy, I was sent to help with returns, or help out on the floor."
good,"Booking appointment, sales marketing, photo shoot, editing."
good,"good place to work, bad management at the store i worked at and that starts from the top on down"
good,"No real complaints with sears, i didnt mind working here just found a better paying job that was full time."
good,Learned alot about cashier management and cash management.
good,"While working with your coworkers is fulfilling and a 50 hour work week is promised, look forward to around a 57 hour management schedule. Expect to miss holidays and numerous family events due to the demanding retail schedule (which is similar across all retail) while doing more manual labor than management. The training and knowledge received is invaluable, but the friction it caused within my family and other management families is definitely something to consider."
good,A typical day at work involved preparing daily activites for the associates in there assigned areas providing them with the tools needed to succeed. Provide feedback on what was accomplished the prior day. And what is expected to be accomplished on the days buisness. what I have learned working for Sears is having a Positive attitude even when your fellow leads do not helps maintain a good working environment for the associates good team Building skills. Management was helpfull at times. the hardest part of the job was maintaining good working elevators for merchandise movement to be successfull. the most enjoyable part of the job was having your team succeed even when everything didn't seem to go the right way.
good,I had a great learning experience in working with the public in retail.
good,"Fast paced, friendly, people-oriented, good experience for young people..."
good,"I learned how to interact with customer, and tech. Helping people is one of my strong points."
good,"I worked here all my college, and they are very flexible and will work with your class schedule."
good,Day isn't bad
good,They were not willing to work with employees and there school schedules.
good,pues es un ambiente pues se podria desir que bueno no hay forma alguna de crecimiento pero lo agradable es que te dan la oportunidad de estudiar.
good,"A typical day at work requires me to get to know the customers and create an inviting environment to shop. As a Land's End associate, I enjoy assisting customers as they shop. I enjoy helping customers put outfits together. Giving a postive experience to the customer is what is important. Management does well at communcating with the lead associates. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new and interesting people."
good,"ok place to work, not much as for making a career out of it. dont like making commission, prefer hourly wage."
good,A typical work day at sears was very busy.I learned to always put the customer and their needs first. The management there was somewhat effective. I got alone very well with my co workers. The hardest part of the job was trying to please every single customer including difficult ones.The most enjoyable part was to see a happy customer when leaving that you've helped.
good,"all i will say is we were all in the same bout we the co workers looked after each other becouse the company did not. To get the job done it did not matter even if they wanted you to brake safty rules , I have seen this at the store levels, but also must add bad bussness to there list they will find a way example. they cant just fire you but will eliminate you job catagory , but instead of keeping you there or tranfering you to another area they just have you in a meeting along with others on a confrance call to let you know sorry we have to let you go this was a coprate thing. cant move you from full time to part time they just let you go and hire have baked part timers that have never worked in retail and then cut others hrs to meet pay roll and let the store you work so hard in goto he-- . and i must say this was not done to me but hurts me that i work for a company like this anyone have a job offer let me know plz."
good,"Its a great place to work, if only they could give me 40 hours a week."
good,"do as they say or loose your job, management is terrible, systems always crashing, turn over rate is HIGH i.e. hire and fire"
good,I would clock in working part time and was assigned to home improvement and outdoor furniture section. We would get paid commission per sale. The employees were competitive but not in a healthy way. Management wasn’t to intuitive with what was happening
good,It was not a bad job. It filled a void for a job and support while I attended school and got started with an employer with my degree. Most of the people were nice.
good,It would be a good  job for college students are high school students  but not  for someone with a family could  been better  if i had  more pay and better  benefits
good,Good job nice environment and great location. Job had plenty room for advancement. Company trained and offered opportunities to advance skills to marketable value
good,"Friendly coworkers. There are a lot of opportunities to gather experience and grow professionally. Not easy to take off when you need to, not much room for work schedule adjustments, and pay."
good,"Application Support Engineer, Seeking roles in Application Support, Core Java,Teradata SQL,Unix,MySQL."
good,"New ownership ruined a venerable, once highly regarded company. I worked at two stores that were closed. I loved working at Sears, the customers loved the stores and were so sad their store was closing. I could have transferred to another store but elected to take a small severance and some vacation. Found out a few weeks later that it was closing also. Sad, so sad."
good,"ouverture de la bijouterie,faire affichage de nouvelles promotions changer les prix ouvrir la caisse mettre en place les nouveaux produits servir les clients."
good,sears was my first job and it was pretty easy. the only down side was the management was all over the place sometimes and the building was always understaffed.
good,"I love my job because I love the people I work with. However, management can be so petty! You make one mistake and they take it out on your hours. And, they want you to get yelled at by customers because they want you to be so pushy with the credit cards. “Just let him yell. Maybe he’ll get mad enough to apply.”"
good,"I enjoy working here, but I feel the pay is too low for the job requirements. Sometimes we have to wait until a manager gets there to open the doors, and some employees get frustrated, I enjoy working here mostly because of the positive energy I get from other co workers."
good,"What I learn in catalogue is customer service first. You Have to please your customer when they are mad. You make sure that they can trust you to find the problem, and make sure you return the call to reassure them. \\\\in catalogue we had to deal with lots of those things. But there is always a solution so you can please your customer."
good,"It's a great place to work to build more experience for customer service and sales. You get a 45 minute lunch. It isn't paid lunch, but it is a great time length for it. While working I'm constantly on my feet."
good,"Management was in shambles. The manager was fired for fraud. The assistant manager quit. The next manager in line was phased out."
good,"The foot traffic at the mall contained the same people daily, except Saturdays. It was difficult trying to sell new customers on applying for the credit card."
good,"culture change from service to sale man. from full time to part time, 3th pary taken part of the job to put you  lay off, no one tell you next day off with out warning"
good,"Company is gone ."
good,Learned a lot about footwear and about shoe sizing. Loyal customers and self motivation to complete task. Management wasn't the best but still got the job done. Best part of the job was learning new things.
good,Come in to work have to search thru stock to find products to put on shelves to sell make sure they wasnt on the floor already than place them in system and location where you placed them put up shelfs displays place price tags on whole store before opening and closing
good,This job was a place where you had to sell agreements for different appliances that the company sold. The way you made money at that time was you got an incentive on every agreement you sold. People were being called all over the world so you know many were angry because they did not like getting woken up or just called at an bad time for them; but how could one know.
good,Productive and fun workplace. Place where you can learn a lot about work and gain different skills that can help you in the future. Had good relationships with management.
good,Worked as merchandiser for Land's End department. Placed new merchandise out and maintained area for selling. Good work environment and co-workers. Management was good to me.
good,"Lack of interaction with customers, there was hardly any customers that came through electronics and purchased anything. there was no hard work being done there and it was notorganized and they lacked employees because they did not have any hours to hand out."
good,"Although the team I worked with was excellent and my direct manager was the best, the company is falling apart, and it shows on the inside."
good,"Honestly I wasn't here for long, as a tool associate you only made 10 an hour in my state or 5 dollars + commission depending on which was more. I didn't care for the fact that since it was commission people fought over customers because they wanted the sales."
good,"Good place to work for a couple of years, then they started closing sears stores everywhere in Michigan which resulted in the reduction of in home service technicians required to support Michigan.  17 technicians were laid off and I was one."
good,Well I was a commissioned salesperson so I made a ton of dough.  But in the midst of it they proceeded to fire everyone I liked.  So there was that.  Probably would not recommend as they are firing people on the daily.
good,Lack of Training Support...the operations manager position requires full knowledge of the business but direct manager in building lacks the training knowledge or experience in operating a delivery operation.
good,This was a very simple job. I worked here when I was 16 for about two months. You have to go through a spiel with each customer (are you a part of the rewards program? Would you like to be? Would you like to donate to such and such charity? Do you have a Sears card? Would you like one? No!? There are so many benefits!) and the customers get mad FAST. We had to push the credit card at least two more times after the customer said no. Your hours depended on how many credit card sign ups you got.
good,"Typical day consisted of wandering around the appliance department helping customers find the appliance that would work best for them. Product knowledge was key, and was easy to find and remember to show customers the ins and outs of the merchandise."
good,"A typical work day started out checking metrics and coming up with a plan to improve throughout the day. Everything was about those metrics, driving them and job security relied on it. If you failed to meet them then you got coached on how to improve. Upper Management only cared about those metrics. Hardest part about the job was getting starting associates to care about the metrics and to improve them. Best part about the job was your coworkers, having someone there that knew what was going on."
good,"Sears is a good company to work for. A typical day at work consist of selling appliances and working with public. The customers can be somewhat difficult at times but other than that, it's an okay place to work for."
good,"My work day varies help customers and employees with any questions check shipping orders, verify deliveries handle any complaints if possible. dealing with shipments is sometimes challenging I like working with customers and helping them get the right product for their needs"
good,"It was a very fun learning experience team was awesome, the team had a winning mentality always wanted to exceed goals. always willing to help each other."
good,"Buen apoyo por parte de los gerentes siempre atentos al igual que los compañeros de piso, simepre abra ayuda."
good,"calls into call centre as complaints on delivery service from coast to coast.  Most who complained were right in doing so, but some were not, good for developing a thick skin with verbal abusive language and impossible demands from customers on a daily, minute by minute basis. We had the authority to compensate problems."
good,"All the associates are friendly and very easy to talk to and make good friends with, lots of common customers so they know the policies and returns and refunds (there is a few people who will pitch a fit, just call a manager and help other people if they do), management who wont try to help in any way, shape, or form. If you do call a manager then don't expect anything unless its not busy, forever to respond, maybe 2 managers are excluded from this review though. Sears is a dying company so they have a bunch of people on little pay all fighting to feed themselves. Don't work here if you are looking for a good paying job/job with lots of hours; you wont find that here. If you are looking for basic retail experience and want an easy ride through it then this is a good job, Like i said, don't take this if you need money. There is little to none benefits, full time and part time is just what separates Sears from giving you benefits despite working the same or more hours as a full time member."
good,"El ambiente en Sears es bueno pero, el tiempo de trabajo es algo pesado, todo el día y en ventas nocturnas es aun mas pesado."
good,"Store management is OK, but district, regional,and corporate don't have a clue."
good,"un dia de trabajo en Sears, es comun, cuando hay trabajo el horario se extiende hasta dos o tres horas despues del horario normal... cuando no hay trabajo se busca que hacer."
good,"Assistant Store Manager, Hardlines is more than likely the most difficult mid level management job within the company. you are tasked with a high amount of responsibility and are held accountable for most of the stores metrics. Market and District Managers are completely out of touch with what is actually happening at the store level. It is an ok place to work."
good,Primarily on compensation based pay on top of a base pay. Company allowed transfers between Kmart and Sears allowing for a broad area to relocate if necessary.
good,"A very Vital role in the store , Appliance sales are typically large Sales bringing in the company plenty money."
good,sales associate - assisting customers with daily needs handling cash credit/debit cards restocking the floors with inventory
good,"If you like a job that is creative and rewarding, this is the place to work! You'll never feel like you're working. Getting paid to make people smile is wonderful!"
good,"Demonstrated ability to provide quality information about the product, and assist the customer in their choice of what to buy. "
good,It was a fun place to work. The manager was great! I enjoyed helping customers. I learned a lot about the mechanics of how tires actually work.
good,the job keeps you busy. There are several tasks to learn. You get to talk to  follow employee while you work. You get to be social with customers. and all still work.
good,"i love sears. and all the managamennt very kind and helpful. I was a cashier so i would ring up the customers items and than clean around my area, helping the customers with what ever they needed."
good,Management is sub-par at its best i'd say but all places have their days i guess. The co-workers are the best part of being there honestly. Typical day is stressful if others don't fulfill their specified duties for the day.
good,"File night before paperwork, check for appointments, review the days sales goals and plan the day out. The employees were very knowledgeable,"
good,"My days would usually consistent of making sure that all clothing racks signs are up to date and on the right merchandise. Then, I pull out new product and place it properly in its place. Lastly I finish the day off with walking the store and making sure that the store was looking acceptable by folding clothes on table and organized the racks."
good,"Member of a team that managed a floor of over 800+ parts and service employees."
good,Working in retail has taught me that I definitely don't miss it much since leaving it. The time constraints and expectations demanded daily made for a stressful daily life. Pay was decent but definitely not what I think it should have been but that's from 1 persons perspective.
good,"Coming to work with a positive attitude, feeling good about myself, ready to work and the good people around me. Getting all my tasks done and accomplishing what is required for the job. The hardest part on the job is not being able to help customers as quickly as you can when the store is busy and when there is a long line of customers and them with little patience, trying to help them out as much as you can. The most enjoyable part of the job is having that one on one eye contact with your customers and tending to them. Making them want to come back to the store."
good,"Great people to work with,"
good,You are assigned to clean either a residential or commercial building. Good job if you like to be active and have good attention to detail.
good,"Daily safe deposits, Monday morning fax weekly deposits to head office. Daily paperwork, redeeming sears points, catalogue receiving, and pickups for customers. Helping customers return sears catalogue items. Filing daily paperwork, sales associates daily sales cards. Setting up and taking down of sales price tags."
good,"at times it was so busy then on down times it was boring just standing and looking. all of the employees was nice and kind"
good,"I had a love/hate for this job. It is feast or famine, and you have to be ready for both. Working with cars is very rewarding and it was the best part. You get paid hourly minimum wage, but you have times when it is dead, and when you are overwhelmed by the volume. Customers are a roll of the dice, never know what you're gonna get. Everything is sales based, and the employees are competitive, but super fun and everyone is ready to laugh, so it's not high pressure. Management is great, they are very supportive, and firm. And the most surprising was that they are willing to take responsibility, which, in my experiences, has never happened before at previous jobs. The hours are okay, they will work you crazy if you let them, but will also try to respect your needs. Especially if it is temporary, like a semester schedule."
good,"A typical day at Sears, putting out clothes and items for customers to shop. Ringing out customers after they have finished shopping or assist with any questions that the customers may have regarding the items that they are looking for or purchasing."
good,decent salary can easily be made but poor management and the companies failure to modernize is leading to its downfall.
good,Leaned what it was like to work as a team.. The management I work with listen to the employees if we knew how to make the location more efficient
good,Love the people I work with but the company is horrible. Barely any advancement and barely any raises.  Ive stayed so long trying to advance and I cannot go anywhere farther with this company.
good,can be worthwhile to gain some basic experience with customer services and sales roles.
good,"I enjoy working with the other employees at Sears. The pay is not enough to live off of and there are no raises. Many people quit making more responsibilities fall upon others. Ex. If there are not any cashiers scheduled or quit, others will have to step up to take their place. I enjoy working with people so its not too bad of a job and great discounts and prices!"
good,"Greeting customers, giving them information on jewelry sales and promotions. Working together to meet quota for the month. Accomplishing a sale was the most enjoyable for me and not meetin a customers needs in pricing and losing a customer would be the hardest part."
good,"typical day at work"
good,"not enough workers"
good,"If it were capable of being my career in a more upbeat and positive environment with a living wage; I would of worked there longer. I made life long friends working there, and customers I still talk to here and there after bonding. However, people are always in fear of not enough hours and being fired. Regardless of job report."
good,good place to work but not much job security and not very understanding of going to school
good,it was a typical job. I learned customer Service Skills. Management was horrible .Co-Workers were the same. The hardest part of my job was working around difficult people.The most enjoyable was the customers.
good,"management is nice"
good,they make it hard for you to keep your commission if you work in sales
good,"Good career if they could have kept the company going, They have closed several stores nation wide"
good,You have to have a lot of energy to work with kids and families to get them all to look and smile at the same time.
good,"Although I have enjoyed my time working for Sears, as well as the people who I work with, there is no room for advancement in this company."
good,"a very stressful working enviroment, very disorganized,but good bosses, and an ok salary."
good,loved working with different people everyday. hated the drive for the amount of pay.  didn't feel appreciated by company but definitely felt appreciated by my customers! loved being able to show my creative side.
good,funniest job ever.  Would like to go back during the hoilday.
good,Ok job with the worst job security and favorites when it comes to advancements within the job.
good,es el trato directo con los  clientes y ofreser lo mejor de la empresa y  darle a conoser las  ofertas q la tienda tine para los clientes
good,"I combined extensive product knowledge with customer relation skills to assist consumers in making their home electronics, and appliance purchases."
good,"A Typical day at work is printing the ad for the day and then setting the ad which is taking the old signs down and putting up new signs.next stock shelves and set new up new displays and stock.  I have learned to sale,give great member service and to work with coworkers that are like family.  I work with management on a daily bassis and help with there work.  The hardest part of the job is stop working with the members (customers) and going home. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing how much i can accomplish."
good,This was a great job but the department closed down shortly after I left. 
good,"Nice, calm evenings. Assisting customers was/is always my thing to do. Co-workers and myself didn't really interact, since I was working from home. It was just myself and Management. I liked being able to take breaks and snack throughout work. "
good,"Very repetitive learned about appliances"
good,Sears is a place I enjoy working. A typical day is spent pushing freight to the floor setting merchandise on floor helping the customer
good,"Co-workers are decent people, family friendly environment"
good,If you love working on cars they will train you in all aspects or automotive repair
good,"I liked working with different people and different jobs. I enjoyed meeting the drivers and hearing about their travels. I was able to do quality control on the work that the tech have done. Knowing that if I was a customer, is this how I would want my product back."
good,"My co workers made it great working there . The management was lacking in the teamwork aspect, no support from them or upper management . The knowledge I learned will be used other places"
good,Answering phone to help customers with any issues.
good,"At sears i learned how to be a great employee towards my customers. I learned about credit cards, reward programs, and even sales experience. Some mangers were very friendly, and others were not so much. My co-workers were the best and we all were part of the same team, helping and doing whatever it took for one another to succeed. The hardest part of the job was explaining to the customers about the the way our reward points work, but once explained they completely loved it. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing i had the co-workers that was always on my side to help no matter the situation."
good,"A lot of fun to work here because the store was slow on an everyday basis, but very unproductive day to day. Its the culture that has come to be expected and unwilling to change as mediocrity has come to be the norm."
good,Recieved a route via satelite on company provided laptop with service orders Placed calls to customers to schedule a time and drove all over the state as well as some outside the state.
good,i have learned to be more focus on customer solutions
good,"They put way too much pressure on forcing customers to apply for credit cards, and cut hours drastically if you don't perform."
good,It was fun the managers very very motivating and fun to be around
good,good job mostly for a part-time.Cashier- stand greet customers and check them out.
good,This is a good student job but could be better for a career person or someone looking to make a career if the benefits were better and they paid u more. Six dollars an hour plus comission is not very good if the comission rates are only 1 percent. I know alot of other comission jobs that pay alot more and give higher percentages.
good,"This was a great real first job. It was simple. A typical day consisted of cashiering, cleaning and customer service."
good,My typical work day at sears would involve calling customers to tell them their pictures are ready to be picked up. I would call people to have them come into the store. I would occasionally have to take photos and sale them to the coustomer.
good,"A typical day at work involves creating schedules for sales representatives, facilitating a sales meeting, and then training new sales reps and completing three or more proposals for HVAC/home improvement products. I have learned a lot about HVAC and home improvement products, how to strengthen relationships with clients and coworkers with a problem solving attitude, how to communicate directions in a coherent manner, and problem solve issues in a timely and friendly manner. I enjoy traveling from site to site and having the freedom of creating my schedule. The hardest part of the job was the amount of traveling required. For example, I live in San Joaquin County but had appointments as far away as Fresno and Monterey on a somewhat regular basis."
good,"A typical day working for this company consist of personally working with customers to reassure that they purchase the product that is most essential and benefitial to them. I've learned a lot working for this company. I learned to be a great customer service representative, how to become knowledgeable about a product, present it to the customer with honesty and at the same time, convince them to the purchase the product. I enjoy working with my co-workers as well as my managers. However, some of the managers could use an adjustment in their attitudes and how they treat the associates working under their authority. The hardest part of this job would be maintaining the department because we have so many customers to assist and so much inventory to prepare in so little time. However, with determination and patience everyone and everything is taken care of. The most enjoyable part of this job is interacting with people. I love being in an atmosphere where I can help someone."
good,You can learn so much about various electronics at this company.
good,"Loved my job, but nervous about losing it every day. It is hard hearing ""they're are no guarantees"", while trying to do your best. The headquarters at Hoffman is getting quieter and quieter."
good,"Sears allowed for internal advancement, and provided great incentives for making sales plan each quarter. They gave you the autonomy to make decisions for your department."
good,This was a great place to work while I was going through school. I liked the people that I worked with. I wasn't able to do as much but everyday was different than the next.
good,"I didn't work there long. I just held a sign for them advertising the fact that they were going out of business. Made my own hours and got paid daily, which was nice."
good,Allowed to work full or part time. allowing time to continue education. Staff very caring. Most employee work well with each other. Not many advancements positions.
good,I loved the people I worked with everyone was friendly. Although not all of the managers were not respectful and didn’t know how to do their own job. I don’t recommend.
good,"Sears was a good company to work for, I would still be their if the company had not closed down, My district manager was great he was always their if you needed him."
good,"working six days a week, ten hour shifts because we were always short handed, burns people out real quick. did meet a lot of nice people along the journey, hardest part of the job is to meet sears expectations and requirements"
good,"I worked as regular associate in the portrait studio and then was promoted to management almost 13 years ago. This was a company within Sears called CPI, they leased the space in Sears so I cant speak about Sears.  It was a high stress job but creating those moments for people made it all worth it. I stayed in this job for about 8 years and was very successful. I became a mentor to my staff, even after they moved on to other jobs. I left for a better opportunity and this company has gone out of business."
good,"I have learned valuable skills in a tough work environment, working with vendors to drive profits for Sears Online business. Going through a bankruptcy teaches you skills and make you approach your job in different ways and look at it through multiple lenses."
good,"Sears has been through a lot, but for those who can be flexible and patient it is a great opportunity to forge your own path, learn anything that you want in the industry, and take initiative."
good,It was a good place to work but so many stores have been closing and you never know if you will have a job after being with the company for years. worked here for years
good,"daily dealing with employee issues, questions, bringing people on board or off boarding.  Hardest part of job was when I had to eliminate positions but I took all steps I could to set up programs, etc to help the impacted associates.the culture of the company was right on, they were doing what they needed to do to increase profitability. Management gave the room to run my business.  The most enjoyable part of the job was going the extra mile if necessary to help someone get something taken care of and not letting it slip thru the cracks."
good,"While working for sears I learned to work as part of a team while we off loaded trucks and processed them, In a typical day I may have to receive or ship merchandise while being available to stage or load a customer item, Management was ready to aid us with customer issues The culture was like family relaxed and ready to help each other. The hardest and enjoyable was giving our members  a wow shopping experiance"
good,"I enjoyed the people I with whom I worked but the salary was pitiful, the benefits just OK and the managers were not very good.  There was one manager who was very good but she left and the person who took her place was a joke."
good,Sears is a fun job to work in. It's a social environment and easy to balance social with work. A lot of the customers are really nice and easy to talk to to.
good,Highly recommended anyone to work. Get to know new people get to be a hero learn about system. Test your strength in communication skills and networking. Also test your strength on the job description.
good,"The outlet stores are different from the retail stores. I never work for the retail stores. We sold used appliance, closeout merchandise that was no longer sold in the stores."
good,I love working in the jewelry department and I would not be leaving the company except the store is closing and I do not want to drive the distance to any of the remaining Sears stores.
good,I was employed by Kmart/Sears for 29 years and intended to finish my career there but did not happen.   I would not recommend a job at Sears at this time because the company is too unstable right now.
good,I would not recommend anyone I personally know to go to sears in tucker to work the manager I had was childish and petty. This job is really for someone who needs a quick job to get on there feet
good,I worked in receiving and found this to be a very fun work environment. It may have been quick paced but it was relaxed and fun. Everyone got along and management was great. Especially with working around school schedules.
good,"Sears starts always with a meeting that helps us to boost our energy and confidence. We have to believe that our products are the best so that we can promote it as the best product they will have. Our manager will give us a pep-talk about sales on how much we lack and how much we gain. He keeps us on track at the same time appreciating our efforts in raising the sales. He also reminds us to push harder so that we are always on our feet to achieve our goals."
good,Es un buen lugar para trabajar la mayoría de los empleados trabajan por Comisión es indispensable un buen servicio
good,"Overall the company has good talent and tries to train employees, but the work culture is depressing. At this point there is to much going around and not enough working bee's. There are a lot of decision makers just not enough to execute."
good,"I wasted so much time working at Sears, not only was management rude, but they hired their son/daughters so their was so many incidents of conflict of interest."
good,"The position help me acquired different point of view ,"
good,Overall experience was good. Received excellent training on job performance. Very good communication between your immediate supervisor and the associates.
good,"people were pleasant, had nice breakroom, clean bathrooms, most supervisors were nice, work was fairly fast paced most of day, only things  that would be considered a down side was having to go up & down stairs many times a day"
good,"Most days I would be moving merchandise with forklift within the plant, also operated other machinery as required.  I leaned to work independently and always tried to get the job done.  Alot of negativity in the plant which I tried to avoid...I chose to go to work, tried to have the best day I could, and give it my best effort.  Did not find any part of the job difficult, I knew my responsibilities and I did them.  The most enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers, worked with a great bunch in my area"
good,"Working at Sears can be enjoyable."
good,Amazon and the retail industry is negatively impacting sales. Inventory levels are dropping. Associates are all concerned they are closing and hard to get good help with the concerns.
good,"A typical workday starts at 04:30hrs and finishes around 16:00hrs."
good,"Fast paced work environment but very friendly and helpful staff, always will be on your toes and there will always be something to do. Enjoyed working here a lot."
good,Very fast paced. Up at 6am end at 6pm. Great if you like working with people and can take the criticism when you do not have parts on hand to fix the appliances.
good,"The management in this store aren't professional..she has preferences with some manager ...in this store we don't have an equal opportunity of employment, no matter how you work if you are not friend of this manager you don't have any opportunity to sucess"
good,"Responsibilities including: unlocking the Store and changing alarms  6 am and monitoring by camera and floor surveillance all points of access prior to and after opening. Frequent conversations with store customers and associates with different demeanors regarding Company, Store policies and Point Of Sale procedures. Daily safety walks to look for problem areas that could be of hazard to Store customers, associates and staff.(Risk Management) Writing and filing reports as needed as well as accomplishing any other task that might be asked of me."
good,sears did a great job at providing an environment and it was quite an experience. I never worked retail before however this was a great opportunity and learning experience
good,"Sears as a company is not that bad. At the store I worked at, management was horrible and there were some issues. The biggest issue I have with working here is the pay and the discount. There is basically NO employee discount. They say that there is but it is barely anything. The pay is also as low as possible, it really sucks. The other employees at the store were kind and we all got along well, but there were lots of issues I had with a new manager we got."
good,Family oriented and very fun to be around.  Polite employees who care about there customers.  Safe and friendly environment.  Glad to be a part of the Loss Prevention department.
good,sears is declining on paper and in store per the inventory availability and the logistics systems.  The upper management is micromanagement style and does not do a lot to train and coach middle management
good,"Great place to work, but hours not great. like the people I work with. I Iike helping the customers. Always meeting new people and making new friends."
good,i really enjoyed working at sears. coworkers were fun to work with and management was on top of everything. i would defiantly recommend working a sears.
good,"I liked working there. The co-workers were friendly and helped out when I needed it. The pay wasn't the best, but I got by. I didn't like coming in early in the mornings all that much, I do not mind working until closing time though."
good,"Working at Sears is a joy of professionalism, feeling of pride in a name. Recently new tactics of techs to sale warranties and additional maintenance at cost to customers has made primary duties difficult and sometimes not possible to complete jobs. The constant pressure to sale warranties every day and a requirement to sale or be placed on probation has made it less desirable-able to continue working with Sears."
good,this job was all about hard work no matter what. there was no time to play nor socialize. the only problem was that it was based on contracting so the workers/drivers had no benefits
good,"Great place to start off for being 16-18. It is retail though, one of the hardest most stressful jobs in the industry. Management can get to you, you have to keep your numbers up. Just provide good customer service and you'll have no problem succeeding there"
good,"Working here was early morning shifts usually by yourself, which I found great. Management was alright, and I've made some life long friends from working there."
good,"Touch base with immediate team members on workload and does anyone need help.  Lots of interaction with other business teams, organization team members answering questions or working to help resolve pricing or signing issue.  "
good,"While I worked at Sears I had decent management and lazy co-workers, but overall the people were nice and it was a friendly work environment. Due to there only being a few people in the back room, everyone had enough tasks to keep them busy for the whole day. But some of the workers would often push their tasks onto me because they claimed a lack of physical strength or because it would be easier for me to do it, even though I already had my ""plate"" full with numerous tasks. This was just because of laziness and nothing else. I often found myself picking up a couple of my co-workers slack, but I didn't complain because I needed a job, even if it was low pay for a lot of work. They scheduled me plenty of hours, but they often would schedule me by myself for 5-7 hours and left me to figure things out through experience rather than training me properly to handle certain situations. All in all, the work environment was good, but the job wasn't quite so good."
good,Relaxed working environment as a starting job as a young man to get a good work ethic.  Enjoyed interacting with customers providing help to them in any way..
good,"I loved working at Sears, it was always fast paced but when it slowed down it was a nice break and it would allow my team and i to get the floor and the fitting rooms tidy."
good,"This company has no opportunity for advancement, nor does it offer full time employment ( normal hrs per week 20-25). Has a high turnover rate. Pay is low with no room for raises or bonuses. This review is based on Kmart employment."
good,the job s are easy training is tedious no help from management no one new what to do when problems happened to many changes in management unstable hard to get your vacation days
good,"The long hours with minimum staffing. The challenging was to make the facility goal. Also, making the department goals without effecting another department."
good,"Sears is a bottom dollar company with bad management and over worked associates. Associates are quick to unite and create a fun, friendly, and inviting environment, but beneath the surface is a lack of trust in store leaders. Like most failing retailers, Sears cares about meeting financial goals and looking good on paper while functionality of the store suffers. Cultural values, mission statements, goals, and training are amazing! Very sufficient. The company doesn't lack vision, it lacks priorities. If Sears put their customers first, like they claim to, they wouldn't struggle financially or have aggressive sale's reps forcing customers to sign up for in-store credit cards so they can continue hanging on by a thread. There have been associates who have worked in the store for 9+ years and they have not seen a pay raise (some still making $7.25) or a promotion. Associate discounts were taken away and those few associate with full-time benefits are over charged for basic health and dental coverage (charged $60+ every pay period!). "
good,Great place to work.  People are amazing and it's a fun and creative environment.  Met lots of amazing people and would recommend working here if you love people
good,I enjoyed 20 years working with Sears Canada Inc. The staff the I managed were a pleasure to work with. The management direction often changed requiring adaptation and flexibility.
good,"A great company with great employees.  Company focus could be more streamlined focused on customer service product lines and vendors.  Employee compensation was not worth most applications minimum wage attracted those who felt they had to take the employment while still looking for gainful well paying jobs or careers."
good,Its a fun work place but I was given less hours and has to do things in order to earn hours and some people were rude. Also managers called me names for no reason.
good,"I liked working in the Fraud department, I thoroughly enjoyed my job, sadly health issues and life made me have to leave this position. I mostly enjoyed the amount of investigating we did to stop fraudulent transactions and persons"
good,Loved the environment and the people jus didn't like haveing to push the credit cards on people enjoyed working there with all the people loved the hours I worked
good,Productive especially with online ordering. Backroom associates in my opinion keep the company afloat. They work the hardest and the longest hours. I learned how badly managed a company can be.
good,"Sears like every other retail gives horrible hours after the holiday season is over. And if you can't get them credit applications that's not the job for you, other wise it's fun and easy pace to work here."
good,"I never knew when a policy had changed until a few months after the change occurred. There was no availability to advance in the company, you were stuck wherever you were."
good,not much room for advancements.company is OK for college students. OK for experience only. they do not allow much time for a personal life.
good,"This is a decent company to work for, however, it's very stressful that you are constantly being ""pushed"" to keep ""pushing"" customers to enroll onto the stores credit card."
good,Depending on the management and the store it can be a great place or a complete nightmare. Typically tires seem to be what keeps them in business. Promises made and not kept.
good,"the days were long, but rewarding. lots of inbound calls from customers needing help on their orders. they had a very flexible schedule if time off was needed."
good,Kmart and Sears have been struggling for years and it is getting worse. This is the only reason that I am looking elsewhere to move on. Leaving the people will be hard.
good,"loved have that job was the most fun, but not the best could have use better direction and and better organization in hours and time and place. but loved the manager i had."
good,Like most companies there's some mediocre staff then there's superstars. most of the dms and specialist have been nothing short of fantastic but their superiors seek only the people they can mold.
good,"My time spent working under Sears taught me a lot. It taught me a lot about patience, discipline, and organization. Definitely learned a thing or two to carry with me into life."
good,"I stocked shelves, inventoried, Sold merchandise and supported the manager in the department, but the main thing is Customer Service"
good,"*Unexpected of how flow was going to be by customers."
good,"The employees were pretty great. It was a really positive work environment. The management was either right on your butt or they were way too laid back. The job itself was very easy, and you learned to multi-task."
good,"Really great place to work, awesome co workers and management. The hardest part of the job is the metrics. The most enjoyable part of the job is the work environment."
good,they have a dress code and flexible break times. All the upper management is nice and are trying to make the company better.
good,"good company it is a good job but as 2 be expected you get a lot of jobs and are unreal to get to all calls before time frame, equipment tech works with has to be reset all the time or fuses replaced....management has never been a tech and hard to get an answer on an issue"
good,me gusta mi trabajo el trato con la gente el compañerismo el gerente una persona con la cual se puede platicar y te atiende amablemente la parte mas dificil es cuando algun cliente no termina de comprar y ya se cerro la tienda
good,"was required to download route every morning and run calls accordingly "
good,"Sold Craftsman hand and power tools. Lawn tractors, mowers, snow blowers, and other related lawn and garden tools. Fitness equipment, treadmills, exercise bikes, and elliptical machines. Also related exercise equipment. Seasonal items such as gas grills, patio furniture, mountain bikes, cruising bikes, and holiday related items."
good,"A typical day at work would be going in and cleaning up merchandise. Some days i will change the signs around the store to update prices. I've learned that some days you can't always get everything done. Between helping customers, putting out merchandise and cleaning up merchandise it can take some time. I really enjoy my co-workers and my management. They are very friendly. The most enjoyable part of my job would have to be helping customers find exactly what they are looking for and seeing the joy on there face."
good,pagan bien solo si vendes mucho muchos dias de trabajo buenos companeros de trabajo y buen supervior
good,"Sears is a struggling corporation led into irrelevancy by short sighted management."
good,I worked here as a clerical and it was interesting. It was peaceful and harmonious. All co-workers seem to get a long very well. Managers were professional and cared for the well being and security of employees. Good place to work at.
good,"great if your in need of income and your working threw school, but not a great job if you are raising a family and need stable income"
good,I was a difficult place to work. This was another temporary position. A typical day would start with me getting a scanner  and I would go to a packing station and make sure I had supplies. I would then go get what ever I needed. Next i would check the first container to make sure all the parts were there and pack the and send them to shipping. At some point I would either be sent to shipping where I would start scanning boxes or envelopes to create a shipping label and ship the item or I would be sent to the truck where I would load boxes on a cart and take them to the truck and load them on the truck. I would do either of those until the supervisor decided to send back to packing and vise versa.
good,Good place to work and have been treated fairly.  No room to advance now. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to make decisions and act on them to benefit both the Company and the Customer. Enjoy being accountable to handle and resolve escalated issue while gaining trust from internal and external customers. Each day brings new challenges and more knowledge.
good,"very stressful, very little communication from management, love the position but no hours to support self or family on due to newer management and hiring of extra staff that is not called out in company"
good,"I enjoy my job. my favorite part of the job is my co workers. I enjoy working with them. I also enjoy most of the managers I work with. the hardest part of the job is balancing helping members, putting stock out according to the floor plan and answering the codes/ phone for help. the most enjoyable part of the job is working as a team."
good,"Positive open dialogue with everyone. Great teamwork throughout."
good,"As an employee with Sears Holdings Company, I worked at a Kmart. "
good,Working at sears was great! They gave you tasks to keep up with during the day in between cashiering. Management was great and easy to talk to and they solved problems quickly.The work environment was great and i really enjoyed.
good,it was an ok place to work at very busy fast pace. Very scattered needs to be on top of things. Management was ok lots of costumers can rum into many problems.
good,At first the company was great and then when new managers moved in the store had a whole new atmosphere and wasn't the same.
good,"i liked working there but the management was not stable, the work didn't fill the hours, i would have loved having more responsibility"
good,"Due to working there I feel that I could sell ice to an eskimo but other than that I don't think that it helped me besides making me marketable. The accountability for associates, the management staff and the policies were constantly changing and it was far too stressful for long term employment."
good,"Just a job to earn pay, good online training, but really no one cares. It is okay for a person with moderate needs. Keep working and one day you will make it. shoot for the moon."
good,Helping customers find items that they are looking for and checking out those items. Dealing with money and offering them a chance to receive a discount by applying for a credit card.
good,You again are dependent on your manager.  Poor communication from my manager.  Very controlling which was not company policy
good,"Need to be an interactive 'people person' to do this job."
good,"•	Leading and coaching sales team in achieving daily/monthly and yearly sales goals."
good,Management changes very quickly and none go by the sears policies and procedures. Then they work employees extremely hard due to being short handed and turn around and write them up for going over their 5th hour when there was no one to cover their shift. I was apart of the management team but the 4th rank so i just had to go with the flow and that is the reason I am seeking a less stressful environment.
good,"Management helped, learned how to engage customers, and learned the latest consumer trends when it came to electronics. I started working here at 18. Commission did not seem so bad but eventually I wanted to get out. Competing against your coworkers for sales does get ugly. I just did not feel right after a while. If you love working on commission, this is a job for you."
good,i loved the pay and working 9-5 dream hour for a single mother but than they added more workload but didnt increase pay.they stopped carrying about there employee and never cared about the well being of there customer at the end of the day it was all about money no real customer service
good,I was hired on as part-time worker but it ended up they let me go because they said I was seasonal. That didn't bother me much but I wish they would have been upfront with me. Co-workers were fun to talk to and work with.
good,Was hired in a temporary position. But they made it a pleasant experience while I was there. There could have been better communication between management.
good,"Sears management cares more about the bottom line than their employees. They absolutely do not give raises unless an employee is promoted. They only hire for minimum coverage on the floor. "
good,"I dealt with customer complaints, returns, coordinating breaks, lunches, processed credit cards, set up tills, balanced service desk cash drawer and accounted for all tills turned in and in safe and ran end of day reports.  I learned returns on register.  I liked my management and coworkers.  The hardest part of the job was making sure the cashiers were taking breaks, lunches on time.  I loved the responsibility."
good,Sears Corporation gave me the opportunity to find out what I really want as a technician. I learn that to work as HVAC Tech. I was in need to go back to school and re-envent my self
good,Selling fine jewelry has taught me to never judge by appearances. You can never tell who is going to purchase the expensive jewelry.I feel management does well within the structure in which they work. My co workers are all great. We all get along.
good,The ability to thoroughly work well under pressure. Professional and down to earth. Ability to handle unruly patrons and dissolve problems quickly. Flexible and versatile. Able to maintain focus during stressful situations. Poised and competent with the ability to sustain a personal yet professional relationship with clients.
good,"Everyday at work I get to help members have the best experience with us at sears. I learned so much each day, from selling mattresses to creating, sorting and putting up all of the stores signing. Management guided me through the merchandising and taught me to read and apply plan-o-grams to the merchandise. Each and everyday my coworkers make it delightful to be there and put a smile on my face. I struggled at first with learning to use the typicals and plan-o-grams when I began as an MCA compared to a sales associate. The best part of the job for me at this point is the family atmosphere of the workplace. I really feel at home with my coworkers."
good,I learned a lot with this job. I feel as if this company really prepared me for any other career in the same field.
good,"A typical workday included part-time hours.  I learned that in order to make money, it requires sales knowledge and a go-getter mentality to make money.  My co-workers were very family oriented.  The hardest part of the job was the part-time pay and the most enjoyable part was the ability to balance work along with my family."
good,"A typical day at work is a high energy, sales driven culture! I have learned over the course of 17+ years to adapt to any and all situations, value people, and work hard. The current site director is very in touch with the needs of this direct reports. I love the people that I work with. The most challenging part of the job would be not knowing what to expect from day to day. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the positive difference that I have made with the people that I come in contact with."
good,". Work as a liaison for Help Desk Analysts regarding Outlook 2012. Windows OS b g questions. "
good,I had an very experienced team. We all worked well together. There was a ton of work to be done daily. I enjoyed that I was a hiring manager.
good,All my co-workers were really good. They encouraged me all the time. I learned how to deal with difficult customers and better customer service. The hardest part of the job was to stand all day long. I loved talking to people and making contacts.
good,Sears has some truly outstanding people working for them; my direct boss was fantastic.  I got along great with all of my co-workers and superiors; but because I was not working within the Sales Department; there simply was no room for either advancement or adequate compensation.  Loved my bosses and co-workers but simply put felt trapped because my only option for a promotion was to return to the Sales floor which was not aligned with my career aspirations.
good,Sears Holding Corporation and the subsideary Kmart have been working towards improvement since the buyout a few years ago. sales have increased and the fading company is indeed making a come back.
good,great people working holidays stinks need to pay more money to associates
good,I loved working in the tool center. it was always welcomed and loving. They guys were always nice to me and taught me a lot about tools
good,Sales associate. Customer Service. Typical Sales Associate role at any Sears Store.
good,I would come in to work and see if we needed to order any merchandise. I actually learned how to order and make copies of the order for my own just in case. My co-workers were friendly and helpful when I needed their help.
good,Staff was fun and management were very professional. Didn't run into any problems while working there.
good,"cold, dust, conjested, short of equipment. there is nothing else to say"
good,"A typical day in the retail Loss Prevention field at Sears Holding Company begins with a routine tour of the entire store.  This may change day to day depending on if there is some other immediate attention needed on one particular area.  This job requires me to be adaptive to the customers, the merchandise, the associates, the managers, and the community.  Being able to agree or disagree with other management in a professional manner is a skill that was learned from experience.  Other associates may not adhere to any form of direction, but the job is still completed by someone who will be the first to step up.  The hardest part of the job is constantly repeating myself on the simplest tasks to the department leads, such as checking in merchandise in receiving to ensure we have received it, and to follow up with the warehouse if we did not.  This requires emotional intelligence.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the tangible positive result from my words or actions.  For example, catching a shoplifter with a high amount of merchandise and learn that they are a wanted felon.  Having the arresting officer thank me and tell me I did a great job is the highlight of whole experience."
good,Go in and review stats. Make sure work area was clean and presentable for customers. Selling and cashiering. Worked as a cashier and electronic sales. Management was on but the managers kept changing and that did not boost moral. My coworkers were wonderful. I have created life long friends from people I have worked with at Sears. Hardest part of the job was selling the protection plans. Most enjoyable part of the job was I had the chance to watch movies all day in electronics.
good,"Had the hardest working team. Always on top,  did our jobs and lots of jobs that were not ours."
good,Too much politics evolved for the work place to maintain decorum. It makes it hard to do your job .
good,"Management wasn't the best. All they really care about is getting credit apps from customers. Other then that, the work experience was a good one. Enjoyed being able to work out the truck and help customers. Just didn't like the management or how they treated workers."
good,sears was okay.  The holiday seasons were the best.  They have dress codes which made it easier some days.
good,"Working with Sears Holdings was a nice experience. I learned a lot about the retail world, handling customer issues and working as a leader. I was an assistant to the HR manager therefore I was in charge of making and releasing schedules, as well as writing up, terminating and hiring employees. I also managed the cash room, in which making sure all money was allocated for each day or night. Unfortunately there was no room for growth in the office, therefore i had to resign upon finding employment elsewhere."
good,"Sears is a great company to work for. You make friends and get to be professional at the same time. Lots of laughs and good commissions on top of your normal pay rate. The management was good but they did gossip about any associate below them, and would have ""clicks"" and some refused to help you when you were dealing with a hostile costumer which i thought was completely unacceptable for a manager to refuse to help a customer, which then makes the associate look bad for not giving good service. Some managers would threaten your job daily if you didn't get customers phone numbers and get them to open a sears charge card. The pressure made many associates leave the company, "
good,"Just your typical retail job, stocking shelves to helping older people with any questions they may have.  Helping load/ unload delivery trucks."
good,"I loved what I did there. I love photography and working with families.  Customer service is number one in my book. But with the company going under it was was hard working day to day holding our breath for  a call or email that the company had gone under. I had an amazing manager in my home studio, meanwhile some of the other studios I worked in had flimsy managers. I loved working there day in and day out. Making the smiles last on their faces when they left with prints very satisfied. The hardest part of the job was knowing that I was going no where with no way to move up because the company was going into bankruptcy. "
good,•	Performed warehouse duties including unloading trucks and stocking shelves.
good,"I sold appliances so a typical day was spent with customers helping them decide on what product was best for them. Management wasn't too bad, but they just made sure they did enough to cover themselves. I learned new sales techniques and how to help a customer come to a decisions. Your coworkers are always what you make it and I always enjoyed working with everyone."
good,"Fix appliances in customers homes, worked with a great bunch of guys and enjoyed what I did. Management not understanding when it came to needing time off for family problems and was let go for needing to take leave of absences."
good,"The work is very slow and I'm not gettting any hours. The job is very stressful. We have to meet a quota, if not you'll get written up and then after so many write ups you are fired."
good,"The job is challenging, there are lots of task to get done in a short amount of time, but I time manage and get things done, such as customer outreach, maintaining a clean work environment, making sure that daily tasks are done."
good,"Ive been at sears for about five years. i enjoy working there, great people to work with and managers there always helpfull in anything u need my typical day at sears is contacting previous customer and checking in if there still intrested in the product. and also calling the customer about if they received there product fine. dealing with cutomers problem trying to fix from the installation or any delivery problems.the hardest part of the job is dealing with customer problem about there installation or delivery or gift cards they havent recieved."
good,"coworkers found out some problms I had in my past and made fun of me and were mean and verbally abusive to me or behind my back and I over heard them. Supervisory staff were nice and supportive. The hardst part of the job was having to deal with my coworkers and customers being rude and hateful to my face or behind my back. It was hard to focus on my job since it was constant talk about me and laughing at me. I did learn alot about folding clothing and I worked on my memory remembering where the clothes were returned to after retrieval from the fitting rooms. I also learnd how to make a display. A typical day at work focused on keeping rooms clear making sure displays are in an orderly fashion,and working with cashiers to find the right price for some items not clearly marked"
good,"Working for this big box store was so much fun . I loved changing out windows, dressing walls, The visual position was amazing."
good,"I make sure register has proper change. I help customers with questions and purchases. I explain electronic equipment to the customer. I provide detailed examples and feedback as needed to the customer including financing options offered by our store. I am always learning new things from others because my department is an ever-changing environment. I love the management team at Sears they are very helpful and friendly. My co-workers are really helpful and we work well as a team. The hardest part of my job is the job security because hours are not stable and I was hired as temp help with the option to become full-time, but sears rarely hires full-time help. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers find the perfect item that they were looking for. Sometimes it takes a while, but it is worth it to see them happy and willing to come back and shop again."
good,"It was a good work environment, just not a good paying job. Some days I could leave making hundred, but there were several days i left with making less then $25.00"
good,"This job is perfect for someone that enjoys working with people, and helping them in their search for employment in retail."
good,"I liked working with my customers, co-workers and my manager. The company itself has no value in its workers and there was little to no job security. Advancement was a title, more work, and no compensation (for example I was a manager making $8.75per/hr.)."
good,"Great Coompany to work for,but store management is poor,lack of costumer service."
good,"It all about sales,how much you have in the drawer,what kind of sales item for the weekend pr the holiday sales,what coupon are we taking off the regual price.Hardest part would be customers complaining about price of and item,or a return.Overall the work area is a good place to work.People that are there were very friendly. What I learn is hard work is by talk to customers and making sense."
good,"It's a good place to have a first job and learn how to work on product, but there's no raises or steady hours and its part time job."
good,"10 minute meeting , I am parttime so I either open my register or close @ the end of the night. Greet Customers Process their purchase and tell to have a nice day. Answer Questions on the phone with customer. Clean up my area. Nice bunch of co-workers"
good,Great products and unbeatable service! Scheduled appointments can start as early as 9am and as late as 8pm. Presentations can range from 2 to 4 hours.
good,Not enough hours. but working was fun and educational. People were great. always busy.
good,Can start off fast but also slow mostly steady work flow.
good,Fun work environment - co-workers
good,It was a decent place to work to have money through high school.
good,Totally enjoyed working in internal theft cases. Managing the personnell office
good,"Excellent hours, just lacked in decent pay rate. The management was very understanding of all situations at hand and helped you as much as possible."
good,Provided knowledge about credit and how to read and understand reports. Learned what was important to avoid and not to avoid on your credit report.
good,"Manage between 70-100 employees at a time but the most difficult part of the job is that although assistant managers and department managers are employed and inside the building, most customers and employees want to speak with the store manager."
good,"I did not mind working at sears, the service mananger knew nothing about cars didn't have a strong passion to see and hear the sound of great running vehicle. He was always on everyones case about not done yet or still working on this. But I learned a lot about vehicles and leaned some little things that each manufacture did for exsample a oil filter from a top mount to the standard bottom mount or remount mount. Learned basic customer relations. I'm glad I got to work there"
good,This was a good company to work for. I enjoyed working with the people.
good,"Many times i couldn't get as many hours as I wanted. Sometimes i felt like being human wasnt prioritized,  our feelings didnt matter. There were good days. When the management team was lacking the bond between other associates filled in. We supported and helped eachother push through the day."
good,Sears was paying employees way under what other retailers were. But the people I worked with were very nice and kind and helpful I miss it. They no longer exist Kmart and Sears  longer is in business :(
good,"Only got to work there briefly, as our location was closing down. The remainder of the time of its time, was overly joyful, the team was great the staff was fantastic  the work flow and environment was energetic very happy wish they would’ve kept sears around as I could’ve saw myself working there for much longer"
good,"price items that come and when new things come in add the new items in system, take pictures of the items, add it online. change and add prices on items."
good,good place to work but sadly closed. managment was okay in store. direct leader was very nice. old building and a lot of old people working/shopping there
good,"stock inventory, learned the difference in gem stones how to tell lab created stones from genuine, the supervisors were very friendly, and they have flexible schedules."
good,"I was provided racks of merchandise that needed to be put on the sales floor.  The merchandise was in need of being organized and categorized by size and color.  I spent a little over 3 years doing as they requested, and was laid-off, because our Management didn't know how to properly run a Retail Store."
good,Sears was an enjoyable place to work until it went into receivership. I made many lasting friendships with fellow employees and co-workers. I enjoyed the many customers that I served every day.
good,"The people who I worked with were great, so were the managers, however, the higher management who came to visit monthly or so were completely rude and unprofessional."
good,It was very simple and there a lot of thing to do usually a typical day at work. The the thing that I enjoyed was my co workers. Management was  very straight forward on what they were asking of the employees.
good,Working at Sears was a fun experience learn a lot of skills help me in customer service experience well-rounded cool or ENT family environment if I had to I would work at Sears again
good,Worse place I ever worked at. Not for a person seeking long term job security... employees have no voice and are being ignored on a regular basis.. glad they were shut down
good,llegar al cubiculo y checar la lista de pendientes
good,"I really like this job it's just the hours that I receive per week aren't too helpful, as me being a part time I expect at least 15 hours per week a s 11 hours isn't really much"
good,"The people who work in the store are great and the work good."
good,Management needs work. They’re all over the place. Scheduling hours need work. The coworkers are cool though. Free lunch sometimes. They do work with you if you need help.
good,the amount of hours per week was not enough no matter how many sales or leads I made I only received 5-10 hours per week and was paid bonus/commission every 2 months based on how many people allowed our company or contractors into their home.
good,I had a lot of responsibility from train people to help with inventory and I did  not reverse any benefits or anything I was all commission and I didn't get paid at all on some work I did
good,The drawback for me was that applicants could schedule their own interview even if it was on the spot. The management was very disorganized and displayed low levels of professionalism.
good,"I enter the building at 7am, Disarm the security system and let others in. I Turn on all the lights in the store manually by walking to the individual breaker boxes positioned throughout the store. I then turn on all the registers and count the money in the tills in preparation for the day. I would then Process out of stocks , set Plan O Grams , mark clearance, or clean up the sales floor. At 9 am I would unlock the doors and let people into the store to shop or visit the license businesses. I would cashier as needed,  manage as needed, Solve customer problems complaints or criticism's. At 7:30 pm I would begin store closing overhead announcements every  10 minuets. At 8 pm I would lock the doors close registers clean the sales floor, and run the end of day process. place funds in the safe. Exit the store after re arming the security system."
good,"Staff and in store management were great, room for growth within the company.  Team worked together throughout the store. Goals were easily met, also flexible work schedule."
good,Obviously difficult times at SHC last 5+ years. If there was a better captain steering the ship perhaps things would be different. The people were great but when you don't invest in your stores or customer service you are not going to succeed.
good,"Great company but when salary gets chopped by $45k. You have to keep other options open. Living in Bay Area it’s hard to live off of $60k. I started as a sales consultant then manager, to District then Regional. It was a great place working and managing a great team."
good,"I had been at Sears for almost 11yrs, it was fun helping customers and working with my coworkers and management, it was like having a second family. My favorite part was helping the customers, figuring out the needs they had and feeling accomplished when I was able to fill their needs. The hardest part of the job was trying to figure something to do when there wasn't any recovery on the sales floor or any customer traffic."
good,"if you need better retail skill, well then sears is the place to apply. i gained so much experience in learning how to talk to people and figure out how to better meet their needs."
good,Used to be great place. Just sold to Service.com and they immediately closed a forth of our offices. I would stay away. Very cold in separation procedure...no 20 year gold watch here.
good,"Change the price on the products that are going on discount or if the price went up or down. Match the skews to correct product. Run down the restock list, and bring it to the floor before opening. Make sure that all items have the correct pricing or the Sales associates will loose on their commission. Be a team player."
good,"Nice environment and good people to work with. My coworkers and managers were great. No job security, as I was a temp for the Christmas rush. Not the best pay."
good,"I enjoyed working for Sears.  At the time, the staff and management were super supportive of each other and the rest of the employees.  There was a lot of opportunity for learning and advancement within the store.  It all just depended on the employee and what they wanted to learn and do.  I started out in soft-lines replenishment and over the course of almost eight years I learned about soft-lines, hard-lines, electronics, appliances, shipping, receiving, return-to-vendor, and tons of customer service.  I also spent some time as the hard-lines replenishment lead."
good,"Good retail store, with nice merchandise and nice prices. I experienced a good working relationship with the store manager and loss prevention manager."
good,"Must have good managerial skills, able to multi-task and be an extremely well-organized individual. Typically managing approximately 20-25 technicians on a daily basis."
good,enjoyed selling to customers.  I am striven to make sure the customer gets what they needed.  a lot of times that usually does not what the asked for originally. I was try to make sure the customer leaves the happy and know that they will be back when they need something else.
good,This was a nice place to work before the closed down. For the most part the other employees were nice of course they were some people who were just negative all the time but for the most part it was a good place to be a part of.
good,"everyday I was backroom stocking, or internet shopping. I learned how to internet shop in put in repair orders. Notting was hard about job. I enjoy my co workers."
good,"A typical day a Sears was taking payments and selling appliances, electronics or etc. "
good,"Excelente empresa con muchos beneficios laborales ,desafortunadamente la cerraron"
good,"Their training program was excellent, Customers also said that they trained employees well. Liked the versatility of the store, Sears could fit a niche that was not available in all stores."
good,"I never had a typical day at work, everyday was different, depending on what was urgent for that time period.  I learned the importance of communication and having the ability to be a team player.  Management was different, depending on what department you worked in, overall the goal was the same, customer satisfaction and sales.  I love the workplace culture, they embrace diversity.  The hardest part of the job, was trying to do what several manager asked for at the same time.  The most enjoyable part of the job, was seeing the customer satisfaction, especially around the holidays."
good,"A typical day on a weekday is very slow, usually only doing a few transactions while helping customers with questions or putting away items on shelfs. Many times where I was bored and was looking forward to going home because I was bored, not because of being a bad worker but because the store was dead and it really set a mood throughout everyone. And of course everyday I am always asked the question if this Sears is closing"
good,Sears needs a lot of work to be done to it in order for it to make better profit. Too many people trip over it closing or not and too many people steal which affects everything in the company.
good,"Super équipe"
good,"I loved working at Sears, because you’re mainly with people you’re age. I got along with everybody, the job was super relaxed when uptight managers weren’t around. It was just amazingly fun."
good,"Worked in the Optical Centre answering phones, setting up appointments and processing financial transactions."
good,"I truly enjoyed being part of the Sears company. It was like a family experience, we all got along well and the culture was inclusive and friendly. Unfortunately, Sears closed and I was not able to continue my work there, but I worked until the very last day of closing."
good,I've learned so much from sears and that knowledge I will use to move on as my location is now closed. I hope others will get the chance to experience it as well
good,"Great beginner job to get your foot in the door, however if you are not trying to scale the rigid ladder up sears or hoping to get paid more than $9.00 an hour then I suggest you use a job from here to bridge into another one."
good,Sears was a very fun place to work at I enjoyed but there was a few problems with my schedule because one of the managers didn’t really communicate and the other would change my hours for the same day that I was already on the clock
good,"Sears required a lot of attention while on the floor. Managers were very busy, and didn’t seem to always have an answer to associate problems, but could definitely assist any customer. Work flow or daily goals were completed in a hazy disorganized manner. But over all I was treated appropriately and never stressed too much."
good,"Worked on the sales floor, straightening clothing. Also put out stock, and did markdowns. I also rang customers out at the register. Opened and closed registers and counted the money. Was excellent at Customer Service. Helped Customers out with what ever they needed."
good,"Proprietary software, occasionally hectic. The opportunity for advancement was nil, and hours,when full time were great but full time was not always available."
good,Los horarios son muy exigentes y el salario es muy poco
good,"I like the job. I feel the store may close due to financial reasons, and would rather find another job before the store closes. The main duties I enjoy for the job. Business is very slow at times and it can get extremely boring. Pay being hourly plus commission is hard to estimate my earnings."
good,I would say that this job was pretty decent. It may have been some issues with the job at first. But i feel as once you have the right management to do their job everything is great.
good,"Sorry to say was mishandled at the national level.  I enjoyed working with my peers at the local store, very friendly and I have life long friends from there."
good,"I worked there temporarily. This is a certain work experience for me."
good,"I worked at Sears Auto Center for 12 years. The coworkers were awesome and the managers tried to help with the schedule as much as possible. They gaved me the oportunity to study while I worked part time. I feel that to advance in a different possition, a higher position was very hard."
good,"Its an ok job, we have to sell warranties to keep our job, meet sales quotas, put up with shortages and explain to the customers why we cannot fix their machine today or why we do not have parts."
good,"Una empresa donde se aprende sobre moda, tecnología y muchas cosas mas."
good,El horaro es irregular y no hay apoyo por parte de los compañeros
good,If in sales position expect slow traffic all year round except for major holidays. Training is done very thoroughly high expectations from management.
good,I enjoyed working with a good group of people. the job was pretty realaxing and easy except during holidays. Management was good. There was no hard part about working at Sears.
good,"-They took off seniors discount and replaced it with coupons in which was audited in the end anyway."
good,"Typical day was folding clothes, organizing clothes racks, emptying dressing rooms, assisting customers with store to home sales. Management was alright, the whole time I was with Sears I was never put on the schedule, always working on a week to week basis. Hardest part was keeping up with all the clothes and organizing everything."
good,Not a bad job. Some aspects of the job were tedious but overall you got what you put into the job. Make your connections with customers and you will increase your commission
good,"While I worked here it was long hours , lots of driving.  Had no problem with the costumers or my boss.  Not used to using a computer that only seemed to work half of the time.  It was before the computers that we have now and didn't work well at all."
good,"polite manager, understanding staff, clean and fun workplace with good people to be around. I would continue to work there if it didn't close down. Overall good."
good,I enjoyed the team I worked with. People look out for one and another. The company does have high expectations from their associates but they also give you the tools and training to reach those goals.
good,Sears was good place to work but the only complaint I have was management. Some of their management clearly displayed favoritism towards some of the co workers and it it showed.
good,"There is not much to sya about this job. You generally do the same thing everyday, manage stock, help customers and do what ever is asked of you. Good management was depending on who was running shift."
good,"all we did was fill shelves and kept things orderly in the backroom."
good,This was a beginner job for me typical call center world where you feel like you’re in high school all over again. Hardest part of the job was putting up with untrained management.
good,"I enjoyed working at Sears, it was my first job right after high school so i felt like an adult when I started. Great people, the manager was fair, I didn't have to many issues. I would recommend them as a nice place to work for the young and the retired."
good,"Sears appliance department is commission only and random computer-generated work schedules. The store manager is great then goes down from there. When sales start slacking your working hours and schedule gets erratic. Sears is good company, but going through a lot of changes."
good,"* A typical day at work. "
good,I was only part time so the time flew by. We did a lot of store to home orders in which we were paid commission on. I started working there as seasonal and they kept me after seasons end. I worked with a lot of really nice people and customers. The hardest part of the job was when we had to work 3-4 hrs. by ourselves and tried to get everything done.
good,"My boss at Sears optical was a lot like me,we got along great. She taught me a lot about repairing glasses and sales. If the pay was more, I would have stayed at the job. However, they later closed down."
good,"The days were slow , but you could find something to do such as helping customers, sorting or cleaning dressing rooms. I gaines retail experience and management didnt mint helping you and explaining how to do better.. The work place was nice, you met people from all over. The hardest part was getting more day hours and having to work hoildays was hard especially with the long hours."
good,A typical day at work is very slow. There may be a few people to come in and pay bills. a lot of people use the store as their exercise track. They come in everyday and walk through the store and the mall itself for exercise. I learned how to do layaways. The management team are great people to work with and for. People come in daily asking are we closing. The hardest part of the job is not knowing whether or not hat store may be the next one to close. The most enjoyable part is when the store is continuously busy and having a good day.
good,fun place to work started my LP experience here but no room for advancement and horrible pay. Not a good company to go to because looks like they may be shutting down soon.
good,"The culture change at Sears, albeit coming late in the day, was the 'right thing to do'.  The culture was all about making the customer feel important and valued, as well as the employees.  It extended to every level at the company - and was well received.  Unfortunately, with the decline of this retail giant - we did not have the opportunity to see where it could take the level of employee engagement - but the signs were all there.  It was awesome."
good,It was ok till they cut hours! Great people working there! They pay could have been better. They make you work to hard trying to get customer to try to get their Sears credit cards.
good,it was an amazing first job and I will always be grateful to them for offering me the chance to be apart of the company. If they weren't in dire straights to stay afloat I bet they would've treated their employees better when it came to the benefits and pay. But with the rising economy and the dwindling of old malls they are struggling in this world. I will miss them greatly.
good,"I would put out new clothes for sale, restock items that were sold, return non purchased items to the sales floor. Help customers find items they were looking for."
good,"This is a great company. The deals, co-workers, and managers were really nice and we all worked as a team. Sometimes the day was slow and sometimes fast but most of all balanced. Sears just needs to change some of their policies and management. The hours you receive are based off of how many credits you sale."
good,There is no room for advancement. Low pay and little hours. They don't give any benefits. There are not even any chances for raises. The management team was very friendly. There was defiantly a team atmosphere.
good,I learned that no matter what a customer is always right. the most enjoyable part was meeting people from other countries.  The hardest part was dealing with the rude customers which didn't happened often.
good,"As a company Sears is not doing great, so they are tightening their belt so that the business does not go under.  When I first started they offered lunch or treats regularly, we received 20% off most things (not appliances), and had as many hours as we wanted to work.  Now the discount is 20% back in points that can be spent in store, no special extras except for Christmas, and few hours available.  The management has always been awesome to me, making me feel like I matter and that I do a good job.  Moving up in the company is possible, but you have to put your time in its not going to happen overnight."
good,"Simply put it was a good company, but over the years with the fall of stocks the job security just is not there anymore. Anyone with a family that works there needs to be prepared to move on in a moments notice."
good,"Sales and Cashier usually laid back  until holidays. Good management team, a very friendly work place.  The job was not hard. The most  enjoyable part of the job was ending your transaction with a happy customer."
good,fast pace envirnment.great associates and overal a positive environment.learned how to help others while developing leadership skills. great customer interractions.
good,"I was not informed until after I was hired that raises are not given, and have not been given for years. I love the people I work with and it is truly a fun environment. I just can't live on the money and hours available to me."
good,"Keeping metrics up while attending to the customer's needs can be tedious, but the co-workers helped with getting through the day. I learned the Point Of Sale system here."
good,"Despite the lower salary, it has a decent work atmosphere.  The managers and not mean or petty individuals.  "
good,"I enjoyed this job a lot because i did a little bit of everything. The thing that sucked was the pay and part time hours. Manager was very undecisive on certain things he wanted done, one day he would say one thing and the next day would change it. Him and his assistant managers were never on the same page. Other than poor management, i enjoyed the physical and mental work on a daily basis, this was a guy job and i proved that women can also work in the back just like those men i worked with. I was the only woman and i was pretty much their team leader."
good,I worked here for years and in that time it allowed me to develop and grow my customer service skills and gain knowledge on how to become a sales person.
good,Overall Sears was good place to for flexable hours and the people that work there. The enviroment was challenging and fun.  A good experience in administrative office.
good,It was very hard to advance at Sears. The Sears I worked for had a lot of things that happened that ended up with management being fired because of mishandling of monies etc.
good,"Mostly a good place to work."
good,This could have been a great career choice if it was run correctly at the corporate level.  I'm going to be sad  to see my store close I met alot of great people and I'm sad for our customer's to lose another shopping opportunity
good,Cultural opportunity took several years to get store culture in line with The Sears cultural expectation.  Great apparel staff.  I learned how to face adversity with endurance and perseverance.
good,"it was a cool place regardless, sometimes it can be very busy or it can be very slow, however there is always something to do, some of the managers were really cool."
good,"Working at Kmart was very slow. The store was close to closing down and on a normal day there weren't many customers. During black Friday and closer towards Christmas however, It became fairly paced work. All in all the staff was nice and the hours were fair."
good,"I loved working at Sears because I essentially had 6-10 different jobs on any given day. I helped the cashiers when they needed it. I handled returns, defective/damaged merchandise, repaired tools and equipment, assembled floor model items, shipped parts and orders to customers, unloaded merchandise trucks and unpacked/allocated all inventory in an efficient manner. I was always busy which made the day go quickly. I enjoyed being needed in so many departments and helping employees, as well as customers."
good,"low stress job which I liked,  because end of day deposits were easy to learn and do as well as easy point of sale cash register transactions and offered customers credit applications with instant credit if they could not afford the purchases they wanted or needed"
good,"At the end I was an Auto Center Assistant Manager, I would help sale and do daily office paper work, help make schedules, and with the work load out in the garage."
good,"es estar en constante presion en cuanto al area que estaba pero era lo mejor por que aprendes mucho, tuve apoyo por parte de la gerencia, mis compañeros eran buenos apoyos, lo unico malo es la distancia del trabajo ya que hacia 2 horas de trayecto, fue una buena experiencia totalmente diferente a lo que hacia no tenia nada de experiencia pero aprendi rapido mis funciones."
good,"This job has been been fun for the last three years, but since the company has been having issues financially, they have been making a lot of changes very fast and everything is very inconsistent. There is not a lot of direction and associates are asked to things that they have either no idea how to do or are unrelated to their position. I love being a team player, but Sears tends to cross the line in that respect."
good,"Excellent people, bad management, little opportunity to achieve. The company is not doing well and there are no raises or opportunities. Every couple of months there cutbacks."
good,Fast friendly place to work at working with different types of customers having them apply for credit cards and signing them up for rewards I love the challenge and like to be the best
good,"I would help customers find the tools or appliances desired to take home. I always got along with anyone that was hired on. I worked Saturdays and Sundays which i could never take off. That to me was a down fall."
good,This section of Sears that I worked for has been closed and no longer exist. I prefer not to review the company since  it has been 17 years since I worked there
good,"Start my route at 7:25 and head directly to my first customer. Take a look at my computer to determine if this repair is a first visit or a part install. If it is a part install, repair the product with the part that was shipped to the customer. If it is a first time repair, first diagnose what the problem is then check to see if you have the part, if so repair the product, if not order the part and reschedule to return to repair. Then move on to the next call. I have learned to take my time in diagnosing issues with the product. Management could learn to speak to individuals with the same respect that we give them. I enjoy this line of work getting to meet new people and solving issues that they may have. The hardest part of my job is if I can't repair the product and the customer is still without their product."
good,afraid company is doing so poorly that I would not have a job shortly. loved working there before the company started closing stores. now things have become very unsure.
good,"During good times, Sears is a wonderful employer. These days, it is a pressure cooker for stress, with upper management acting from a place of desperation. Most promotions, both titular and fiscal, have been frozen as the company struggles to remain solvent. "
good,"No job security other wise over all it is good company but management is bit difficult, managers are very nice supportive , good friendly environment"
good,Enjoyed working with coworkers and customers.  would get in touch with store management and assess all maintenance needs. Would prioritize all work orders. Order parts and complete the work orders.
good,A good place to work. Friendly co-workers. Always a chance to move to other Departments. Managers are ok. The hardest part of the job is no getting the right training needed for the job.
good,The management while working at this location didn't know everything needed to properly supervise and manage the departments they were accountable for.
good,Low pay for hard work in warehouse environment. Balance of family and work was not family friendly. Loved the coworkers but was a job where you must enjoy having no heat in winter and no air condition in the summer unless you are inside the store part.
good,unorganized working environment. Busy with little cashier.Uncomfortable environment. Management unorganized and do not know what they doing. I learned to be a great customer service for the 2 years I have worked at Sears.
good,"Nice workers, bad pay. Management is very nice, its just too much to do for such little pay. Would recommend if you're a college student."
good,"very kind and open employees . always there and ready to work , days and shifts are super slow. i was incharge of taking items from warehouse and putting them in the store aswell as shifting shelves and tables"
good,"I had never sold something that I was so unfamiliar with, nor on commission, but ended up thriving for the most part. I found that I was adept at selling selling the product, once I understood the basics of the features and could easily define what the customer needed, based on Income, Lifestyle, Size of Family, etc."
good,"Although the pay can be better, Sears is pretty good place to work and the managers do their best to take care of their employees."
good,"A typical day at work is putting out freight and straightening clothes. I learned how to merchandise clothes, and make signs. The management was good."
good,"Lo recomiendo solo personas que vivan en la ciudad, ya que  para algunos que vivimos un poco retirados nos cuesta un poquito mas llegar a casa,"
good,Sears is a low budget company to work for.They give their employees scraps for wages. They work some employees 4 hours a week. They expect you to do so much work for no money.
good,"I cannot give a fair opinion of being a Sears employee, I was a seasonal part-time employee for the holiday season.  I was grateful for the employment."
good,"°Haces tus actividades, reparto y entrega de producto."
good,"Sears was a wonderful culture to work in where the employee was totally empowered. Transparency at times was difficult to deal with incredible pressure from senior management to perform. As a result, management was not really management."
good,"I enjoyed working with everyone, it was my first job so I made a few mistakes but have grown from them. I did not like how when I made one mistake it kept getting thrown at me during a morning meeting by the former manager."
good,Great place to start and gain experience but the company seems to be loosing customers and as a result job security is questionable.
good,"I helped with purchases, and credit card payments. I learned how to sign people up for store credit cards. Nice working environment, pleasant coworkers as well as management. Hardest part was standing on feet for full shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting so many nice people."
good,"Typical day of work: Come in, count up register, clean counters. Wait for customers, assess needs and repair watch if possible otherwise send to main office."
good,"The office staff is very cool, they are easy to get along with. It feels like a family. The pay isnt the greatest and they take out for every little thing as a back charge."
good,"I was in Loss Prevention, my immediate manger was awesome. I would still be there had the company not done mass layoffs. I was full time Loss Prevention, applied for a promotion to a manager spot, and not only didn't get it, but I also got laid off along with the whole LP team from the store I was at. Other than that, the work environment was great, the district managers didn't try to micro-manage from a distance and listened to the ideas and concerns of everyone."
good,It was a pleasure working with the people i worked with. The hours i received were good and they worked with my full time school schedule well. The pay could of been better. My main complaint was the store manager
good,"bonne ambiance de travail"
good,"I have learned so much from my office associate job that I want to continue learning through another company. I love my job but my hours have been cut drastically and I can not afford to continue staying. I enjoy my job because I love to file, do deposit and do payroll and a lot of the associates and managers are so laid back and enjoyable to be around; that helps when you do have a stressful job. The only thing I really dis like about my job is having to write people up, because it makes me feel disappointed that the associates are not performing as they should, but I do agree that even though they are not performing as they should they do deserve a write-up."
good,"As part time employee and in specialized dept, have little expectations for growth.Also not sure of"
good,"Again, I really enjoyed working at Sears. My only reason for leaving is they are closing the electronics department and I want a job better preparation for teaching."
good,good place to work if you can get on the bosses good side plus it is an easy job if you can talk to people loved the people i worked with
good,"It was commission based,and while I was their the businesses was slow. I often had nothing to do their while I was working."
good,It was a place where I gained new and different experiences. I enjoyed my time there. I did not enjoy the department manager's neglect and favoritism to some of his employees. It did not coincide with policy of Sears.
good,"es un buen lugar para laborar "
good,"The people are great but management is kinda wack. Take calls, set up repair appointments, and troubleshoot. Sears is a dying company sadly."
good,"typical day:  depending on what time of day your shift begins you either open or close dept. provide customers with information, solutions, recommendations and the item(s) they sought initially came in for or leave with an item they weren't looking for until you showed them the value of what you recommended...conduct cash/credit transactions, input pertinent information for installations and deliveries, maintain dept. in all aspects: appearance, planograms,relocation of merchandise, replacing present displays with current or newest."
good,"Constant change of management leads to unstable work environment resulting in high turnaround in staff."
good,7am-3:30pm daily Monday through Friday with occasional weekend as needed. Fast paced always changing task. Laid off due to company realignment after 14.5 years of service
good,its by commission and received over 25 hours any week to work. We don't have a good backup for management. the commission its very lows in comparation to other company.
good,I assist customers with purchases and discuss features of items if they would like to know more about products. I learned how to better myself with sales. The management is decent for the most part. I enjoyed my co workers. The hardest part would be having to deal with tough customers. The most enjoyable part would be making sales.
good,The job itself is not that bad it is the way the attendance is set and with children or if you get a common cold and bring doctors notes then it can bring you to a write up with HR and it does not matter if you have a doctors note or not. Sears Holding Call Center is not family friendly.
good,"Sears Home Appliance Showroom in Norwalk was one of Sears showrooms for this new venue.  Sears eventually shut this venue down, for reasons that were not entirely clear.  Because it was new, and at the time the economy was difficult, we were heavily supervised and scrutinized.  Not fun over time."
good,"save money on products one needs.needs better management or may be more compensation to retain the new hires.the on line training is excellent,the employee performance database is the best and breaks down to help improve the employee performance"
good,Need to work for a company to grow with lots of changes and cut down lots of benefits. No 4o1k or other retirement plans. lots of changes with the company and employees.
good,"Great place to work if you are placed under the right manager, few issues with middle management in recent past has resulted in attrition.The top leadership is motivating. Good place to work , gives good work life balance"
good,"Good place to work if you're looking to get some sales experience starting off, easy to move up in the company, and very very flexible schedule."
good,Was a good place to work was something new and fun a little difficult at times with locating things because things weren't properly organized
good,Everyday is a new day to receive knowable information. Customer Service with residence and commercial customers upon Delivery of SEARS Products.
good,good place to work with an opportunity for good work experience. good management supportive and very helpful co-workers. hardest part of my day is dealing with the heat. most enjoyable part is interacting with customers
good,Fun laid back work environment. The managers were laid back and worked with you. The numbers were a big thing because they are trying to keep the store a float.
good,"Multitasking position in a very busy location, decent equipment and great place to work for. Challenging position when understaffed, customer satisfaction is a daily goal."
good,Buena capacitacion. Buen respaldo de la gerente. Sueldo regular. Buenas prestaciones pero no hay respeto por los tiwmpos. Excelente lugar para trabajar si eres soltero o sin familia.
good,"A typical work day was a good day of honest hard work. My co-workers weren't just co-workers, they were family. The hardest part of the job was the holiday rush. The most enjoyable part of my job was being around my co-workers."
good,"Ring up purchases.  Move merchandise round and restock,  Create displays.  Tag clearance items.  Answer questions and address concerns of customers.  Build relationships with customers and coworkers.  I did not like leaving my own young children at home to go to work.  I did like helping people and seeing all the cute children's clothes."
good,"Basically, the job was only challenging, with the amount of customers buying appliances. That varied from day to day."
good,the job its self was pretty cool and most the customers were nice but some of the co workers were not reallyeasy to work with due to it was cheap hourly and on comission so u basicaly sale ya self to get better pay but it was nice but it had its up and downs when it wasnt busy cause ya pay would be very low due to no sales and depending on the hours they give u to and on top of making sure u close everything properly and count the money to drop off to the head of store
good,Overall OK place to work.  They will bring in new hires at higher rate than promoting from inside.  Seem to not appreciate those who have been loyal to the company.
good,Good place to learn working skills as a young adult or teenager.The worst part of the job was the degradation from tough coustomers.
good,"Start the day by greeting members as they come to the store to purchase items they need or want. "
good,"Dealing with members and follow up on escalations.  Assisting Tech Managers with parts issues."
good,"I worked here while going to school. This was my very first job, and overall, was a good start for a young teen. Retail can really teach a person a lot about work and the real world."
good,"Work life balance was made difficult due to business needs and retail schedule."
good,"Good people, work is tedious and not challenging , no advancement is possible."
good,Constant pressure to have customers sign up for terrible sears card. Meeting every morning past when the store was supposed to open. Would have been better if the head of store Jen would of hit on me. Would of loved to give her head under her desk or say on my face. Would of calmed her down.
good,"El día típico erá llegar temprano,ir por el fondo a caja principal, asisitir a la junta diaria de trabajo, matenr limpia el área de trebajo, reacomodar el área de trabajo, checar faltantes de productos, atención al cliente, checar sí hay tranferencias."
good,"Performed office duties including: inventory, scheduled appointments, maintained files, helped customers with purchases, handled all the mail and helped with hearing tests."
good,"I liked that I was given the option of a scehdule I like, its' a small warehouse, my days goes by quick, my job is easy and I get to listen to music all day."
good,I love working there and loved all the co-workers. I worked there for 3 years until the store shut down. I quickly moved from register to a sales associate. I would approach customers asking if they need anymore or just greet them at the door. I'd also lift heavy objects and replenish stock. My favorite part of work was the people i worked with. My least favorite is i made minimum wage for 3 years without a promotion or raise
good,A typical day at Sears is very long. I was put through four different job positions in a year and a half. The hardest part was the management. One manager would tell you to do one thing and another manager would tell you something completely different.
good,"- Most days were smooth "
good,Show up to work with a smile on your face. Greeting customers constantly. Cashing out customers and providing great customer service. Management is up to par. The hardest day is when the customers are really cranky about sales. I enjoy the discounts at the store.
good,"There is nothing I can really say.  The atmosphere was good (with one or two exceptions), but as this store is now closed down and gone...there isn't anything I can say that will sway anyone.  Although it did teach me that I am uneasy going back into commission based work."
good,Sears was a great place to work. I did very well there. The only thing about sears was that we worked only on commission. They would have 6 of us on the floor and there was not enough foot traffic to support the sales team. The business has since went out of business.
good,"At times it's boring and no one comes in the store, I wish that I had more customers, because I don't like being bored and when I'm bored I feel sleepy"
good,"I enjoyed the fast pace while working here. not many dull moments. Always something to do stock,price,organize,clean,registers etc. People needed help and I was glad to help them find what they were looking for. I liked the people I worked with. we all got along really well. The hardest part of my job was learning to balance all of it at once. Someone is needed at the register, A customer has a question about a product, the dressing room is a mess cause someone decided to take in way over the limit and leave it all over the floor and you have a new co-worker you are trying to help get used to things. The manager wants you to do something in a certain amount of time, while you are still the mca of two or more areas cause someone called off. But in a way that is also what I enjoyed most."
good,I learned a lot about tires and how manufactures differ in oil filters and capacities of oil.
good,"get with mgr. to go over what all needs done make a plan start working on cars if any in shop.check oil bays make sure we have fluids rags etc. check and restock any oil filters if needed.check how much oil left in barrells of each type. unload tire trucks,count tires inventory check them in,when all accounted for,put tires away in order on tire racks where they go."
good,I was out of work for 3 months after being fired. I was greatful to them for hiring me. Minium wage job. Day shift which i didn't care for. But over all I enjoyed it!
good,"A friendly and peaceful work place where you were glad to help and answer peoples question about power tools, lawn equipment, and fitness. Working with co-workers side by side as a team to either help customers or close a sell. With friendly and motivated management."
good,Work with customers on repairs to vehicles. I have learned much about mechanical repair and causes of disrepair. Upper management lacks insight. Co workers work hard in an almost impossible situation created by top management. Most enjoyable part are the co-workers and happy customers.
good,"I work for base salary plus commission selling fine jewelry.  I really enjoy working at the jewelry counter.  I meet people at their best when shopping for gifts or weddings, etc.  Management is easy going and a lot of fun.  We have a good time and work well as a team."
good,Good for people still in school. flexible hours. their are plenty Sears to work at. Good for customer service and sales experience
good,"It was a good place to work. They always put me in a slow place, then when I needed credit applications, that's why I could never get them! They would cut my hours, because I didn't have enough credit applications. But, a lot of people don't want credit cards. So, I don't know what's going to happen when no one wants them at all."
good,"If im alone for the whole day I have to be quick as possible  to make all my customers happy,To give all the orders in time to accomplish my job."
good,"diagnose and repair automitve vehicles,train new employees,sell and install,stock and inventory."
good,"I was still in high school when I worked for Sears. I would go to school, go home, shower, and went to work from 4-9 p.m. When I wasnt in school, during the summer, I worked a full 8 hr shift 5 days a week and made a decent amount of money. I learned a lot like competitive sales, how to multi-task, how paint was mixed and many other skills that would help me get through jobs to come. I sold everything from electronics, to lawn and garden equipment, to paint, and much more. I had great benefits for someone at my age! Management was foreign to me at the time, but my co workers were accomodating and friendly. The hardest part of my job was necessary training, that I wasnt given much time for, and didnt complete all of it by the time I left. The most enjoyable part was the learning experience I took from this employment."
good,"* Inventory levels review, shipment details, packaging, data compilation "
good,Learned how to install different equipment for home improvements from siding to windows and doors
good,marketing was the key asset in this role along with management. listening to customers and understanding their needs and offer them with the service that best suits them required the marketing ability. Managing the other staff with their demoing and approaches to customers making the schedules and all in all the accountability was what I gained in this role
good,"You start at 0725 clocking into your laptop"
good,"somewhat busy off and on, learned how to get people to sign up for credit and multitask and get customers in and out as fast as i could but maintained an even flow so my customers didnt feel rushed having to push to have a certain ammount of credit by the end of your shift was a hard part because alot of people really dont want to get stuck with a credit bill at the end of the month or just arent into credit at all"
good,"Enjoyed my 23 yrs of working there. My position as a gift registry was eliminated so therefore I and many others were given a package."
good,"	Worked as a sales representative selling appliances, provided pleasant, patient and courteous customer service. Assured all customers were properly and promptly served. Shared my knowledge on appliances, making sure the product meets the customer’s needs & the price was affordable for them."
good,"Co-workers were very helpful and nice.  Retail is not the easiest job.  Overall, good experience."
good,Good job to make a living and balance work / life.  Benefits were not great.   Company was to concerned about getting credit cards appl's and not focused on sales and profit.
good,I enjoyed my job at Sears. The work was as challenging as I wanted it to be. Co-workers were fun and helpful. I most enjoyed setting a daily goal for myself. Was pleased when I could meet or beat it. It made my day go better. A typical day for me was a shipment of appliance parts (10 to 60 skids); I would sort and receive then send to proper areas for putaway. The hardest part of the job was sometimes not having proper equipment to do the job. eg: printer paper for printer used to print receiving tickets. I learned a lot about the operations of a large company.
good,"Stocking shoes and clother,returning things to their places.Hard work  helps you learn more..fast paced."
good,I enjoyed working with a positive teams of individuals toward a common goal during the busiest sales season of the year.
good,"Fun, fast paced job. I enjoyed staying busy and on my feet helping customers with thier needs. Most work shifts were only 4 hour days and i also enjoyed my co workers"
good,I enjoyed working at Sears and the coworkers.I was the replinishing associate for the softlines area. I was responsible for stock and occasionally helping at the registers if needed.
good,"working for sears is very fun and you learn something new everyday. my job was to provide customer service and sell warranty, it was a commission job so you had to hustle could not slack off.."
good,"Watch and Profile customers"
good,"sears was a good place to work, the enjoyable part of it was the fact that everybody was helpfull"
good,I had the opportunity to work in a great enviroment and learn different skills.
good,You have to sell credit cards to get hours (and the rate is so high that no one wants them) Coworkers were friendly and management usually took care of any issues. Hardest part of the job was to sit back and watch people stealing and having to let them get away with it because there was no security. Best part of the job was the employee discounts.
good,It was a good job for a summer.  Enjoyed working with the management and co-workers.
good,"Hard job, you have to stay focus and motivated. The customers were sometimes rude but you have to keep a positive mind frame."
good,"its a ok job for someone out of high school, meet new people everyday, no raises at all the minimum you can make is 12 dollars a hour. the managers are really unorganized, terrible communication skills, move to different departments because others are failing and they need help, you go through training and finally make it to a position you want they they make you move to a department where you have no training and expect you to learn on your own,"
good,"Very little room for advancement"
good,"Fast paced environment, my team is centered around communications. Developing materials for New hire training as well as continuous learning for seasoned employees."
good,"Good training ground for retail, interesting days and clientele.  Management is very facilitating and helpful with training and creating a family, team supportive environment."
good,"I very much enjoyed my time working at Sears,I thought it was a great part time job where I got to experience many types of people. However management and corporate focused more on money than  they do customer service"
good,I handle on average 75 to 100 calls a day. I troubleshoot appliances over the phone to resolve issues. I sell protection agreements and home improvements. Set up service for techs to repair appliances. I have learned  the skill of troubleshooting and tech support. Management has a high turnover. My co-workers are nice to work with. We help each out with tech support. The hardest part of my job is to get the customer to participate in over the phone resolutions. Most enjoyable part is my schedule.
good,"Only regret is that I didn't leave 2-weeks notice and so can't ever go back, but all and all, my time in the auto center was fun"
good,"Unload new trailers full of furniture, appliances, rugs and mattresses, assemble as required, price and assess damages if present, confirm items on shipping manifest.

I learned to properly display and price new merchandise."
good,Selling electronics was fun and educational. The workers were very helpful.
good,"Customer Service which I enjoy. Also, cashier, answering phone calls and taking payments. I really enjoyed this job because every day was different. I mostly worked in Woman's, Lingerie and Accessories. Management was nice. I met co-workers that were fun, helpful and carrying. Still have contact with many after all these years. hardest part was not getting to many hours. And most enjoyable was helping out customers with new trends and answering questions to the best of my knowledge."
good,"a typical day at work would be to clock in, clean around your area, make sure the customers are all set with what they're looking for, ring the customers up and make sure by the end of the night the register has $200 left in it for the next person opening and the rest of the money has to go to the hub office. co workers were helpful when looking for certain items its a fairly easy job just make sure people don't scam you with fake money, enjoyable part is having discounts. I learned patience, organizing skills and money managing"
good,"Although Sears is a great place for someone to start, it is hard to advance, and although I had some great experiences It is too unstable and the turnover rate is excessively high."
good,A typical day at sears can very a lot from day to day. There are some days i have a lot of deliveries and others where i only have a few. On days when i only have a few i check with the manager to see if anything else is need while i am there and if not then i would get sent home and be on call if need.
good,"all the people working there are like a big family."
good,"A typical day at work for me is coming in to do all the signs for new sales that have started or that is coming up, and also cleaning all the appliances. In this business I've learned that its everyone for themselves because we work on commission. My co workers are uptight. There's nothing hard about my job. The most enjoyable part of my job is being around so many people."
good,A typical day requires widespread knowledge of many different products
good,"My typical day at work would be photographing children, digital retouching, graphic design, filing, sales, answering phones, and fixing  equipment when needed."
good,"llegar padar a admon. por un fondo de caja para empezar a laborar , llegar a tu area a limpiar y acomodar para vender, lo mas dificil del area era vender sin promociones"
good,A typical day at work consists of interacting with members and welcoming them to the store. I learned a lot about sales and customer service. The management is supportive overall and like to see associates achieve higher results for themselves. The co-workers are a bit hard to deal with at times however there are a ton of friendly people there that make up for it. The hardest part of the job is to hit numbers. The most enjoyable part of the job is a fun atmosphere and great learning experience.
good,Great group of co-workers and management staff. Quick to help you if you needed help.
good,"Overall it is a good place to work."
good,"In the average day come into work and check what floor I am assigned. Go to that floor and start on go back which are clothes customers decided against. Check fitting rooms for cleanliness, and assist customers."
good,"Enjoyed working at Sears,Great Managers"
good,great place to start out at good discounts  and great coworkers
good,The only thing I didn't like about the job was credit applications
good,"In my time working at sears, I learned that as long as I work and due things before they are asked, I had no problem with anyone."
good,"Its great if your in school, they isially work around your scedule"
good,"During a typical day at work would be: As soon as I clock into work, there's always something to do. Its very fast pace and decisions mostly have to be made on the spot or one could easily fall behind in work. Along with working on the floor, there are several fixtures on the floor and we have to keep in mind customer safety. What I have learned here is to be attentive to details. Small mistakes can cost you in the future and could turn into a bigger mistake. Working quickly is a constant requirement and customer satisfaction comes first. Multitasking was hard for me at first but I definitely picked it up quickly and it has become second nature to me now. "
good,I learned a lot working for Sear's. They taught me how to make a customer happy and how to deal with a unhappy customer. I loved the hours I work.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Sears the recruiting department was small, the people were nice."
good," I enjoy purchasing products at Sears but didn't like working there very much. It could just be the local store but the management didn't get points across very clear and the co-workers weren't very friendly. It seemed, to me, that everyone was trying to look out for themselves to make sure they look good. When I asked for help there wasn't much given."
good,"acudir ala junta de ventas diarias, encender  todas las pantallas y realizar la limpieza de la mercancía exhibida, verificar si hay mercancía por recibir y pendientes por entregar, esperar que lleguen los clientes para realizar la labor de venta."
good,"fun busy workplace, flexible hours, the quotas suck, the people and coworkers are nice, the job is pretty easy"
good,To me working at Sears was enjoyable for the most part. I learned how to have patience and understanding. My co-workers taught me a lot in training and they were very patient as well. We took our job seriously and loved the customers. Some of them would shop there just to see our face.
good,"Worked a Sears as an O.R.S. Lead under Ron Kibler. It was alot of hard work because as a manager the subordinates were not motivated due to the low pay of $7.75 an hour. I managed to motivate and listen to their concerns and was able to encourage them to meet productivity goals. The problem was the front store manager Heidi would interfere with the orders give by Ron. This resulted in mass confusion of an over worked under paid staff. Heidi was a very rude and harsh individual that for a wage of $12.00 / hr, I could do with out."
good,"You must come in 10-15 minutes early but are not allowed to clock in till 6 minutes before your shift. This is so that you can find seating and set up. You take call after call after call, there is no time in between calls to catch your breath."
good,"I was brought in to help with the closing of Sears in Zanesville, OH. Most of my time was spent shifting merchandise or behind the cash register. Management was uninvolved during the work day and I got along very well with all of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was when there was nothing to do or no one in the store and the most enjoyable part of the job was the customer interaction."
good,"* selling merchandise, floor planning, sales lead assistant, stocking merchandise, mark downs, cleaning dressing room and show room floor, doing inventory..."
good,Meetings every morning at 7:30 am to review the day before and see what there is that can be improved on.

good,"another job that i'm glad to have gotten the expieriance...received paperwork from semi drivers, keyed the merchandise in from each truck."
good,"I work with Sears Outlet right now and things at the job are going great. I have learned how to make a sale to get customers to sign up for a credit card and i am excellent at doing various tasks. The managers I work with are very helpful, direct, and professional. My co-workers I a joy to work with because they are their in the time of need. My hardest part of the job is when we are short staffed and I have to do everything on my own; however, I am able to manage. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking to each and every customer."
good,The telemarketing offices are crowded and noisy.
good,"As a cashier we never knew what to do. We'd be there for the customer, but if the store was empty we'd try to clean and get in trouble for leaving the counter and if we stood around doing nothing we'd get in trouble."
good,management was not good
good,"I loved the job, the creative opportunities and the ability to work with such wonderful clients on a regular basis. The only downfall was how harsh CPI's expectations were for their employees. We'd get assigned a new district manager just about every couple of months because they could never manage to get the sales the company demanded in such a low time in our economy. They were very unorganized, demanding, and very threatening to each studio which was very stressful."
good,"For the most part, this was a cool work place. I've made plenty friends at this job. I really enjoyed going to work because of my co-workers."
good,I have a great time taking peoples photos and meeting daily sale goals. The company is based off one person for a time period and than another person takes over. I love watching people fall in love with the photos i take.
good,I have met many new friends. Duties are good. Hours were good for me being retired.
good,Found company less customer concerned than my liking. Felt dishonest at times because of the extremely high prices they charged customers for jobs worth less than half of the assessed prices.
good,"The reason why I love this job is that I have come to know and love the people with whom I work, including the highest management. Each person has a story tell, personally, and has in some way helped me to be a part of a great team. I learned to work the register; sell new membership to Shop Your Way Rewards; assist customers to find what they want and need; take returns; restock racks and shelves; inventory damages; and function at ""point"" where I greet all customers as they enter the door and inform them of the latest sales and promotions. The most difficult part of my job has been to perform complicated transactions like approving checks, doing complicated returns, and changing prices to the advertised price. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with the customers and my co-workers."
good,"Un loading freight off trucks,then reloading the right trucks with the rite freight for their destination"
good,I have several responsibilities
good,I learned a lot of office procedures here. The employees were extra nice and helpful. Great place to learn office techniques and experience an office environment.
good,Chaque journée est différente
good,"A typical day at work would be me helping customers place orders, get their parcels for them and filing paperwork. I learnt better customer service and a lot about selling merchandise. My co-workers were excellent towards me and we all got along very well. I loved working with people and that was my favorite part of my job, unfortunately the hardest part of the job was getting my boses to understand that school is my first priority."
good,Most day I would start out picking order for stores using a clamp lift and checking them using a RF screen.The 2nd part part of the day was unloading trucks sorting and putting away.
good,"I worked for the call centre in Belleville, although it was slightly above the average pay for a call centre in our area, the work was stressful. Management was constantly badgering us to get EXTRA work done which was almost impossible to complete with the phones constantly ringing. This was a common complaint among co-workers. It was common for people to be off on sick leave due to the stress. Vacation time had to be asked for months in advance and then get approved by management. Unfortunately it wouldn't get approved until 2 weeks before you were due to take vacation and sometimes not until a week before (and this is after bugging for answer) I know one of my coworkers had booked a trip with his girlfriend and kids and was told he couldn't take his vacation a few days before he was due to leave. His girlfriend had to go alone with the kids. His morale went downhill from there. On the plus side, my coworkers were excellent people and for the most part kept morale up. Also on the plus side, were the competitions that we had for small prizes and we also had regular potluck lunches & dinners."
good,"I like my enjoyed my job, because I enjoy working as a team and working with the people."
good,"Investigate internal and external theft, help promte workplace saftey."
good,I was happy selling eyeglasses. I worked along opticians and learned all they knew. I am also happy to have acquired those skills.
good,Management and the associates were all very helpful. It was a very enjoyable job.
good,A typical day at work consists of inspecting merchandise for damages and inputting the results into the database. Over the years i've learned how to look-up sku's on pkms and lock and unlock sku's. Management is very polite and great to work with. The hardest part of the job is somtimes lifting heavy cartons repeatdly. The most enjoyable part is my co-workers we all work well together as a team to get the the job done and have a little fun in the process.
good,"Was able to work on my own to meet deadlines, train other associates, devise safety plans and shrink control plans. Local management was very co-operative and helped to make it a great place to work."
good,"On a typical day at work, I maintain a good working environment by putting back the clothes and also picking up the clothes on the floor. Also assist customer with finding product in the store and also on finish given task project within a certain time. And on busy day, I will assist the cashiers and help ring the customer. The hardest part of the job is managing the task within the time given. Most i enjoy about this job is that I love working with my co-workers and helping them as a team."
good,"Working at Sears seasonally was a good way to get an idea of what working retail was like. Management was nice, but hours were variable and not always what I would have liked."
good,a part time job while in high school. I learned cash handling and customer service skills. I also learned how to have patients. The hardest part of the job was during the holidays when I had to learn how to not get over-whelmed.
good,"As a store manager,I was met with some opposition to some of the initiatives I wanted to put in place, The biggest problems are as follows....no payroll, unrealistic plans for store staff, lack of acknowledgement for ""Jobs well done"" antiquated technology. And, here's the biggest of all. Since the acquisition of Sears by K-Mart, the business model has shifted dramatically to a very rigid, and uninviting environment."
good,Arrive at 6am to unload sales trucks
good,Sears is a good company to work for but the management there wasn't really as professional and don't really pull their weight in the work they do. But I always did my part and worked as hard as I could to maintain the store as needed.
good,"Sears has a long way to go as far as raising the employee morale, reviewing their supervisors and making the customer their priority."
good,Working in a big department store and meeting new people everyday. Getting a employee discount
good,Sears is a great place to work. Looking for new opportunities a change in life achievements.
good,Sears was a great company to work for. The only down fall was it is eventually going out of business. I wanted something more secure
good,"It was a fast pace company and there was various task, for example tire changing, wheel balancing, rotating tire's, checking and changing brakes, changing rotors, and checking and changing batteries."
good,"sold appliances, for over 20 years it was a great and friendly place to work everyone got along well.then the merger with k mart happened and it all went down hill, ceo killed this company"
good,Shipping and receiving unload and reload stores on  trailers I start work at 8 a.m. till 6:30 p.m. but here lately been getting off early due to lack of work Sears has filed bankruptcy and I looking for another
good,"Good place to work. I have learned to use their systems, and to deal more with the community. They dont have very many employees and want one person to work in more than one department at a time."
good,"It was a okay, I enjoyed my time there i wasn’t always surrounded by employees and mangers weren’t really present, I tried my best to do things on my own, but still need more training"
good,Trabajar para Sears fue una experiencia muy agradable
good,Sears wasn’t the best employer they had lots of issues that needed to be worked out. I had major issues with management and don’t think I’d work for this company again.
good,Great place to to and I had a secure job for 25 years until Sears Holding went bankrupt. My job as a district facility technician was eliminated November 2018.
good,"Consultative sales is cool, its competitive, goal oriented, management does a good job of setting goals, and holding you accountable for meeting those goals. Overall it's a good environment, but it is retail, dont expect full time, dont expect more than minimum wage"
good,Closing down many stores....really slow at the moment. Need customer service skills and be willing to always be working on something...hours are tight after holidays.
good,Sears in the logan valley mall was great to work for. It was just terrible leadership from the corporate company that led to the closing of this store.
good,Had a overall good experience  with company and learned alot while I worked their. The things I learned  are useful for future jobs I may work at. A fun and friendly company.
good,On a normal day you have from 8 to 10 service orders. You will be constantly be learning new things on a daily bases. during my time with Sears I had a few different managers with some being good and some bad. The hardest part of this job is time management. they will push you!....
good,"Great creative team to work with and atmosphere to work in. CEO treats staff like family. An awesome place to work if you prefer a fast-paced environment."
good,"I am going to be honest, this actually a review of two times I worked for Sears.  One in Alabama, and the other in San Diego.  I will try to clarify of which i refer to during different sections.  Over all the company was fun to work for, but only as a part time job while i was in school.   I never worked for sears as a full time representative.  "
good,"Es una empresa que te da el material que necesitas para trabajar, hay distintas áreas para crecer y establecerte , sus prestaciones son buenas , pero el tiempo en piso es demasiado para algunos días ."
good,"productive environment"
good,Served over 14 years at Sears. I grew professionally at the company. Very fond memories of associates and leadership staff. The people were a great group of individuals which made every year of service worth it!
good,"Buen ambiente mala paga, los horarios son muy agotadores"
good,"A typical day at Sears is observing and monitoring the CCTV, looking for suspicious activity.  Every day is a good day, especially when we make sure no one steals from our store."
good,"The job is better if you work seasonally because there are a lot of Sears being closed down and a lot of problems happening, so it’s suggested you don’t try to make a career out of working in Sears."
good,"Doing deliveries you have to not only do the job but had to make the customer happy. Keep homes from being damaged, and keep a certain schedule. No matter the weather."
good,"El trabajo es relativamente bueno si no tienes problemas con la presión, cumplir objetivos y cuotas."
good,Sears gives you plenty of hours and over time. They work pretty good with school schedule and the does not close to late. Easy to catch on and plenty of interactions with customers
good,"A typical day working for Sears for me started with an employee meeting to make sure everyone was on track with sale targets with any special offers or changes and new stuff and daily cleaning tasks. "
good,Management Team was exceptional at all there duties and had to go beyond their daily activities due to shortage of staff!All the employees were down to earth and you were able to get help in a timely fashion
good,"This was a great place to work, always something new everyday.  The store manager is bossy and rude. Employees had inconsistent schedules unless you were manager as favorite. At my location but all in all I enjoyed being there."
good,"I thought it was a very easy system to learn and would go back if one was in the area. They treated employees well. You could work at your own pace. Learn at your own pace. Easy learning all the insurances they took.  Always knowing which frames to take down at lunch and the evening to make sure none were stolen."
good,"Unloading vans manually, some containing 800 boxes of weights ranging from 2 lbs to fridges and stoves. would unload boxes, open and sort merchandise, place in proper bins and bins were distributed to proper departements in store."
good,"Cumplen con lo ofertado y buen ambiente, aprendes mucho en la parte gerencial en la práctica su déficit está en las capacitaciones al personal en general"
good,Es muy buena la empresa solo que su surtido de mercancia a caido un poco
good,"It can be very competitive, you have to own it and motivate yourself and your team to do what is necessary to make yourself,your team and the company to look good daily."
good,"Excellent job, great environment, great hours, and flexible schedule unfortunately they closed down before I could get comfortable I had a great experience while working for them"
good,"I love that I am not micro-managed! I previously worked for another company who constantly was up your rear end checking your work, notes, call logs, ect. "
good,"Great company to work for. The work is there and consistant, but can be a bit overwhelming. Meeting customers at there home for product deliveries and set-up."
good,Deliver and meet techs for parts also assist tech on two man operations. I would drive to parts store to find anything we didn’t have in stock and take it to techs also
good,It was good couldn’t have been better Sears is a great place to shop and work great prices and great people glad I had that experience so don’t be afraid to go there some time
good,Wasn't a bad job just need more money they offered alot of incentives to earn more but the starting pay wasn't enough to provide for a family over all a good work environment
good,J'ai eu la chance de vivre une belle expérience et tisser des liens avec des gens formidables.
good,I enjoyed working for sears Canada and was saddened by their departure. they gave it a good run for decades.they served many people in Canada and the unites states
good,"I worked at Sears for a little over a year and a half.  I loved my co-workers dearly and my store was very good at scheduling you in regards to what you wrote down as your available days and times you can work. I can’t speak for other stores but where I worked the managers and leads were great about helping you overcome any problems you encountered with having people sign up for credit or the rewards program they have there. Overall the managers and leads were very helpful and supportive in getting you to meet your goals. The drawbacks were very understaffed, if you were a consultant who got paid a lower hourly wage because you received commission you could be pulled to cashier and still only get paid that lower hourly wage. However I think after I left that had been fixed so you were paid for the hours of working in that particular area.  And they are big on pushing you to get people to sign up for credit which can be stressful at times when you can’t provide the result they want but they will go the extra mile to try to help you achieve your goals. It is difficult to schedule doctor appointments etc. due to the change of policy in requesting days off. I believe you have to request the day or days you want off at least 3 weeks in advance and your schedule comes out weekly or bi weekly so you never know what days you are going to have off but if you can schedule outside of your available hours then you should have no problem.  Even if you request those days off there is no guarantee that you will get those days off. It is at the managers discretion and also depends on if it"
good,"Worked with and managed a group of smart, engaged and creative people who always gave their all. Despite many challenges, the department I ran always contributed more to plan."
good,Es una empresa buena pero no en cuanto a sueldo y el tiempo es demasiado.
good,"Sears is  great company to begin a career without the expense of a trade school. OJT, Sears is very competitive and your performance will be evaluated weekly. You will learn very quickly because of the volume and diversity of brands."
good,Good company and I learned how to sell TVs and many more. I created a good sales pitch with my time there. I hope it helps me be a better salesman in the future.
good,es bueno solo la cultura organizacional no es practicada
good,There was good environment and  the work schedule was very flexible. However there wasn’t any benefits and  the pay was not good. The management team and coworkers were friendly and helpful.
good,"Lugar de trabajo estable, de oficina, se puede tener promoción a largo plazo"
good,Great place to work before company closing so many stores. High stress job with company trying to reinvent themselves. Work lif balance very good for Store manager level position
good,"Sears in my area changed store managers every two years.  Could have hired within.  They expect associates to be loyal to them, but they don’t take care of their employees."
good,"Focus on yourself. Dont let the customers bother you. Hit all the checkpoints on what you have to do weather your good at it or not. They just wanna see you trying. Its not a bad job but can be stressful. Ppl are great there and understanding but dont stay for them. If it works it works. If not then just leave. Again dont get stuck. But thos is a definet yes for a job to get your stuff together. Got a car, house, goals for everyone. Think of it as a stepping stone."
good,"I enjoyed working at Sears outlet, I was able to run the sales department the wa I wanted to, I was given full range to make neccessary changes and implemented selling strategies to build sales and customer service."
good,"Es una empresa buena, sólo hay que adaptarse a los protocolos y preguntar sobres los beneficios que te ofrece."
good,"I got this job when I had just turned 18. I worked here full-time. It was a great 1st job. Taught me a good work ethic and I loved my boss and co workers. I'm still in contact with my supervisor. It was fast paced, and fun. I only left because I moved to Lynnwood, otherwise I'd be still working here!"
good,Helping customers to solve their complaints is the way I see to make people happy. I also enjoyed recommending merchandize to my customers because this was a way to show my customer service skills and interpersonal skills.
good,Working at SEARS allowed me to grow and develop my communication skills as well as my sales skills with the amount of face to face conversations I had with members in the work place.
good,A typical day consisted of a meeting discussing membership expectations and cashier work. I learned that it is important to listen mindfully to a customer's complaint before attempting to solve the issue. Workplace culture was amazing. The hardest part of the job was politely stepping up when someone was attempting to pull a fast one with returns. The most enjoyable was the work relationships and the sense of community there.
good,Great staff. Warmest. Made sure employess felt comfortable. Always made sure to play to an employee's strengths and took every opportunity to allow advancement in the company pay and position-wise.
good,The only reason I have continued and plan to continue working at sears is only because of the people I have worked with I have met some great people and realized just what it means to have a manager that has been stressed to the point that he/she will refuse to help you with simple things like a schedule change.
good,"The day started off with prepping the food for the day and through week.I Knew what was expected of me during the day and what time it had to be done. Through the week I changed stations to get full effect of the kitchen. Teaching is a part of everyday life, no one knows everything. Some things are such as cleaning! that's a common. The most enjoying thing about the world of Food Service loving what you do."
good,"Unfortunately the company closed. However, manager and co-workers were very supportive. Manager at that time was understanding in regards to hours, days off and sick days."
good,I worked for A&E Factory service which was the appliance repair division of Sears. Even Though Sears is no longer own business A&E Factory service still is.
good,"I typically would run the cashier, help customers with inventory, upload work to the computer. I learned time management, people skills, patience. Management was surreal, they knew how to run things accordingly. The culture was open, everyone got along."
good,"A good place to work, and very easy to make some good money with the correct support.  Fast paced environment and customer service is the key, would definitely recommend"
good,"-Not enough room for you to grow"
good,"A typical day at work was busy with a many things to learn regarding sales goals for each day.  The workplace culture was competitive and kept me on my ""toes"".  The hardest part of the job was meeting sales goals for myself when it was a slow day for customers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was always making the customer completely satisfied."
good,Buen escalón para iniciar una vida laboral pero con carencias resaltables para la formación de el colaborador
good,"The team was great. The managers were very understanding of each individuals' needs and goals. Sadly this was cut short by the closure of the store."
good,"very ,very slow lots of employee and customer negativity.  Low sales never meet budget."
good,Sears was a great place to work. The loyal customers made coming to work every day a joy and I could not have bee happier with the staff members around me.
good,I work in auto warehouse my main job was to restock self out in the auto department keep warehouse clean stock ties unload truck and restock battery main thing the hardest part of the job was to unload truck by myself and put the ties in it proper place. I enjoy working there the people I work with was ok
good,Company was going down hill at sears portrait soon after i left the company closed for good. The job as a photographer is emotional and seasonal hiring with such a short time to train was unfair to managers employees and customers
good,"fast paced environment more focused on sales than repair "
good,Sears was a fun and enjoyable job while in high school. Taught me a lot about how companies run as well as valuable work experience at a young age. Sales taught me valuable communications skills.
good,The time I worked there my direct manager was not able to manage her technical group and the technicians were under great pressure and the job did not have any pleasant part to make my day. the only good thing about this job was communicating with different customers and some of these customers were very nice and you could learn a lot from them plus helping the people and solving their problem was interesting. when you see a smile on their face that was enough for me.
good,"Unloading new stock and putting items from and into the stock room and onto the the sales floor,and cleaning the cashier area. Knowing how to deal with difficult customers and proceed with the transaction, helping other associates in other departments. The work environment was very friendly and work-driven. The holidays were always a crazy time for us, with a humongous rush, but it always made co-works feel closer at the end of the night. On of the hardest part was management of different stores having different rules/regulations and having that mingle for the other stores to deal with the customers."
good,"Co-workers Were Good, Boss Was Good, Some Days Are Busy While Others Weren’t, Called Off If Not Enough Work & No Benefits, Some Pay Raises, But Not A lot."
good,"I was proud to be a member of the Sears workforce.  They have a strong commitment to supporting our military and for the most part I enjoyed the job very much.  I enjoyed dealing with the customers, was enthusiastic about our products and services enjoyed passing that enthusiasm on to the customer.  The hardest part of the job, I would have to say, was the competition for sales, the most enjoyable was getting to meet many new people."
good,"A typical day you would have a meeting in the morning and then go to your work stations. Open register and check area for cleanness and check clothes for prices, then stock as needed. Management was very pushy on getting you to push Sears credit cards. Hardest part was not having time to set for a bit or get management when you needed them. The most enjoyable was meeting and greeting and helping satisfy the customers."
good,customers came first and were very loyal to the sears organization.Easy to build a strong customer base for sales with individual knowledge of products
good,I was always working in the warehouse part of the building.  I learned a lot about appliances. When I first started management was great until he retired.  All the employees got along with each other but did not really get along with management.  Hardest part of working in the job was working in the warehouse in the summer where it was over 100°.  Nothing was really enjoyable about the job it was just neutral.
good,"This job, while temporary was not overly demanding. Fellow employees were a good group and management was very good. It was unfortunate this was a temporary contract position"
good,"This was a great place for a first job. Well structured in training and there was always someone to ask questions to. The only bad part was when they switched to the central aisle cashiers, you basically had to stay in the boxed area or within sight of it, so there was sometimes a lot of waiting, however I've seen more recently that have gotten less restrictive giving the cashiers more responsibilities and keeping them more active."
good,"The reason I liked working for sears my immediate supervisor was great she was a good trainee she show me so many different things about my work, also I traveled to different stores to do inventory and merchandise the store or to close a store."
good,"For the workload in moving furniture, kitchen appliances and workout equipment by dolly the pay of 8 dollars was not worth it. Management was very impatient with employees."
good,"atencion al cliente, buen trato al cliente, recibir mercancia, cajero"
good,"At the location I was fortunate enough to work at , most of the "
good,"Minimum wage, sorting stock and organizing the storeroom. Had a manager change after the 1st month of work and the workplace environment rapidly went downhill. Went from having 3-4, 8+ hour shifts a week to 5-6, 3-4 hour shifts a week. Would come in, sort the entire warehouse/storeroom in 2-3 hrs, get sent to the floor to make sales and still somehow make 2nd highest in the men's section."
good,"Great place to work. Good pay and benefits. Not a big fan of working in a host environment.  Deal with a lot of shrinkage. After I close the host is still open. No doors, gate or anything to secure my store. AP is none existent."
good,"My time with Sears assisted me with enhancing my management skills.  Working in stores, and at the home office I had the opportunity to  learn from many different managers in a variety of departments and I was able to form my own style."
good,"I enjoyed my first position as a CSR where I gained an adequate amount of call center experience. I learned I possessed the ability to relate and communicate well with incoming callers in a upbeat, fast paced environment."
good,"It was a fun place to work. A variety of faces every day and I loved it. But there was just no room for advancement within this company. Overall, the management was great though."
good,Mas bariedad de mercancias micelaneas es mas venta y atrae nuevos clientes
good,"Just a regular cashier job nothing too stressful."
good,"Gran ambiente laboral, una muy buena experiencia con los compañeros de trabajo. Respeto mutuo y experiencias inolvidable."
good,"It’s a really great job. All the employees were nice, everyone knew what was going on. It wasn’t badly unorganized considering they were closing. Managers were awesome. Flexible schedules."
good,"Fun environment to work in, fast- paced environment. Good for a starting job, they are very flexible with hours. Management was very helpful, did their best to keep the work environment enjoyable."
good,It's ok but it's hard installing stuff with out making any mistakes. Sometimes you have to do some stuff over and over again cause people don't know how they want things to be done or where they want it placed.
good,Was a great experience In was a well rounded store and also was excited to be part of the sears team was also paid good in let me work as many hours as I wanted
good,Interesting work and enjoyed my co-workers.  Helped me develop and gain new skills and knowledge.  The workplace was very welcoming and conducive to my needs.
good,"The direction keeps changing so never clear line of sight of deploying set strategies . in 7 years we have had 9 CIOs, which make it hard to bring standards to IT"
good,"Sears gave me the opportunity to improve my retail sales skills. "
good,if you aren't use to customer service I wouldn't advice you to work here. customers tend to treat you as if you are not human. customer service isn't a big care for this company but selling credit cards is.
good,"managed 15-20 sales reps for outside in home sales of home improvement products. Assigned leads, conducted training classes, reviewed and processed sales paperwork. Evaluated sales rep with ride along observations."
good,Working at Sears was a great experience and I enjoyed my job a lot. If I ever had the opportunity to work there again I would definitely work there again.
good,"Typical day starts with checking new inventory, then placing them in the respective areas. Greeting customers and helping them find things what they look for. Always keeping the designated area clean and sorted. Changing price tags during sales and doing inventory whenever needed."
good,"The staff were pretty easy to work with. We ll got along well. The job wasn't that demanding, and I didn't mind the work .really didn't like getting paid every two weeks."
good,I did everything from packing orders to reconditioning product. Picking product for stores. Packed product for the stores. Received product from vendors and inspected to product. In charge of ordering new supplies for department.
good,People are great to work with. Hours are great and only by the mall. Great discounts and fun place to work. Managers are approachable and great to work with.
good,I worked in the driving school. It was a pretty chill desk job. Handled student records. Scheduled driving appointments. Answered the phone and consolidated angry parents.
good,The work environment was stable.  Started  a position in children's department and transitioned into cosmetics.  Became very comfortable in opening credit accounts for several customers.
good,Sears concept is to take care of the customer needs. I work with a team that was trained to give a 100 % every time the step foot on my sale floor. Our workplace culture was to follow all the policy & procedure that Sears expect from everybody that work for this company.
good,"It was a good job.. I learned many new skills and had good management. Overall, I would say it was a good working experience. My store manager was not the most professional however,"
good,"was an okay place to work good co workers"
good,"enjoyed working there, the people were great. Management was very poor and didnt do their jobs well. Definitely miss working there and the family/friends i made"
good,"es una gran empresa, pero a la hora del crecimiento se ponen un poco duros"
good,"Traite avec des clients en majorité du cote de l'ouest canadien ce qui faisait la majorité des appels étaient en  anglais. travailler avec plusieurs département dont les catalogues pour placer les commandes, la facturation,  le support technique service de garantie et service de plainte. Tout ces département était divise en section selon les produits."
good,"I actually loved to work for Sears. Initially, the hours were long when you were fresh out of training. Once you were able to do a shift bid and you maintained high numbers, you were able to get a better schedule."
good,"customer service , sales counting  jewelry,  cleaning, first choice of clearance items. If you like to shop it great jobs. Sometime you runs in to good manager some are bad."
good,"Working at sears was a great oppurtunity to further better my working and communication skills, Although I saw a decline in the current management at the time, I went back and got interviewed recently and the people have all been changed. It is a different working enviroment."
good,Decent place to work at but management  didn’t really communicate with each other.  You work hard and they really didn’t appreciate it or was willing to train you.
good,"Sears provided good experience working with the daily intake of cash/checks, and their subsequent reconciliation to the corresponding sales, cash disbursements, and bank deposits. The pace was fast. The front-line managers provided a good measure of autonomy and did not try to micromanage the day to day functions. However, it was sometimes challenging to have little direction. But, it was always satisfying to see all the numbers balance at the end of the day. Sears provided a good, flexible family oriented workplace."
good,Sears created an opportunity for me to learn and grow within retail. My first job was as a cashier and I was able to move up to be an assistant manager. Sears embraces its' hard working associates and gives them the opportunity to grow.
good,Good to very good place to work Comfortable environment and friendly staff. Lacks some training aspects that would allow you to be successful sooner and move upward.
good,"I would go in take care of my task, floor moves and take care of the customers. I would make sure the signing was correct. This was a solid company years ago."
good,"I enjoyed working for Sears, my only issue was there was little room for advancement and career opportunities. Most management was leaving when I worked there and they were not being replaced."
good,"Sears has been a great company to work for. But the recent climate in the company and consumer confidence has diluted the appointment quality to people who are unable to do any home improvements,"
good,It was a great job to start out with if you are training to be a sales associate. You learn the basics of folding clothes and putting them away. Always make sure your area was tidy.
good,Sears has been around for a very long time and as an associate it was sad to see it go. working here was fun and normally and fast past place. when it was slow i am sure the mangers would find you something to do.
good,"Busy busy busy place to work, especially during the holidays. I know that they have benefits now that were not available in the past.  Looking forward to shopping in the winter."
good,"In order to receive commission a matrix table must be achieved , however, one of the matrix is having to meet credit share, which means you need to apply customers purchase using a sears credit card. Not all customers will qualify for a credit card, therefore, you can possibly miss your matrix in order to get commission and or delivery may drop the ball and customers will cancel their orders based on delivery service which than effects your matrix and therefore preventing you from making commission. people are great to work with and Store manager is awesome."
good,Not a bad place to get automotive tech experience. Especially for young people starting out in the career field. Not really a life long career job type setting.
good,"have a start up meeting, then the boss would assign our job to me. I unload trucks with forklift and clamp trucks.. then we put product away in locations in warehouse."
good,Sears culture is to be the worlds greatest retailer. Goal is to deliver a 'wow' experience to customers (which can be internal business units as well as individuals that shop at Sears & Kmart). Typical day included strategic steps to ensure that each associate did their part to drive operational excellence.
good,A typical day was very busy for me. I learned a lot about customer needs and employee needs and always found ways to help. It is a great place to kick start your career because they always make you feel like family.
good,"Working at sears, taught me the proper way to help and provide for a customer and to go above and beyond! The workplace had a great environment with great people; It made work a little more fun."
good,I worked at Sears for a seasonal position. The manager and employees were great but the pay was not. Only worked here for a short time so I cannot give much more information.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to help customers find what they need. I work place environment was positive and leadership is always willing to help when an employee does not understand something.
good,"I liked working as a sales associate, helping customers and assisting the commission sales people if they needed help.  A good part of my time there was at the maximum pay grade in a position of no advancement"
good,I worked for Sears for 13 and 1/2 years and another 2 years as a contractor.  The people at Sears were great to work with.  Like family. The issue working at Sears is that the company is shrinking. They stopped giving wage increases....no 401K match and you have job cuts every 6 months.  So you live your life like tomorrow can be your last day working for the company.
good,Typical day at work consisted of taking incoming calls for customers looking for information on their warranties on their appliances. Would also schedule appointments for repairs.
good,Sears was a great company that is fading quick.  Management at the top is ruining what was once a great corporate culture.  They don't even advertise to bring customers into the shop and traffic is low.
good,The management fought over hours and made the atmosphere tense. It was clear who the managers liked working with and would cut certain people's hours which I thought was discrimination.
good,I itemized and totaled purchases by recording prices to provide customers with accurate funds returned to them. I calculated cash drawer by counting cash at the beginning and end of each work shift to indicate the revenue of sales. I also ensured a positive customer experience through meaningful interaction.
good,Aprendí más sobre el equipo de trabajo y competencias.
good,Being in loss prevention was very interesting. I was able to see the other side of a business that I have never seen before while also learning how everyday processes work in order for the store to run efficiently. I also learned the ins and outs of some of the company which was interesting.
good,"Good commission based job in past glory days of company, good training ""courses"" on computer of previously unknown subject matter (appliances, e.g; features,benefits, etc.)"
good,If it weren't for store closings this would have been a great company to grow your career with.  Great team environment and many talented managers and co-workers.
good,This is a job where you will be working 70+ hours a week sometimes more if you have a lot of driving. The worst part is you work by your self. you have to be a people person.
good,"Company went out of business. Store closed. All Sears stores are closing, Sears is currently going out of closing all stores. All Kmart stores will soon follow. Upper management is totally unresponsive."
good,Sears is easy to move up of you work hard. It is stressful at times but you can easily overcome with the right mindset. Have to be goal.oriented and a people person.
good,"I enjoyed working in the jewelry department, but i was hired on as seasonal help so after christmas i was let go due to them not hiring on any seasonal help."
good,"Good Company to work for at Sears,My role was looking after the store employees &  looking after customer service at every level to ensure customer satisfaction."
good,"Working at Sears had so many"
good,I enjoyed working here and learning some of the essential life/work skills that I learned. Management was great and understanding. I recommend working here.
good,"A typical day would consist of cleaning up the salesfloor and helping members out with any questions. Also, when the cashier team needed backup sales associates go upfront to help ring."
good,it was a different experience . i stayed busy no doubt about that..it was a job . i would it all again if i had no choice.. i unloaded n loaded trucks . my hand dolly was my best friend at sears . without one of those in sears n your out of luck!
good,"A typical day at sears can either be slow, which is where a lot of large tasks can be done, as well as smaller tasks; or fast, which is when you are back and forth handing customers their online deliveries. management is great, all managers are optimistic and are great at providing team spirit."
good,Was happy working at Sears. It was a great learning experience for me. It taught me a lot about customer service and how to deal with all types of complaints.
good,"enjoyed working  for one year. the last 2 years were difficult with the end coming. fast-paced environment, co-workers were excellent and an overall great work environment."
good,"Considering the current status of Sears, I am reluctant to recommend that anyone work there.There is just too much uncertainty for me. We will just have to wait and see what happens."
good,"Coworkers were friendly, many people got along. Training was paid, even when we needed to travel. Unfortunately not many people came to the store to browse products, competing with the online division was tough,"
good,Some days  were better than others. Commissions sales can be hard. You keep yourself busy in between stocking the floor. Now though customers can get product off the shelves.
good,"Interesting company very good people, love the ability to teach train and develop the associates into better associates, the store is only as good as the leadership."
good,"Aprendí a tener mas paciencia a la gente tanto con mis compañeros como con los clientes, a tener mas facilidad de palaba y convencimiento de compra."
good,It was was a good place to work but the hours I was given did not work with my school schedule. It is now closed so that is why I did not recommend it.
good,I really enjoyed working there. As long as you can pitch credit card sales your good to. The lines can tend to get really long but working there is a lot of fun.
good,"I enjoyed working at Sears, as in-store support we did the signage for promotions and events so a lot of times we were working before the store open. Which aloud us to get signage done quickly and efficiently."
good,"I was a very hard worker at Kmart, I exceeded expectations, and I did more then what was asked of me. and they still cut my hours. Job was very boring and slow."
good,"My job was pretty basic, but the people I worked with were really nice and my superior was a great person. Never really got bored."
good,"Aprendi a trabajar en equipo de una manera diferente de una fabrica a un tienda departamental"
good,"A very good work environment, productive and fun workplace, peoples are amazing and a wonderful management, very sad that sears closed his doors, i hope one day all the team will work together again,"
good,The position at Sears was in a warehouse.  My job was to unload appliances and to move appliances unto the floor. I was also in charge of cleaning the units.
good,"A typical day at works is stocking merchandise on shelves and racks, cashiering, cleaning the fitting rooms, pulling items to the floor, and cleaning up the store from the day before. I learned more about working on a cash register,  helping customers apply for store credit cards, and working with different types of people. The management was willing to help when ever you needed help, was trying to push their employees the push their credit cards on the customers. Workplace culture had different types of people from different backgrounds. The hardest part of the job was trying to have people apply for the Sears credit card. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with good people."
good,"Once clocked in I would check the board for any apprehensions, then I would receive shift turn from the other officer before watching the cameras. Most enjoyed was when I saw a suspect on camera and they just concealed an item."
good,"Flexible, after reviewing project can take it or leave it."
good,"its a job, and at the end of the day it was what paid the bills... opportunity to make your own paycheck but never a quiet moment, not for someone easy going"
good,"It was a great experience, I learned many new skills though helping customers, and being positive. The hardest part was dealing with non cooperative customers, but that taught me patience and good thinking skills."
good,"I worked here while going to school. The management team was overall good. Some cared about you as a person, some not so much. Some of the people were good people to work with."
good,"A typical day at sears was helping old people. Most of the customers were elderly and they enjoyed shopping there."
good,"Great people, under new management which is a great improvement to the overall attitude in the store.  Everybody working together makes for positive atmosphere."
good,"Great products sell-able reliable and wanted by the public.  Upper management is resistance to change at the store level, almost dismissive at times to any ideas coming from the store level cause we've done this for 100 plus years"
good,"Competitive pay with easy promotion with in different departments. Discounts and recognition for employees. Events for holidays, customers and friends/families."
good,"This position was outstanding when I was first promoted to management.  Unfortunately after the down turn of the economy in 2008, as managers we were heavily micro managed.  The job became very unenjoyable."
good,Managed very poorly from district manager up the chain of command. Great job just feel should be paid more for what is expected. Benefits are quite expensive.
good,"All though I liked the people I worked with, the company does not pay well and you don't get enough hours. Most of the department managers we easy to get along with too."
good,"Although Sears is no longer in business, it was a great place to work for. Managment needed better training to help lead their teams. Upper management was arguably the reason for the company's demise."
good,"Well not much to say now that Sears is closed, it was a good place to work. it had its ups and downs, worked there for 34 years so it was a good place to work"
good,I enjoyed working for this company. The only downfall was no raises as promised ever! This site sold out to have jobs overseas for cheaper wages. I enjoyed the people I worked with. A lot of teamwork and supportive coworkers.
good,Pretty amazing job that allowed me to be happy while making scruptiously amazing money and become cool and beautifully wealthy with honor and respect from them.
good,"good training, bad executive management,excellent benefits, great work environment,professional associates, constant training,fair,organized,easy to shop"
good,Thought that I would retire from Sears but as does happen things don't always go as planned... Unfortunately as time went on things started to change and not for the better and I found myself in a buy out because my job was eliminated.
good,our local store closed. was cashier. customers usually friendly. had to keep eye out for shoplifters. they pressured you to get credit card apps. management was ok. learned to fold clothes per company guidelines
good,"nice place to work, flexible schedule for students"
good,"I love working at Sears ...  I learned how to bra fit .. Our manager is always there to help if we need one... if we need a day off he just smiled and said ""No Problem"""
good,Great second job. Overtime was usually offered but not mandatory. The call center managers were usually fair but there were a good amount that were very petty.
good,Great place to learn on different positions in a automotive shop. Great paid training is given. Management is very supportive and easy to communicate with.
good,"I feel at this time hard to give a review but for the years I worked at Sears I enjoyed the work and found them on par with other retail outlets. The people that worked for this company made it fun . "
good,"Great co-workers, Sears was in liquidation so it was fast-paced and constantly changing. Great management. Sadly the Kingston location is now closed and I'm out of a job."
good,"loading and unloading trucks,assist customers in their needs. distribute boxes in the right departments. the manager was very helpful and trained me well."
good,when I started sears was in liquidation and they were closing so they didn't really care about much weather it b e customer service or training or anything. as long as we gave the correct discounts it didn't matter what else we did
good,Overall Sears Sears was for most part a good working environment. The other associates seem to be very cooperative and  eager to help if need bee .My job was basic just unload the trucks  put stock and ship out returns and always make sure I made the auto order up date to replace stock inventory.
good,"I liked working with my Co Workers,  they were helpful. If you needed a manager they came right away to help with what you needed from them for the Customer."
good,"I loved working for Sears. I loved the flexibility in my schedule and the focus on customer care. This was my first job after graduating high school and I still use the skills I learned at Sears today,"
good,"Une journée peut se passer très rapidement surtout lorsque le volume d'appels est élevé."
good,"Everyday was something different never often did the same things twice in a row , if you were cross trained you often took on more responsibilty and were expected to do so ,the managment was good"
good,Working at sears was an okay job while i was going to school they didn’t really have great hours you had to really fight with the mangers to get hours
good,"• Assisted customers in applying for credit cards"
good,Loved my photography job.  However was just part time needed full time to raise my family.. Great place to work. Was not paid by Sears as it was just a rental office
good,The people in my department were willing to help when I had questions. The managers were very approachable and helpful as well.  The department offered full time hours and benefits.
good,"Es una buena empresa en la cual puedes adquirir muchos conocimientos nuevos,la cantidad de cosas que  aprendes es mucha  ya que debemos ser pro activos."
good,"Day will go by fast.  Had so much to do couldn't even keep track of time.  Process claims all day, and the people and managers are awesome made my job easier"
good,There's room for growth and they do like to move up from within also always a lot of money to be made if you're working on commission staff was very pleasant and easy to work with
good,Mellow work environment. Very short work days. Very consistent work scheduling. Easy to follow work instructions. Good manager with good leadership skills.
good,Taking outbound calls to customer to renew pa agreements for appliances. management is poor sales like talking to customers.Ilike the hours and good parking area. If you are going to school take the job until graduation hours are great
good,Great tech? Good tech? Get to be a salesman. Sell home warrentees and PA's you will be top tech. Don't and you will be on the chopping block for a job loss.
good,"Upper management was in disarray and the pace of change and turnover at head office made it difficult to cope. The best part of this job was the people I worked with at the store level. Great bunch, somehow despite all the mess, still managed to find pride in their jobs and make my job easier."
good,the job can be rewarding when you're able to help a customer but at time can be stressful because of the sales goal they want you to meet. people are great!
good,I started off just unloading the boxes off the truck but i previously did training for the cash register so i can be put up front. I prefer unloading trucks but i don’t mind working with customers to make sure they’re satisfied when they leave.
good,"Set up and demonstrate the product that I was selling.  Over the years I sold vacuum cleaners, furniture and pictures and lamps.  Including also mattress and box springs.  Before that it was clothing.  I learned how to set up a display that makes it appealing for customers. I learned how to  work with others trying to sell the same thing that I am. The hardest part of this job was cleaning up after the customers (sometimes they make a big mess)  The best part was just meeting and greeting most of my customers."
good,"I was a cashier at Sears until we moved to WA State.  I was also a trainer, opened and closed for the day.  Counted down all tills at night and did all the paper work and nightly cash drops."
good,"I dont really remember much from this job, but from what i do remember is loving being a loss prevention detective at 19. I learned a thing or two from this job."
good,"is wasn't a bad place to work. but they are all gone now. went out of business and that is that. too bad they did, i rather liked working there. oh well, whats done is done."
good,"multi tasking in the office, answering phone dealing with face to face customer, preparing schedule for office and dealing with day to day problem solving for customer accounts"
good,"it was good experience working at sears, plusvery  good environment, manager, BA, qa leader and team members are very friendly and responsible too. typical day at work is usual like my at&t work place and overall were good."
good,Great Customer service and Good Training. Starting point for youth in the career field. Good first job. Really helps with social skills and organization skills. Learning is well balanced as well.
good,"Sears was a really good company to work for. It is really sad that they are going out of business. Really going to miss the people I worked with."
good,"Physically demanding but completely manageable, Great supervisors and managers, they are easy going but stern at the same time which are good qualities of any leader."
good,Really only bad thing about this job was sears' corporate rules and regulations and interference. Great time working with good management and coworkers. Wish had more hours.
good,Ambiente tranquilo y con salario decente por medio tiempo
good,"Its fun, but there is not a lot going on. the work is not exciting, but then again you get paid like that. some of the work is monotonous and could use better strategies."
good,When you work at sears you experience a great atmosphere and meet wonderful new faces everyday which makes this position very interesting and more lively than others.
good,my favorite place to work. the staff were fun to work with. the environment was so fun to be in. I loved going to work wen o worked here. family and friends day was the best time of the year because of the games and completions we had. I absolutely loved this job
good,Not enough hours per week .and no work in the fall unless you go to some other state and work for a month or so or your out of luck to the next year when grass starts growing again
good,It was great working there during the holiday season. Even part time workers got 30 or 40 hours a week. But during the off season you will be lucky to get 10 hours a week. Usually only 1 four hour day a week. Not easy to live on that.
good,"It was an allright Job ,But the store closed The hours were tough when I,ld Work nights ,then have to come back in early in the morning.And it was a 20 mile trip each way."
good,"In the past 5 years, Sears Canada Inc. offered an amazing learning experience to its finance team, which is invaluable and unique. A typical day at work is pretty flexible to the majority but some others are really dedicated and hard-working."
good,You always knew what was expected of you. Unfortunately you could not count on the hours given. Management seemed to change often.        over all not a bad place to work
good,"Working for Sears was very rewarding.  Although retail environments can be stressful, people were generally very collegial and looked out for each other."
good,el lugar es bueno para la persona que esta terminando de estudiar y desea empezar a tener experiencia laboral.
good,"i was part of their 16 week regional training program. absolutely fabulous! by the time i was done i was able to do everything that one would need to do in the store. mix paint, work with loss prevention, shipping and rcvng, etc"
good,good place to work. lately some stress due to country economy issue.  In need of more workers on floor to perform better service to our customers.  People Friendly
good,"ambiance agréable, horaire flexible, très bonne direction"
good,"The Sears store in Mentor, Ohio is closing. Since we were Sears Optical, operating inside the Sears store, we have already closed. There are not many Sears Opticals left, so not many employess were given the opportunity to continue employment with this company."
good,As an MCA the job required a lot of friendly communication and one person work assignments. Managment can become a little stressful when assigned aren't complete in appropriate times.
good,It was a good place to work but it was somewhat disorganized.  Initial training period was excellent for basic knowledge needed but training for specific role at company was extremely disorganized.  Processes for doing job were unorganized as well.
good,"One of the last remaining department stores. Was a great place to work and try to get me back on my feet after being in school. "
good,sears is winding down and closing stores this store is still happening the outlet stores are still holding on their own and overall the traffic is allowing enough business for a few to do well.
good,Co-workers were great and everyone helped each other. Each work day seemed to pass quickly. The management at my location were a strong group who helped each other.
good,Sears is my first place to work in Canada. In Sears Canada Inc. is a very good work place to learn and execute experience. Its a very good and friendly environment.to work.
good,"Buen ambiente laboral pero sus horarios son pésimos, las jornadas laborales se vuelven demasiado pesadas"
good,It was not a hard job but they pushed a lot of the sales tropes on their employees. They want you to sell overpriced protection plans that didn't do anything. When they would confront you on low numbers and you'd ask a better way to sell it they wouldn't have any answers either. In my area the people I worked for and with were always very nice and understanding. I did actually have a lot of fun at the job.
good,It was an exciting and fun job that I enjoyed very much. The boss was a blessing to work for and made the job fun and not boring at all. It didn't pay very much though but it was not like i was looking for a future through their corporation. It was just giving me a stable income through the portion of college i went to.
good,For a retail company they treat most employees with respect. Unfortunately you still have to play the retail store games to make it with the company. But its OK.
good,Un ambiente de trabajo normal. Me gustaria que tuviera mas oportunidades de crecimiento dentro de la compañia para que de esa manera los empleados puedan mantenerse evolucionando.
good,"most people are outgoing and friendly, there are a number of ways to make extra pay. However, its harder than most places to do so. The base is very low for the position"
good,I was responsible for accessing customer needs and meeting those needs. Also for maintaining a clean and organized sales floor. The hardest part of the job was selling service plans although I met my goal monthly.
good,"Réception, traitement des besoins du client. Pour les points, les commandes par téléphone réactivation des cartes et autres tâches connexes."
good,Very simple to do. Loved the hours they gave me. Co-workers we're super friendly and made it comfortable for me to work with them. They push you to do the best you can
good,"This store was run so poorly and so many of the emloyees were robbing the store blind. When they started getting all the long time employees that were taking huge amounts out of the tills from the store and talk of it shutting down, I went ahead and reloated back to Wilmington, NC. Within a month it was completely shut down."
good,I enjoyed my time a Sears.  The culture was very balanced and my boss allowed for work from home days and was very supportive when needed her help.  I had nothing but good experiences at Sears.
good,one thing I like working in SEARS are the support given to me by my co workers and they are all absolutely nice and wonderful to work with. They don't treat you as an employees but a part of a family and that's make me feel so proud and the management team are very supportive. They will really teach you all kinds of technique in handling customer's problems.
good,"I loved working for sears, I received great training in cashiering and in sales. I was the top sales rep. I loved the customers they would have regular customers that you would get to know on a day to day basis."
good,I work part time at Sears for a couple of years. For the most part it was a laid back environment until around the holidays. It was really busy during the holiday season which was okay because it made time go by faster.
good,Good job for a 16 year old or someone getting back into the work world after a hiatus. Easy and challenging in small ways so its never too boring. Be careful they don't go under..
good,"Not a bad place to work for"
good,"The customers would be upset about their appliance being broken, then you send a repair man to take care of them. Moved up to Dispatcher, Scheduled routes for the Technicians."
good,"Reporting to the department manager, sell items appropriate to your assignment. In some cases one is expected to retrieve stock from the warehouse. Some items require extensive unpacking or assembly, it can be very hard to keep pace while maintaining expected neatness and attentiveness. Professional politeness and personal magnetism are expected, where customers may need to be told what they want, and the accessories that should accompany it.  "
good,I learned a lot about being a leader and forming a good team.I did not find hard parts in my work because I did not like it and enjoyed it very much the time I did it.
good,"Great place to work plenty of work hours and friendly staff. worked through a staffing agency and did not work directly through Sears."
good,Answered incoming calls; troubleshooting of equipment; handled customer concerns and complaints; scheduled in-home appointments; handled escalation calls; made courtesy calls
good,"fast pace."
good,"Giving excellent service to our customers which makes me feel so good inside."
good,"The people who work here are supportive, they adapt to change easily and take pride in their stores and communities. If you decide to work at Sears you will be working with people that will welcome you and make you feel like part of their Sears Family. This aspect of Sears has endured for generations. Time management, organization and delegation are necessary in this environment, the hours are long."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting the customers. During the summer time many came looking for school uniforms. Plus there were computer stations in several areas to make that happen.
good,Beaucoup de défis à relever ce qui est très motivant.
good,Typically if you like to organize while restocking merchandise the job can be rewarding at times. discounts would be great especially during holidays and work is pretty relaxed You do have to memorize where things are but its not too hard
good,Kmart was very unorganized when it came to scheduling but other than that the associates were very nice as far as the people that I worked with. I just had problems with hours .
good,The job was okay and the work environment could have been better.  It was not very team oriented. There was too much division and Management roles needed to be defined.
good,Work consisted of heavy lifting and running back and forth between loading customer goods and moving products out to  sales floor; which made day go by faster. There was a rotation of managers so work and task varied from day to day.
good,"Sears is a great place to develop, but may not be the best for job security and long term growth.  Layoffs can cause additional stress, but if you want to get your foot in the door with a company that you can get some experience, SHC is a good place"
good,"I liked working here as an employee. Everyone got along well with each other. The head staff associated themselves with everyone as well. If you ever needed help they were sure to help. Reason I left was on a personal note.  Also, they seemed to start showing favoritism towards certain people. It was like if you were a kiss up then you move up to the next level. I never finished my training to move up in the job, and they were trying to train people who only there for a month or so for the same position. They also started making changes that interfered with your person all life. They didn't want to approve vacation time for about 9 months throughout the year. If you were running late due to traffic, accident, anything not your fault it counted against you, which doesn't seem very fair at all. I would only recommend this company to those who is trying to get by until they find something they really enjoy."
good,I worked here along time ago as a starter job. My review for this company would not be accurate. But what I can tell you is that it was alot of good sales for employees
good,I worked in the paint department.  I went to training's and learned a lot about home repair and paint.  The management was very approachable and friendly.
good,A normal day at work was good. I would assist customers in their appliance needs. I learned how to be patient with customers. We have an owner that helps us whenever we need it.
good,"It was a great place to work, the only problem came when i applied for department manager and the store manager decided to lie to get his friend in despite me being more qualified for the position."
good,People are fun and easy to work with. Scheduling is very flexible. Clean work place. Laid back and easy going daily routines. Great training provided on the job
good,Sears was a balanced workplace where some days it would be busy and other days it would be slow. A typical workday would usually consist of helping customers and putting out/rearranging merchandise. I learned more about product placement as well as organization. Management was ok and mostly upbeat though I feel more managers were needed in the store as the one I worked for were short staffed in some areas. The hardest part of the job would be getting out all the proper merchandise out of the truck area and onto the floor. The most enjoyable part was that most days were slow and work would be easier to handle.
good,"Hardest part of the job is the pressure to sign up for rewards and credits. Its a pretty easy job otherwise. Fun people, friendly environment and flexible hours"
good,I worked with great with people at Sears. It's a friendly environment and atmosphere at Sears is great. I think i improved my customer service skills by working at Sears. I really miss working there!
good,"Sears Auto Center over all was a great place to work. Fast-paced and demanding when work was abundant. I tried doing everything that came in with great attention to detail, but majority of sales advisers had horrible selling percentage as a result customers would walk. Would definitely go back to Sears if management was better and more incentives/rewards were given."
good,"Gained leadership skills, gained customer development, learned problem solving & multitasking. Learned to interact with different customer types. Culture - Customer focused"
good,"There are two ways to view a company in decline. The most popular (and easiest) is to simply write it off as ""troubled"" or some such and ignore it until it goes away. The other - and the one that landed me here - is to view it as an opportunity ...one that will allow you to legitimately help people do their jobs better while giving you some awesome experience. There's no hiding the fact that it's a struggle, but it keeps the work day interesting and there's always a new challenge to be had."
good,"Nice to work for full time. Less stable hours as part time with next to no work at times. Clear and easy to follow policies and expectations. Overall, a good experience. easy to transfer between cities if needed"
good,"show up to store either open department, or get scanner from who is leaving and take over order pick up or online orders to retrieve for customers. load heavy merchandise into car."
good,For the mist part Sears was a good place to work. The Staff could have been more professional. The hours were flexible and they were able to work with you.
good,I really enjoyed working for sears. The staff is good people and very friendly. It was close to home and really felt at home when I was employed at sears.
good,Hay muchos beneficios en cuanto a lo económico así como prestaciones
good,Sears although going through some corporate changes was an interesting place to work. Solid benefits and strong leadership. A bit resistant to change.
good,"Sales goals were absolutely obtainable, and there was always money to be made even with the constantly-cut commission rates. I would love to go back for some extra cash, although I would't expect the company to last long."
good,"My typical day in Large Appliances is simple, and also it can get extremely busy . You run into incredible people from all walks of life that make your job extremely glad to be there. I learned so much including the things about my department. I look at appliances , electronics , and floor care so differently now . Sears really do all that is possible to keep the employees informed about everything in the store. the way that they train us is really great cause you learn at your own pace , and the material isn't hard to grasp.The downside to the job is that the commissioned side is completely cutthroat. you have to keep fighting to keep your commission every day. heck every hour for that matter. everything from cancellations returns wrong colors dents scratches that will significantly hurt the commission that you have built up. Then if you don't make your quota, you are n what they call Draw pay. meaning the paycheck that they pay you is a loan and you have to automatically pay that paycheck back in small payments over a term of 4 weeks til its paid back . which sucks cause it seemed like a good group of us are always in draw."
good,I was able to attend the Sears Chicago Tech School . Were the primary focus was on small appliance repair with a specialty in refrigeration. This was also a great learning experience for me .I was laid  off due to store closings. I enjoyed working for Sears.
good,The job at sears was an enjoyable one. After moving up to the sales associate position the job became a lot more independent and creative. Having to make sales and ensure customer satisfaction was one of my favorite parts of this job.
good,the pay is just not good and you cant get more than 30 hrs a week. that's bad when you have bills and a family. if your in high school its a great place to work
good,"I am able to meet with a variety of customers on a daily basis, provide leaderships and work with a professional staff as well as develop my skills in regards to time management, multi tasking, leadership, presentations and sales development."
good,Nice people to work with before closing NY design office. New leadership made the place disaster and people leaving. Sad the NY design office closed 2017.
good,Fun workplace with friendly coworkers. learned a bit of sales and commission. Organize and re-organize after customers. REALLY busy and hectic from Black Friday to after New Years.
good,Sears has many different departments which helps it as a retail store.  Lands End clothes gives it variety and style.  I like to shop at the Friendly Center store.
good,Sears has been a great company to learn and grow up the ranks. I have learned how to best balance work and personal life. The hardest part of this job is working through the times when we have less help. The best part of my job was working with remodels and helping customers and my coworkers.
good,Sears was a great place to work for. Leads were very cooperative and helpful. Nice and friendly environment to work in especially the kids department.
good,"I loved working in my store. It was where I had planned on retiring from. "
good,Be at my station and Pack for 8 hrs or 10 hrs sometimes work sat if they need help  moved  get moved over to shipping area to make unline system to make label's on boxes to to be
good,"I love my job, we have a great network of employees who work here. Work is very busy at all times. I have learned how to prepare and scheudle for a busy work week."
good,Thery have different training programs you can do to learn more about different positions and procedures in the work place. Depending on performance you are able to get promoted on available positions.
good,Sears provided me with an excellent opportunity to learn retail. Understanding the functions of a corporate structure was vital for my need to learn. Everybody on the team was contributing 110% which made it easy to have a great flow in the workplace.
good,The work environment was really lovely amongst the art department. Everybody was respectful and got along great. The job felt unstable the entire time though.
good,The place was great.  I could never leave.  But it is time to say my farewells.  The management was awesome.  The pay could have been better but the people made it better.
good,While I enjoyed my time working at Sears they were in the middle of closing a few stores and it made me nervous for my job security. they often didn't give increase for pay during review times made me look other places for employment.
good,Après dix année de travail  je voulais prendre ma retraite et je me suis révisé . Retourné travailler à temps partiel près de chez moi . Je me considère comme une  employée exemplaire .
good,"There was always something to do, but no one in the store. Could get boring but the days usually went by really fast. Everyone was super nice and we all worked together to make the day easier and more fun."
good,"A typical day, started with a  green light as soon as you entered the building."
good,I have a long history with this retailer. I think they used to be the premier place to learn sales techniques and get comprehensive job training. I miss the friends I made with this corporation.  Sadly I think they struggle with this modern economy and have let quality slip and training is now almost non-existent!
good,A place where you can consistently learn and earn money. Management is understanding and wants you to get things done. A good place to achieve sales goals.
good,"L'équipe de travail était magnifique. J'ai adoré travailler là. Par contre, côté salaire c'est très mauvais. Salaire minimum à vie, à moins de négocier et quasiment démissionner.  Aucune reconnaissance de la part de la direction pour les gens qui travaillent très fort"
good,store was very slow paced. Management was very poor on conducting adset and maintaing store cleanliness . systems are very out of date and always crash on a regular basis .
good,Sears is a great place of employment for people currently in school. being open weekends and mildly late at night allows student to take a full class schedule and still maintain a decent income. the commission sales positions are also a great opportunity for students to earn a little more than their counter parts may at a normal hourly wage position.
good,"Management tries to keep employees motivated but sometimes it is too little and more than a little lame.  Pay is not very good and raises nonexistent.  Only way to make more money is overtime or move to a department that has higher pay scale.  Like most companies, it is difficult to find which positions pay better."
good,Plenty of training for dedicated individuals.  Always getting new tools and technology to better do our jobs.  Room for advancement to dedicated staff
good,"The workplace is really cool and mellow.The hardest part of the job was convincing customers to apply for 2 different credit cards, knowing they were going to get denied."
good,"Very Good Place To Work,Very Professional.Got To Meet Very Interesting People Also Enjoyed Helping Costumers Find The Right Product For There Needs,Also Enjoyed Customer Resolution With Any Issues That Might Come Up."
good,decent place to work the work is not hard and management is very clear with instructions its a very clean and friendly. i enjoyed my time there
good,"Manager – supervising 4-6 employees"
good,This company is no longer in operation.  But I did enjoy the challenges of photography different groups everyday.  Location inside a mall helped with gaining additional customers.
good,"A typical day was setting up repair appointment for customers . Working along with  technicians to assure arrival of appointment, Selling appliance warranties"
good,I don't understand why I have to write a review of this a company. This was so long ago. It was a good experience as far as I can remember. No immediate complaints come to mind.
good,"Great place to work, great coworkers, fun atmosphere. Sears is what you make it. If you want a career then you can have a career."
good,"Great place to work, great coworkers, fun atmosphere. Sears is what you make it. If you want a career then you can have a career."

good,"Great place to work, great coworkers, fun atmosphere. Sears is what you make it. If you want a career then you can have a career."
good,Sears was a great high school job which trained me a lot about customer service and retail. This job had great guidance and team environments with a well rounded community.
good,"sears was a fun and great place to learn and gather experience."
good,"At the time of me working at Sears Roebuck and Co. I had an eventful and exciting learning experience. The biggest problem was scheduling and the service experience customer got when they walked in. Never were they proper, polite, and courteous. What I learned from there was about Automotive and the amount of work that they taught and how many different key components there were to make a car run. Hardest part was all the heavy lifting and keeping up with service requirements due to the high volume of customers who came in to have the vehicle serviced. The most enjoyable part was getting to know, grow, and learn from the seasoned technicians about how certain components to a vehicle work and how to service them."
good,"There was a very diversified workplace environment with lots of room for advancement and self-improvement. The company was very supportive of its staff, which were a pleasure to work with."
good,The most enjoyable part about the job is the  Automotive Service is located at the mall.   at break time we get to walk through the mall with our uniform on letting the people know we work a job.
good,They offer a non judge mental environment for all types of people. A typical day at work can be fast paced or slow paced depending on the call volume. The opportunity to grow with in the company is always there.
good,i would recommend someone to work for sears they will show so much hospitality if you dont understand something they will make sure you understand it to your best ability
good,"The work environment at Sears can be a bit slow paced, as it is not as popular as the bigger departments (J.C Penney, Macy's. etc.) and you can feel bored quite often. Would not recommend working here if you are looking for a retail job."
good,"Great opportunity to work with people and acquire experience on different areas. It is the type of job that will help you on the development of floor duties, customer service, storage, among others."
good,Great place to work and grow.   Many different options to develop yourself and teammates.   Meet and help many different people.   Challenging a times but rewarding
good,"This workplace needs to be improved for many reasons from efficiency to inaccuracy. I could turn the shipping department into a much better place to work and improve the process, no one there has any motivation to change the old ways although they have recently changed a great deal of their system."
good,I was an ok job nothing fantastic. I think they should have younger Team leads the older ones are very rude and don't care about a thing. Only upside was the cafeteria and the lounge room
good,Sears Technical Assistance Company has been sold off to a as of yet unknown buyer so we are all concerned for our future there.
good,was a good place to work always was worried the store was closing then it did. Was working with s great group of people.  I enjoyed my time working there.
good,Enjoyed working there as a consultant. Worked multiple times for the same client. Worked on several projects with multiple business lines and learned some new tools while working for this client.
good,Company has amazing history of innovation. Company has outstanding brands that are well respected in the broad market. Building the same brand strength in other business units is important to sustained growth.
good,I liked this job but the pay was low. The location that I worked at is actually no longer in business. I only left for more pay and better opportunities.
good,Interacting with customers is what I enjoyed the most. My co-workers we're friendly. Management was very poor. I made it look easier than what it was. I learned more about backrooms and how they work. Also help me learned how to handle on line shipping.
good,"Sears is a great place to work. Great people,  but not so good pay or hours to give out.  I worked in receiving for a little while and had to do so much stuff for just $8.25. For example,  stand out in the rain/cold/heat for some periods of time, lift things that are roughly 500 lbs."
good,"Delivering and installing for SEARS isn't a bad job. The work becomes repetitious and there is a lot to learn in the field of appliance installation. The only downside to this position was the uncertainty of work hours. It is known what time to be at the warehouse, but there is no telling what time you'll get off due to how difficult a stop may or may have not been. Having a young child at home I need a job with set hours where I can still make ends meet. While the pay is decent here I need better hours."
good,"My team, the Kenmore, Craftsman and DieHard business unit, is charged with all of the products sold by those iconic brands. It has been extremely rewarding working with the product managers and engineers who create these great products."
good,I don't have a lot to say due to the fact that my employment was brief.  I worked in the cage got to deal with different managers from other departments.
good,Working at Sears as a customer service adviser taught me a lot of things that I didn't already know when I first started working there. It taught me how to run a cash register and how to interact with customers in a positive way.
good,"Overall, my experience with he company was .. ok. The management was great, but the pressure from maintaining sale quotas and lack of any raises whatsoever makes this place a dead-end. So, a good place to start working, but don't make a career out of it unless you can flee to the corporate jobs."
good,A typical day at work consisted of monitoring the camera activity for the store in order to reduce theft.  I also walked the sales floor looking for suspicious activity.  Worked well with the sales and security staff.  The hardest part of the job was being the only security person expected to apprehend shoplifters.  That was actually a bit frightening at times.  I did enjoy the fact that I was not limited to any one location throughout the store.
good,"How to treat costumers and how to work in SEARS          "
good,"Sears is a nice and fun company to work for. If you are a full time employee, then you have the options for advancement. Its hard to get full time because the employees stay for a very long time and love their job."
good,Working in retail is an art. Your customer service skills always come into play. The customer is almost always correct. Patience and tolerance are at a premium.
good,It was fun being able to interact with the customers everyday.  The hardest part of the job was no one willing to be a team to get the store together.
good,"i did ad set up, merchandising per company directives, customer service, follow team instructions and examples, not difficult work but i enjoyed it"
good,Sears had a lot of great ideas just failed to execute these ideas effectively......................Had to leave there is no job security there anymore
good,"I maintain and repair appliances, keep track of inventory meet new people every day. My days are full and fast paced. I learned a different aspect of electronics with appliances."
good,"Aprendes cosas nuevas, pero el sueldo es un poco bajo, no todo es felicidad."
good,"Lots of creative freedom and idea sharing. Great group of people to work with, full of knowledge and very helpful. It always feels like we're all on the same team!"
good,"Driven to customer resident , to repair their appliance"
good,"Loved my job. Typical day was just working at the cashier or helped making sales. Learned a lot working there. Loved the people. It was always relaxing, never stressful."
good,"A typical day at work is never the same. There is never a dull moment. Everyday has it's own exciting challenges. I have learned self discipline and drive while working at Sears. Being strictly commission based has helped in other sales positions that i have held since then.   Management is good  and co workers are very likable. The most enjoyable part of the job has to be the co workers. But overall, it is a great place to work at."
good,first job out of college. the opportunit was for a start up repair center. the management and technical position allowed for personal and financial growth. it also allowed for real world examples of electronics
good,"Needs to be on track always for production team is lack of Man power."
good,Day to day changes. Good pay. Ok coworkers but a bit unorganized. Didn't have to work Sundays but long days. A good job if you are a hard worker. Commission based.
good,"Love to work in this really good work environment.Management is friendly and will give all chances to develop and prove. is near to living place, commute is good."
good,I like the place of employment. Love having interactions with the customers and giving them a wonderful shopping experience.
good,"Dealing with appliances and making appointments for installments and estimates. "
good,"Dealing with customers with their unique situations to resolve the issues through the avenues given, Learning the regular customers so they felt weclomed"
good,You must  be a multitasker in this job. You may be doing office duties one second or ringing a customer the next so if you like having a large knowledge base and making use of several skills at one time this is the place for you.
good,"My experience at Sears is a mixed one. At the Associate Management level I worked under very motivated and very motivating managers. From the store management level on up to corporate things start to fall, apart especially when trying to move up in the company, qualifications for any given position are very seldom considered for promotion."
good,"The starts off slow but there is usually plenty to do and I miss that."
good,"Again, their was an issue that occurred that caused me to get transferred to another department and ultimately my new bosses position was eliminated; therefore so was mine."
good,"Earning potential is there but you must be willing to give up most weekends and all holidays. "
good,"Not a place to seek full-time hours when first applied, no matter if posted on their front door, looking for full-time employee, get part-time hours only."
good,"I enjoy my job and co-workers, boss is awesome to work for. My day starts at 6:30 in the morning until 3. There is a lot of downtime so need to keep busy."
good,"I have been working for Sears since 2013 ,I got a great exposure  in "
good,Its retail and in a mall but overall management is great.  I would still be there if my position was not elimated.  I was offered another position but it was less money and that was not within my budget
good,"Over all I enjoyed working there, every one worked together, minimal drama! Every day we could count our cash drawer and go to a register. When we were not busy we hung clothes up that were returned, somebody changed their mind etc. At the end of the night we counted our drawers down cleaned our areans and made our deposits."
good,Great place to work.   Mainly on my own.  Manager and salesmen were usually on calls.  There were super to work for. Met a lot of new people as we had storage facilities too and many came in to check on their items or pay bill.
good,I learned how to deal with customers since it was a retail job. The management was good and very helpful at times. The work environment wasn't so bad it just got crowded during holidays which caused some stress. A work day varies in customer service so I was ready for the unexpected.
good,"It was a small store ,great customers . To much drama . Didn't matter how good you do your job if you didn't kiss up to managers you didn't move up!"
good,"A typical day of work was a slow 4 hour shift. The management team was pretty nice however, Some would bend the rules for a few. I enjoy spending time with my coworkers. We really did create a pretty close bond."
good,"Sears is  a struggling company who cant seem to find their way back. Daily policies are changing, removed and there doesn't seem to be any direction within the company"
good,Picked the job up for extra holiday cash. I ended up staying on for a longer period of time. All in all the time there was workable. The most difficult part about the job was was dealing with the irate customer who purchased merchandise online and wanted to blame you as the in store sales person.
good,"Assisting customers with merchandise such as size, color or brand names. Online orders and shipping details on furniture. Rung up purchases calculating and doing basic math on purchases as well as bagging."
good,Good company to work for. Competitive pay and during my time there they worked with us to balance home and family life. I enjoyed my experience with this company.
good,"Big learning curve for me. First job after high school plus going to school full time. Stayed 2 years here until I decided school was going to by my number one priority.  Administrative assistant/runner, faxing, filing, general office duties."
good,"learned alot about appliances and was a good job during college because they worked around my schedule. Good environment, strict but a fun environment to work at"
good,"There were days when it would be busy, other days slow but it was a good workplace. Needs more teamwork in the workplace. Co-workers need to get along with new hires"
good,"Coworkers were kind hardworking individuals looking out for each other, and each trying to get through the day with minimal issues. "
good,"Sears is a great work experience, however the pay is not great.  They hire a lot of part time associates so that they do not have to provide you with benefits,  They also like to add more work with as little hours as possible. I have been able to do what they ask of me however, it is quite the challenge."
good,Sears is a place where members always come first and through our values we strive for operational excellence while driving profitable sales. I have learned through the years how to weigh out tough situations and make a decision that is both right for the member and the profitability of the business unit. Sears is a great place to get to know your co-workers and build strong relationships. The most enjoyable part of my job is watching the member smile with satisfaction that we have given them the best in-store experience possible from start to finish.
good,"Sears, carries every appliance brand. If your looking for a new appliance for a good price sears is the place to go. Sears has many different types of stores (Appliance and hardware, appliance showrooms, and outlets)"
good,I made sure that the customers needs are taking care of by providing excellent customer service.Assist other coworkers with projects when needed.
good,"Work would typically be for 4 hours per day.  I would photograph subjects and digitally enhance photos.  I would then guide the customers out to a sales table where they would select the poses that they wanted to purchase along with the sizes of the portraits.  Once they were finished with this process, I would then proceed to the register to have them finalize their purchase of the portraits that they had chosen.  My manager was very helpful and a wonderful guide.  She always made sure that we knew about everything and that if we needed additional training, she would take us aside and walk us through the process.  All of my co-workers stayed busy and would help each other out if help was needed.  The hardest part of my job was to capture moments with infants that were tired and cranky.  There were also many times that we were experiencing down times and trying to drum up business.  The best part of that job was the people and capturing beautiful photos of our subjects.  The families were so appreciative of all of our efforts."
good,Sears is a company that struggles when it comes to management and how they run things. Other than that however I enjoyed my time as an employee and felt that it was a good job to have.
good,I have enjoyed my time with this company I have grown very close with my manger and coworkers. I feel part of a team going into work and know that I have the support of everyone in all my tasks. I have learned many new skills.
good,"A typical day at work entailed operating the cash register, greeting and assisting customers, preparing for sales, keeping the department tidy and clean, and providing a positive shopping experience for the customers."
good,A nice place to work at with a high focus on metrics. Time spent working alone was very high and management was mostly seen only when required.
good,I got promoted 3 times in 2 years. I like the fact they offered unlimited overtime during the spring and summer time. Around the Fall/ Winter holidays it get slow and cut hours down to 15 to 20 hours a week.
good,"Sears Parts Direct is a generally okay place to work if you have any experience with mechanical devices like lawn mowers, washer/dryers, blowers, or lawn and garden equipment. Granted, the job doesn't pay more and there's no room for advancement but the management is great."
good,"While working at Sears I have learned many trades. For example, I have learned to work well with others, as well as time management. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with customers. The customers allow for different goals to be met or challenges to accomplish each day. My co-workers helped me learn to rely on others for help while also teaching me to work hard for the success of our work team."
good,"management was very nice and easy to work with. When needed they helped out. However, there was a lack of organzation in areas such as scheduling and task mangement. Sometimes we were over staffed and other times we were under staffed."
good,"An average day was pretty basic for retail. Meet metrics, coach the team, and make sure the customers are happy. Depending on when it was in the month, you might have planograms to set, or stock to move out, but your primary concern was customer service. I learned a great deal about selling techniques, management styles, and customer service while I worked there. The majority of the people I worked with were very straight-forward, honest, hard-working people, and were always kind to one another. The hardest part of my job was dealing with upper management in the store. Although I was ""technically"" a manager, I was not allowed to do my job and manage my team. This was due in no small part to my direct manager, the store Operations manager. Any time I attempted to use my authority to affect positive metrics for the store, my decision was vetoed by the Operations manager."
good,too many changes going on with the stores going smaller.  They treated the employees very good and had  coverage.  depth were covered at least with 4 people.  Had a good training program
good,"très belle emploi, très belle clientèle, emploi que tout les gens pourrais aimer."
good,"The job was good. It started out as minimum wage, but flexible hours. Good for college students. I enjoyed working here."
good,Kmart has always been a good company to work for. Strong Values on Customer relations and always trying to improve for a better shopping experience.
good,2-3 appointments daily.  Lots of driving.  Very competitive with fellow co-workers.  Positive company meetings 2 times a week.  Hardest part is that it is commission only.
good,I had new outlook on technical support it wasn't has easy has I thought but you learn new things everyday it was amazing experience
good,my typical day at work is like loading furnitures and appliances on the truck and securing them properly and learning to deliver them to the correct addresses. Getting the delivery on a timely manner was very important.
good,The climate and culture at Sears has changed dramatically over the years and their ability to bring in customers has declined.
good,Bon travail d`été. Beaucoup de rencontre avec les clients.
good,I had the pleasure of working closely with the store management on various projects and given my years of experience in retail  I was assigned to work either independently or on the different teams. Seldom were my days typical. I would be asked to help with signing one day and hardlines  set-up the next.  The hardest part of the job was not completing an assignment before the end of my shift. The best part was finishing it.
good,"Good Management, busy in the office. Hardest part is not enough hours for their employees."
good,"A typical day at Sears is eventful, challenging and fun."
good,Involve din Design and Development. Great Team to work with. Excellent work environment and opportunity to grow. Fun place to work
good,"Daily activities were very easy for me. I loved what I was doing. Being able to help customers find the products they want, and doing everything I can to get them the best deals possible..."
good,Customer Oriented and rewarding when customers are content and satisfied with services rendered. Sometime challenging with regards disgruntled customers with defective products.
good,We had a great team in my job.  Loyal employees.  Work life balance was great.   Job security due to the current state of Sears was always difficult.
good,When I worked for Sears in the 1990's they had a very good upper management team that specialized in product lines. Sears had a good benefits package for hourly employees. It was a good experience.
good,This was one of my favorite jobs.  There was no room for advancement though.   Co workers were great.  Had a good amount of external theft that kept us busy.
good,Learned so much working here and got along with all the other technicians. You get to experience working on all types of different vehicles and foreign cars. It's hard work but if you love working on cars its a great place to work.
good,I wouldn't even be looking for another job right now if it were not for the lack of hours and underlying fear that our store will be the next one to close. Work is fun. The environment is very friendly and so are the co-workers. Everyone is down for everyone. There is always a helping hand if it is needed.
good,I find this workplace to have a good management team that cares about the employees' well-being. Frequently have events for employees such as pizza parties and potlucks.
good,In the beginning it was great but towards the end it started getting bad. Business was taking a hit in the area. If business would've stayed good it would've been good still.
good,"have a good team at work that get things done everyday, so im happy to go work with the team, i love the people that work there, wonderful management team"
good,"The job was pretty easy.  A typical day at work involved me placing sale signs and completing computer training."
good,"I did enjoy working there, I was constantly learning, they always gave good constructive criticism and offered many opportunities for advancement."
good,Sears was a great company to be part of IT for many years but unfortunately that is no longer the case with the possible exception of the infrastructure group.
good,"monter les ventes, vérifier le réapprovisionnement du rayon."
good,"Core values where not follower from the time that Sears lead in retail.  Did not take care of the customer.  Never aspirated to keep the core customer.  Customer expatiations, service, value, customer relations and appreciation fell shore."
good,This was my first job during high school. It was fun and they worked around your school schedule. Meet a lot of great people over the years with sears
good,"Overall, its a good company to work for temporarily. A typical day at work includes long lines ,exhaustion and managers constantly on you about credits. What I learned from working there is you gotta have patience and not take your work home. Management is a bit lazy when it comes to customer satisfaction which makes us employees look bad. My co-workers are pleasant,some are,while others arent as much friendly. The hardest part of  my job is hitting the credit goal. The most enjoyable part when theres downtime and conversing customers,and helping."
good,Sears started off to be a good job. It would be a great first job for anyone willing to gain some work experience.  It has changed a bit since I started working for them in 2012 but it's still a great place to start.
good,Needs to foresee a better future for company to hold up longer. Coworkers all work well with completion of work but company lacks helping employees with  safe job guarantee.
good,I sold appliances.  Enjoyed working with customers and giving them as much information as possible to help them make an informed decision on their purchases. The co-workers all worked together and helped each other to make the sale.
good,"Al entrar hay una junta diaria donde nos informan sobre las ventas del día anterior, y el objetivo de ventas del día. Todos los días se aprende algo nuevo incluso de los clientes. gerente de ventas nos da las promociones de la semana o del mes. con mis compañeros hay una competencia respetuosa, y a la vez no es perfecta. No es una empresa perfecta, tiene buenas políticas pero quienes se encargan de ejercerlas no lo hacen de una manera perfecta y a veces el empleado sale afectado."
good,"Assist supervisor with daily assignment and work delegation, train new hire with receiving and distribution of merchandise, track inventory"
good,The workers and staff at Sears were very helpful and helped me with any problems that i had. It was a nice environment and i would go back any day.
good,"Working for the company is nice. I've learned that you have to have a great sense of humor and patience dealing with the public on daily basis. The management is great as well as my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is not being able to satisfy everyone to there extent. The most enjoyable part is meeting new friends and watching some walk away with a smile on there face, knowing you have satisfied another customer."
good,Managed on average 30-40 associates.  Interacted with customers for start to finish of shifts.  Multi tasking all day every day.  Loved the associates I worked with
good,"Duties would include cutting foam, folding boxes, cleaning, helping out where help is needed. Sometimes work hours would be cut short due to less product in the facility"
good,I enjoyed my time at sears. I was very rewarding to have the experience I received from them. If they ever came back I would go back to them.
good,some months they had employee day and there was bbq and some activitys but you had to pay. and the working there wasn't great. you were to get paid for different job you did and I never got paid for it. and didn't get a rese. so not but when I got preganant I got mat leave
good,almost no room for advancement. poor training by the upper management. supportive coworkers. can be a fun place to work if you are good at pushing things on customers. way to focused on metrics and less on satisfying customers.
good,"It was an often understaffed, and stressful workplace.  However, management was exceptionally good at hiring amazing people who were a pleasure to work with. The ease to which we all came together is why I stayed. I ultimately left because I was my position made minimum wage and I was continuously scheduled 6-10 hours a week - which I could not live off of."
good,I had a good time working here with the management provided. There are many areas to cover with CCTV. Very friendly environment.
good,Had a great LP Manager.  Wages were low in comparison to other markets.  Nice friendly people. Needed better surveillance equipment...
good,"Excellent company to learn appliance repair. Unfortunately, the balance between work/life is lacking. The routing of a tech during the day is out of control of the tech and does not lend itself to proper work/life balance."
good,Started and ended the day with a meeting a recab of your day. Where assigned to an area to own as your own and become knowledgeable on all products. Being in customer service has its challenges however staff worked together to give the best possible outcome. We where encouraged to market the Sears or Sears MasterCard and rewarded if a certain number sold. Over all a good place to work.
good,"une journée typique:"
good,Sears is one of the oldest retail companies in the united states. I worked as sales associate and prepare merchandise repair orders
good,plenty of opportunities to talk to customers and assist them. predictable hours and flexible schedule as well. wide variety of tasks to tackle.
good,"although there is a lot of down time the customers and staff are great"
good,"never know whats going to happen."
good,"light house keeping . take to DR appointments ,cooked meals.played games like cards and checkers. my supervisor  was helpful and understanding and gave all the tools was needed for the job."
good,"Une journée typique pour moi c'est d'avoir pu aider et donner le meilleur service aux client."
good,much drive time with jobs in multiple counties.  front line associate in handling customer's needs and concerns.  rewarding interactions with customers who appreciated one's hard work and attention to details.
good,Only 2 people can work at a time. Really busy. Management is not helpful. High expectations for only certain amount people that are allowed to work.
good,Enjoyed going to work everyday.  Management staff was great.  Everyday I was presented with a new challenge which kept me constantly learning.
good,"management doesn't take care of employees and put them in the best position to succeed, flexible hours, compensation isn't great. very metrics driven"
good,"An excellent place to grow and develop your customer service, teamwork, and organizational skills."
good,I enjoyed working in a department store.  I marked down prices on clothing.  I set up displays.  I ran the cash register to help check out customers.
good,I think my time at Sears help me mostly by working with others and dealing with all types of customers. Being in management there really fine tuned my communication skills and scheduling/planning skills.
good,the company takes there time to educate there employees and educate them for better knowledge and customer service. fun working environment. good fair people.
good,"Llego a las 11:00 am, checo entrada en la computadora, si esta llegando mercancía, ayudo a descargar, y si ya había mercancía en el almacén, me pongo a escanearla y acabando de escanearla, enviarla a piso para su venta."
good,"The people I worked with were team workers."
good,Very fast paced job. Built a great team who embrace the Culture of the Company.This is a high traffic store. Great location.
good,Talking to the customers over the phone to help them with their orders. Just knowing that I was able to help is what made my job enjoyable
good,I have been wiht this company for almost 13 years and it has treated me well. Commision based job always motivated me to perform at very high standards. It has helped me get through college and support my family.
good,"They are a great company, although the store i worked at didn't really get a lot of business, the people there are great.  They work around your time."
good,"Worked with a lot of great people, had fun with the job that I was doing, and i enjoyed interacting with the customers on a day to day basis."
good,"While there may be bumps in the overall company structure, our team works together as just that.  We have a manager that is knowledgeable, helpful, and fair, in addition to having a wonderful personality.  It is a pleasure to work under such a decent leader."
good,I learned a lot about men's clothing working in the men's department. I was able to almost guess a mans Levi's jeans size just by looking at them. I had one of the best managers that was over seeing my department. I miss working here.
good,"cuando un trabajador inicia es muy tenso el trabajo, hay compañeros que no facilitan las cosas, son pocos amables , no les gusta trabajar en equipo"
good,Was given the freedom to implement no programs and procedures that affected the bottom line of hospital revenue.  Great working environment.
good,"un dia normal inicia con buena cara con los buenos dias. con el transcurso el desempeño del trabajo se ve mucha tranquilidad en la central, ambiente perfeto con el personal, la parte dificil es cuando ocurre una problematica dentro del trabajo hay quienes mezclan lo personal con lo laboral y es cuando se tiene que lidiar con proteger tu actitud. Despues viene la comida cuando todos convivimos un poco mas y platicamos nuestras dudas, etc. un momento de relajacion."
good,des appels sortants toute la journée pour offrir des contrats de maintenance. c'est répétitif mais un environnent dynamique
good,"It was a really enjoyable work, I learned to distribute the merchandise in the store, we worked really well in teams helping each other, I liked working with clothes and put them in the shop, we fixed all the merchandise in one day."
good,"My typical day at work at Sears was scanning incoming parcels/merchandise for customer pick-up.  Also doing the morning report (daily sales) and opening the tills.  Preparing the counter for display, etc.  Serving customers and helping them purchase items from catalogue and on-line. Performing cash/debit transactions with customers and credit card purchases and returns.  Answering switchboard and telephone inquiries from outside customers and other Sears stores.  Internal calls from staff and taking deposits for night deposit and preparing store for closing.  Closing till and preparing to close the counter at store closing.  Closing till and taking all deposits for the night deposit."
good,i gained a lot of business sense from sears operating a variety of different businesses under one roof.IT TAUGHT ME PEOPLE RELATIONS WITHIN A MEGA STORE FORMAT.
good,"A typical day of work consisted of coming in early in the morning and unloading the trucks bringing new inventory within a 10 minute period. After unloading we were to then organize and move the new inventory to the proper locations, bin them, and take inventory with our SNC devices. For clothing, we'd have to unbox, unbag, hang and tag the items. This was my first time in a job and I learned what it was like, and how cutthroat some of the job can be. I was partnered with a coworker and we were a team for unboxing shoes and clothes, and we'd get through 5-8 pallets a day, depending on what kind of clothes we were doing. The hardest part of the job was having another team claim we were doing any work, so management installed cameras above both teams to see if they are doing work. The most enjoyable part, I'd say, was the actual work (not so much just unboxing, but actually working). I enjoy working, and I enjoy working hard even more."
good,Review of sears outlet is great and also helping me with experience for future employment to help me gain the needs for better opportunity's..
good,"Mucha carga de trabajo, aprendí muchos aspectos médicos, mi relación es muy buena con compañeros de trabajo y jefes."
good,Great company to work for many perks. Perfect place to start. Fun work place with supportive management. There was a lot of variety in what I did each day.
good,Sears was an amazing opportunity for me as a first job. I had the best coworkers. There was an equal balance of rude and sweet customers. This opportunity helped me grow as a person as well as within the company and learn various positions.
good,"Sears is a friendly place to work. We love to smile and help our customers with their everyday needs.Lots of ways to earn more money by signing up customers to apply for a credit card, accident free days earns us a barbecue!!! For me a typical day would to make announcements for whats on sale, to show items to customers and help them with their decisions on what to purchase. Our store manager is awesome! He makes us wants to reach higher on our goals. The worker do teamwork and when they finish their tasks they go help others."
good,"Friendly environment, top at store process education. A typical work day includes straightening the store, customer service, changing prices, setting up displays, and putting out stock. Co-workers are friendly and most time helpful. Some great managers and some not so good. The hardest part was working hard in the heat (air conditioning broken). I liked working steady so that the time goes by quickly."
good,"Sears is a friendly place to work. We love to smile and help our customers with their everyday needs.Lots of ways to earn more money by signing up customers to apply for a credit card, accident free days earns us a barbecue!!!  For me a typical day would to make announcements for whats on sale, to show items to customers and help them with their decisions on what to purchase. Our store manager is awesome! He makes us wants to reach higher on our goals. The worker do teamwork and when they finish their tasks they go help others. My personal enjoyable part of my job is that I get to meet so many wonderful people from all over the world!!"
good,The best part of sears is the highly comfortable and fun environment that the managers provide. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know all my coworkers and learning so much more from senior management.
good,"My own personal experience and review is impertinent to the idea of myself looking for better opportunities.  I can do better with what I have; I have no need to leave anytime soon but with my colleagues doing so and I am just as much a candidate or better to proceed in any career, I have no reason to not explore other endeavors."
good,"It was a fun place to work, supportive managers and colleagues.  The hardest part of the job was the long busy hours during the Christmas season."
good,The people i work with are a great team. We work well as a team but are able to work on our own.The managers are easy to talk to and are there for you if needed
good,"My job was great, easy to do, and I enjoyed interacting with new people every day. However, the other employees were constantly calling out and making everyone else suffer for their actions."
good,"A great staff, worked well together.  Learned many useful selling tools.  Management was hands on and always there to back you up."
good,Up beat environment. Great customer satisfaction. Always something to do. Working in tools always provides extra learning experience.
good,Ringing up customer's purchases is what makes up most of the day.  Also I try to get customers to sign up for a credit card so that the customer and the company can save money.  The co-workers are fun to work with and the environment is very easy-going.  The hardest part is finding something to do to fill the time between ringing up customers.
good,Enjoyed the work environment because of the people I worked with and the management staff. Everyone was sincerely nice.
good,good place to work but needed structure always something to do left you to do your work didnt micro manage you hours were good worked every other weekened fun people to work with
good,"When I first get into work I check to see if there are any signs that need to be printed.  I then sort the mail and reports for the day and go to the cash room to process the previous days money.  After the deposit slips are written I then enter the data onto the R&D report and the Over and Short report for the previous day.  Check the safe for accuracy, supply change for registers, verify credit apps., and if necessary hunt for missing money and or paperwork.  After the cash room is done I would go to the HR manager and see what needs to be done.  Some of the things I would do is make phone calls, sort and file, get signatures when needed from employees,  and if there was a project I would assist in that.  My co-workers for the most part are hard working individuals.  The hardest part of the job is if I'm on my feet for more than 5 hours.  But I do enjoy all the aspects of my job."
good,"How to handle multi line phones. Dispatch service techs. Clear service techs routes in computer. "
good,"I was with the company for many years and I did many different jobs within the company.  When I left I left Sears I was a store manager and liked what I did.  I like working with my teams, development of staff and store staff.  I was a great company when I was with them."
good,"I enjoyed working with Sears, but when the seasonal hiring ended, I was released even though they told me I did a great job for them. It seems that they were selling me a lie, since they didn't re-hire me or call when a new position opened up. even after I showed interest in getting re-hired in the future."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Sears!  They treated their employees well, the pay was decent and the staff was nice.  The only reason I left was because I was relocating."
good,"I liked the people and the management, I sold protection plans for appliances. The only thing that bothered me was that sometimes management didn't talk with one another."
good,Best training I've ever had for any position. The company makes sure they maintain training of all positions on a monthly basis.
good,"it used to be great, but now sales are drastically declining. the flow of traffic has greatly decreased. We used to have hundreds of customers in electronics alone, and now there is a max of about 15 per shift. "
good,Making sure that the customers were taking care of in a timely manner.I learned how to listen to employees issues and take actions to their needs .The hardest part of the job was making sure that all the customers were completely happy.The most enjoyable part of the job was joking around with the employees and customers that they have a great day.
good,My job in sears was basically as a data ingestion engineer. So it was always new and enjoyable working there. Co-workers were fantastic in supporting me. The management was really co-operative with us and and very friendly
good,I enjoy working at Sears because everyone there is helpfully and understand my school schedule. Everyone is nice and understanding
good,Company will most probably go down if it is not acquired soon enough. People were good though. Keep hearing about bad customer experience all the time.

good,Liked working for the company. Had to leave due to my daughter being born. I loved my coworkers that I had there. The main supervisors on the floor were kind and friendly. I didn't really care for the head people in charge there. The seem like they do care about the employes at all.
good,"Replenishment / Floor Associate"
good,A great place to work and a lot of really good people to work with. Great bonus structure that made up for pay. Management was easy to approach and were very opened minded as far as helping make everyone successful.
good,Job roles were straight forward.  The coworkers were very nice and courteous.  It was a fun first job were I learned responsibility.
good,I love pushing and challenging myself every day. I work around great supportive people. I learned how to provide empathy to members.
good,Sears was a good place to work. My co-workers were wonderful to work with  I never had any altercations with fellow co-workers or customers. The hardest part would be dealing with a shift alone because my department had to not only handle our duties but also help other departments so it could get overwhelming.
good,"My first job straight out of high school. I enjoyed working with the visual team in the Landsend Company. The only thing that was wrong with this job was management.Beginning in 2008 until 2010 management came and left. I had 3 different department managers, 4 different store managers, and 3 different department leaves. I just didnt like that there was not a steady team for me to work with."
good,"aprendi el uso de la caja, el manejo de efectivo tanto moneda nacional como extranjera "
good,I enjoyed working with the other staff and customers at Sears.  I learned a lot about all the items in the hardware department while at this job.
good,Always something to do when you work in such a big store. The hardest part was getting people to get the SEARS credit card because most people don't want more credit cards. My co-workers and boss were very nice.
good,"the season I worked was very different. the hours kept getting longer every week, due to the season starting. the staff was great and I never had a problem with any of the managers."
good,I have not been working there for two months now but I gained a lot of experiences when it came to how to give good customer services. Working in their human resources department gave me a lot of confidence and skills that I can apply anywhere I go.
good,I learned a lot on customer service and helping to solve customers problems. I always enjoyed going to work.The hardest part of the job was being placed in a variety of departments.
good,"Seasonal job position that taught me valuable loss prevention skills. It was fun while it lasted, though as a seasonal worker I was restricted in what I was allowed to do, which made work stressful."
good,"I had a wonderful experience when i was employed at sears , I must say the 16 1/2 years i was there was much rewarding hated they had to relocate to Winter park Florida."
good,"I worked there for several years and made a lot of money. As time went on in the call center, management began making changes to commission structure which devastated paychecks. Overall not too bad of a company to work for just not as lucrative as it once was."
good,A typical day at work would be a lot of customer interaction.  Not a great deal of interaction with co-workers because at most times it was probably just 1 or 2 working at a time.  Interaction with management was great as they were always both approachable and helpful.
good,"- a typical day was greeting customers and handling customer service issues"
good,"The job involves a lot of monotony, heavy lifting and a very old customer base which means a lot of people who are hard to deal with."
good,I worked with Children ages six weeks to fourteen years. It was a great larning experience and everyone was very caring.
good,"A day at Sears consist of group of employees hanging out waiting for customers. I learned how to do more with less, the lack of organization would stress even the salesman. Management was inly concerned about their bonuses if you were selling protection plans they wouldn't bother you. Co-workers ranged from 16-60 I met a lot of people there some I still keep in contact with nearly ten years later. The hardest part of the job was the lack of a computer system to track inventory. Imagine attempting to sell a tv having no idea whats in stock and what is not. They used a tally sheet that wasn't effective at all. The best part was the money it being commission sales I felt like the harder I worked the more money I made it was easy to get motivated to go to work."
good,Paid my way through college here. Best way to make a lot of money and not waitress.Co workers were great. Very flexible hours.
good,"Working here taught me to watch my back and just do my job and go home.  Most of the employees were a little too close, both at work and afterward."
good,"Loved the time I spent there with some great people. Although merging with Kmart wasn't the best for the way customers viewed the company, it was still a very good place of business."
good,It is a is very busy like most big box retail companies are. Sears good company to work for. Store Manager at the time wasn't every nice. Workers and Management are great to work with.
good,"Working at Sears at Chapel Hills Mall is an interesting experience. I started as a cashier, in which I made minimum wage, which is 8/hr. The amount of work all of the cashiers there do is worth so much more. You get paid $2 for a credit application which they tell you to vigorously push. They have a rewards program which they tell you to sign people up for even if they say no, which is so wrong. Your job is threatened if you don't meet the metrics for the month, especially in their reward program. After I was a cashier, I was moved to mattresses, which is straight commission. it would be fine if more people shopped at sears for a bed. When its slow, the management asks why you haven't sold anything but no customers have walked through the door. The store manager is just awful, and if you try to have corporate's help on anything you're doomed. They hire managers who are so incompetent its absurd, the good staff of Chapel Hills is what makes it worth it, but at the end of the day, Sears does not provide a livable wage for their employees and does not treat them how they deserve."
good,Sears is a great company to work for. when they closed here in Aiken it was very sad bc not only did we all work well together but it felt like we were all one big family and we loved working with our customers on a day to day basis
good,I loved working for sears there where so many tasks to complete and it kept me busy. I worked all around sears in any department I was needed in but mostly in men's wear. it was awesome but men are very messy and the pay was very low. and my manager was not very nice but I helped her out as much as she needed
good,Working for Loss Prevention was a great job got to meet new people and work with the law. Great place to work if you want to be on your feet all day!
good,This company I was with for almost 2 years. All the co workers and management were great. I learned so much and was even promoted twice based on how quick I learned and the quality of my skills. I provided support the service technicians that were on the road. The first promotion allowed me to adjust their route accordingly and make decisions based on schedules. A few months before leaving the company I started to create the all the technicians routes using a specific computer program. I was able to give them a good route based on where they live and the type of service they do while getting all customer service calls scheduled.
good,"Good place to work and productive environment"
good,During the week was always slow but can always keep yourself busy doing other things like cleaning. Cashiers were treated well have nothing bad to say.

good,started at this company doing customer service. Moved into the route monitor loved doing that. Then they moved it out of state

good,each day in retail is an adventure. solving the different problems from day to day was interesting and made the job fun. dealing with a variety of people and issues was interesting as well family time was short however.
good,"Everything is extremely dependent on your manager and his/her expectations. I was lucky that my manager truly believed in work/life balance. However, because of the state of the company, many jobs are being cut and many people are leaving and not being replaced. As a result of this, many people are being overworked and expected to work 40+ hours a week. "

good,worked in the mall so traffic was a little better. but it can slow down just like all sales job. good commission rate. latest tvs as well as tablets.
good,"The people are the best people to work with."

good,"I enjoy working at Sears. I enjoy being able to help people. I enjoy working in customer service and with the public. It is an easy going job. The people I work with are very friendly, which makes the job easier."
good,"This was a great first job for somebody that wants to be in retail/sales.  The pay was not great, but it gave me a good inside to how a business runs since this was a small dealer store."
good,Great job to have but not very busy at all. No job security given the state that this company is in. Management could be a little over-bearing but for the most part was very understanding about your job and duties.
good,"I liked working at Sears. I got the chance to create great garments, and see the item from the beginning to the end. The team that I worked with was great, and we were all very dedicated to creating garments that the customer would love."

good,"Changing out clothing and other multiple departments as it arrived to make it fresh looking and saleable. Helping associates in multiple areas where needed with product knowledge, selling credit, teaching associates how to change out displays, resets, signing, product placement and price changes.

I enjoyed helping out the associates along with the customers."
good,"I loved the environment my managers and co-workers were really fun to be around and it just was an overall great learning experience,\"

good,"My typical work day includes reviewing emails to make sure I capture all email action request for the day, reviewing my six executive calendars to make sure meetings do not override each other.  The Kmart and Sears stores send help ticket requests for actions.  It is my responsbility to route all help tickets out to the different merchant teams to follow-up with our stores.  "
good,"Company sets clear expectations for employees.  Workplace is professional yet can also be balanced with fun and reward."
good,Don't really recall! It was a short and temporary situation over 10 years ago!  Was a pretty solid deal overall though from what I can recall.
good,"When I started working here I was young and It was my first job i was terrible and hated it, I then got to move to the backroom and i loved my management i loved all of the coworkers it gave me a real chance to grow and learn. The pressure wasnt so strong on getting sales and things. There were still things that were required of me of course but it gave me a chance to see management in a whole new light. They were under pressure way more than I was and after working for so long i wanted to do anything i could to help. They had cookouts and team meetings to help everyone get a good bond and great team work. it was my main job and then second job after getting full time somwhere else i worked here for my days ""off"" and it was like a home feeling. It was where i was felt comfortable."

good,some days were busier than others but what kept my mind off all the craziness was helping the customers find the merchandise they were searching for.
good,"I love the people I work with, working at Sears has taught me a lot an allowed me to grow and learn different skills as an individual. Sears encouraged me to try to move up in the store which allowed me to have the confidence I needed in order to be promoted to the managers position I now have. As in any job there are difficult customers, unfortunately you can't please everyone no matter how hard you try. Although the people that I work with as well as many of the members I have keep me happy and this job overall very enjoyable."

good,A typical day would include timely customer service when members came to pick up their merchandise. Lifting and moving 50+ pounds with help if I needed it.  Keeping a clean and organized backroom and stockrooms.  Something I learned was that I may not always like the people I work with but I am able to be nice while at work.

good,Learned a great deal about the logistics industry. Had the chance to work and learn from a great deal of managers.
good,"•A typical day at work"
good,"A day at work could vary depending on if it is a week day or weekend. Of course there is a lot more traffic on the weekends therefore you have better selling opportunities on the weekends. I learned that I am very good at selling and interacting directly with people. Management could have been better, all of the previous managers recently left and new management is in the process of coming in. The previous management was very dishonest with employees which created an uneasy and unhappy environment at times."
good,"A typical day at work included counting money out of 6 registers, Pushing lawn mowers and tractors outside of the building for display, Helping customers find what they are looking for, competing in sales with my co-workers, ringing customers up for purchases, and also restocking shelves to keep products ready to buy for customers. I learned the work environment very quickly, which helped me make sales. Management was very professional and I don't have a negative thing to say about the management from Sears. My co-workers were very competitive, and I really enjoyed that. The hardest part of the job was mainly closing out a sale.

good,"Worked in multiple departments, from Tvs, to lawnmowers, selling products and accessories as well as promoting business and offering credit applications."
good,I was able to create great memories for families for years to come by taking great portraits of families and children. I learned that I have a great creative side to my personality. I was a part of the management team and we all worked together to make our store a million dollar store in sales. My co-workers were great people who came to work with positive energy.

good,"I started off as a part time sale's associate with a great management team and co-workers. Everyone I worked with was willing to help train and show me how to do things the right way and also position myself to move forward in the company. The work hours were flexible and the pay was competitive. Although there were times where help was needed in other parts of the store by associates that didn't work in those area's, everyone worked as a team."
good,"We open the store and take out the mowers. Then, we have to count the drawers and be ready to take payments and for customers that come in. We have to move appliances around in the store and set up for the sales we are having that week. I have learned about customer service and how to keep up with my time and get my work done. Co-workers here are easy to get along with and very helpful with any questions you may need. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to have free time as long as you get your assignments done and take care of customers."

good,the store/company really push the credit card sometimes and it is very hard for some people to get people to apply and it does affect the number of hours a person receives
good,A typical day at Sear consisted of making sure displays f mattresses were up to par and the pricing was correct.

good,"Shipping and recieving. Deliveries and setup. Dusting, cleaning and mopping."
good,"I learned all there is to learn about customer service while working here in the hardware department. I thoroughly enjoyed my job, my co-workers, and management."
good,"A typical workday involves assisting customers, helping them with product selection and additional services, data entry,providing great welcoming customer service with enthusiasm. I have learned how to be an understanding sales consultant and putting myself in customer shoes to help them find a solution for their problem and needs. Management were very supportive and helpful. Co-workers are very friendly and family oriented. Hardest part of the job may have been learning everything that I needed to know to be  a good sales consultant but overall I took my time to learn efficiently to be a good sales man and have great product knowledge. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and building great relationships with co-workers and customers."
good,"Overall Sears is a good company to work for. The management team is understanding, friendly, and very flexable. Management was very easy to talk to, forgiving, and always available. All questions were answered in some fashion promptly and honestly. There was never an ""I don't know"" answer. Asking for more hours was also easy to do and was usually answered with 4-6 more hours weekly, without exceeding 30 hours weekly. Benefits were cheap but the company didn't offer benefits for at least 1 year or 2 years of service. The pay is minimum and depending on where you work sometimes hourly pay was not available only 4% commission. Other than that the store was always slow due to the amount of online shopping and the greater selection offered at the online store. The only busy time of year at this location in the Colonial Park Mall was the holidays and Black Friday. Also the credit card was a hard sell to customers who either have had already been denied, had an account and closed it, already had an account. or ran up the account holiday shopping and were trying to pay the account off."

good,"Prefer working for Sears. Great work environment."
good,Work with customers on a one on one basis to select the right appliances for there needs.
good,Good people Loved Selling jewelry great work environment great discounts.
good,"Assisted rewards members with questions and inquiries  regarding specific programs. Answered contacts in a professional, courteous and helpful manner via telephone"
good,"As a Sales associate my job requirements were to offer and issue credit and rewards cards to customers, answer the phone in my department and answer and customers questions or concerns, maintain clean area, fold clothes, clear and monitor fitting room, offer advice or assistance with clothing."
good,"If your a student, or this is your only option right now, Sears isnt a bad place to be.  Honestly if i could make 50k a year a Sears I might consider going back.  It was simple, organized and fun all in all."
good,"Contrary to what you have likely heard, Sears can be a great place to work. I say 'can be' because it depends on your position and department. If you're a cashier in any department, especially apparel it's just another dead end job. You'll be standing in one place all day, using old technology, dealing with angry customers, trying to get people to sign up for Sears' memberships and credit cards. The only good thing about the credit cards is that you're actually compensated if the customer is approved. The company doesn't have to do this, but they do. Now on the other hand, if you're a consultative sales associate in any of the hard-lines (hardware, appliances, electronics, etc.), this can not only be a great job, but a great environment. It's hard not to make close friends while working in this environment. There is a general interest in your job because the more you sell, the more you make. Sears is one of the last big retail chains that pays their associates commission. This creates a competitive environment which in the long run actually brings people closer. There are a few major negatives about the job though, as is with most jobs. Management is not professional at all (in my experience). I heard about this before taking the job and thought it was just bitter people who got fired, but soon realized it was true. Management usually stays in HR and will actually get mad at you if you call them ""too much"". They want you to absolutely make sure they you can't handle the situation yourself, even though it's not in your job description. There is no customer service, so on top"
good,A typical day at work involves me providing the best service for a customer. Also to make sure they are leaving the store satisfied and to ensure they come back I'm very friendly. I get along with all my co-workers really well they all are very nice.  The best part of this job would be earning the extra initiatives.

My co-workers most of them are awesome, good bunch of people to work with. The hardest part of the job is loading and unloading mattresses, because it is done all manually with a mattress dolly, and some of those king size and electric beds are pretty heavy. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to drive the machines I really like that part the most."

good,You learn new information working at Sears a typical day at work consists of me clocking in on my own personal computer using a special system after that I log into all my favorites I know I will be needing to help assist all my customers who will call in that day. I check my email to get my daily orders sent over to me by a company that will about 75 to 110 orders placed by online shoppers. I print out the orders and start placing the orders at the same time if I get a call I have to assist the customer as well to the best of my ability. After I place each order I have to call the customer to inform them of their delivery date. I repeat this process until I have completed all my orders meanwhile I am receiving issues that need to be solved sometimes in the same day that are sent to me via email as well. I handle those issues and get it back to the managers in the field. I was also giving reports that was due every day the reports are called open because the order hasn't been closed/shipped which I resolved as well. I had to do this everyday and I loved my job I loved helping the customers to the best of ability I had to go above and beyond to help and please the customer and myself. It was a lot of work to be done everyday it was never a dull moment or never a minute that work didn't needed to be done which I loved it made the time go by so much faster I was very busy working at this particular company.

The years I have done this has increased my area of expertise in the sales world. I encounter customers each and every day, teaching them about our products, helping find them the best match for their needs, and establishing great customer based relationships. I have worked hard to exceed my goals each year I have been with the company.  It is a definite pleasure helping people in the capacity I do at Sears and knowing I did my very best in assisting them while also earning great pay in the process!"
good,"I learned a lot at sears while being there for 3 years. I really enjoyed everyday of it, even though it had its ups and downs the people made it easier to work there and made it joyous to be around them.

If there's a customer issue, other managers or I go and help solve the problem. There's nothing in my eyes that is hard about my job. The best part of my job is being able to help customers and being respected by most of my co-workers."
good,You always have something to do.  You interact with a variety of customers.
good,"A typical day at Sears during the weekdays was slow and boring, but in the weekends and holidays the store had double the amount of customers which made me more busier then ever. What I learned was being helpful to customers whenever I can and learn to where to put things in the right spot.

good,A day at work would be like a routine at 6 in the morning I had to stark one task after the next. The manager taught me everything I needed to in order from first to last. It would be cleaning the restrooms first and next emptying all the trashes. Then vacuuming floors and cleaning the fitting rooms. I learned that you can develop different methods of cleaning in a small amount of time. The hardest part was it being so early in the morning and transportation for me was hard.

I developed the ability to communicate with others effectively in my pursuit to convince customers that our pieces of jewelry were of great quality and compared to those of competing companies, but at a discounted price. I also had the responsibility of having to multi-task many responsibilities at once, for instance, reaching sales quota, keeping sales logs, keeping my working area clean and helping any customer who needed assistance not only within the jewelry department, but throughout the store. My energy and commitment to success not only helped raise sales in the jewelry department, but also set a new store record for most positive feedback given to any employee on our store website."

good,Typically on a day to day basis I create the schedule for my associates. I handle any customer service issues and or customer needs through out the store. I am a member of management and so as a team we work hard in order to ensure our associates are armed with enough knowledge to meet metrics.

The hardest part of this job is keeping everyone on the same page as to what the company's goals are and what its mission is.

I am also able to utilize my foreign language skills almost everyday while working here.

I learned how to present products to consumers to make them shopable. I worked with a great team, some more experienced than others so there was always something new to learn. Hardest part of the job was dealing with other employees who were not quite on the same page as you are. I enjoyed learning, learning about product, how its ordered, why its ordered when it is and how to display it to catch the consumers eye."
good,working there at Sears was a nice and peaceful job keeping inventory stocked and nicely displayed.
good,"A dynamic and vigorous experience awaits you at Sears. The training program is constantly under development and is continuous. The corporation is committed to respecting diversity in the workplace, ensuring the safety of staff and customers, and to providing quality of both service and products to the shoppers. If you believe that retail sales is your field, Sears should be a strong choice, especially because there is no ""gimmickry"" in their pricing and commission systems."
good,"Great brands, well known for customer engagement, turn around opportunity."
good,Counting the register and making sure we have enough change through out the day. making sure the area is customer ready. making PA announcements to be able to bring business to our department. Checking daily goals and making sure our training is done. I've learned how to interact with customer in a more professional manner. Learning how to drive sales and meet daily goals. My direct manager is awesome. He is very understanding and helpful when it comes to customer service. My co-workers are fun and really great to work with. The hardest part is the Ipad they've been enforcing us to use. there is a lot of bugs and glitches that need to be fix on the software whoch slows us down a lot. Customers get upset at the fact that its taking so long to ring up a simple transaction.
good,The company was good to work for in the past 7 years. But no advancement to the next level.
good,Good Company and great people to work with. Hourly pay is low but easily increased with good hard work.

good,"Each day felt more like a bonding time period between all of the workers in the backroom.  We all looked out heavily for each other and made each day enjoyable.  I learned many valuable lifting and transportation techniques that could easily help me in future warehouse jobs.  The lead and the store manager were both caring and energetic co-workers that just wanted what was best for the store and would help each other worker achieve that goal.  Sometimes, the items were too heavy or the equipment was faulty, but overall this job wasn't a hard job to enjoy.  The wonderful co-workers from all departments made each day a great day to work there."

good,Worked with store operations to improve store performance
good,selling electronics gave me better people skills. and leadership
good,The only real complaint i had is when working as a commission associate they kept lowering the amount of commission we could earn on each item. This made it harder and harder to keep a steady paycheck.
good,"My primary job at Sears was to ring up a customer's purchases at the cash register. In addition to that, we were to help promote Sears' credit cards, rewards memberships, and donations to local charities. The hardest part of the job was definitely having to help out disgruntled customers. Ironically, the most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with a pleasant customer. My coworkers seemed like very nice people, but unfortunately there was little interaction amongst cashiers."
good,"I had a good time while I volunteered at sears eastgate, I had a few responsibilities that prepared me for a job placement."
good,"I was hired as a cashier, made sales with their credit card line, made sure the customers were happy."
good,"Good. Depends which department you are working in, management also matters."
good,Overall Its an okay work environment. The hardest part of the job I would have to say is meeting some of the sale expectations but they can be met with the right motivation and push my management.
good,"Very busy some days but rewarding. Customers can push your buttons, but that retail."
good,Everyday is routine. Some of the employees was awesome working with and some opposite. I loved working and didnt mind cleaning and sorting clothes. The hardest part was coming to work very early and leaving very late because i was in school. I enjoyed break time the most because i could help in other departments.
good,Work was calm and easy to adapt to. Management was decent but the co-workers made it worth it.
good,"I would not trade my time with Sears for anything.  As a young professional moving to Chicago to pursue career opportunities and build experience, Sears gave me that opportunity and then some.  "
good,"This was my co-op placement when I was in grade 11. I had a great time working here. I was treated as if I really worked there. I booked and cancelled appointments , made phone calls to customers, cleaned the camera room, made photo enhancements, studio outreach, ordering sitting cards in alphabetical and numerical order. I got an hour lunch break. the hardest part of the job was the studio outreach because I had to go into the store and ask people while they were shopping if they would like to book an appointment. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with. They were all older than me but we got along and they were easy to talk to."
good,I love Sears as a company but the department I worked for was bought out and declared bankruptcy.
good,"A typical day at work was to talk to about 80-100+ customers. I would call our loyal Sears customers to renew the protection agreement (insurance) on their appliances. My job was to renew their agreement, and explain to them why it was necessary for them to continue on being protected. I would talk to them about their service history, and how much money they have saved on being protected. "
good,"Working for a Corp such a Sears was pretty challenging at times. Other then dealing with Sears or angry customers it was a pretty good job. I would typically open my store everyday and go through my morning paper work. When that was done i would get the store ready for the day. Through out the day I had daily task's that had to be dealt with. whether it being banking, payroll, helping my associates and customers. There were customers issues that would have to be taken care of. What I took from this job is now what i excel in now. People skills, problem solving, managing and operating a corporation franchise and my associates. Also from this job i learned a great deal on how to train my staff and mold them into great sales associates. The hardest part about being the man in charge so to speak is the abuse you can get from some of the public. Sometimes there not so friendly, but some of the best times i had in my store was my repeat customers, and teaching willing customers about products they wanted to learn about."
good,I learned to do exchanges and returns. how to open and close the cash register. my co-workers are very friendly. management is also very friendly and understanding. The enoyable part of my job is going to work and socializing.
good,I learned a lot and my customer service was a great place to be.  the only issue I had was I never was able to get into full time and the hrs weren't great.  they didn't always work with us either.

I learned a great amount about photography and posing subjects as well as how to approach large sales.

Every customer is different and with different issues that needs to be resolved through our Executive Team. The challenging part of the position is that you have to work with the customers that are very irate in different situation, while remaing calm to come up with a resolution that will best fit the customer and company needs. The most enjoyable part of the position is being able to make your own decsions for the customer going outside the box with minimal supervisor or none at all. Co-workers were a very big part of the company because after so many years they all become family and we all work great together and had fun at the same time, conducting business first to make our customers the first priority before anything else. The management team is always there to help if needed, though majority of the time, they are only there for administrative purposes within the particular department in which I held."
good,The staff and management was more stressful than the customers.
good,Sears gave me an opportunity to be a new manager and try out all of the new things that I had learned at school.

I had to patrol the sales floor at least once an hour and monitor the store through CCTV all with in the same hour. I learned how to file paperwork because it was an important aspect of our job to fill out and submit the proper forms after we apprehended a shoplifter. Management varied, some mangers were very belittling and others were better at communicating but overall the management was average because many of them were not very approachable. My co-workers and I were a great team. From our safety tips the store associates would go hundreds of days without having a work-place accident.

When working with Sears, I learned the value of assisting a customer and working hands-on to ensure quality satisfaction. The hardest part of the job I would say was letting the customer know that a sale had expired. Customers sometime came in and searched for an ad seen on television broadcast and found that it was not in store. The most exciting part of the job was, in fact, working hands on with the people; I loved to meet and greet their various personalities."

I learned most of my work experience from this job seeing as it was my first, and still longest standing, job. Management was not too great and I personally went through several department and store managers all intent on ""doing things right"" which made things a little confusing at times. My co-workers were by far the best part of the job. I personally trained two associates, both of whom later became department managers, but I personally was never promoted regardless of request. Advancement was great for them but non existent for certain others."

Each day is filled with assisting customers with product knowledge about a variety of products. There are also ""household"" tasks to be done every day, from cleaning the department to updating product signage and merchandising to resetting the floor plan. I have learned a lot in my almost 8 years with Sears about dealing with a wide variety of personalities, whether it is customers, co-workers, or management. I've also learned that each day is a special day to learn new things and to improve upon existing things. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to help customers learn about the product and to make a choice on what they are going to purchase as well as the camaraderie between the employees and management."

good,Sears was a good place to work. They employ mostly part-time workers. The management staff are the main full-time workers. You have to push credit card applications and are reviewed if you process less than 20 a week. They are good about giving breaks and 30 minute lunches. They do offer a small employee discount.
good,"A typical day at work is answering phones from sometimes angry people because their appliance that they have paid good money for has failed. My job was first to be sympathetic to thier problems. Try and calm them down and work with them with their schedual and ours to get a tech to them to fix their appliance. The hardest part of my job was to not take it personal. My co-workers were awsome, they actually took up a collection to help me get to Florida. The most enjoyable part of my job was when a customer would call back in, ask for me by name, and say Thank you. And you didn't worry about management if you did your job, you are on time and you keep a smiling face."

good,"I loved starting the day at Sears. We would usually gather around and do a motivational pep talk, including the sales goal for the day. Often held small competitions to win gift cards, coupons to improve employee moral and promote a health competition.  The management was friendly and helpful when it came to training. The most difficult part of the job was looking through back stock for products during holiday rush."
good,"constantly need to file claims for things that are unecessary due to ""corporations standards"". the bathroom is excessively far, and time counting against us,  we get dinged for ""going to the restroom to much."" a typical day at work is receiving about 40 calls of existing customers that need to renew an agreement or are expired. i learn sales techniques, the management is okay, and the workplace culture seems like a joke. they gave one guy $50 for being there for ten years. the most enjoyable part of the job is talking to customers and selling them what they need."
good,Good place to work for good pay good hours. Get a decent amount of time off good people good management. Overall not a bad place to work for. Holiday shut down every year
good,"El jefe directo del area donde labore era ejemplo a seguir, el ambiente laboral con los compañeros era agradable, las ventas bien en temporada navideña, muy pocas oportunidades de crecimiento"
good,"i was responsible for recruitment and selection. the employee documentations and scheduling."
good,I enjoyed my time with Sears and thrived until they closed in 2017. Management changed hands often so that led to frequent schedule changes and late nights.
good,"A decent place to work, but the pay is low and the amount of work is unfair for the pay. I liked my last manager very much. It's not really worth the effort."
good,"Great people to work with, but the continual evolving changes make it at times difficult to see the fruits of one labor.  I believe Sears would be great if the financial circumstance was better."
good,SEARS  buena empresa pero sin sueldo base LOCURA muy buena empresa sueldo
good,It was not a bad place to work. I definitely had a few extra dollars in my pocket during college from sears. Overall it was an easy place to work and a friendly environment.

good,"Repair appliances and sell warranties. Customer"
good,Working at Sears.It was hard work but I loved it. My duties was to load and unload trucks. We had to scan inbound and outbound frieght. The hard part was we never knew when the store was closing. There was a lot of big lay off during my time there. Then it finally closed.

good,A typical day at Sears was on my own pace. Management was sparse and wasn't trained properly. I taught myself on the hand held inventory equipment....
good,Starting abot 8am and ending at about 7pm which made it hard for a family life. I really would like to be able to enjoy time with the family but that was not the plan at Sears.

good,"I have worked at Sears for about 10 years. Moving up from sales in tools, to electronics, to large appliances. Solid compensation for appliance associates, it is commission though, so you have to drive sales. Wouldn’t do any other job there. Cashiers are overworked and underpaid. My personal managers were awesome but higher management is not so great. Work/ life balance kind of sucks because you will probably be working most holidays weekends if you are a top seller. Hated working Black Fridays. All in all, ok experience."
good,"Es un buen lugar para trabajar, pero los compañeros se llevan pesado"
good,"Es muy buena empresa, muy estable. Pero muchas ventas nocturnas y extensiones de horario. Excelente plan de benéficos como gastos medidos mayores y fondo de ahorro doble"

good,"I worked approximately thirty five hours per week.   One of the great things about working at Sears, was the schedule flexibility offered.   A typical day for me, would start with checking for new sales and store communications. I would then walk the department to check for sale opportunities.   Both the culture and management team were terrific.   My general manager was the best I have ever worked under.  One of the most enjoyable part of the job was talking with customers.  One of the most challenging aspect of the job was to follow up with sales leads.  I was very sorry to see my store close, and I remember fondly of my time spent there."
good,Enjoyed the staff I worked with and they had quality merchandise. Some of the managers were out of their element because they we’re overworked.  The mall location.was great and you did learn a lot of different things.
good,Extremely fast pace and toward my last few years impossible to get good help if any help.   Retail automotive is extremely difficult to work in.  Very stressful
good,"I worked for Kmart/Sears 43 years, but the last few years was telecommuting.  A typical day started with stand up meetings in the morning to meet with our team in India.  We had a limited on-shore presence with most of IT support being offshore.  It was my responsibility to ensure this team was working tickets, focusing on what we required and stopping any escalations to senior management.  The hardest part was the communication gap and language barrier, while most could speak English at times it was very broken.  The most enjoyable part of my job was to service our customers who were executives, buyers, analysts and financial folks to retrieve information from our online application."
good,"Sear was a satisfactory place to work, great management, great team players and friends. Would have been a fantastic place to work if the salary, compensation, and benefits were great, and if there was career advancement. But, overall, great, relaxing, and friendly working place and environment. Quick-paced most times."
good,One of the best jobs ever the peolpe was polite manager was professional at all times. The most enjoyable part was early morning gathers with all employees to get the day started.
good,"Its been 4 years since I've worked there, however, the memories are fond, and the pay was acceptable. I'm not too sure this review matters even more, since the company seems to be in perpetual decline."
good,"Sears was a lot of fun to work at when I was there. I'm not sure if it was because I was young, or because I was in management, but I do miss it. When we heard that the store was closing it was time to leave. The management at the end was very stand offish and didn't seem to care anymore, internally the morale was just not there. The pay was usually minimum wage, and there were no other benefits that were offered to the majority of the workers."
good,Management interested in helping the employee succeed. On going training. Regular structured meetings . Opportunity to make above average income. Opportunity for fast advancement.
good,8 hour day loading trucks. Management was nice and everyone and worked together. Most difficult part of work was when the climate was hot. I enjoyed coworkers
good,Motivated by commission system and sales recognition. Set 30 year sales record last year I was there. Even with setting sales record and being top salesperson there could still only average about $9 per hour. liked the environment and owner. Senior management of the company I feel made some poor decisions about direction. Lots of trouble tryikng to work between online slaes and Hometown store sale prices and delivery. I enjoyed my time there as a natural salesperon but low pay and commission mae it almost impossible to stay and make it financially.
good,"Enjoyed working there but unfortunately closed down."
good,"I miss my job at Sears. I worked with a great team and felt our work made a difference. I also had a manager that always had our back. It was great to work at headquarters three times a week, and two days at home. The best of both worlds. It is heartbreaking to see the company fail."
good,"Sears was an overall good experience. I started out in the hardware department part-time, and once school finished became full time for the summer. Sears started to crash and burn because they went bankrupt, and the hardware department eventually didn't exist. I then got switched to upper cash, where i enjoyed my time, and worked there until the day sears closed which was January 24th, 2018."
good,"it was very stressful, especially on holidays. it used to get super busy. and long hours. i used to get home so late on holidays. past 12 am. the people there were nice."
good,They provided a flexible work schedule that allowed for good work and home coordination. There is emphasis on company goals and direction which change frequently. Some of the best and brightest people I have worked with in a company.
good,"It was a fun work enviroment because with just one other person and you made your deliveries. If you finish in two hours or eight hours, it was the same salary. So that was good."
good,Was only part time. Had a wonderful boss. Liked working with the customers. Received discounts on orders. I learned a lot. Was my first job. Was very sad when they closed that store.
good,Worked for the Company for 30 years. I felt very secure and was given opportunities to grow. I was accommodated when i was faced with family and babysitting issues. We were always involved in the the decision making process whenever it directly involved our department.
good,"For lack of words, Sears was one of the greatest pioneers in sales, customer service and products of the US.  Unfortunate to see this chain fall from grace not being able to keep up and not evolve with the times.  I'll miss you Sears."
good,"The people and my manager are excellent to work with."
good,"I worked in the fine jewelry department  I loved my job"
good,not bad to work for just not enough money or hours good benefits but a little pricey not knowing what hours you are going to work but over all i would work there again if i had too
good,oil changes tune ups tires and flat repairs preformed inventory placed orders of batteries oils and tires automotive supplies .break repair in stall batteries
good,"la dinamica laboral esta muy bien, ya que hay buena comunicacion entre todos los colaboradores, pero el sistema de comisiones deja mucho que dejar"
good,"Sears me brindo la oportunidad de aprender cosas nuevas, estoy agradecido"
good,"Tons of outgoing phone calls, sometimes to people who were not expecting them.  Easy to remember questions to ask during the outbound calls.  Easy to used computer software.  The room was always frigid.  Don't forget to bring a sweater!"
good,"During this time, the store was ready to close so had sales from 25-70% off all items. The goal was to sell as many items as we can in hope to get rid of all items. The hardest part was not allowing refunds and working in the shoe department. The most enjoyable part was the new people I was able to meet."
good,"Working for Sears, gave insight of the retail and manufacturing collaboration. I enjoyed dealing with the distribution stores and managers. The typical day is sometimes challenging but rewarding at the end of shift."
good,"Sears is a nice place to work as a part time job but they do push you to try to get people to apply for credit card with Sears, this I did not care for."
good,"It had a great time and as a first job, I learned a lot. Management was great and we had very flexible hours. Sadly, however, customers at a closing store are not very considerate. If you plan to help close a store prepare for extra work."
good,overall the job was pretty good. Pay was low and benefits were not great. I would recommend this job to a beginner technician or student. very good job for someone just starting out
good,i worked in the photo center. was given the opportunity to use my own creativity for customers. usually was the only person in the studio. perfect for those that prefer to work alone.
good,"Worked with the same group for 6yrs, so we were like family."
good,"The sears I worked at was in the process of liquidation. When I first started there (right when liquidation began), it was a very chill job, I wouldn't do too much most of the day, however, when we got closer to closing, more people started quitting to go back to school so the work load was bigger. I worked in the shoe department and when the sales went up customers started acting like savages, leaving the store looking horrible. There was also a lot of drama at this location, but other than that, I enjoyed my experience working here and my co-workers were great for the most part. "
good,"Sears was home to me for almost 6 years, I loved the staff I worked with as they made the job. Hate Sears had to relocate. I had intentions on being apart of the company for years beyond the above."
good,"I don't have much to say about my first job. It was supposed to be seasonal but they kept me on due to my performance. It was a decent job in of itself it's just that my hours decreased with the passing months with no sign of change. I was getting paid for 1-2 days for 5 hours each in a pay period. I simply couldn't sustain my way of life with the pay so I had to leave. The people I worked with acceptable. I never had internal problems with them or anything. There were only two I got along with well, but everyone else was generally O.K. Sears is acceptable so if go for it if you wish."
good,If you are looking for a company to retire from keep looking. Stores are closing across the country especially the Kmart stores. I really enjoyed working for this company. It's a shame that it is failing.
good,"They said they were expanding this Parts Center from carrying 200 parts to 6,000 and we weren't in danger of closing, you know, 'cause it's Sears.  A month after I got hired, the big wigs found out our lease was up in June and decided to close the store.  The is just BAD management.  Why didn't they know that before?  Why expand only to shut down?  I liked everyone I worked with at my location and it was fine, but from this small experience, you can really see why the company has problems. They laid off everyone at the store, including people who had worked there for a decade, in management!  Smh..."
good,"Exciting work days, never know what will come in next. Great training to advance my career. Not sure of the companies future, but hope they survive and continue great success"
good,"We have a morning meeting that the manager talks about what the numbers were for the past day and then they tell up what our goals are for that day. And compare that to the year from before, Its an relax environment to work in. The hardest part of working for Sears its the closing of stores never knowing if your store is next and customers not coming to the store. Best part is that I get to use my talent once customers do come to the store."
good,"A typical day of work consists of customers with different wants and needs in a fast-pace environment. Overall, it is a fun place to start a part- time, but a small chance of career advancement."
good,"Aprendi a dar una excelente atencion alos clientes "
good,"had a great time working there , enjoyed selling jewelry to costumers and having a great relationship with them , the sears staff as well were like family ."
good,Friendly coworker. They try to push every customer to sign up their credit card. The store manager sometimes is a little mean. Not too many hours for part time.
good,I learn the right concept of coaching and leading a team. Bonded with other General Managers in my region. Help trained and promote my employee from within into management. Help managed and run a business. Learned how to market my business and promote my store through social media and beyond.
good,"Loved the work an the people, but low pay do to minimum wage and not really any career advancement. Management was very nice and helpful. If they wouldn't have closed"
good,Sears was a fast paced work environment that fostered a work first people worker second culture. I was able to work with and manage some great people. The positive experiences that I gained within the organization  are such that I've used since.
good,Their is great work life balance. Management and all teams are very nice. Hoffman Estates Location is beautiful. the 16 years I speak there were very awesome!
good,"Todos los días son diferentes ya que depende de la gente que requiere de mis servicios, las facilidades para adquirir artículos de la tienda son muy buenas."
good,We would have to get 10 people to sign up for credit cards a day no matter how long you worked. Sears has many loyal customers so most of the time it was very difficult to achieve the goal. There was a huge disconnect between managers and employees.
good,Working at Sears is ok but the hours haven't been too good.I have been only getting about 10 hrs. a week on average.That is why I'm looking for other employment.
good,"Sears was an enjoyable job. Most of the managers were pretty cool and didn't pressure you about things too much. Coworkers made the job better, even customer interactions were interesting"
good,"nice staff"
good,"This job had moments of sheer delight. Helping a customer find that one item needed. It could be stressful, especially ""Black Friday"".  A typical workday consisted of readying the sales floor by removing old sales tickets, putting up the new ones. Department meetings were at 9 AM each day. Inventory, displays, customer service, sales and stocking rounded out the day."
good,"I was young when delivering sears catalogues, about 12 or 13. I walked around town in ALLLL kinds of weather (rain, snow/blizzard, shine, winds) in order to meet the delivery deadline. The guy I picked up the catalogue from was super nice, he was always home when I had to pick up my catalogues and was very understandable if something ever popped up."
good,"i started working for the company at the age 16 kmart and sears both, i grew into a higher position within 2 years and was also offered a management position but declined that, its a very good family oriented environment to work in, i did end up working with the company for a good 12 years give or take."
good,"Sears is mostly known as the company thats slowing tanking and its evident. Management is okay, its not the best but they are respectable people who will try their best to work with you. My recent managers were top notch and ready to engage 1-on-1 with any employee but other managers who work in other departments usually dont look at the other employees at the same level."
good,typical mom and pop style franchise location. Was later bought out by corporate in order for it to be shut down since sales for Sears are on the decline.
good,I loved working for Sears. The culture and environment was welcoming and enjoyable. Collaborative and a learning environment. Did not want to leave but the opportunities for the future did not look good.
good,"During the week, it can be really slow but it all depends how you work with the customers that come in. The weekends are the busiest and the best days to work."
good,The Culture was a good one and everyone really helped each other to succeed. It was a stable job and I felt I contributed something to others. The Company had great values also.
good,"A typical day at work, is going all around the store and chatting with customers and helping them understand more of the product they are looking at or intending to purchase."
good,"not many people go to sears, so your work day is pretty slow, you have to do things around the store to keep yourself busy and if you do all your stuff to fast then your stuck there with nothing to do, also the managers really push you to sell there master card and sign people up for the rewards program which is very hard to do because not many people want a credit card"
good,"Sears Canada was a great to place work.  The job was challenging and I truly enjoyed it. Although there were over 100 employees at the Markville store where I worked, it seemed like a family. Every day was unique. The Human Resources team consisted of only myself so every day was different. I was responsible for recruiting, training, payroll, performance issues, Health and Safety and all other HR activities. The most challenging time was dealing with the Markville store closure which also affected my position.  I needed to be professional and committed to stay to the end to ensure that all the associates had support."
good,El trabajo es pesado ya que la empresa se ha encargado de dar una imagen mala al cliente y los clientes se molestan por que luego por políticas de la empresa alguna promesa no se cumple
good,"Relaxing backroom work with added stress towards holidays. A bit under paid, but for the work usually is understandable. Management was a bit lackluster sometimes not communicating with each other."
good,"Now defunct. This company Location was closed in 2016.  I worked parttime in thsi location . however, although, the earning was not satisfactory, there was a life work balance in this place."
good,deliver and install home appliances.Manegment was pretty good they cared about there employees and showed it.The hardest part of the day was unloading the heavy Fridges
good,"Sears was a good experience, loved working there when I started over the years it did get a little harder to appreciate.  There was lack of communication between managers and employees.  As far as the job itself went I enjoyed it, it was fun merchandising. Co workers were great."
good,"I enjoyed working at Sears, enjoyed helping the customers to solve their problems, by getting them the parts needed for repair. I strived everyday to make money for the company and take care of the customers to have repeat business."
good,"It was great at first advanced very quickly but then your worked like no other doing a little of everything from each department, there is room for advancement but you have to give it your all and give up a lot of your personal time and plans."
good,"- I use work in warehouse and customer help desk."
good,"It was fun time working at Sears in both locations , moreover the management were kind . Working at the bank is my best job especially dealing with customers."
good,"It was an experience working as a Merchandising and Pricing Associate with Sears Ala Moana.  I had learned to process markdowns by using handheld scanning units and printers.I was also responsible every Tuesday for the processing of all advertised sales sign for all three level of the store in the computer room.  Seperated signs in assigned basket."
good,"Sears was new to me as I worked at restaurants prior to becoming a cashier. It was very intimidating at first, but once I got the ""gist"" of how everything operated, it became very easy."
good,"We were a hometown store with our own culture. Corporate did not provide as much help to the hometown store as they could have. Once our business decreased, we closed the store."
good,"There are a lot of people at Sears that have worked there for over 15 years and I had the chance to work with a lot of them and learn a lot about the company, it's processes, etc. "
good,it was a ok place to work. It was hard to get hours. I don't the proper training. I was only working 4 hours every 3 to 4 weeks. They hired another person and that is when I decided to look for another job.
good,"J'ai bien aimé travailler chez Sears dans la Quincaillerie. J'ai développer une passion des machines de jardins. Auparavant, on avait des objectifs de ventes et des bonus à la vente de certains services du magasins. Mon département était énorme et j'avais la responsabilité de l'état du plancher de vente et de l'affichage."
good,"Sears provides a good work environment, and has good local management, but only hires its employees on a part-time basis.  I have had many talented coworkers at Sears in the consultative sales position, and Sears has a proactive modern culture of teaching sales."
good,"A typical day consist of changing tires, oil, and any menial jobs on cars.  I learned a lot from this job.  I now know how to work on my car.  There was always a problem with management but they were always moving people around.  The culture was like any garage.  The hardest part was tires that took about an hour to replace.  I enjoyed working on cars."
good,We all worked together but competed to see how can do the best sales pitch and most sales. We had manager and supervisors that understood life situation and to flex your hours.
good,"Siempre hay trabajo, fue una gran experiencia por que se aprende de muchas cosas."
good,easy job nice management not too strict on the way thigns should look as long as it looks neat and as long as you get your job done by the end of your shift
good,It was a ok place to work I guess nothing too efffy or too much. Very relaxed I like it. Pay wasn’t that good though. Find a place that pay more you’ll be happy.
good,"My time at Sears was marked by a lot of change. Some good, some not so good. There were many attempts to reinvent the company and in that churning and roiling there were a lot of opportunity for advancing your career."
good,"Working at Sears gave me the opportunity to gain experience with diversity, as well as the personalities that comes with it. The time would go by fast."
good,"It was a good place to work, the work life was nice and they tried to take care of employees. However the company does not give raises for long term employees."
good,"I worked at the Sears Service Center for many years."
good,a typical day at work included stocking supply and answering customer questions about products offered at store. management was pretty easy to work with.
good,"Fun but customers will get on your nerves, but the manager will have your back. You know how they said customers is always right, yeah no. Our manager always have our back! Best job ever."
good,"I have truly grown within my tenure at Sears Canada. No two days have been the same and I have welcomed each new challenge. I was fortunate enough to have an amazing mentor who motivated me to be constantly pushing myself to expand my skill set within the human resources channel of our business. "
good,fun environment where everyone knows each other and is willing to help everyone out of needed the hardest part of the part of the job is the heavy lifting
good,A day at sear warehouse is a long I'm tired day for dock packed and unloaded management is very cool in understanding but the hardest park of the job is packing up the truck before u make your delivers
good,Would like to see company go in another direction.  Company’s future is not looking good.  Would like to retire from Sears but not sure of future.  Good benefits up to 2017.
good,"Sears was a great early job. I learned the basics of customer service and sales. My primary job was to use suggestive selling to up-sell customers and increase the stores sales volume. "
good,The workers were so helpful in teaching everyone how to do cash and work on the floor. It was a lot easier to learn with such a helpful team. It was slightly unorganised in regards to scheduling.
good,A sido una buena experiencia de trabajo pero no se adapta a mis necesidades.
good,It was great helping people find appliances that suited their needs. Sears was a good retailer that lost their way. It really was a great place to work.
good,"A typical Day/Night at work depending on the department you work in is straightening up your dept, putting out Merch."
good,"In my past work history I was a lifeguard, worked at a snow cone stand, and babysat. Working at Sears, I learned more about appliances and working with customers."
good,"Beautiful environment and Great work place"
good,I would like to say that the company sears was a good company to work for. I learned a different set of skills as far as customer services goes. I learned how to lead the call and not let the caller take control. I learned how to work with dual screens. I would say the interactions with the callers was my least favorite part of the job due to the tier i fell under. I had was part of the sales/retention department. I will say the mangers and trainers were the absolute best part of the job.
good,"Was a great place to work when it comes to meeting and seeing new people everyday.  Customer service can be fun but there is always a challenge that you need to be able to tackle, staff and management were always really good about helping out when necessary."
good,"I loved my regulars that would come in and see me in lawn and garden and hardware. I would get them taken care of and listen to the stories that they had from the last week. They would also send me their friends as well so that also made my commission checks bigger. I hated when I had a customer come in and ask for me and one of my associates would try and steal the sale from me which happened a few times, but they where caught doing it because the customer saw me and said there she is, and would walk away from them even if they where in the middle of ringing up the sale, just so I would get the sale, because I had already sold them on it before. I have also had several of them report it to my manager on duty, that they tried to steal my sale."
good,"Burnsville, MN store location closed. I wished the company could have found a way to keep their doors open. If there were another location with-in the Burnsville, MN or zip code area of 55337. I would have diffidently reapplied."
good,Sears was a great place to work for many reasons. This has been a great growing and learning experience for me. Advancement from within the company was always promoted until recent years.
good,"- Flexible timings"
good,"working at sears i've learned a lot, the management was okay and my co-workers was very lovely. overall sears was a great place to work apart from the hours I enjoyed it"
good,"Good experience with Sears in general. Worked there for 7 months.."
good,"Generally, management was easy to talk to, and cared about their staff. They tried to actually fix problems, which is rare in retail. The job was what you might expect from a retail environment. But, at least for me, the management helped make up for it."
good,"I would stock the shelf and I also ran the register. I would help in other departments  as needed. I really enjoyed the customers ,they would come in almost everyday and ask for me to help them.I would also balance the registers . We had meetings  every week. Great teamwork. I also helped in the customer service department and would handle all complaints and resolve them."
good,If you are talented and can handle the anxiety of the company's financial state you can move up quick.  I was promoted 3x in 3 years which would be very hard to do in another company
good,"Right now the hardest part of the job is the fact that we are under staff so some of the employees are doing the work of two people. Upper management has cut the hours so bad to the fact some employees are feeling stressed out. As a department lead of Fine Jewelry and the Shoe department, I am doing the work of three people."
good,Sears was good place to work and provided good work-life balance.  There was a lot of turn over in the senior management level that led to some instability.
good,"could be a better place to work if the support is there. You are on your feet a lot, Customer service handles way to many complaints. income could be better."
good,Sears was a great place to work. They were very flexible with the work schedule. The pay was great for not having any degrees nor much experience. I would work here anytime again.
good,working for sear gained a lot of team motivation a lot of customer service the pay is very low its been so many years but loved the opportunity.Gained the experience for many more years to come
good,Typical day was fast paced. opportunity to work on different makes and models of cars was beneficial. The on the job training/certification was nice. For the most part enjoyable.
good,Typical day was to interact with customers when they walked through the door. I started as a sales associate to handle money then later i was able to work on their vehicle.
good,"Sears portrait studio has closed. A typical day at work, however, included cold calls, scheduling appointments, taking photos and selling photo packages."
good,"organize  items on shelves"
good,"Was able to move up in a short period of time, but room for growth have been limited now. Was able to learn key skills and knowledge.  Management and staff are always learning from each other"
good,"The job is a typical piece rate job.  Get your numbers, 145%, then clean up your area.  As long as you do whats asked of you, there aren't any problems."
good,Great place to work. Loved the people I worked with and management was very positive. If Sears would not of closed I would still be there. Very sad to have lost this store in Timmins.
good,"The management staff was amazing. They understood family life and usually accepted time off with a reasonable notice. The other employees were great to work with. I would recommend this job to anyone looking for a first time job to gain skills and knowledge. Unfortunately, the chances of moving up in the company are very slim and the pay doesn't tend to increase."
good,"My time at sears was brief seasonal position."
good,More Communication needed but overall a great place to work!! Coworkers and management were great!! The pressure to work while on break or lunch was a little excessive and would affect the rest of my day but i am very grateful for the opportunity!!!
good,Sears is great company to work for but they dont pay their workers enough. This results in an overworked staff (if your a good worker).And they take advantage of hard workers with little in return.
good,hardest part of the job was standing for 8 hours. management was nice. Learned to be more patient with people. We would fold clothes all day and stock shelves
good,"Es un buen empleo, comodo, pero el salario es un poco bajo."
good,"I like my job except for the customers that think they are entitled, think they should get things for almost free or are abusive."
good,"easy going I've learned a lot about retail my General Manager is awesome she's a very fair person, it's just hard to get more hours and pay, but being around people in general is the best part."
good,"Price items with price tags, stock shelves, do inventory, help answer customers find products in the store. Bring items from the back warehouse when there isn't enough items on the shelves."
good,the job was stressful on the holidays but it was a very wonderful place to work when the other co workers help around. This job is a more look out for yourself job but it taught me a lot.
good,"I worked this job during the holiday season, so almost every shift was a rush shift which created an exciting working environment. My manager was lenient when it came to time off to participate in school activities."
good,"Once customers brought there cars in to get services, I input all services in to computer system, checked all fluid levels ,tire pressure and key check points (hoses and ect)"
good,"I worked initially in the clothing department, then worked my way to the commission side. If you are dedicated, you can make a fair amount of money but need to be ready to be pushy"

good,"Great fun workplace located in the heart of downtown Toronto. "

good,Its a great environment to work in. Lots of fun people good management. You get a good balance between work and life. good scheduling for vacation and events
good,Sears has been in business for a long time. It was a privilege to work for this company. I raised my children and met a lot of fine people that I am still good friends with and consider them family
good,The was my first job as a sales associate and my supervisor was super chill as long as you did your work. I left because I was going to school and they wouldn't work around my school schedule no matter how hard my sup tried.
good,"The average workday was pretty slow. The entire mall is going under, so that's to be expected. On Black Friday, we did work extra shifts, but we also get free meals and regular breaks and management made sure everyone was doing alright, and helping with whatever needed help."
good,"L'ambiance aide à faire de son mieux pour travailler."
good,Working with the associates on the floor. It was long hours but enjoyable because of the job duties that was required. Also hiring people and bring them on with the culture of sears
good,good place not enough days for training but the team and manager are very good place very clean quiet good area feel comfortable working there but timing was little bit complicated
good,"Started working as a cashier at Sears.  Fought for hours most of the times to get a fair paycheck.  Paid minimum wage, but there were several ways for advancement while I was there.  As long as you are doing a good job and hungry for hours, there is no where but going up.  Enjoyed my time there."
good,The best part of working at Sears were the employees. Everyone got along really well. Management had it's faults but for the most part they were really nice.
good,Sears is a good job to start at but as you get out of high school you might want to look for more. I had fun at times but other times I just got tired because its the same everyday.
good,"I typically worked an eight hour shift and it was my job to answer the phones and set up service appointments.I sat at a computer and typed answering the phones and trying to calm everyone down because their ""washing machine"" was broken and wasn't getting fixed fast enough. There was a definite rift between management and the good old working girl. The hardest part of the job was getting yelled at by customers. The most enjoyable part was that I had a ""REAL"" job."
good,"buen ambiente de trabajo, excelentes clientes, excelente equipos.............competitivo,  divertido, te da la oportunidad de utilizar diferetes tecnicas de ventas."
good,"A retail sales person at Sears has to do a number of activities.  They start the day at the office gathering the money pouches and keys and take them to the registers they are manning to open and count.   Next they greet customers and help them by educating them about products and protection agreements.   There's a lo to do and it keeps you on the fly... as long as the foot traffic is good.  Otherwise it's a bore and a long day.  "
good,"early part of my career are great, management support and a lot of real training, flexible hours to support your carreer and family. Had a great benefits, and pay raises"
good,There is in fighting among the mechanic about who gets what job assignments. The manager looks the other way when employee complaints are brought to his attention.
good,"You work long hours but have a feeling of accomplishment.  There is real camaraderie among the people.  "
good,"The job was easy, you have to be able to work in an extremely fast paced environment. I work both sides of the company, store side, and operations side. Management has gone down hill."

Also, coordinating Retention Program, set up accounts, run and fill out renewal monitoring reports; handle mail and UPS; branch filing, handling of contracts, work orders and associated paperwork for files and the Sears Store; run daily check-ion sheets and daily bookkeeping and sales reports; manage petty cash, weekly reports and accounts payable; fill out Louisiana Eradication Reports, handle damage claims and all related claims."
good,Having come from retail stores that didn't post sales Sears was a refreshing change of pace with their print out of sales and occasional employee reviews.  This helped with setting goals for sales and personal improvement.  As well their introductory store training was definitely a step up from most retail companies.
good,"Everyone working there was friendly and helpful. Even though the store was being closed, the staff maintained a professional attitude. Everyone helped out each other."
good,A typical days work is fun- customer service if you are in it for that is very satisfying -adapting to new practices verses old practices have been challenging to get previous staff to comply but once its accomplished its good
good,Very good place to work if you want to begin a career in the automotive field. Very hard to get benefits. Have to wait 6 months before you can be eligible for training classes
good,Worked sucked I don't want to write about this company. I want to continue creating my Indeed account so i can apply to more important jobs. I hate this.
good,Job security is questionable. I am not confident that the company will be around for another five years. Salary and benefits drop every year. The stores are doing less and less business.
good,"A typical day at work was hot but good work."
good,"Great extra money. Christmas time was extremely busy. Had to get customers in and out in 15 min. Have kids that are tired, don't want to cooperate, parents expect photographer to work magic on the kids that don't want to cooperate. We did a lot of fun stuff at Christmas and Easter. Really like that job."
good,"It was a good place to work at to enhanced your work skills. Friendly environment between the store managers, associates, and customers. Always up to date of the latest sales."
good,"A typical day at work consists of a blend of helping consumers fix problems with their current products/services and selling new products/services to consumers."
good,"Worked effectively with Store management and store drew to achieve sales and great customer service.  Supervise associates through assigning, directing and following up of all activities."
good,"Sears was a great retail experience especially because there are many options within one store. There are all different types of people and job opportunities from customer service, to back stockroom workers and even loss prevention."
good,Working 50 55 hours a week it's a big company it's mostly smooth sailing but you just don't feel like they really care about you as a person but it's a job
good,"Was a good high school job, wouldn't want to work there forever though. Started working at Sears senior year of high school, and stopped when i decided to attend university."
good,"overall a great experience, I learned a lot in such a short amount of time, everyone there is considerate of your outside life and the managers just want to see you succeed"
good,"Repair technician is a good job if you can work independently and are good at troubleshooting. No advanced warning what your day will look like, some days you will be driving half the day, other times you may only get a few jobs and be done early. Good amount of training is provided. Sometimes you will assist other techs on a job but primary contact with management & co-workers is over the phone."
good,"Conferring with customers by telephone, and providing information about the products. "
good,Taught me a lot about sales and how to read and communicate with people. They urge you to sell protection agreements because they make more money for the company and actually pay you more than what you make off of the actual unit. One of the things I like is finding the product that will work for the member and send them home with the correct unit with a big smile on their face.
good,"Load your truck then deliver your product. I learned good customer service. Management was nice but, under stress from sears. The hardest part of your job was working more than 60 hours a week. The most enjoyable thing was making the customer happy."
good,Great people with good flexible hours. The owner knows how work with people knowing that life happens. There is nothing better than a good work environment.
good,"The environment was decent, but the pay was horrible. Management tries hard to work around employee schedules and preferences."
good,On a day to day basis I would ring customers up. Often times I'd be asked to assist customers in finding merchandise. Also having customers apply for Credit Cards.
good,"Learned how to display tables and be productive with go backs, learned how to take out merchandise out of inventory. I worked along with the lead. When it was a busy day my lead would put me in other departments."
good,"it took 24 year for me to see the light, over the years I saw lots of things that Sears did  that could have made the company better but no one would do or say things management  would  focus on numbers not people thus the down fall  of the business"
good,"Good buisness to work for, great hours do not work too late, nice break area, management is ok, hands on the department I was working at."
good,It provide a good employment benefits such as employee discount. The location is central in downtown Toronto which is very convenience for people who travel from different part of the city
good,"Good co-workers, and good management. Always working on Different types of cars with different repairs, or maintenance needed. co-workers always willing to help out if someone needs help."
good,"there weren't many days in which I could say were normal. First off; The store is closing and the work load is very limited.Secondly since I have been there they haven't really gave me an set position, so I cant really advise another to work for the organization for I really don't have a good understanding of my job title. But for the  most part It was a pretty decent learning experience."
good,"El ambiente entre compañeros es  exelente, todos se ayudan entre sí, aprenderse a trabajar en equipo, a tratar a todo tipo de gente, lo único más pesado es el horario."
good,"There was never a slow day on the job. As soon as you hung up from 1 call, there was another 1 waiting. Sears Credit now is closed."
good,I worked with Sears for 6 months starting out as a Jewelry Associate and working my way to being the favorite of the managers. Lots of favoritism in place at this Sears and sometimes cashiers aren't treated fairly. Management was ok but they pushed too hard for credit cards.
good,it was a fun job with a good environment  there was lots to do and the other employees seemed to have the same views. my only complaint would be that i never got trained even though i was there for 6 weeks.
good,Sears es una empresa muy grande que puede ofrecer mejores pretaciones y salarios para poder estar en competencia con el area de manufactura que aqui en tijuana es el mas fuerte.
good,"Sears is great company . Love people that I work with . Very fast paced environment. Best customer service . "
good,"over the years working with the company it made me such a strong person with different skills. i started in the warehouse and learn all the different positions. After graduated from a local college for Air Condition and Appliances, i felt maybe i'll give it a shot to become an installer at my company. The gave me a chance and a great installer i became."
good,"My job as a cashier was to have customers to have that WOW experience.  I always greeted each and every customer with a smile."
good,"learned a great deal new appliances. manager was great, co workers very helpful. Getting started was a little rocky, they didn't have a van, tools, etc ready for me. Spent a lot of time teaching us to sell stuff which could have been used to train on appliances. I enjoyed meeting customers, and the feeling of accomplishment when the repair was completed"
good,"Good place to work, if you are interested in working the same thing everyday of processing daily payroll, working independent was what I enjoyed the most. They have some small room for growth in moving up there is a payroll processor level 1 or level 2. Very laid back and quiet place to work."

good,"I worked in sears for about two years and actually enjoyed working there. I was always available for full time, and didnt have a problem staying longer hours. In sears I greeted customers upon their visit. I also worked in the cashier for awhile."
good,"Very fun place to work very clean environment , Great people to work with , Good experience fast paste , goood team work and everybody dose their  work on time"
good,Sears has no future company is falling and will give you no incentive to work for them they have nothing to offer. Horrible insurance and no 401k witch gives you no reason for working for them
good,I worked at a small Sears store that ended up closing due to the downsizing of Sears. I did like the small town where everyone knows you.
good,I think they company (kmart) that i was at was kind of unorganized because they for got my lunch break. Mean while i have been therr for 6 days now and my number still wasnt programed in the system. I dont believe they should be paying 7.25 and hour and not giving raises.
good,I enjoy my co-workers and the opportunities that Sears have provided me.  I am proud of my many accomplishments and recommendations that I have provided to numerous departments.  I am concerned with my ability to advance within the company because many departments have been on a hiring freeze for an extended period of time.
good,"Easy job, flexible schedule, 20 percent discount on clothing and 10 percent on home goods. The down part is you only get paid minimum wage."
good,"Enseñan a como poder vender y tener palabra de convencimiento, a mercadiar y saber exhibir la mercancia"
good,I found it to be an enjoyable work place and there was a consistently positive attitude. The only downfall was the lack of available hours and the low pay rate.
good,A typical day at work consist of ringing up customers and keeping customers satisfied. Asking customers to apply for the Sears credit card was a must. Management wasn't as great as it should be. Co-workers were very friendly. Nothing was hard about the job i enjoyed everything about it.
good,"Sears is a progressive company with room for advancement.  The store I worked in, we were not co-workers, we were family.  The management team worked as a very cohesive group."
good,"Good company to work for. Management seems to care about their employees. Only downside might be, that you are not guaranteed to be able to work a set schedule."
good,"I liked working for sears . I felt like I was actually serving a purpose, I like the people that I work with I like the people that I work for they gave me a capability to expand my knowledge and my selling ability"
good,"Usual day working retail support was monotonous, but the fantastic coworkers and managers made up for it. The job itself wasn't hard at all, it was engaging and a great stimulation of the mind. This job really had me checking myself, and my emotions before every call so as to not upset the member on the line. "
good,Sears was caring about its customers but it was also out of touch with what the public wanted to buy. After they were bought out by an American company it just got worse
good,"Slow for the most part in HI Department.. "
good,Great place to work. I learned to much about High Risk Credit Collections and Customer Service from Sears Credit Center
good,"Its good if its your first time working, but don't expect a lot out of it. They pay sucks with all the work you have to as a backroom associate. I enjoyed my years there but it's time to move from a job that doesn't progress."
good,"gave me experience on the workings behind the scenes of a retail store. fun music to listen to during the holiday, different jobs to work in the back. people to talk to."

good,"Es un ambiente formal en el aspecto laboral, donde se aprende a tratar con la gente y a trabajar bajo presión, me gusto mucho que no fallan en los días de pago. los gerentes de piso de ventas en todo momento te ayudan en lo que pueden como con el gerente de tienda son personas muy respetuosas."
good,"Very little structure, no calendar or organization.  Business strategies and models are constantly changed based on new management,  Great team."
good,"We would take customers calls and place catalog orders, also solve customers complaints if possible."
good,"I really enjoy the competitive side of my job. Being in sales means the rewards and bonuses are very good. "
good,"We had several management changes, some good, some unfavorable. Overall, they're extremely flexible, which is helpful for students. There is always opportunity for bonuses."
good,Normally I had to verify the merchandise before we start the delivery. I learned about how the people care about their items.
good,"Started day checking work orders and preventative maintenance schedule for stores. Prioritize work load and start at most critical work orders first, along with store location.

good,"Great place to work, I learned a lot working here. Great place to work.Great place to work. Loved working here. Only the weather is not so good."
good,"A typical day would have started with picking up you work orders for the day. Checking to make sure you had the parts needed to complete the work orders. Calling customers to arrange a time to do the work. Complete the work order and give a copy to the customer. Sometimes collecting payment for the work that was done and turn that into the accounting office along with the accompanying work order. "
good,"Excellent customer base, co-workers we somewhat unprofessional. I gained experience in the customer service field, problem solving and as a cashier. My immediate supervisor was a bit unethical but aside from that it was a decent place of employment."
good,"Working at sears was an okay place, after holiday season your hours will get cut dramatically. Co-workers were great, nice and fun people. The hardest part was if you were a sales associate and didn't sell anything it messes with your metrics. Which your managers bother you to sell, even though no one would really go by to buy anything."
good,"I would dispatch 10 trucks throughout Vancouver Island to specific homes at specific times... routing each guy with their route, parts, timing and syncing them so that their days were fluid."
good,"10 horas de trabajo."
good,"You would have to help customers, and sale products and warranties. I learned a lot about sales and appliances. Management was very pushy when it came to sales, and that made it hard when you didn't get a sale. It made it hard to be friendly when you felt like you had to fight for customers. I enjoyed the training trips."
good,"Sales and effective customer relations ensuring that stock was always available or finding alternatives."
good,"fast paced, god place to work, need more advancement options. management should be more organized. Should have more shifts available. fun environment to work in."
good,"Although Sears is a great company to work for, and has wonderful loyal customers, there is no stability in really any job at their customer contact centre. This is the second time I've been laid off due to ""business needs""."
good,The supervisors were nice and taught you efficiently.The employees were nice and willing to help if you needed it.the training was good and I learned the basics of using a cherry picker.
good,"I learned to become a manager.  At first the role of the shift manager,  running shifts, making counts and handling inventory for the store.  In charge with delegating out task for other crew members.  In charge of making safe drops or runs to the bank for the store, to make deposits.  I also handled truck deliveries and stocked the store with the desired counts for inventory."
good,"most of the staff was amazing and got along well, my only issue with the company is that when you work more than 30 hours pretty much every week and are still considered part time. "
good,"Working at sears was a kind of a slow paced job. I learned how to do price changing, and learned how to work a point-of-sale system. Management was okay they really didn't interact with employees, but co-workers were great with training for new hires. The hardest part was during the holiday season but it was also very fun when everything was complete."
good,Have worked for Sears for many years.  Easy advancements and good worklife balance.  Sears provide all training aspects to ensure you are successful in your position.
good,"I worked as a Loss Prevention Agent. I provided security for employees and customers. I helped to deter profit loss through theft, internally and externally."
good,Sear's is a competitive workplace for getting credit and shop your way. It's fun but it all depends on how many credit applications you can get.
good,"A normal day at work would be quite fun actually. I was one of the youngest working there so my older co-workers usually taught me how everything flows and works at my job. Everyday I would learn something new whether it be from a co-worker or just a normal customer. The management there was actually not to bad, I would think that my manager would be mean and always angry all the time but he pretty lenient. All of my co-workers were really active and hard-working and a couple of them were quite friendly. The hardest part of my job was getting there, I don't have a vehicle at the moment. The best part of my job was just going there everyday, I really enjoyed the working experience there."
good,wasnt at this job to long but it was ok loved the people i was working with good to lean how to change oil and tires on a car or truck
good,There is never a dull moment here.  One is always looking at innovative ways to solve issues outside the box but within corporate parameters.
good,"Either open or close the studio, count the drawer, opening/closing paper work, drop money in the safe, clean studio, pick up the camera rooms and props, and clean."
good,Fun fast paced and enjoyable work place. Many different insightful experinces during my short time of employment at sears.
good,"management did a good job very supportive, employees were great to work with. not a hard job was all customer related, was not a big company was owner operated small friendly atmosphere"
good,"A typical day starts out with me leaving my driveway and heading to Malden MA, or Brockton MA. Getting parts that technicians need once they are at their service calls. I get the part and deliver to where ever the part is needed within MA, CT, or RI. Then I go back and do the process all over again. Assist the technician in the installation of parts. I drive all over every day ""Road Warrior"" "
good,"For a part time job while in school, it was a fun place to work. I was a cashier/ stock clerk. I enjoyed the variation of tasks my manager used to give me, to keep me busy as well as challenge me."
good,Easy and well caught on job for me. I had a blast working for Sears and Sears supervisors was laid back and easy to talk too. assembly line work was easy to catch on to and the hours was not too bad just right for those who have families.
good,"Sear's is a ""keep it in the family"" type of work place. Cool laid back but when it's a rush it's hard to handle but bearable."
good,"Good place to work for part time, small environment. Its a slow pace job so you dont have to worry about rushing. Co-workers are friendly, almost seems like your around family"
good,Enjoyed working there great incentives for credit card sales and as long as you are willing to push for them you end up with a nice little bonus at the end of the month!!!!!!
good,I was not in a busy enough state with constant work. I do not like a job with nothing to do but stand. Sears was not the job for me. I enjoy a job that challenges me to work hard.
good,This is a pat time job for me. I like my boss and my co workers. It is a job that helps me pay some bills and has some benefits. You get to meet different people everyday.
good,Unloading of shipments was by hand. Dock area was not air conditioned and very hot! Had a time limit to retrieve items on hold and some were hard to locate.
good,Was a nice place to work because the employees and management was very nice and helpful.  Good employee discounts. Stock in store was very good.
good,"Sears' metric based sales requires higher effort than most retail will ask for, but the compensation more than makes up for it."
good,I was fortunate that the people I worked with were awesome. However the goals they wanted you to meet everyday were a little ridiculous.
good,"Typically I would start at the main desk. I would usually start by picking up phone calls and greeting customers with a smile as soon as they would enter the store. "
good,"Interesting environment, my supervisor before i resigned. was probably the most amazing person ive ever worked for in my years of customer service. The lady who trained me was amazing with explaining things, i was very happy with my peers, coworkers were ither friendly,busy or kept to themselves. Very comfortable with attire so long as maintaining professionalism. Coming into work swiping your badge to get in, walking onto a call floor that seats about 380-400 people separated into different departments, retail,parts,commercial,parts customer care,chat&email(for partsdirect)was quite the experience and i feel i gained alot of knowledge from the content and the individuals i met"
good,it helps to pay bill and there's alot flexibility within your schedule great job for college students or people whos just looking for extra income
good,"not a bad place to work "
good,All individuals put a strong effort forward. The teams worked together well and made all deadlines meet their target. Great job..!
good,I worked for Sears for 28 years total.  I enjoyed by far the majority of the time!  How ever as Sears changed to a Holding Company with K-Mart I lost interest and decided to opern my own business
good,Fun workplace. work the registers and put back clothes. sign customers up for credit cards. bad management. Co workers were great made the job better.
good,"i learned how to deal with different people, MAKE SALES, AND Process credit applications. It was mainly a very friendly environment."
good,"A typical day  at Sears was opening registers, counting  money at the beginning and end of the work day, clean up  areas of our store, merchandise products, do resets according to the  visual manuals. It wasn't  a tough day especially if you  like your co workers zand the customers. Only thing hard to deal with is when customers are rude."
good,"Its great the managers treat you good. the pay is minimum wage but the enviorment was good and well worth it the hardest part was the dressing rooms sometimes, I learned people skills I always had good days and I loved everyone there."
good,"Fun,the employees are friendly and great to work with. Could use more employees in certain areas of the store,as we are short handed the majority of the time. Great energy the majority of the time."
good,As a mother it wasn't the best career choice. I often had to work nights even when I just wanted to stay at home and watch my children. I was put into a not-so-pleasant work environment.
good,"fun but very fast paced, there was always lots to do, i met a variety of people and that was the best part of the job.The hardest part of the job was the hours were long and the breaks were short, a lot of typing and sitting."
good,Overall the company is good to work for. The associates on the call floor are constantly having competitive /goal oriented projects  and awarded very nicely. The company just had a trip to Atlantis for top sellers. The support staff is always willing to help out with projects and are friendly. Everyone is on a first name basis and even the cleaning crew is included in celebrations.
good,"I loved the people that I worked with; my bosses and co-workers were truly wonderful people: the only problem was that in the Auditing Department there simply was not any opportunity to advance.  My bosses were ;terrific  ;the people in my office were extremely nice and a great group to work with.  "
good,"Sears has been a great experience. Among already being trained in customer service, as well as billing and sales I learned how to troubleshoot and deal with customers on a different level in the call center world. I'm certified in technical support which has taught me alot about dealing with different types of customers in a different setting."
good,"receiver in mourning, picking in the afternoon, forklift driver load and unload trucks when needed, also packing to finish the day."
good,"worked as tech 1 and 2 for a year."
good,Overall good place to work but management needs to be better organized and steady. I would prefer if they had fixed schedules instead of random shifts and hours would always fluctuate.
good,Good starting point of employment for the retail industry of shopping. Work hours are difficult because they are consistent and very minimum amount of week hours one cannot count on to make a living.
good,"Great on the job training, great staff and management. Very physical work, certifications thru ASE if desired. Days start at 8 am, end at 7 pm, while 10 hour shifts are required. Sunday's are 10-5pm, overtime is mandatory. Sadly, there is no sense of security as ownership at this particular location is iffy."
good,"Loading up people purchases,Team lift, Paul was my manager, My coworkers were like family, Loved the environment I was in."
good,"Asistir a juntas diarias antes de la apertura de la tienda, cursos de superacion personal Asume limpieza y acomodo de ropa y aparatos deportivos"
good,"Worked from 8 to 4, go to building at 8 to pickup day's orders and parts, called customers, proceeded to individual residences to complete the work orders. End of day, called in completion status and placed part orders"
good,"This job was nice because i liked to always feel like i was doing something, and this job allowed that. I would unload trucks, stock, and take inventory. Each day was a little different, but always enough work to be busy."
good,"i  also like this job very much because i like to organize items "
good,"It was cool but because they were going out of business the workload became too much for the pay. "
good,"A typical work day at Sears would be assisting customers in my department, finding exactly what the customer came in looking for or creating an online order for them if I couldn't find what they wanted in-store. I enjoy working with a great team of co-workers and managers and being able to get things done in a timely manner or assisting customers to the best of our ability."
good,"While I disagree with the company at a national level, at the local level Midland, Sears is a great place to work at. The company has a strong sense of family and working together and I appreciate it. While the company has issues with its technology and processes, the small team does its best to fix these issues."
good,"Tiene buenas prestaciones, hasta cierto punto ofrece estabilidad laboral. Pero en lo personal deseo crecer laboralmente y no se me ha permito hasta ahora."
good,"They are a good company, but never knowing when you are getting home was hard, very long days. no real time to get your van in proper order to find iteams for job."
good,"Sears a great company to work for. This company offers you the opportunity for career advancement ,benifits as well as job security. fun productive work enviorment."
good,"This is a place where, yes, you could advance if you apply yourself but in my opinion, isn't really worth it. This is a great part-time job for like students, retirees who just want a job or someone whose looking for a second job."
good,"Picked mail orders and sent them on their way to customers"
good,"Tranquilo por lo general,atencion a cliente en caso de no haber cerca vendedor,aprendi a complementar mi trabajo con mi experiencia de ventas y seguridadpor lo que la atencion es constante,de parte de gerencia considero es buen gerente esta al tanto de la sucursal,la parte mas dificil es la intolerancia al tiempo de entrada porque eso de regresar por dos minutos tarde me estresa por mi tiempo limitado de un lado a otro y sin carro propio,lo que mas me gusta es que hay buen ambientelaboral."
good,"ringing up people "
good,Overall my experience with Sear has been a great one so far. The management team is wonderful althought at times there are minor issues amongst employees. But nothing that isn't to be expected in a normal work environment.
good,"I fill the floor with stocking mrchandise from the warehouse. I gather web orders from stock room or the floor for customers. I greet, give and thank customers who are picking up their in store bought or on line orders. I audit the warehouses. I organize customer bins and keep warehouse clean. "
good,"A typical work day i would go in to work and go straight to my supervisor and we would go to the stock room and collect housewares to fill the floor. "
good,"Sears is a great place to work. Minor bumps in the road along the way, but overall a nice environment. Friendly staff and crew."
good,Word day starts at 8 and end at 4:45. I have learned quite a bit about phone setup and SAP. Many dedicate associates with little chance for advancement.
good,Overall fun work environment. Excellent staff and supervisors. Very informative and supportive. Great part-time work for students.
good,"Always busy. Learned customer service and how the customer always come first no matter what. A team environment. Fun and upbeat place to work. Engaged with customers at all times, making them feel at home."
good,"A typical day at Sears Appliance Store started with making coffee and cookies to welcome the customers, as they walked in. I did have flexible hours and the store was open 7 days a week. "
good,"A typical day for me would consist of a morning tour of the salesfloor and stockrooms.  Tour notes would be given to my assistant(s) to delegate to the department managers and part time associates.  I would then review sales, emails, and plan for truck deliveries.  I conduct a morning meeting with my team prior to store opening.  After store opening the key focus is on customer service and merchandising.  Throughout the day, depending on the day of the week, different things would take place:  Conference calls, interviews, customer inquires, planning displays with vendors, budget planning, etc. The early evening, prior to leaving for the day, I would complete my daily audits of shipping, receiving, merchandising, and cash."
good,A typical day was fast paced.  I learned how to load and unload trucks.  Management was hard and forgoing.  My co-workers was always smiling.  The hardest part of the day is when the yard was full of trucks.  The enjoyable part of the day is when we reached our goals.
good,I really enjoyed working for Sears. It allowed me to really learn about logistics. I was allowed to work with many wonderful co-workers and management. The hours were sometimes limited but overall I have no complaints about my work there.  I was allowed to do my jobs without having to have direct supervision.
good,"Not sure what to say but the early days of Sears was a lot of fun and I really enjoyed customer service, we had great christmas parties, and we even put together many golf tournament, most co-workers became close friends and still are to this day.."
good,"My obligations were to acknowledge clients sooner than other mates, in order to keep them for my a daily work load, and productivitie.Learned to be time wise and productive in a competitive enviroment.Managment were supportive and helpfull,co-workers were highly competitive but friendly, the economic climate made our sales based enviroment ever so challanging,the social aspect of meeting people and the feeling of acomplishment with each client."
good,"See above for review. Sometimes had free lunches, sometimes had short breaks."
good,great place to work for and the management was wonderful and everyone was great to work with at a good pace to get the job done in a timely mannor that was safe and was able to learn new things..
good,"My typical day at work is not typical at all which is what I liked. I could walk into system issues like the sorter being down to a complete network outage. I had to hit the ground running to get the production moving and then begin the root cause analysis. I have learned to work with SQL, multiple RF networks / devices, databases, report automation, phone systems, etc. There was never a dull moment in this job and I hope I can find another just like it. The management team always supported each other and did whatever was necessary to get the job done. My co-workers included everyone from the newest hire associate to the General Manager. We all respected each other and enjoyed each others company. "
good,"This has been the only job I have had so far, that honestly cared for their employees. And the other employees were all mature, and hard workers. I loved working here, and if it hadn't been for them cutting my hours because the holidays were over, I would have stayed with them."
good,"MCA's work very hard. But we get minimum wage and no health benefits or vacation time. Definitely no way to treat yourself. Def not long term. Unfortunately, you are putting forth a max effort to do your job with integrity and getting little compensation back. This isn't a salary you can live on. But the biggest challenge is that every task is priority and also the members. So time management and excellent customer service will see that you thrive in this position. If you like to work hard and stay busy and you enjoy talking to people and helping them, then i suggest you apply for this job! Good luck!"
good,I have been at Sears Holding Corp for 10 1/2 years and it has been a great place to work. It is time to go for a new experience.
good,Learned how to interact with customers on a daily basis and how to sell. Managers were usually more concerned with specific departments. Coworkers were great. The hardest part of the job was maintaining steady hours after holidays. I had a lot of fun talking to customers and making helping them get the right product.
good,typical day at work would be traveling through the city cleaning residential properties. I learned how to maintain expensive purchases for your home. Management has tons of experience in this field. Co workers all have vast knowledge of products. Dealing with customers is hardest part of job.
good,"I like the fact that you see a lot of the same customers every day, and get to establish a good relationship with them, as this is important in retail/sales."
good,The business was bought by a larger company and was subsequently closed.  The larger company bought the loan portfolio but decided to close the Southern Financial offices and blend the portfolios from each office into their existing offices.  All Southern Financial employees were eventually phased out.
good,"This is a typical retail job with all of the perks and frustrations as all others. "
good,it was a fun and productive place place of work. We listened to music while unloading and loading the trucks. The management wasn't that good cause they were not knowledgeable at all.
good,"I build my position as a hard working person, it was tough with many competitive at my store and other managers in different departments."
good,"A self-starter, energetic and enthusiastic with over 30 years in single and multi-unit merchandising and operations experience. Results oriented and highly motivated to succeed with excellent customer service skills. I hold myself and team accountable to company goals and financials, ensuring targets are met. Focus in driving standards, organizing, planning and developing total store team to increase sales and profit."
good,"para mi sears fue una ensenansa mas en la vida en todo sentido,a como convivir con los companeros y alas metas que nos ponia la misma empresa. Yo sabia cual era mi papel y lo mas importante para mi era que el cliente se fuera contento y satisfecho con la atencion que yo le habia dado, eso para mi era mi mayor reto."
good,Challenging and high paced work.  Customer oriented. Schedule was accommodating for work/life balance.
good,"On any given day the attitude and atmosphere was always positive, even during difficult financial times."
good,This company gave me the customer service and problem sloving basics to excel  in my next position.
good,The hardest part of the job is dealing with the different attitudes you encounter.
good,A typical day at Sears is that there always something to do.  For example receiving a shipment to merchandising the sales floor.  Helping customers.  Getting the job done.  The management is good they are always  very nice to me including my co-workers. I enjoy my job very much been there a long time I love the fast pace and how the flow goes in my store.
good,"Coworkers were for the most part a good working group who supported each other.  Mangement above store level seemed, for the most part, clueless about was happening in the stores.  Unfortunately, ten years later they still don't get it.  Tellling customers we didn't have what they needed in stock.  The best part was having satisfied customers, especially when they returned to buy something else and asked or waited for you."
good,"Working for Sears Canada is rewarding and enjoyable for anyone that thrives in a customer service setting.  Days are filled with routine work (opening cash, stocking and cleaning displays, assisting customers with purchases and products), but the environment provides variety through the day.  I learned a lot about how larger companies work, as well as many things about the products I was selling.  Sears provides plenty of opportunity to learn (as well as incentives for doing so!).  Management is steady, amicable and understanding, though sometimes hard to get in touch with.  Supervisors move around the departments frequently, but all are friendly and easy to work with.  I enjoyed the busy Christmas season the best, when line ups at the cash desks never end, as well as seeing regular customers from time to time.  The hardest part of the job was posting sale signage; it is a long, and sometimes complicated process that needs to be done quickly."
good,"At Sears, I did many duties, among them was: "
good,"I would start work at 7 am. scan and load counts into the snc (sears network communicator). I also assisted customers at store opening and throughout the day. Point of sale, covered breaks and lunches in various departments and answered phones. Management was tough, yet direct. My co-workers were great people, for the most part. I would say the hardest part of the job was not knowing what my schedule would be from week to week. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the repeat customers and having a rapport with them."
good,"My day began by checking the technicians routes so see if they had lost any calls overnight,check messages to see if any tech had called in ill,l and to look for calls to fill the routes. As the day progressed I would monitor the routes for time window violations,contact techs if they had not updates their routes and contact tech managers if necessary if there was a customer complaint that I could not resolve.Before working for Sears ,I had no previous computer experience. I learned to defuse difficult situations with customers and technicians and to meet deadlines within the time constraints.Sears hired a diverse mix of people that always made life interesting.My direct supervisors were always upbeat, positive and helpful.The hardest part of the job was the daily changes to my job.It made it difficult because we would tell the customers one thing and the next day we would have to call them and tell them something else.I most enjoyed interacting with my co-workers and making my customers happy and satisfied."
good,"I would like to rate my time and employment there on a scale from 1-5, a 3.5. I loved working with the people there, but management always had trouble when it came to communicating appropriately. Things were not always about ""team members"" and I wish that management did work on their integrity, and communication skills."
good,"Online Service Representative 2006-2011"
good,"This was a very enjoyable place to work! I was given a lot of freedom as far as responsibility. I learned about appliances, electronics, lawn and garden products, and hand and power tools. It was nice to see customers that knew me by name and trusted me to give them the best quality product that would fill their needs with a budget in mind. Over the years of working there, I became more comfortable with the selling business and grew to love it. I was able to work alongside my brother and nephew at separate times that made the job even better."
good,"Working at Sears has definitely been a new experience for me. As it is my first job in retail, things took a little getting used to. I do enjoy sales, and talking to people on a daily basis is my favorite part of the job. My coworkers are great and are my favorite people I have worked with at a job. Management however, is a little lacking. I feel like there are too managers and not enough tasks for all of them to work on. There tend to be a lot of different tasks assigned to one person, and we are constantly hearing different things from different managers, which leads to quite a bit of confusion."
good,"At Sears i learned customer service, team management, I took supervisor calls, And did freight work to move items from trucks to the store"
good,One exciting place to work and fast paced. long hours and typical days at work.
good,"My current position is typically slow-paced throughout the week. The store gets much busier during weekends, and I have had to learn to quickly respond to emergencies and other activities."
good,"Llegando a la tienda claro después de checar tenia que ir al departamento de caja general x las llaves de las diferentes vitrinas de los departamentos varios para hacerle entrega a los gerentes, ir a junta de animación, luego revisión de correos del gerente asi como los que me llegaban de la central y asi darle contestación y solución a los oficios o lo que se presentara, entregar información al gerente de los detalles o solicitudes de cada gerente de tienda, también atender proveedores, hacer paqueteria para que estuviera lista cuando llegaban por ellas, de igual manera si no llegaba la chica de conmutador o era su hora de comida me hacia cargo también de ese departamento asi como del voceo y vigilancia. etc"
good,"I was only there for two months. Customer service was great, always polite and friendly. Learned basic cashiering skills. Worked til Christmas."
good,Once arrived at cashier station one would count money in making sure all money was to be accounting for. Once day is started one would attending ringing up costumers items in a fast paced and friendly costumer service.
good,A typical day at work starts off with reviewing personal and departmental goals for the day.  Verifying work schedule and recent sales for the department and a quick meeting with my manager or assistant manager for any updates yet posted on internal e-mail network.  My manager has been very flexible and supportive in regards to time for completion of training modules.  My co-workers are both friendly and knowledgeable in their job positions.  Human resource representative is very upbeat and consistently maintains a positive attitude which makes for a comfortable work environment.  The hardest part of the job is down time in work load as I prefer to be in a fast pace work environment.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when I can truly identify the needs of the customer for the home appliances they are looking to purchase
good,High regards for the people who are talented and dedicated to the companies success.  Great resources to support job success.  If the talent had a clear and consistent strategy to execute against great things would be possible.
good,"Working at Sears was a fun place to work,learned a lot about retail,have good reprator with Police,hardest part was internal investigations but are nessacery,co workers are great"
good,"On a typical day, I would go in and clean and stock  the shelves with                                                                          all the  sizes and straiten up all the areas."
good,"Sears is great because they allow you to grow and develop. Being the ambitious person that I am, I have often found myself learning skills that aren't required because the personal staff welcomes me to stay after work to learn more about the retail industry. Sears Holding Company has given me the rare opportunity to work in several departments in order to give me a more balanced feel of the big pictures. A typical day may include opening, counting money, helping customers find their way through our department, maintaining an organized desk, and learning over the shoulder of any one of my managers to gain a better understanding about our companies operations."
good,Nice enough place to work. Trainer is wonderful and pay is good. Scheduling can become bit of a problem as it is first come first serve on the schedules.
good,First person in would make sure all technicians would get the routs. If a technician called in ill we would give routes to other technicians. When the second person came in then we would make sure all technician got the routes and working. We would call the customers to give them eta's. If a technician needed more work we would call customers to offer sooner service. We would also call local suppliers to see if they have the part for the technicians so he could complete the call on the same day.  We had a system that helped you manage the time and you are able to work with your co-workers. The co- workers were great. The hardest part of the job was calling eta's when the computer system was down and could not see where the technicians are. I enjoyed my co-workers it was like one big family. If one was sick the others would step up and cover for that person plus check on that person.
good,helped me improve my productivity and tactile skills. Very helpful co-workers. Learned a lot about cars and maintenance.
good,"Had the pleasure of working with many different people,Everyone got along and worked well together to get the job done, Management was always around and took their time to let you know how you were doing. It was very sad for everyone to say goodbye after the distribution center closed."
good,"Great job but limited advancement"
good,"They were a great company, however they are no longer in the United States."
good,The job was pretty good. But as the holiday season ended so did my hours.
good,"accueil des clients ,nettoyer notre environnement, offrir nos produits,"
good,It was a great experience I would not mind working for Sears again.
good,Sears doesn't have the necessary resources to compete with its rivals.  I enjoyed the people I worked for and with
good,"It was a good first job for me. What I learned at Sears has actually helped me in my past and current job. My fellow employees were nice and fun to be around. The customers were always nice,  few were rude but it's retail."
good,"In the Softlines department of sears you run an entire department either by yourself or with one other person depending on how big the sales floor is for that particular department. the hardest part of the job is just time management because you have to leave the store by a certain time so you have to make sure your sales floor is clean and spotless while handling customers questions and putting your freight out and checking fitting rooms all before you leave the store. The Management staff definatly has favoritism, but your co-workers are very easy to get along with and will help you out."
good,"Great employees depending on your store. Management was good and really lead from the front. They do a good job of finding talent, though the pay isn't great."
good,"buen trabajo en equipo, excelentes asesores de venta."
good,"A fast paced work environment on the weekdays and holidays, learned a great deal on how to maintain composure with complicated customers."
good,"A typical day at this job for me simply includes assisting customers, cleaning the store and helping cashier."
good,Productive and fun workplace were u can learn many different things about shipping
good,Good place to work if you're looking for extra money. Got along well with staff. Learned a lot about cars. Hardest part is working in the heat. The best part is making money.
good,"shifts not too long, senior management is demanding. occasional long shifts but over all not a bad place to work."
good,I would ask for more hours. Can work 7 days a week. Love what I do. I work only daytime from 9-5. Love my coworkers.
good,"My days at Sears were long and dedicated. I was a sales Supervisor in Plumbing, Hardware, and Sporting goods. I assisted in stock room profiling and clean up. Stock Replenishment. Scheduling and teaching. I learned a Great many things at Sears, especially customer skills. Management at Sears was not always the best, but any well adapted employee can perform his/ her duties even under the worst of managers. There was the occasional stock work and heavy lifting to be done. Otherwise retail is quite the under mining task in the way of special hardened muscle needed. My most enjoyable part of being with Sears was the sense of accomplishment I got when I left the building. Not only helping the store but, helping the customer as well."
good,"A typical work day for me was managing the cash register, applying excellent customer service. I have learned to be kind to customers and help them any way I can. I would have to say the hardest part about a job is getting the job done the right way the first time."
good,Good college job. A lot of hours. Management was fine. Most enjoyable part was the co-workers
good,"every year more work was added to the job and there was a fast overturn of managers , resulting in having many bosses  over a period of time"
good,"A typical day at work is stocking and waiting for people to come into the store. I learned how to talk to people like a salesman and that sales really were not for me. Management was ok at best. I loved my co-workers, each one was nice and willing to help me. The hardest part was making sure you met your numbers. The most enjoyable was black Friday it made things fun."
good,"I specialized in family portraits. Responsibilities included great customer service, high-quality photographs, and maximizing sales. Skilled in working with children who are resistant to having their photo taken."
good,"Manage the sales floor.  From selling to stocking to customer service, we do it all.  Management has great communication.  Co-workers make the day more enjoyable.  Hardest part of job can be adapting to off-the-wall situations.  Doesn't happen all too often, though.  Most enjoyable part of job is knowing you get to meet the needs of customers."
good,"A typical day consisted of restocking shelves, cashier, money handling. I learned the importance of trust and honesty in the workplace. Co-workers and management were all fairly easy to get along with."
good,The job was simple . Perfect for a college student! Pushed sales of credits and wanted you to reach unreasonable amount of credit card sales!
good,"Sears is a fun and exciting  place to work, the department I currently work in a family orientent,friendly and appreciated environment."
good,laid back work unload a truck of merchandise organize them by category and prepare the merchandise to be moved to the floor
good,"Very helpful management"
good,was good company but pay is mostly commission so on a slow day you wont make much but can make good pay on holidays and weekends.
good,I have very much enjoyed my experiences at Sears.  My co-workers were the best part of my day in all three stores for which I was employed.  They gave me opportunities to grow and develop leadership skills.  The advancement opportunities were available when I was ready to try something new.
good,All the customers were very friendly and pacient. Sometimes the registers would stop working and that was the only downside.
good,This was my first sales job and provided me experience in face to face sales. I learned sales techniques such as building interest and direct closing. The ultimate skill I obtained from this position was the techniques used when dealing with disgruntled customers. In electronic sales you face many people who become very irate when they have issues understanding the product. This was a common occurrence and I built customer relation skills from it.
good,"je trouve le travail agréable parce que je l'expérimente en famille mes parents mes frères et soeurs, cousins, cousines sont touse la pour m'aider et me soutenir dans tout se trajet vers la vie d'adulte"
good,Sears was ok. A lot of keeping busy as there weren't many customers usually.

good,"Learned and advanced as a technician at Sears Auto Center.  I learned how to use all the tools, machinery, computer software necessary to perform my job.  Management was kind of a roller coaster, as managers come and go every year.  Always worked as a team in the shop and built a great team connection.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to make customers happy, while also being able to fix and repair automobiles."
good,Working with customers to meet their needs.Learning more about the use of computers and the products we sell. Management is supportive. Co-workers are easy to work with. Hardest part of my job is the language barrier with some customers. Most enjoyable part of my job is customer satisfaction\ dealing with the public
good,"Selling electronics on commission at Sears taught me a lot about how to talk and sell to people. I learned how to explain why this or that product was best suited for them. Also, how to explain why a Sears warranty is the worth getting based on the value of their product. I really did well in selling warranties with Televisions."
good,a typical day at work would usually be slow but at times very busy. I learned to stay prepared for any situation and always have a plan b. The management here was good however the managers were usually not around or too busy to talk. The hardest part of the job was selling reward programs to people who did not want to sign up for anything. The most enjoyable part of the job was the pay and the great energy from other employees.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of helping customers find the correct mattress for them, and then ordering it for them. I learned how to start up a new department and integrate it in a an already established system. The management was fair, but dependently not the most professional. My co-workers were a great part of the job, I made many new connections with them. The hardest part of a job was trying to explain to a customer that there was nothing more we could do fro them in particular situations, and they just wanted someone to yell at. The most enjoyable part of the job was conversing with my co-workers."
good,Was fun dealing with tools and helping people solve their needs.

good,A typical day at work starts by prepping our truck with eco friendly and safe cleaning products. Retrieve invoices to plan daily route. All customers are called prior to arrival to ensure cleaning will remain scheduled.  Upon arrival service tech gives a introduction by first name and explains their certification. Prep examination is taken place and customers are giving a final chance to ask question that pertain to the service. After authorization cleaning service is begun. Job is not completed until customer is satisfied. Afterwards service techs complete a post report and ensure the warranty by going over in detail.
good,"Un dia tipico de trabajo Junta del dia y , ventas atencion al cliente "
good,This was my first job out of High School. Overall I learned a lot in various areas throughout the store.
good,while waiting on customers to make buy their products off of slaes floor i go through different pallets and separate the items that are in them. as well as moving and stocking the floor with new products. this was more of a independent type of job where you have keep yourself busy doing something. the hardest part of this job would be keeping yourself busy.

good,"I worked as a sales consultant in the Lawn and Garden Department.  The job duties include selling and stocking the various merchandise in the department."
good,Selling home appliances to consumers. Work experience was challenging but worth every moment and hour at work.
good,good work place if good with people . you can a lot to little amount of money if you do not know the product
good,My day would start with phone calls and end with phone calls dealing with customer issues.  Mainly about where they where on their technicians list.  Some where calls on where their parts were that they ordered and we'd have to locate the part and advise the customer of this. My co-workers were very friendly and fun to work with.  I enjoyed helping the customers with disputes regarding if it fell under their warranty or not.  It felt like I was really helping them out and it felt good.
good,Commission sales is a very challenging way to work. You have to be hungry and passionate about helping the right customers to attach and get a great sale for good compensation.
good,"enjoying meeting and helping customers. each day different customers issues. Management great in helping associate succeed. Hardest part of the job- no sale minimum wage loan, During holidays prices are reduced and commision reduced and more sales with little pay. long working hours without sales. Impact on sales per hour goals."
good,"Customer service"
good,I usually came in at 9am and took a glance at the appointment book to see what the day was going to look like. I answered the phones to inspectors who sold furnace maintenance jobs and wanted a booking. I then checked our availability and open times in the book and landed a time agreement with the inspector.
good,"I enjoyed working as a team at Sears Loss Prevention.  I was also the main bookkeeper for the office.  Camera equipment was very good to work with.  We worked as a team at Sears, and were friends outside of work as well."
good,I took care of customers and dealing with them was fantastic.every persons were heipful.i enjoyed each part of my job.

good,"A typical day at work begins with a morning meeting about how the store did the day before. Then we go to work, we all have to make sure store is ready for business. As associates we all need to keep busy, by make sure we greet all customers, stocking the shelves with merchandise and making sure we take care of all the customers needs."
good,"This job is one of the least rewarding benefit wise, but being able to help a customer find an item and decide on a purchase was the highlight. Sears is located in a shopping mall so the foot traffic is high. In addition to cashier duties credit card applications had a major role in how many hours and money that a person made. There was always something to be doing. The cashier managers were beyond amazing."
good,"At my Store its more about who you know then what you know."
good,"a typical day at sears would be, making sure you are looking at your sales plan. Making sure the metrics ""rewards, credits, protection agreements are up"""
good,Sears is great to work with as long as you do what your position entails you to do. Selling Credit cards and SYWR's offers are tougher than the actual position due to having to meet a quota every month. They will monitor your progress of what sales you have done on a day. Only part time positions unless promoted to a high position within the company.
good,"It was a fun and fast paced environment and every day was different.  The company's head was in the right place and was moving towards a heavy focus on customer satisfaction and return business, but perhaps too late.  The company as a whole is on the fence right now as to whether it will stand the test of time or get phased out.  Career advancement is difficult with as the company doesn't promote from within as often as they should and naturally job security is uncertain at this point in time as the company's future looks bleak."
good,"This position functioned essentially as a stocker.  One was in charge of maintaining the flow of product from the warehouse to the sales floor, organizing bulk stacks and displays, and taking inventory in conjunction with placing orders for extra product.  Assembly of grills and exercise equipment was also part of the duties of the position.  Management was great for the most part, but for some reason, they were not a fan of my helping customers find product (confusingly enough, that was part of the job title)."
good,My manager was excellent to work for. Worked with a great group of people. Selling TV's was rewarding and I enjoyed going to work.
good,I update documents as well as call certain customers for appointments.
good,"Fun place with advancements. easy job, fun gift wrapping gifts for online customers. lots of breaks, nice staff."
good,"Typically a day starts with calling customers to verify problems and confirm arrival time. Driving a company work van, receiving parts and sending in used parts and keeping accurate inventory. Consulting with customer about cost, and time involved with repair and part arrival. Diagnosing equipment for repair, ordering necessary parts or going thru inventory on work van. Receiving payment from customers thru credit cards, cash, and checks. Explaining all repairs and logistics about maintenance and follow up care for unit repaired. Getting acceptance of warranty payments thru manufacturer and home warranty policies thru telephone calls."
good,Sears was a fun place to work . I liked to work with people and co-workers. Learned how to deal with customer problems . The job  was not a physical job

good,I have enjoyed working at Sears.  The co-workers were team players.  Management was fair.  I learned about the retail industry.
good,pleasant place to work good focus on team building. work with good people. good customer as well as employee relations. Always know what is expected of your work some benefits but little hours and very low pay compared to industry standers.
good,"It was a great experience, excellent co-workers and friendly staff management."
good,Usually a busy day waiting on customers and filling prescriptions for customers. I have learned a lot about customer service and how to work with people. Most of the mangers I have worked with I have taught me a lot about the particular job I was doing at the time.  I have enjoyed most of my co-workers and as with any job there are a few you do not get along with. The hardest part of my job is being on my feet for 8 hours a day.  What I enjoy most about my job is waiting on the customers and give them the best customer service I can possibly give.
good,"Sears is great,no raise in 5 years and working 6 days a week. The calls never stop. I have no time between calls to maintain tools, truck  on handle parts going back. What I mean by Sears is great is basically its a good job. Steady work and more overtime than anyone could want. It provides and income stream to keep the budget in the black. I work hard and I am a fast learner. I train other techs to do what I do. Out of the 172 techs i am normally in the top 5. I enjoy fixing things, I always have."
good,"A lot of sitting around getting paid."
good,Its a good place to work everyone is friendly and willing to help you learn. It is a good place to make money also you just have to work to get to it.
good,Hardest part of the job would had to have been making the numbers that were expected by the company during certain times of the year. There was some really slow times in the year so it was hard to make the numbers the company expected. Like trying to sell certain maintenance jobs.
good,"I enjoy working here, but there is a lot of pressure"
good,"Daily tasks include: Checking order volume and readjusting agents so that Service Level Agreement times are met. Checking attendance, previous day phone stats, agent metrics and productivity. Review emails and answer accordingly. Provide coachings to agents where orders were not worked in accordance to Policy and Procedure guidelines. Review orders for Fraud trends.

good,Having to train and work with new people was a great opportunity to better my people skills.
good,very productive place to work pay excellent focus on customer product first in first out able to do all tasks on a timely  manner lead by example 
good,"I haven't been at Sears in several years. But when I was there the big problem was the commission rates. They constantly pushed you to sell one brand over another by lowering commission rates on everything but the brands they wanted sold. And they were not very transparent about what the rates were. Also they paid on a draw commission system. If you didn't make enough commission to equal what ever dollar per hour they agreed to, then Sears paid you uo to that amount. But the next week you made more than that minimum dollar per hour they took back the extra they paid."
good,go in open store make sales the team was great managment wasnt so good but it was passable the hardest part was selling protection agreements most people dont even need them 
good,"A typical work day is having a customer walk in to the Electronics dept. and not buy anything but ask us as Sales People all about the brand new flat screen televisions. But that was our job, to fulfill our customers with a better understanding of today's technological television sets. What I've learned is how to become a better sales person and instill knowledge to all my customers about all our merchandise. Managers were very understanding and gave us the schedules we needed in order to have time for school. The job wasn't really hard, only the training in the beginning. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting paid a lot if we sold a lot. "
good,Great opportunities to those who are patient and focused on doing their job to the best of their abilities.  Will provide excellent customer service experience and salesmanship techniques.
good,"Overall it was a good company to work for.  The people that I worked with were very good people, hard workers.  The only problem was it's lack of benefits.  Typical day at work was helping customers with their needs, filling stock.  One thing that I learned working for Sears was how to run every department.  The hardest part was unloading tractors alone, either someone called in or was not scheduled.  Most enjoyable part would have to be the friendly customers and the good people that I worked with."
good,the work was good ..we working together as a team i learn alot of things that will help thrughout my life 
good,"There were no typical days at Sears. I learned a lot, mostly about safety and how to use certain tools. The management was nice and I had no qualms with anyone. the hardest part about the job was the lack of hours, this was also the best part."

good,"The team was welcoming and you felt like part of a family. The pay was pretty low, and the hours were extensive. There were a lot of weeks I was working 10 or more hours of overtime. The hardest part of the job was the customers and some of the poor policies implemented by the company. You were constantly getting yelled at for things that were out of your control. $11/hour just wasn't enough for what I was doing. My retail job in the mall pays that."

good,delivery gets heavy at times dealing with irrate customers
good,It was a great place to get my experience in Retail sales and management. I enjoyed it when I first began working for the company in 2005 but its value and culture along with customer focus slowly began to decline about 2009. I enjoyed working with most of the people there the entire time.
good,a typica day at sears i opening up my til and asisting customers in the hardware section.
good,"A day at work can be hectic, but that is what makes your day. I have learned the proper ways to help a customer understand what is going on with there car. The manager makes the job relaxing so that we can do our jobs well, if we are stressed then the customer notices and we also might make mistakes. My co-workers are great they have been a big help in learning the process of the job and we all get along well together which makes the job fun. The hardest part of the job is when customers get irritated they want to take it out on us, but they don't understand that we are not working on there car we only write the work order. We do try to give an accurate estimate of how long the work might take, but sometimes there are snags and we try to inform the customer of what happened. The most enjoyable part of the job is the the ability of all of us to work as a team, we help each other out and we also have fun with each other as we work, which makes the work day seem to go faster."

good,picked orders for shipment using fork lifts and different equiptment
good,"A typical day at work consists of a burrage of emails from multiple officials in the corprate ranks, most often the same email if not forwarded. With taking away from the constant micro managing the company could regain such power within the industry."
good,"Sears was a great experience, I loved it but I didnt see any advancement."
good,Aprendi a mejorar mis tecnicas con el cliente
good,Management duties were alot.
good,"A typical work day would include selling lawn and garden equipment with a goal for the day. Goals would include a certain percentage of the stock had to have an PA (extended warranty.) The management was real hands-off unless there was a visit from a regional manager, or you were below target on your goals. The part I enjoyed the most was selling to different kinds of people with a goals in mind."
good,Work involved normal cashier duties with the processing of credit payments and card activiation as well as assisting consumers with returns and exchanges.

good,The management at sears Oakridge Sears is less than to be desired to work for. I felt by the time I left sears I felt the management had let the whole store down with its inability to work with its employees and make the store feel like a warm place. I loved working Loss prevention you felt good when you caught some one stealing.
good,"I started with this company when I was 15 years old. This company went from a string focus on it's people to the bottom line. When I left in 2009, the feeling in the company was more of survival then success. People are the number 1 asset of a company and this company lost it's way."

The most enjoyable part was working with my co-workers."
good,"I really enjoyed working for a company that was totally out of my element. I've been in retail for quite a while but working there, I worked with appliances and tractors, tools etc. It was great to get to learn all the things I did while employeed there.

The most enjoyable part is when you do your 100% best job and the customer leaves happy and becomes a repeat customer."

good,"My typical day consisted of saling jewlery, pricing and merchandising. It was great meeting all the new people but the store had poor management."
good,Not a bad place to work when they are in sales force mode. Now they are shifting to work force mode and want to choke the life out of anybody who enjoys their job. The calls you make are tough but fun when you can overcome objections and close the deal.

I performed requested logistics operations regarding incoming/outgoing shipments utilizing company created computer software. I performed work associated with warehouse restructuring and monitored progress of this ongoing project. Several times, I was called upon to train and lead new employees.

good,I liked the job overall. It's good for a high school student.
good,I enjoyed working here and providing customer service to all.
good,A typical day is to try and sell as much service and merchandise as possible. In doing so keeping the customer happy and safe on the roads. I have learned more of how to relate my self in the treatment of all kinds of customers as well as co workers. The hardest part of the job is pulling tires and being out in the rain at times. The most enjoyable is when all attitudes sync.
good,Was recruited by the company and provided a good work enviroment until the the downsizing took place due to poor 4th quarter results by the company.
good,"As a first job i have in USA i've learned a lot at sears. Work with helpful associated who never hesitate to teach me all the basics on retail job and more. Have a great working environment, friendly co workers and supervisors."

good,it was a good job. management was good it was fast paced and a good environment. had a nice break room and good spots to relax at lunch. i would recommend
good,"A great company to be apart of their transformation."
good,Sears is a good job to have.  Despite the overwhelming financial issues at the company itself may have the work in five minutes Sears is genuine and welcome to the employees and guest.
good,"Good place to work, leads were pretty laid back job was easy. Hours were long and pay is on the low end. They train you on all their equipment, overall it was a positive experience."
good,"Its ok "
good,Great first corporate business experience with high standards for profit and productivity.  Need to be self motivated and driven to work there for success.
good,customers were tough to speak with at times. Had to handle anywhere between 60-80 calls in one shift. Employees were fun to work with and management was fair.
good,"Generally worked with customers who were trying to make a decision on electronic purchases, usually high definition televisions. It was enjoyable to hear customer inquiries and attempt to find solutions to their  predicaments with their entertainment setups. Very easygoing workday: be honest with visitors and do my best to help them. Management was there to help when needed, but was never hovering over my back."
good,Sears laid off the whole IT dept. They are bankrupt and needed to meet their numbers. They then hired a new team once the year was finished. I learned a lot there.
good,The job wasn’t bad at all they just wouldn’t work with my school schedule plus I got cheer captain so I needed to dedicate my time to that especially since it’s my senior year.
good,"As my first job, it was great, I made friends and it was flexible with my schedule. I had great co workers. The job wasn’t too overwhelming, which was great. It was busy at times, but other times it wasn’t. Had to be able to get people to sign up for credit cards, 5 a month."
good,The job itself is fun and sometimes challenging. The biggest downside is how hard you have to push in order to get people to sign up for the rewards program and credit cards. This is a huge part of the job and your hours are affected by your ability to do these things. Other than that the job is nice.
good,it was just a very competitive time for the company and they continue to struggle to stay relevant. the changing time of online shopping and the share of the appliance market and hardware and tools will continue to be the struggle in the future.
good,"Hi,my customer relationships one on one. I work all soft lines department.  I was on the pricing team to do sales. I displayed and did visual windows ( a few times)."
good,help customers in finding items they need. handles cash and any form of payments from customer. organized and tidy up when not busy at the cash register.
good,"Nothing particularly hard. The position of footwear associate is barely even available because commission pay is being phased out to hourly pay. Management was okay, nothing special and nothing that was especially bad."
good,It was a  professional  and clean place everyone got along the manger he made sure the  employee was comfortable....the work  schedule fit in with the employees everyone play there  position ......and the manger always went around asking was everyone ok and do they have any questions.....
good,I enjoyed working with people and helping to catch their memories. Sears was a great place to study and practice my photography and computer skills. I wish we had more time with clients.
good,Is a good company but they actually needs to improve some points. In my opinion should be more worry and condescendent with employees and definetly they have to work on how gain the attraction of young people
good,"Needs to improve, only worried about getting credit card apps, one manager told a friend that if she was sick to ""come to work and die there"" before staying home"
good,Very busy but enjoyable pulling the online orders for the customer. personally walking the order to the back of the store in a timely manner to either be picked up by the customer or by UPS. also assisting the customers in the store.
good,Sears hires people with little or no experience so it was nice to be able to start out with an entry level job. This allowed me to go to school and still have money of my own.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, con precion para cumplir con las metas del dia lo cual te ayuda a tener odjetivos diarios."
good,The Sears I worked at most of the employees got a long well.  We were basically a family as most have worked their for several years. Managers were great and we tried our best for the managers as they were good to their employees.
good,"Was offered a raise and never saw it. However, the people are great. Department manager was awesome. Really flexible and relaxed work environment. You could basically do what you wanted as long as your tasks were done for the day. Time went by fast. Free food at least once a month. Down to earth co workers and supervisors. My store closed down because of the bankruptcy. Would be better if the CEO never ran the company into the ground."
good,"Provided support to customers for home delivery for Sears."
good,It was a good work atmosphere but you were asked to do a lot of work and make sure that you stay under a number of hours and you weren’t paid enough for the stress of trying to stay under the number of hours .
good,I was able to learn as much as possible with my motivation of wanting to learn. I could make the time to learn some things that wasn't a part of my job description.
good,"It is a very comfortable and reliable job to work at, as it provides the employee with situations in which they can handle on their own. It is not a hand held job like others in the field, and it is very much enjoyable."
good,"Excelente empresa para laborar, tienes todas las presta iones de ley más todas las que te da la empresa ."
good,Management really pushed the sales of high priced items along with protection agreements and credit applications. The environment with associates was  pleasant
good,A typical workday checking the vehicle for oil and safety checks before heading out. I learned a lot about being there on time for the appointment set. The management were great people.The workplace culture was a great. The hardest part of the job was driving great distances from one location to another. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the customers face when their problem was solved.
good,I worked here for two years and loved most of it simply because of the people I worked with. I hated having to meet the goals for credits applications and the shop your way program. I felt that I was a competent worker but was occasionally made to feel like I wasn't doing my job well simply because of my metrics.
good,The day by day routine was very simple at my stores location due to the fact that it was closing down. I would mark down prices and also cashier during the day.
good,A typical day at sears was stocking and handling problems with team work. I would say the hardest part of the job was associates had to build grills. The most enjoyable part of the job was the associates and conversations we had.
good,"Overall, worked in a fast-paced , high energy position. Outside of team, there were less dedicated people holding back progress. Given more time and resources, the company could have made a real attempt at turning around business."
good,"like boot camp...early morning meetings and then go time! very fast paced, hot, dirty work, fun atmosphere. Team goal oriented relaxed management multicultural"
good,Typical day at sear was alright for me i learned a lot there management was cool and there always a teachable moment the hardest part was the getting commission the most enjoyable was everyone work well together
good,Hay talento dentro de la empresa que no se ha sabido aprovechar dado que a nivel corporativo la empresa no presta atención suficiente.
good,"Worked on truck after unloading truck worked on unpacking Shoes, Clothes, Tools when finished leave all merchandise organized for other employees to take and arrange to proper place in store, afterwards when truck was completed go to floor to work on shes."
good,Although they are going through a bankruptcy the service department is strong and one of the only divisions that still makes money for sears.  Management is good but their hands can be tied.  But they are trying.  I do love this company but I need more of a future than what they can offer.
good,Sears was my first job and it helped me start my working career. I was able to handle cash and learned to interact with costumers face to face. The job worked with my schedule while I was still in highschool. Overall all it was good first experience.
good,would setup for weekly sales. dealing with customers with complaints and issues. help with displays. would cash out customers. replenish merchandise. Put out new merchandise
good,Sears was a fast paced environment where I got to focus of customer satisfaction. A huge emphasis was placed on getting customers to sign up for credit cards and warranties. The most difficult part of the job was the language barrier with some of the employees. Although it was enjoyable when we found ways around it.
good,"As a manager for this company..it was challenging on a daily basis..."
good,An overall good experience.  There is ample opportunity to be exposed to new experiences.  Certainly the company is facing troubles time currently so caution is to be exercised.
good,"fast paced, no down time which was good; good pay and benefits; too many management changes; great team members to work with; everyone was very collaborative. travel as needed; great office space and offered employees on sight banking; dry cleaning; sundry shop and great cafeteria that offered anything you would need."
good,"Sears is a fine job that never overstressed me and the managers were all kind enough. Sears stores were always a mess so there was always something to clean, but the customers were nice for the most part and management was kind."
good,Me gusta más sin embargo es mucho tiempo y no muy buen salario
good,A day at Sears was filled with observing and coaching associate selling behaviors and driving sales.  Ensuring that the store presentation is excellent and well maintained.
good,"productive , structured, cordial ,great work life balance great people to to work with ,before shutting down for business every one was confused , if ,how and when it is going to happen"
good,"The two Sears stores are work with are now closed. While the national company struggled during my time there,  the local stores had great mattress departments.  The managers were helpful, staff members had a strong team sense and generally the customers were enjoyable to work with."
good,"Sears Portrait Studio closed. It is no longer an option for employment. I enjoyed working as a photographer there. I wish that I could go back, but this is not an option."
good,Es muy buena la empresa tiene muchas cosas buenans
good,"1st time working for sears was great in store out of los banos ca and it was a great Experience,  2nd time was in sales which just was not for me as no manager was present for any concerns, but the great part was talking to new customers everyday with a big smile."
good,I learned a lot. I fortunately was under good management where I was able to see the management side of things because I put the time in to learn the logistics of the job. A typical day though would be unboxing inventory and cleaning when not assisting the customers.
good,"Training  new hires"
good,Fun place to work low stress from management. Ability to work remotely. Lots of travel using your own vehicle. Partial gas reimbursement. long hours on daily appointments
good,"Loved sears until the end. We got announced we where closing and everyone started leaving. Had liquidators close the store no help, they where no sears."
good,This was a temporary job in the beginning then a part time position. There was no salary increase or benefits associated with this job. I learned more than what was required of me in a part time employee.
good,"They would always schedule too many people in the morning and customers would get mad that you're late. I was hired as a technician, not a salesperson. I am an excellent technician, however, I have trouble selling a customer something that I wouldn't buy."
good,Es una empresa rica en los valores que tenemos como.seres humanos que ya se estan perdiendo mucho tiene programas para.activar esos valores es una de sus cualidades y muy responsable en ese aspecto
good,"nice place to work,love cust service, great people to work with, manager was encouraging to new and old associates. Discounts were great, company also supplied work shoes"
good,"Working for Sears started out great. I was able to get the time off that I needed. The call pace was not too hectic. The goals for troubleshooting were not unrealistic and there was not as much stress on sales. Now, is a different story. Most people on my team are having a hard time just meeting goal. There is way too much stress on sales. We are never able to get time off without going against aour alotted attendance time."
good,"I was a seasonal cashier, I learned how  to use the cash register, transactions with using a credit card and promoting sears credit, customer care. I didn't like that the job ended and because after the holiday season business was slow and they were going to be closing that particular store."
good,Productive and fun workplace.  A good team environment.  Management was helpful and supportive when needed.  Allowed to work independently but had to be on top of product knowledge. Learning about all the products to market in the cosmetic industry.
good,directed all operational areas in this high volume business. increased business value and profit substantially. reduced costs and improved staff morale. improved overall customer satisfaction scores with quality service.
good,when i opened the store i go around the sales floor an make note what merchandise  i need to bring over from the warehouse with a forklift on truck days i would load an load trucks and reorganize the merchandise in the warehouse and stock room for the new merchandise
good,The training if applied was excellent.Communication between peers  created an environment of sharing and support when the proper district managers were involved. As time passed the security of employment became less and less due to frequent closings. We at store level were given the autonomy to increase traffic flow with creative promotional ideas and activities.
good,Great with flexible schedules but not enough hours if you're not a student.  Compensation is minimum wage but bonuses can be earned by getting credit apps and selling warranties/care plans as add ons.
good,"I worked in the photography studio as a lead photographer, managed the equipment, scheduled appointments, had a wonderful store manager over me. My location's sales were always up above average compared to other locations in the country, but the C-level management team committed fraud, was forced to declare bankruptcy and had to lay off all the photography studio employees with no notice."
good,"Working for sears is an very open place, in the terms of different culture and knowing the difference between satisfied customer service and no customer service."
good,I was a part time worker trying to save money for college. Sears was a good company to work for as I was working my way through college. The company was very supportive for those trying to advance in life.
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, existe el compañerismo, trabajo en equipo, comunicación con los jefes y horario cómodo."
good,Es un espacio que demanda compromiso y que permite desarrollarte
good,"I enjoyed working at Sears. The company was very understanding when family emergencies arose. I closed at night, which was preferrable to spend time with family."
good,Very hard place to work as your first job. They are very harsh on you getting people to apply for credit cards . But it’s a decent first place just hard when most people don’t want a credit card or they already have one .
good,"Very fun place to work to and very good management. Good company culture , and company diversity, very essay customers and friendly, Good company benefits."
good,"Accueillir les clients"
good,"This company was great to work for until 2010. From that point forward in efforts to save the company the turnover at the CEO level was extreme. Each new CEO had their own idea on how to save the company. Unfortunately, although many of them had great strategies they were directionally different then the previous team. The turnover, was too quick , to implement any one strategy completely which eventually left the company bankrupt."
good,Really relaxed but fast paced environment. Only annoying thing is the lack of communication between different departments and the amount of cold transferring with customer calls that got overwhelming.
good,"El ambiente de trabajo es bueno, porque socializas con muchas personas. El problema de este lugar es su administración. Ya que todos dependemos del corporativo o de compras para realizar devoluciones de algún producto dañado."
good,it's a job. you start your day from home and your schedule is scattered around Georgia. some days your local and other days your everywhere. my co-workers are a good group of people. but sometime work gets overwhelming.
good,"i worked there during liquidation, so it tended to get rather busy but other than that all associates were comfortable around each other. It was a time to sell everything and remember moments from past years. I would learn new things everyday and always had someone to help me"
good,It was a great company to work for. Very talented leaders. Unfortunately all the hard work did not pay off as it was a little to late. I took away a ton of great learnings.
good,"I was let go when I got sick,had to take a day off. Doesn't seem to be an appropriate training schedule for the particular position I was training for. Co-workers were great and quality of work place is top  notch. Would recommend as a good place to work,if you can handle it."
good,Great job to keep money flowing seasonal. Becomes boring after a while. very strict.Great discounts. Can become very messy during sale days. Easy to keep up with the paste.
good,Made a lot of life-long friends. Okay place to work at to help get through school. The hardest part of the job was when a co worker left. I learned great customer service skills.
good,"I would open up my department which was electronics. Turn all products on. Get the cash drawer counted. Do signing for sales. Keep area clean I also sold vacuums,accescories, camera's, speakers and sound bars, Blu-ray players. Last but not least put a smile on a returning customer face and help their families."
good,"It was a very easy job. I had time to speak with coworkers and get all my work done. Some of the managers were easy to get along with and were very helpful. Others did not handle situations very well. But overall, a very easy and great first job."
good,"buen lugar de trabajo, depende de la zona son las comisiones"
good,"Reviewed problems with customers to identify their problem and part they required by description sometimes, or photos send by email, or sometimes by name of part.  This included  for all appliances, machinery, tractors, tools,snow plows,lawn tractors,  electronic and virtually everything  sold and warrantied by Sears.  "
good,"I had a chance to work in multiples departments, very challenging to learn the details for each job. A typical day was filled with deadlines,"
good,"- Good company to gain knowledge in different fields"
good,"I enjoyed working with the staff and improving the work place. making sure the warehouse is in perfect condition, and working with the store managers."
good,I enjoyed working at sears. the staff were very nice. Not enough full time employees to get projects done. Full timers were overworked and part timers were not getting enough hours.
good,The average day consisted of helping customers with retail purchases. Stocking the sales floor and maintaining organization on sales floor. Supervised the stock time and replenished the sales floor accordingly
good,Overall it was an alright place to work at. Got paid well and the hours were good. Got paid a little late a few times because direct deposit wasnt a thing there.
good,Answered phones to renew service plans. Sold service plans to customers that didn't have coverage on their appliances. Took payments for additional service plans and ordered new appliances.
good,The people that work there are awesome however the management not so much. Hardlines is the place to be if you want good management. The store manager is not great to work under but if you do what you are asked or if you stand up and say no then your good to go.
good,I do enjoy helping people and Sears has been a US staple that I have been happy to be part of. Sears is still a professional retail environment which is something very different now days in the retail world.
good,"While working at Sears  for three years I learned many skills. One main skill was customer service, having this skill helped me on stressful days that were very busy. Another skill was always being punctual, this skill allows management to see that the job matters to you. The most enjoyable part of the job was always meeting new people and always having a positive vibe around."
good,"A typical day at work consists of interacting with customers and co-workers. Some days are more fast-paced than others. The manager was laid-back and let you do your job without micro-managing. The workplace culture was great, everyone got along well with each other. The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers with their purchases."
good,I began in credit and collections department at Sears then moved into   the accounting office and kept an handle on customer appliance orders from our warehouse in Hagerstown.  When an application was not available I worked to get a comparable appliance for the customer.  I worked several reports in the office.  Took credit payments and balanced the money in the morning of the next day.  This was back in 1969 to 1993 and there was great management and the workplace was very pleasant to work in.Loved it there.
good,"The day can be really slow at times, and at other times overwhelming  with customer waiting in line usually not to pleasant by the time they get to you. They want you to make a sales quota by offering all the services and sometimes the customer doesn't want bothered with the  upselling sales talk."
good,"Los supervisores tienden a hacer a un lado los problemas de los empleados, sienten que tienen el poder para ostigar a uno. No se prestan a escuchar los problemas que uno puede tener."
good,"c' etait tres agreable , bon superviseur, salaire un peu bas pour survivre mais bon!"
good,"I enjoyed my time at sears outlet."
good,"Es una empresa socialmente responsable, el apoyo en cuestion de problemas personales o modificaciones en cuestión de los horarios de trabajo es muy bueno lamentablemente carece de equidad laboral ya que no toman por igual a todos los colaboradores habiendo mucho favoritismo en algunos departamentos de cada tienda"
good,"When your busy it's great, but if there is no traffic, it's slow and  stressful.  Manager is expected to run all social media and outreach events to bring in members.  But the company pays fairly and really works to build work home balance and allows stores to run pretty independently no mircomanaging.  As long as your store is performing your left alone to do your thing"
good,"there is a lunch room and a lot of comradery.There is air conditioning and heating. Lots of friendly workers. mandatory meetings. computer training. the managers are nice. there is no one looking over your shoulders, a lot of independence"
good,Enjoyed building our team and training everyone.  Introducing new procedures and working through options to present the best outcome.  Team was relaxed and great.
good,"work 8 hours a day "
good,"I love interaction with people, I always met my goal also I've extended help in other areas with my co workers in the warehouse. My overall experience with sears have been great."
good,"A typical day of work was fun,especially helping the customers with whatever they needed. I learned to be patient and observant."
good,"Sears is was a wounderful place to work..good environment, great people to be around..i the training that i recieved while working at sears basically helped prepare me for any and every job that may come my way..i worked and managed several departments while working at sears...The benefits as well as online trainind helped further my knowledge in every area of my job..unfortunately the company seems to be closing a lot of stores and it really doesnt seem to be a future anymore..sadly aftwr 26yrs ill have to move on and find another career...Sears has prepared me for just that i definitely owe the a dept of gratitude"
good,Sears is a good company. there were just not enough  hours during none holiday seasons. it was fast paced holiday season but during non holiday season it was very slow paced and  without much of a challenge.
good,"Was a good place to work. Unfortunately the store went into liquidation."
good,"Typical workplace that cares for their employees. Good teamwork among associates.  Relax environment and everyone being there to help each other.  Management open to associates concern,  Hardest part of the job was being there for everyone to help complete job assignments.  Most fun was the feeling of having another family away from home."
good,"it was a great job to have .  Typical day at work doing basic job duties loading un loading truck, cleaning the area making sure everything was on point ."
good,"I enjoyed my years with Sears, I was fortunate to work with some very talented people and would have remained with the company for many years to come if the opportunity had been afforded."
good,"Sears is a very good place start your first job, especially for college students. They work around your schedules if you have school and are very flexible with hours"
good,"working at sears was great, the managers were very nice and helpful, the only problem was some of the customers didn't like the return policy and the co-workers like to talk bad about each other."
good,Everyday I would come in to work and I would always know what to do. My bosses trusted me alone with my department and they knew I was working hard. The other employees made okay work friends  however there was a lot of unnecessary drama and things that did not belong in the work place. Sears is a great place to work for a short but not long term.
good,"very Productive  and fun place to work especially  on the weekend"
good,Sears was an amazing place to work. I learned a lot my management  team and peers.. Through out my many years at Sears I developed many skills working throughout the store.
good,It was a fun laid back job did not pay well or offered career advancement .Safe work place and great co-workers. Management was not supportive enough in the way of pay increase and job security.
good,"In a typical day,i assisted the customers,help restock the shelves,ordered clothes for customers,signed customers up for credit applications,and layaway,return and purchases.The management wasn't up to par with the needs of the coworkers in the fashion I was accustomed to.I did keep that to myself not to step on anyones toes,keeping a professional manner.i did learn a great deal and was treated well however.The hardest part of the job was the salary and fear of the store closing.The most pleasant was the coworkers,and customers in which I received rewards for my customer service and credit apps."
good,"Sears is a good place to work. Locally, it needed to become the Best Place to Work. Having annual raises would be a good plus. HR Department was very friendly."
good,Good place to work but no benefits for part time .Managers are friendly and helpful . Learned a lot of things there which gave me more confidence.This job taught me a lot of new and good things.
good,Enjoyable place to work. Sales can be slow at the location I'm at. I would like a faster pace environment. Where there is more business.  Where I'm at now there is too much down time.
good,Sears is ah wonderful store to work at you learn a lot there they treat you fair they work you kinda hard but you have to work that way cause once you clean up in fold everything soon as you leave people comes in mess everything up
good,A typical day at work was nothing to crazy enjoyable. I apriciate them giving me the chance to work there and meet a lot of great souls. The management always being very helpful
good,"was great before kmart take over, district and regional managers sucked and came and went.  lots of stress, sales pressure.  you had to maintain high credit card acquisitions, maintenance agreements."
good,"Learned to handle the jewelry dept on my own."
good,Moved up fairly quickly and our management team is very coorporative and communicates very well. Learned how to manage a team and motivate them to increase their monthly metric goals.
good,"It is international company with excellent customer service."
good,Loved working there because i got to use my artistic skills in the visual department. i was promoted very quickly. it was a great first job to have. would do it all again
good,"Un dia en sears es dar tu mejor cara para atraer el mayor numero de clientes sin necesidad de buscarlos, conocer tu producto para poder dar alternativas al cliente y ser creativo para convertirte en favorito"
good,"Production line assembly, shipping and receiving, complete order for truck delivery, quality control, restocking and general labor. "
good,"sears was a good place to start your automotive knowledge.. They sent you to classes to learn new things.. You learn about brake, suspension , tire and even batteries.."
good,"agréable expérience, manque de communication entre les directeurs."
good,"It was such a great place to work at store level.  However, upper management does not realize the company is hemorrhaging money and try to keep everything running on fewer hours with less help across the board.  The company is near bankruptcy."
good,"I enjoyed the job for the time I was there, and learned to be a hard working individual. The pay was good for what it was, but I felt like I needed more."
good,"Es un día normal "
good,"I learned how to assist customers in many ways and learned in-depth how to efficiently work in a retail environment. For examples, handling various money transactions, resolving customer related inquiries, and displaying sale items properly."
good,"The company is very goal and profit orientated and does not focus and care about the individual, they are looking for a bottom dollar and dont see you as a long term person"
good,"Great warehouse manager, a lot less to do with Sears, but a lot more to do with the current management leader. (My boss specifically) But the general staff are mediocre at best."
good,"Very slow paced and lagging, no real hard work or stressful situations. Management was always very nice and helpful, but low wages combined with long and boring days made for an unhappy work environment."
good,"alright, learned custmer service skills               , gets boring after w hile but fairly easy, customers are nice and they are very leinient, sweet, and understanding"
good,I loved working at Sears and only left to help a family member. I learned many lessons about inventory and organization and people skills. I enjoyed virtually every assignment and every customer I had the pleasure of serving. Fair pay for fair work.
good,"The typical work day is 8 hours long."
good,"As with any entry level position, the allowance for taking on larger more complex tasks can be strictly regulated. Even with that being said, management is very supportive of employee progression and growth. When shown initiative, management will actively provide employees with tools to grow within the company; making information about classes and seminars readily available. These actions coupled with the expressed personal interests in employee growth, make for positive moral and a motivated staff."
good,"En general estaba bien todo, tanto sueldo,ambiente de trabajo y si había oportunidad de crecer pero me tuve que salir porque quería terminar mi especialidad para poderme titular y no se presentaron los tiempos para combinar ambas cosas."
good,"I found working very rewarding.  I could help customers with complaints or without and this would make me feel great to be able to   make them happy.  I love find out new things and how to others how to do it.  Associates came to me a lot to find out how to do things and where different things were at in reports, computer,etc.  I felt good about myself that I could help anyone. I felt as if I belonged there to be of help.  We had  a monthly board with associate birthdays employee of the month, anniversary. "
good,This position was highly competitive and stressful.  Collections was only one facet of the the Credit Central and probably one of the more difficult to perform.  The most difficult role as a collector was the inability to be compassionate towards another human being who may have simply fallen on hard times.
good,"Can be very stressful especially during the holidays, management can be harsh on you. Overall, its something different everyday and you really get to learn new things with fun people."
good,There is not much room for advancement.  The hiring process takes far too long.  For example there are sometimes only 3 workers on the whole floor to close making it very hard to tend to all customers in a timely manner!
good,If advancement was open would be a great place.  The problem lies with the upper management and the unwillingness to listen to the people on the front lines.
good,"Fast paced, high volume, but enjoyable environment taking photos of families, babies, children.  Customer service focus. Opportunity to manage all aspects as though it were a small business."
good,"Will miss the culture and rewards learned so much with opportunities given to me and we tried really hard to save Sears , It`s great when someones recognizes the Brand"
good,"I provided a number of sales associate duties for customers at Sears in various departments. Responsible for cashier services and upselling credit products while processing purchases. "
good,The company cared about their work. Very understand when it came to caring for your children and offered good scheduling. paid commission in some departments
good,"It's a great place to work when you are in school. Have nice and friendly staff. The hardest part about the job, is that you have to get credit applications."
good,management was pretty great and did their jobs very well. my job was mostly as a cashier and the staff working with me was very knowledgeable and very helpful during training. only reason for leaving is Sears is closing.
good,Its a job it could be better but Its not the worst. there is plenty of room to grow but the company choose not to. the meet an greet is great the friendly kind staff is really there best asset .
good,had an amazing manger when i first started their replacement wasn't great but wasn't terrible. i worked straight commission and it because of slow days it was kind of feast or famine. overall its been pretty good.
good,"Great Company however current financial situation hampered experience. People are great to work with, very cooperative. Management is great and really involved in success."
good,I enjoy working at Sears because I enjoy trouble shooting problems and working with people.  The hardest part of the job is not having enough parts to complete my service.  I do enjoy learning and being trained on new appliances and I hope in the future that companies will keep us informed and up to date.
good,Sears is a great place to work. Unfortunately retail business especially big box concept is struggling due to online buying. Company is no longer stable.
good,"Every day is wonderful surrounded by hard working people trying to make a difference in the company's future. "
good,"Take cases, Call member to assist with either and cancellation or a rering (process new item for delivery) of an incorrectly ordered item or an item that does not fit to assist with locating an item that will work work for the space provided. Follow up on day after the new delivery happens and make sure the member is satisfied with everything form the time I took on the case until the follow up after the delivery"
good,I like working here the staff is wonderfull at my current location. The money is ok and competitive with other auto companies. The work is steady but also retail
good,"Very competitive ,commission varies it help the pay. You have to push credit. Managers are ok. You have to follow your schedule that is made for your lunch or get write up. It's an ok job."
good,I learned a lot in this job. This was my first management position. Sales became fun for me here and I found how much I enjoyed photographing families.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is giving satisfaction to customers. Working as a team to make it right in difficult situations.  Spending 8 hours a day with good people and having fun when doing our job. These are the values we stand behind at our Company. Concentrate on family needs.
good,"Sears was my first job ever but it had a lot of nice people working at sears but the reason I left was that sears paid me only $8.10 an Hour and it was a fast paced job, customers would have a lot of clothing or shoes and toys, I would have to scan them , put the items in a sears bag and I would have to take their form of payments but I would have to do that everyday for only $8.10 an hour, it really wasn't worth it ."
good,It was a fun and fast-paced environment. I had a wonderful time with my co-workers. Managers are a bit uptight and demanding. Overall the job is manageable.
good,"Working at Sears is a fun experience. Very simple work, great co-workers, and some great managers."
good,"Learned patience and time management.  Days were stressful, however the smiles on families faces after capturing a memory is priceless and holds no cost."
good,"I prepare payroll weekly for main store and automotive. We all work well together. We laugh and joke but when it's time to work, we work. Help is given in any area of the store by all of us.  It's a good group of people to work with."
good,Placing replacement parts order for home appliances and lawn equipment. Locating local replacement parts for lawn equipment and home appliance and checking parts orders.
good,i enjoyed working at sears holdings but was let go due to lack of work but overall the work environment was laid back with everyone knowing and doing their job
good,"It was a good place to work part-time while being a full-time student. Nothing exciting about it, the only bad thing I want to highlight is their old cash registers and software that could stop working in the middle of transaction."
good,"Usually, days at work here would regularly go by pretty slow unless a holiday was right around the corner or the store itself was having multiple choice items on sale for a limited time. But although it being  a relaxed work environment, when you had work assigned to you it did consist of much concentration to get everything right when it comes to tending to the customer. If they either had to make a payment for their card, or want to lease something from the store, focus was key to having a great workday with no bumps along the way.Re"
good,"Es una empresa buena para trabajar pero como en todos lados hay gente prepotente que se cree amo y señor del universo y lo peor resulta ser que son los mismos superiores los que dictaminan esa ley , si quieres un reto este es tu trabajo ideal porque hay cada cosas que te preguntarás como es posible esto pero bueno"
good,great place to work if you like to shop. I learned how to work from an undercover LP associate and how to blend it. Greatly improved how i talk to people (ie) getting a shop lifter to come back into the store after we caught him/her.
good,Good work culture.  Lots of Product knowledge.  Must work well with the public.  Sometimes there are lots of problems to solve. It takes patients and professionalism.  Protection Agreements are pressured to sell and graded on performance. Sales follow-ups and call backs to customers are required.  Straight commission sales compensation.
good,"Working environment was great and co-workers were so nice like a big family.  Good facilities for staff, i.e. quiet room for break time and nice lunch room!!  Convenience office location, easy access by public  transit.  So missed the job!!"
good,"I am responsible for diagnosing, Trouble Shooting, repairing or ordering parts to repair household appliances including washers, Dryers, refrigerators, Gas and Electric Stoves, Microwaves, Dishwashers, Ice makers. I also maintain a company van stocked with replacement parts for repair."
good,My first job out of highschool  They worked with my college schedule so that I could get as many hours as my schedule would allow. The employees were nice to work with and my manager was really nice.
good,Sears was an okay experience to hold me over while I was looking for a career job. I didn't like having to start at $7.25/hour but I met and worked with some good people.
good,It's a really fun and relaxed place to work at. For the most part everyone is friendly and willing to help if you have a question about something. Fairly relaxed on when you can take breaks/ or lunch as long as there's enough coverage.
good,"not having enough cashiers"
good,"Fun place to work. Lots of different people come though for portraits."
good,"At Sears I was responsible for all door guards which I recorded and gave this to my Loss Prevention Manager every month, and my door was the merchandise pickup area and the security of store merchandise entering inside and outside was important for the Loss Prevention room and I was inside help for management for the company complaints.  I assisted the management to collect money transfers, at the end of the shift was relied onto to secure the management to collect all registers, and input into safe with my signature at the end of each tour. I also sometimes counted the jewelry department for the diamonds sold and left into store. Kept all door secured and ended with the management to allowed all members out the door and lock the door."
good,this was my first job and it worked out that. they were willing to train just as long as your willing to learn they will train you. i do think that this would be a good first job for someone
good,A good place to learn if you are not fully competent in repairing product.  Support for the technicians is good.  Sales appears to be their main focus instead of providing excellent service for the customers.
good,Wasn't much to it. Pretty simple job. Not much experience required and okay pay. You drive around a lot and some deliveries are harder thank others but that comes with every job.
good,"working here was a good learning experience, this was my first job as cashier. a typical work day here was mostly going to work in the night for closing, i usually worked closing shifts."
good,"A decent place to work they are fair and don't  treat"
good,They put a lot of pressure on getting customers to sign up for their line of credit within the store. The amount of new cardholders you obtain determine the hours you get essentially.
good,"Loved working for this company, Customers were always loyal, My most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers, being and friendly, Management always tried to create a fun work environment for everyone, there were not too many hard parts of the job except if a customer is dissatisfied no matter what, A typical day was quiet and you usually see same loyal customers, kind of busy."
good,lots of training available- room for advancement if you're willing to put in the work and wait. Very flexible with scheduling. teamwork is a must but i found that was lacking a lot in this store.
good,"I have fun there because of the people I know, they were flexible with my schedule as well. The register is easy, you meet a lot of people there. Management can improve"
good,"18 years ago Sears had a different culture, It was a great company up until couple years ago. Company is no longer focused on customer, I feel. They continue to give associates more work and less hours to do it in. They no longer care about the morale of the associates. I did learn so much from the years that I was with Sears and I do thank them for that."
good,"Work was great, met a lot of great employees, customers for the most part were good. I loved working there. I learned a lot about cashing out, opening the store and closing."
good,"Have to meet required cold sales. Was stressful but fun at the same time. Dress code was relax and as long as you like to talk to customers, it's the right place to work. Not much advancement opportunities though."
good,"Great people. Great products."
good,Very slow even though it is a good place to work at not a lot of business. Would sell lawn care tools and fitness equipment. Learned a whole lot about tools and lawn stuff just in general like lawn mowers and power tools and saws. Management was good and loved my managers. Hardest part was learning all the tools and getting it in my head. Most enjoyable was connecting relationships with customers.
good,J aime y travailler. J aime les gens avec lesquelles je travail.j y travail depuis 36 ans.
good,"Really good benefits and hours, lots of advancement opportunities. Lots of shift options as well as postions. Poor communication throughout the entire company."
good,"I liked the workplace and employees. Management was great until a new manager took over. He knew his job well, but he was young, immature and disrespectful to his workers."
good,It was a ok place to work. Just have to look for yourself. Be prepared to follow VERY close instructions on how something needs to be done. Or get written up
good,"Ultimately I enjoyed my work with Sears as a Systems Operator. The people I interacted with were very kind and motivated. Sometimes I would have to assist someone when I was off - duty, but this was expected in my position to a degree. "
good,for the most part i loved working their the most recent manager that was their didnt see that the program that was there was working great and had the attitude of its my way or no way.  other then the most recent manager that has left the store i loved it there and wouldnt mind going back to work thats the only issue i have with them..
good,"Although this job was stressful since it was very busy, I learned a lot , such as: cash-handling, answering phone calls, customer service, etc. I enjoyed this job a lot, it had a friendly environment."
good,"The hardest part of the job was trying to keep your commission at a high level, the associates were always friendly and i love talking and helping the customers."
good,A typical day at work would include assisting customers for the first hour until the store closed. Associates would then proceed to the back of the store and begin bringing boxes and fright to different parts of the store. Associates would then restock areas of the store that required to be restocked.
good,A typical day at Sears is helping customers with whatever questions or concerns they have. What we do is refolding merchandise and maintaining a clean environment. stocking merchandise and helping the cashiers.
good,"A typical day at Sears can be stressful, but it comes along with knowing you are trying to make a difference"
good,Sears had good hours but they were long because it was a slow paced environment. Overall I had very little bad customer encounters and the employees were friendly.
good,Sears has an excellent work life balance that a lot of people enjoy.  There are perks to working for the Buying office and everyday there is something new you will learn.
good,"I liked working at sears because i was taught new things that i never knew before such as folding clothes a certain way , doing signs clocking in and out for lunch . the fitting rooms are pretty stressful."
good,"A very enjoyable and challenging work environment where you have to be 100% sure on what you do and how you do.with most in-house training i learnt how to manage time and effectively work on cars , the management had been great despite working under different managers,working with co-workers was fun and enjoyable as we also shared our experience in solving complex issues.the hardest part was to work in winter as there was no heater"
good,"Company allowed me to advance. Sears initially was a great place to work. There were more than 400 employees when I started. I applied for all clerical positions that were available. I advanced and received three promotions. The Pay was comparable to other warehouses in the Memphis are. The Management staff overall were respectful. They allowed for crosstraining in other departments, which allowed for experience and more work hours during non peak times. Would love for the Unit to remain viable but economy and decisions caused it to close."
good,I renewed the service contracts on all appliances and lawn equipment. Basically was a sales job that was based on commission. Hardest part is just dealing with upset customers
good,"As a salesman, if your numbers are not good it will be stressful. I did not mind working there but when it is time to unload carts that can be a lot of work."
good,"Retail is a tough field to be in, especially if its a retail business that is known for its cheap prices. Their marketing attracts the lowest common denominator and will kiss their feet as long as their money is in their pockets at the end of the night."
good,"Daily duties w Sears was taken inbound calls from members regarding concerns with their contracts for service, parts and repairs. Filed complaints, and finding a resolution for our member. 99% of our calls were members who were irate and required immediate attention."
good,This job as the best I was an MCA which that is a big part I got a really close bond with 1 of my managers and she's like a mom to me now and the only reason I left is because the store closed
good,"The work changes from day to day, which keeps me from ever getting bored. My co-workers and managers are great to work with, and we enjoy each others company. Only problem is that it doesn't pay too well, and I can't negotiate for a greater position, higher pay, or even consistent hours. Only a handful of non-commission jobs get full time, and I am not one of them."
good,"It was my responsibility to interface between stores and online catalog and phone ordering for customers. I directed customers to appropriate departments, ordered and shipped merchandise, and set-up returns where necessary.We handled about 300 calls daily, but the team leaders made it fun. Our training classes were the best because we were ahead of the products we were providing to our customers."
good,"Great atmosphere for dealing with customers, and a fantastic learning environment. At times, physical labour intensive, which was great for me. I enjoyed this job, and the employees I worked with, and the owners I worked for."
good,"Work life is very comfortable and I've had the opportunity to learn a lot of digital systems and promotional tools. This has given be great ecommerce experience over the past year. Sometimes the company can be so big that it is hard to pinpoint a specific group's responsibilities, or who can help fix a given issue."
good,during my time there the work was fairly simple and as long as you did your work you were fine. before I left they wanted us to start getting people information to keep them in our customer books which was a little hard to do.
good,"I am to make sure all paper work from the day before is put away in the correct day. make sure all workers are here at work and they know what to do for the day. write up tickets to car that come into the shop. make sure the day run smooth. Training is very important make sure all know what and how to do there jobs, always follow up on each job."
good,Sears was a great place to work easy to pick up and always a nice mood from fellow workers. bosses always had a kind word or something to make you feel like part of the team
good,"it was good and the hours where fair had to cashier and fold and stock the floor in the clothing departments .           "
good,"This was a great place for employment. Worked with an excellent group of guys and a great manager. Was close to home and the hours were decent. The pay could have been better, but I was only there a short time, due to having to move."
good,Call center work can be both rewarding and stressful. The pace of the work and the flow of the calls can keep you on your toes. Great people delivering very positive results. The front line supervisory team did a great job of keeping the employee's upbeat and positive. Relaxed atmosphere with a causal dress. Additional opportunity to earn extra income based on sales as well as local contests and awards.
good,"a good company to grow with your technical skills, kept motivated to learn and sharpen your skills. Gives a chance to work with cutting edge technologies."

good,loved working there. Friendly place to work. Nice managers. Good discounts. good job training. professional environment. lots of fun but also hard work.
good,"At sears, it is always about the member and finding solutions to their everyday needs and getting them the perfect fit. Advancement opportunities are there all you have to do is work really hard for them and make yourself stand out like at any other place. Great thing is that you get to work with many different ranges of customers and thats how you see how your best skills are put to work"

good,We would load and unload trailers every night. The work environment was fun and energetic. Management was good and always willing to help as we needed it. The hardest part was unloading trailers and the best part was the co-workers.

good,"No benefits, always have to work weekends but it is a very huge team environment management is great and very flexible. Everyone that works there are true team players."
good,"Great place and great people. Management is trying their best to satisfy the corporate. Serve, Delight, & Engage customers. After training (watch and learn from the pros), you'll have all the stuff down on a typical day. Help customers on a busy day, down time work stock, prices, and POGs. Don't forget to sign them up to be a Shop Your Way Member or that'll hurts your metrics."
good,Started part time and I asked what to do to get more hours. Store manager told me to get credit applications. I eventually became one of the top producer of getting credit cards applications. New store manager had me to trained other cashiers and eventually became head cashier and over the jewelry dept..I worked under the assistant manger. There was a new store manager every year till it closed.
good,buen ambiente entre empleados se establecen relaciones interpersonales con facilidad

good,"Interacting with customers all day, helping customers find what they need. This was my first job doing customer service work so it was very helpful, the management and employees were nice."
good,"Working at Sears was not at all difficult work. However, business was always slow and therefore terribly boring. The people were very friendly and helpful, but it was not an environment in which a young adult would enjoy working."
good,"es una empresa en la que el ambiente de trabajo es muy agradable, lo unico malo es que se trabaja demasiadas horas y no son remunerables las horas extras , ni con pago de tiempo, y pues eso hace muy estresante ya que no hay ningun beneficio economico."

good,Sears was a great place to learn how to work with others and gain a knowledge of customer service.  The people who work there are friendly and willing to help.
good,Unfortunately company not doing as well for my needs as a salesman so my needs are not being met.The most difficult part of day is waiting for clients. The salesmen are frustrated and causes some envy among the staff.  I am an experienced sales person who needs to contribute to any company .
good,"The workplace is very slow during weekdays, unless it is holiday seasons or after holidays. The management are a great group to work with, they expect you to do your job at your very best, however they push selling the Sears credit card a lot. They expect you to get three ""NO"" from the customer when asking about the Sears credit card, you have to be persuasive."
good,The environment was good.  All the employees were a joy to work with.  Working as a backroom associate was different every day.  A typical day at work was always different.  One day a truck will arrive and we unload it.  Then all of the unloaded merchandise is processed.  The manager was great.  I enjoyed working for him.
good,"I enjoyed working in my department. I had amazing coworkers and customers. It was in walking distance of my home. And I learned many new things about jewelry and creating planograms,"
good,"While I was not there very long, it was a positive attitude for the most part. The job was slow most days, but the team stayed as busy as they could while still doing their job."
good,Sears was a good place to work. I learned a lot about the automotive  field while I was working there. It was a good fast pace work environment.
good,"Une belle opportunité d'emploi, une compagnie très multiculturelle, possibilité d'avancement et des avantages sociaux."
good,very high expectations with little room for advancement. 5 years of my life and nothing to show for all of my hard work and patients. It would have been nice if Sears cared about customer service and employee loyalty.
good,"If you know how to do your job correctly and he professional as well as keep in mind all the store promotional things you'll honestly be just fine. Almost all of the managers are AMAZING, thoughtful and fun and usually coworkers are cook as well. But it can be boring during slow seasons."
good,"Working at Sears was a great experience. sears gave me the opportunity to raise my children while working full time, with plenty of room for growth. Being part of the store planning and design to provide customers with a great shopping experience was a very rewarding position."
good,Learning on what I was going to do for this company and who I was going to be working with was fun and I was very excited but the job as a whole being a cashier to me is honestly rather boring... I don't feel I am being given full opportunities to work to my full potential with this company
good,"This was a great company to work for. I had a lot of on the job training. The guys always offered me a helping hand, even when I did not need one. If I ever had any questions, they always would be answered! I enjoyed working with this team and often think about going back for a side job, only because I enjoyed being employed with their company."
good,"Apprehended customer that leave the store without paying for merchandise and and recovered, fill out the appropriate paperwork involve with the situation and prepared to court in a monthly basis, report any internal or external, surveillance the store via camera room (CCTV) "
good,Salary raises are not much if they ever happen even gaining advancement. The most enjoyable time at work was dealing with the staff and public. The worst part of the job was walking around acting like you were doing something.
good,"I enjoyed working for Sears but only left in 1997 as cultured changed."
good,"Everyone is willing to help when needed. Management is willing to provide a flexible work schedule. Almost everyday is easy going. When issues arrive, they quickly resolved, usually within 48 hours."
good,Sears is a great fit for someone looking to have part-time work especially during peak seasons. I worked for the Lands' End Department almost all of college and it was a great opportunity to gain valuable retail experience. Do not have to crossover and work on the Sears side with the other departments however culture is different dramatically between the two.
good,"If you have a enough staff and the right individuals your job with be a lot easier. A typical work day will be dependent on how well trained your staff is. With well trained, independent individuals you will spend most of your day looking into bulk sales and how to grow the business. You will role play on a daily basis and receive a ton of calls from your DM if sales are down. The hardest part of the job is hiring individuals for commission sales. A lot of people are afraid of commission sales. The job is as fun as you make it. I like creating competition with my employees and playing work related games. I still sell and it has become a passion of mine."
good,"I do not have much of a review. it was a job that is supported myself and kids. I did truck off load, and I had to move things into guests cars."
good,"Busy when big sales and occasions arise"
good,The work enviroment is good. Company are very flexible with schedule but their managment is lack of knowledge. Benefits are just able for full time employees. I was hiring as a part-time but they provide me full time hours
good,"Great second job. Great employees."
good,"Everything that you need to be successful is in your possession the 1st day that you start. You basically have your OWN business with this job. But, it does take Hard work & Positive attitudes. Co-workers and management are all but a phone call and or email away. Hardest part is understanding that this is a SALES POSITION. So, if you have a problem hearing ""No's""? This may not be the fit for you. Now, when you Do make sales? It's the BEST feeling! The Customer is Happy, Your Happy and you have NO LIMIT on how much you can make!"
good,"Most of the time spent working at Kmart I was pregnant and growing bigger by the day. My store manager threw me a baby shower on a day that I was so overwhelmed that I almost called into work. Most days I spent at the register, ringing people up and talking to them about their day before moving onto the next customer, it was easy, repetitive work, but I got to know my coworkers and customers. The hardest part of the job was not having enough hours after I came back from maternity leave."
good,"AT&T had the latest technology nation wide. There were a lot of prodcust that the customers were intrested in. Therefore made it easier to sell. However AT&T prices were a bit steep, however it was worth it since the service is reliable. THe culture working in the retail store is like as we are all family, We got alone in a way to help each other out and there was most of the time a lot of laughter"
good,This is a great place to work. They are very wiling to work around a persons schedule and go the extra mile to make sure their employees are happy. I would recommend this job to anyone seeking employment.
good,"This job over all was very good in providing the equipment needed to  perform my duty, but management was very poor and thus failed, then was all often blamed on the employees."
good,Un ambiente apropiado para trabajr. Usualmente flixibles con los horarios. Provee algunos beneficios a sus asociados. comence sin experiencia laboral y me ha ayudado a desenvolverme y a crear sentido de responsabilidad y profesionalismo.
good,"Each day you come into the store, you pretty much know what to expect. The day is usually slow but at good sales times it can be great. The staff are together for the most part,"
good,"I learned a lot about jewelry, sports and lawn and garden and much more during my 6 years of working for this business. Its a lot of work and your definitely on your feet a lot.  My co-workers were also enjoyable to have around to make you laugh or help out when you needed it."
good,"Sears Canada, is a good place to work at. Customers are friendly and the coworkers are more friendly. The hardest part of the job was when there were no people and we were bored. The enjoyable part was working together as a team. After all I learned a lot of customer service skills from Sears."
good,"Job consisted of replacing price tags, and making sure all products were correctly priced and tagged. Also ensuring that all product was displayed correctly and in a visually appealing manner, which included cleaning, folding, rearranging all products. It also included assisting customers with finding products and answering questions they may have had."
good,It is very good place to work but you can't make a living out of it. contact with the client is very interesting and all the job offered there are part-time job so not good for a person who have family.
good,Great company that is an american staple! I grew a lot while working here. I wouldn't change my experiences  or my lessons as it has helped make me a stronger more well rounded leader.
good,Something new is learnt each and everyday. It is always fun having to resolve issues for store associate and helping them close a sale. I work with people who are more less like family. I enjoy coming to work on a daily base.
good,Have good Work Culture and its fun to work. Senior management is Good however Manager and team leads need to be trained on Management skills
good,"Sears was a fun place to work and offered flexible schedules. I liked the fact that you met different people everyday with different needs. This gave your work day variety and you never felt like you were in a rut. I also loved the fact that you were up moving around all day and not just stuck in one place. "
good,On a regular day at work it was just like a meet and greet a little we all had fun but we still got the job done and took care of our customers first it was a very friendly enviorment the hardest part of the job was having a fear that you would not be able to help a customer the enjoyable part was having fun with the member leading them in the right direction and actually getting paid for it.
good,"fun place to work as and entry level automotive technician. Management is not the best, especially the upper management. They like to use fear as a managing tool and lack communication tools."
good,"I worked as MCA to assist floor stocking and helping customers to meet their needs in the store. hardest part, it was temporary job just a seasonal. the enjoyable part of the job is the team."
good,A typical day at work consist of opening the store and making sure the store is in order for the day. Counting money and making sure all the proper paperwork is inn place. It is required to make sure all signs and sales are visible for the customers. Once the store opens the sears team is required to be at the service of the customer and to make sure the store is clean and up to par for the next shift or day.
good,I previously worked for Sears Holding Company as a Sales Associate and must say that it was horrible. Although I did pick up valuable life skills. They company culture was indeed in need of an upgrade. I want to work among people who are cool and care-free.
good,"The morning routine is the same, until you have to deal with another person's mistake or a surprise from somebody else ready to add more work to your roster.  When I was hired, I was told to expect to help out around the store when needed.  A few months into my job, it turned out that what they meant was ""you need to do the jobs of three people because we can't afford the help.""  When I confront the Manager about the overload of work I'm doing, I'm told that every employee has the same situation and our sales are down to where we can barely afford to keep everybody on payroll.  The owner and manager will also hire incompetent or under-skilled workers and then ignore their problems until it becomes a monetary liability to keep them employed.  "
good,"A typical day was going in, opening the store (or closing depending on the shift), selling appliances, fixing all the daily signs, and stocking shelves."
good,"la empresa tiene una cultura laboral muy buena, la capacitación a sus empleados es buena"
good,"It was always a new task for me to do everyday when I got to work. I worked in several of the departments, and got to experience different positions. The managers were professional and made sure we stayed on task."
good,"I learnt a lot about profession, technology in this company. All facilities were good except for work/life balance which is not well maintained here."
good,Sears does promote from within and does also train you for advancement. Great opportunities to advance your career and use your skills to do a better job.
good,"a typical day might include navigating through services calls and finding parking to work,information between workers are not always clear and communication between workers and management need improvement."
good,Everyday in my role as ASM I am challenge to achieve all my departmental goals.  I am the team coach.  I rally my staff together to motivate them to completed job tasks fast and efficiently.
good,"Productive friendly environment, which enabled me to gain management and excellent leadership skills."
good,"Management is okay.  Good place to start out of High School, but not to make a career.  Associates speak mostly Spanish, need to be bilingual."
good,"Your typical day at work is fast paced. You must be fast when working in receiving. Cool supervisors"
good,A very enjoyable working environment. Different stores everyday kept things interesting. Working with thee different personnel every day was nice. Even when weather was bad you could get required work done
good,job was great but the requirement's for obtaining credit applications were no fair management was hard to come by which made for poor customer service
good,"As a cashier i never had a problem with any customer's, i was on the floor with out any training. The hiring manager i knew i was a hard worker, and wanted me to be hired after being a seasonal employee."
good,tiene habiente laboral regular pero ahí personas que nomos están al pendiente de las demás personas a ver que asen o dejan de Acer para Acer chismes
good,too much pressure on the cashiers and other associates to make sales and have customers apply for either a regular credit card or master card. they put allot of pressure to the top cashiers and not as much pressure on the others when we were suppose to be a team not just a team of one. but overall co workers kept their heads up and did their best to exceed on the demands and have new people apply for the free program shop your way to save them time in case they lost the receipt. hardest part was dealing with hostile customers and keeping a polite attitude towards the end of the day and not take it out on other customers. the comradery between cashiers was impressive and pushed do do our best.
good,It was a great place to get experience just not a lot of money to be made. The people and managers were all very fun and very attentive to you and your needs.

good,"Sears has always provided a fair, cooperative environment to work in. The management team is comprised of a well rounded group of people who offer their assistance and are team oriented."
good,My experience at Sears has be invaluable.  I have built onto existing skills and developed new ones.  I have managed cross functional teams and led large teams in projects to accomplish goals.  A typical day is busy with analytics and projects to focus on.  Management supports your objectives and co workers work together.  working around the challenges and obstacles is the hardest part of any job.  most enjoyable is the high accountability and impact.
good,"I only worked here for a few months. But my time with the company was great. Management and HR are both great. Hours are flexible and you can ask for more or less if you need and they will try to work with you. I was a cashier and while it was EXTREMELY easy, my complaint is that the registers are severely outdated and when they freeze or go slow of course the customer thinks it's your fault."
good,"Family atmosphere, close knit supportive group.long time employees coached  to help learn how to do different task. Helping members find the correct product to fit their needs was challenging but fun the more discovey questions you asked the better you could serve them."
good,Management while I worked there was unstable but I have heard that it has been corrected. The co workers were great for the most part and helped out whenever I had any issues.
good,"I greatly enjoy working in Loss Prevention. From the thrill of catching a shoplifter, to the satisfaction of helping the store, associates and community- LP is a great line of work!"
good,Sears Holdings has a long history of being an innovator and leader within the Big Box Retail industry. Company has Member-centric views and continues to improve on services designed around Member Feedback
good,"I was given many things to do besides, my regular basic duties, I had a special project every week.  The job was structured and fun too.  My position was MCA clerk, so I called other stores, helped customers, and had extra projects, displaying clothes and other items in accessories and sleep wear.  There wasn't a slow time ever. My staff members were friendly and very helpful, I actually miss working with the Management and the customers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the challenges we all had, in completely our extra projects.  There were lots of diversity at our store. We had many contest and were awarded for our work. Overall, a good place to work and learn integrity and make good friends along the way."
good,"sign in, answer calls, take orders and enter them into the computer,"
good,On a typical day I would drive around to customers house's and fix their appliances. I learned more about electrical troubleshooting. Management was nice and most of the co-workers had been with the company for many years. The weather was the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting exposed to many different cultures.
good,A day at work includes moving materials from one spot to another. I learned how to operate forklift. Co-workers were nice to work with. The hardest part of the job is the long hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is completing task. Stocking shelves was also included.
good,"The job was good, only draw back was it was not full time."
good,"el ambiente de trabajo es bueno y pesado ya que trabajas los fines de semana y días festivos, y las ventas nocturnas para los no comisionistas es pesado ya que se trabaja de 10 a.m. a 12 p.m. y no se les paga tiempo extra ni con tiempo."
good,"I have great coworkers, a fun place with good people. I love my Sears team. Sears pushed me to be my best always. Management was wonderful. I enjoyed my job very much."
good,"It was a little bumpy at first but then things smoothed out and the job was fun. When I started, there was only one manager and now we have a good support staff."
good,"This was a fast pace and change on the fly store.  Being proactive rather then reactive is key.  I was always changing the merchandise in the store around so that the product was constantly moving,  This was all based on sales review.  I had a great team that worked for me and supported me which is the best asset you can have.  The best part of this job was that you always had something to do never a dull moment.  This job was very challenging and exciting with planning and executing of projects."
good,"It's a great place to work at and a good company to work for. Management is flexible yet stern, but co-workers sometimes make for a stressful experience."
good,A good place to work with all people. Showing how to put together the perfect outfit for that special night out. Getting to show someone that all looks can be cool
good,Easy to move up. Benefits are a lack of unless store manager and above. You work a lot for the little that you get in return.
good,Excellent experience company.  Great Job Culture.  In this company I'm have a great opportunity for learn the face to face sales.
good,"A typical work day would begin with me coming in Sears before we opened and having a morning meeting. The managers would discuss the quotas we needed to meet for the day. I next would count the drawers in the cash register and then clean my work station. Through out the day I would ring customers transactions, record transactions, take people's emails, phone numbers, and ask if they would like to apply for a Sears credit-card. I learned how to count a register at Sears and how to handle customers when they aren't satisfied. My management and co-workers were nice and we got along. The hardest part of the job was trying to convince people to give out their emails and to apply for the Sears card because it involves their personal information. But I overcame that hurdle by learning how to present information in a more appealing way rather than just asking plainly. Most enjoyable part of the job was being able to move from department to department while being a cashier."
good,I enjoyed working here. From the co workers to the management i would definitely recommend this job to others. great team based environment to work in.
good,"It is true the pay isn't the best but I absolutely love working here. The manager and her team are great to work for, they're always willing to help and have taught me a bunch. The environment here is great and is one of the big reasons I will stay. I highly recommend working here."
good,"Arrive @ 7am spend time preparing paperwork for the day, helping management with job duties. Do inventory functions, help unload inbound trailers or load out bound trailers."
good,Mattress sales posiition which requires alot of training and sales skills. My manager was pretty fair.We set sales goal and i always made them. This was definitely as learning expirence that will always come in handy.
good,"Started working during the start of the Christmas Season - very busy location.  Worked in Women's clothing - spend a great deal of time at the start and end of shift straightening and refolding articles of clothing.  "
good,"Customer flow was irregular and there was never enough cashiers or managers available, and at times I found them irrational. I did all my duties to par and did a majority of work and was let off for not calling for an extra day off, even though a doctor's note was presented and I was obviously in crutches. I took pride in my work even under the tough and some what irritable management. I earned a lot of 5 star comments complimenting and acknowledging the extra miles I went to satisfy their needs."
good,"tuve la oportunidad de una apertura de tienda, aprendi a realizar otro tipo de inventarios(teoricos), la gerencia general es muy buena, hay demasiado trabajo en equipo, no me agrada la actitud de mando de algunos supervisores de ventas pero es una muy buena empresa en la cual puedes crecer"
good,"A typical day at work might require picking orders using a pick to light system.Packing the order applying the labels and sending it to shipping,Often I would be called to work in our online order department where I would pick the orders , enter them into the system then pack them for UPS.I worked well with co workers and management.We had a great group of people who were good to help each other.The hardest part of my job was being on my feet sometimes 12 plus hours but it was also my most enjoyable because I like to move around and stay busy."
good,"Management was ok, but they must have done something wrong because they are no longer open. pay was ok but we were always doing overtime with no overtime pay. My favorite was being able to interact with customers and see how happy the photographs(my work) made them"

good,"A typical day at work would be answer inbound calls to place online orders, check on the status of the orders."
good,"Sears is a great company to work for overall.  The way the culture of the company is going I think is great.  If Sears can work on there managers work life balance and better benefits, I think Sears will become the leaders in the big box stores."
good,Working at Sears was a great place to gain experience in the retail environment. A lot of young professionals there. It was a great place to learn from people who have been in the industry for many years swell.
good,"I started this job right out of high school. Now, three years later, it's been a good first job. My co-workers a usually very friendly and easy to get along with. Management has room for improvement, but, overall, it's not terrible. I'm just ready for an advancement in my career, one that Sears Holdings Company cannot offer me. I would recommend this as a first job, an establishment, to anyone that's fresh from high school and looking to get into the work world."
good,"es buena empresa en el sentido de uqe tienes un trabajo seguro, pero por lo mismo es una empresa en el cual el salario o las ventas no son de gran ayuda, pero sobre todo no hay crecimiento laboral"

good,"This was an easy job, with good work environment, but the pay was not as good as other jobs I have had.  Store discount was a plus."
good,"i worked at 3 sears stores. they all varied greatly. I loved working in New Jersey. Sarasota was a little stressful. it was much more slow paced and not very up to date. it was hard to improvise but the store over all was great at team work and getting things done. helping and coaching. they took pride in their work. Ocala was not the same. no teamwork, everyone is competing against each other. struggling to survive. almost battling to keep their jobs. i blame most of this on the store manager. not a team player at all. wanted to add fear into the associate. teams were turning against each other blaming the other."
good,I had a great set of co-workers. Mangement was not very informative about was needed to be completed. the most enjoyable part of my jobs was working with the customers. The hardest part of my job was to meet quota with my sales. There were no customers in the store. The expections was way to high for a store with not that many customers.
good,"la hora de entrada es a las 9.30 personalmente no se me hacia un lugar que estuviera lejos de mi casa y eso lo hacia relativamente bueno para lo que yo necesitaba, aprendi a manejar una caja en algunos aspectos el manejo de efectivo cheques tarjetas bancarias, arqueos, apertura y corte de la misma.lo que se me hizo dificil al principio fue el horario y el descontrol de los descansos. lo que mas me gusto fue que vendiabien y como tal me iba bien en mis sueldos que de alguna forma llenaban mis necesidades y que el ambiente laboral no era tenso sino muy relajado. mis compañeras fueron muy amables conmigo en realidad ni yo me metia con ellas y cada quien solo hacia lo que tenia que hacer."
good,Sears is a wonderful place to work! I loved how easy going it was. unfortunately they don't pay very well and they only had seasonal positions.
good,A typical day of work consisted in helping customers find the correct size and style they need for there shoes. Learned how to handle complaints do returns. I love that there was always something to do from stocking shoes to helping customers.
good,A typical work day at Sears was interacting the customers there were pleasant ones and not so pleasant ones. I still held my composure and try  to get a laugh out of everyone. Sometimes successful sometimes not. The hardest part of the day was knowing that there was a customer dissatisfied with our services.I really enjoyed talking with the customers. Management  and my co-workers were fabulous to work with.

good,"Recommended and helped customers select merchandise based on"
good,"Repairing, makes interesting every day,you learn a lot on equipment,customers and coworkers.I have learned to interact with customer."
good,"Each day was pleasant upon arriving at work. Sears treated seasonal workers well and gave us an opportunity to stay permanent depending on our work performance and employee turnover for the new year. I learned what certain codes mean when management or other employees made an anouncement over the p.a. system inside the store, I learned a new step added to check verification when cashiering, and I also learned tagging and pricing procedures for clothing and shoes. Management was very organized and prepared for Sears seasonal shopping, they were also thorough and helpful. Management made it a point to show everyone respect and always gave clear instructions. My co-workers were friendly but professional at the same time, they helped me understand the dynamics of working at Sears and showed me different ways to complete daily work duties and projects in a timely and efficient manor. The hardest part of this job was recovery on Christmas Eve. It was near impossible to keep up because the store was packed with frantic customers, but management did not add more pressure they jumped right in and helped we worked together as a team. Everyone did their part efficiently and we got through it. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with management,co-workers, and customers. Complete recovery of the store and finishing tasks and projects on time or early was also very enjoyable and satisfying."
good,"I began working as a cashier and finished working in human resources. It is a typical retail position, weekends and nights are required. Most shifts are for 8 hours, you must be standing at all times. Sneakers are only allowed with a doctor note. Management has a great amount of changeover while I was there to include the store manager. There tends to be little consistency within the store. The most enjoyable part of this job is meeting the celebrities that come shop at the store due to its location."
good,Greet customers and find their service needs. Build price quotes for needed and recommended service. Call auto parts stores and schedule deliveries of parts needed for services. I learned how to build a price quote for complete automotive service.

good,"I initially started as a sales clerk in various departments.  I was then asked if I wanted to move into the auditing department.  It was my first office job and I learned many things, like how to use a calculator, computer and balance account at the end of the month.   Management seemed to always be watching, but they could also be encouraging.  The work load could get heavy at times. We worked in an open office environment and it was often distracting. "
good,"It was fun while I was working here."
good,"good work place,good flexibility good environment ,pretty easy going job not as hard as they make it seem. Managers are cool, I would recommend people that are looking for a part time job to apply their."

Putting up and taking down signs. Gathering more inventory and closing the department. Great place to cultivate customer service and build relationships with management and coworkers. Management is approachable, warm and caring. Co-workers are caring, helpful and approachable. Hardest part of the job is up-selling the credit card, and keeping up with the needs of the customer. The most enjoyable part is working with the co-workers and the management."
good,"My job when I clock in is reviewing closing report from each shift."
good,"dont know when the schedule would be available to know work week, placing blame on one another instead of taking ownership and very unorganized."
good,"Cashier, stock and prices items. helping the guests.. clean the area, make sales, learn where all items stock so i could be able to help the customer"
good,"Everyone worked together and helped each other when it was needed. Supervisors would not hesitate to answer your questions, listen to your ideas and explain something if you did not understand it. The hardest part of my job was lifting some of the merchandise that could be pretty heavy. For the most part it was a good environment and we worked together to keep up our productivity."

good,Sears is a great company to work for. Just with the way sales has been the company does not have a good future. They will probably close with in the next couple of years.
good,Enjoyable place to work with lots of fun people.  The best part of the job is working with customers and helping them purchase what they want and need.
good,Liked working here. Great people. Jobs could be a bit challenging to complete at times but nothing unbearable. Overall I would recommend this company to anyone looking for some good retail experience.
good,"I feel the trainers were great and that hard work is recognized. I only left to move out of state, but if I did not move I would have stayed. Wonderful team work and managers."
good,"The company needs internal work if it wants to survive. It is doing things, just not the correct things. Most people are nice and mature. The pay is fair but the availability of products has been terrible, recently."
good,"Worked in a healthy environment, got a chance to learn and share my views to help company's growth. This is the best team i have seen till now."
good,a good job to start off in the automotive field. your learn the basics of the job. no experience is required for this job. you will learn everything as you build with the company
good,"I absolutely loved working there, the staff was very friendly (and still are). I loved the fact that I had a break and could go out into the mall for lunch. I loved how there was always something to do, even if there wasn't much. The pay was great, I had enough to get by. The sad thing was I didn't learn much about the cash register. When I worked there, I learned a lot about children clothing brands, what types of strollers, car seats, cribs, ect. were suitable and safe depending on age of the child. The hardest part was being on your feet all the time for hours. Overall, I loved the job!"
good,Management and Co - Workers were great also a wonderful work environment. Required patience and great customer service with a energetic attitude and willingness to learn.
good,Sears is a fun place to work while in college. The team I work with is great and I have gained a lot of valuable experience while here.
good,I worked in the warehouse and I have to say the best part of that is that there is always something to do. The real hardest part of the job is if you're working by yourself there's no one there to help you load a customers merchandise into their vehicle. The pay was minimum wage but I was a teenager then so I really didn't care. I really enjoyed it.
good,"I wrote, designed, edited and did page layout for HomeWorks magazine, a training magazine for the hardware department for Sears' full line stores."
good,"I was hired in as an associate in the HR dept and soon transfered into the Auto Center, where I quickly self advanced as the top CSR in the region as well as becoming an ASE certified Tech. The company is a one of a kind."
good,Improve profitability through operational improvements and driving productive results throughout the area I support
good,"Sears had an excellent training system and decent pay. Often they were overpriced for what they were offering in pest control, but they were good about making sure the customer was satisfied."
good,"Working in the Warehouse 5 days a week. Week days emptying trailers and filling up the warehouse, while helping customers. weekends help customers and fill out damaged inventory and send damaged inventory back. Good co-workers and fairly good Management."
good,"A typical day consisted of making sure your assigned sections were clean and replenishing receipts on the sales floor. "
good,A good place to work management is good and will accommodate any issues or questions that you have. Sears has a very strong team motto and you can see that through the interactions of all the co-workers.
good,"Work at Sears is not overly complicated but the technology needed for the work is run down and a pain to handle. The management team is generally pretty awesome and the co-workers actually become invested in your life (well, most of them anyways). The hardest part of the job is the technology being inefficient but necessary. The most enjoyable part is working with friendly people and the food Sears supplies during the busiest parts of the year."
good,"I've held a job with this company since I was a sophomore in high school. Typically when I came into work, I would spend a few minutes looking around at what needed to be done that day, then figure out who was working on it. If no one was, I made sure someone was asap, or I went ahead and took care of things myself. The second best parts of the job was my store manager and the fact that the company always worked with my availability while I was in college. No one ever questioned when I took off more time and they were always willing to give me as much work as I wanted. The best part of the job was the trust management had in me. It is rare anyone asked me what I was doing if I was seen not doing anything because they knew I would be back to work quickly."
good,"Overall a typical day was a busy one but if needed help  with  a long line of costumers someone would always be there to help."
good,"I would perform routine maintenance on vehicles. I learned basic upkeep of different automotive systems from oil to batteries to tires. Management was very results driven, but very positive in its reinforcements. Co-workers were great, showed me the ropes and helped get me to where I was able to be a reliable and efficient technician. Hardest part of the job was that I was only part time so they were not as willing to help develop me and help me move up. Best part of the job was the skills that I obtained working in my first automotive environment."
good,"Sales, customer service. Loved the multitasking. "
good,"The general job is streight forward, the politics and managment trail is a little taxing"
good,"un día típico comienza con  el mercadeo del departamento, y asesoría para el cliente, obtener la venta."

good,"typical day at work will be from 8 to 5pm working "
good,"A typical day at work as a cashier at sears would be opening my register for the start of my shift. I would ring up customers, answer phone calls, fold clothes, clean as needed and greet customers. at the end of my shifts I would have to count my register down  and make sure my department looks good. I learned proper customer service skills, how to use a cash register and how to open and close. I also learned how to properly fold clothes and make displays presentable. My managers were all very nice and made me feel comfortable. the hardest part of my job was trying to get people to sign up for credit cards in order to keep my numbers from dropping. The best part of my job was the atmosphere! I worked in a few different departments so it kept things interesting."
good,una empresa seria y de gran estabilidad que da la oportunidad de desarrollarte profesionalmente dentro de la misma. Se aprende a trabajar en equipo ya que en cada uno de sus departamentos hay varios colaboradores. lo mas difícil del trabajo es el horario ya que estas prácticamente desde que se habré la tienda hasta que se cierra...
good,I had a lot of fun experiencing the new things I learned while working at sears. The employees always made me feel welcomed the business just seemed a little slow to me
good,"Every day that I go into work, I learn something new about different tactics and different ways to look for thief's."
good,Work days were typically long and involved quite a bit of keen organizational skills. Customer service was an absolute must because I straightened toys for the last shift of the day.
good,"I enjoyed working at Sears. There were always so many customers in the store and we were always busy. I loved the fact we were always busy at the registers. If we weren't busy at the registers (usually when there was no one in line to check out) I would help put clothes away that some of the customers decided not to buy after all. I would answer questions customers had about where a certain product or department was located. My co-workers were fun to be around and we always encouraged each other to try our best. The hardest part about the job was getting people to apply for credit cards, but after explaining the benefits our credit cards had some people would apply. I learned how to enroll customers in to the Shop Your Way Rewards Program while working here. Management was a little strict, but they always encouraged us to try our best and to provide the best customer service to our members. They gave us tips on how to do a better job in enrolling customers into the program and how to get them to apply for credit cards."
good,co- workers were good and the work load was also not too much to handle.
good,A typical day was answering phone calls and troubleshooting with customers about their appliances. Co-workers and management were very helpful and helped if they were asked to. The hardest part about the job was not being able to schedule a date for a tech to visit early as the next day because of the busy times of year. The most enjoyable was the elation you hear in their voice when your give them the information to resolve their problem.
good,"It was a nice place to work while I was attending college. There was some awesome co-workers there  that I got along with that helped me just about everyday. "
good,"Sears has a great work environment. They don't watch over you like you're a little kid, and you have some leeway as to some displays and how you want your department to look."

good,"I was a sales associate and cashier and got paid commission. "

good,"ran multiple departments"
good,"A typical day at work;look for a customer chekaut "
good,"I learned many things, first and foremost, that a positive attitude is extremely important to your success."
good,"Definately not a job that involved repeating tasks. My position involved working with all of the team members which included managers, employees, and customers. Assignments were focused around protecting the store and it's assets. Maintaining a safe working/shopping experiance. "
good,"A typical day at Sears started with opening four registers in one department, cleaning the tables and go-backs left at the register. As well as communicating with customers and engaging them by having open conversations while multi-tasking and creating a well member experience. Also meeting quotas by asking 100% I customers to sign up for rewards cards or Sears MasterCard. The hardest part of the job is meeting quotas by the end of the day, especially on weekdays when customers hardly shop, but the most enjoyable part of the day is meeting the quotas and making the customers enjoy their visit."
good,Strong team environment.  Goals are difficult to attain.  Bonus structure does not allow for Recruiters to make goal.
good,"A typical day at work would be me coming into work and starting to take care of the fitting rooms and putting clothes away from the put-back rack and when that is finished, you would go and start to clean the floor. I have learned how to communicate with customers in different situations and the hardest part would also be the customers at times because everyone is very different and they want different things but you learn how to handle that. I enjoy my coworkers at Sears the most; we are like a family. Management could be better, but one thing I like is that they are very understanding with everyone's different schedules."
good,Production Environment with great incentives. Fair throughout the company and work was comparable to the wages.
good,Sears is a great place to work especially if you are entry level. There are many opportunities for advancement. Other retailers tend to pay a bit more.

good,"Se trabaja bajo presion  hay metas y resultados, tu salario es seguro es buen sueldo  y hay muy buenas prestaciones"
good,"Helping customers."
good,"At Sears I was able to perform many different task. I managed the vault which consist of all the money for the entire store. This procedure usually would take about 4 hours each day to complete. Once im done with that, I wold file, check the background status of potential employees, issue out payroll,"
good,"As a branch manager, all work duties & operations were viewed before starting shift. Customer orders, Staff on board & prompt, & made sure all customers orders were accurate. View all sales and make necessary changes if applicable. Friendly and fun environment."
good,sears was a fun job. its attached to the mall all my friends went to and I could shop on lunch break and after work. the store manger was a bit absent more than he should have been. There was also to much miscommunication between associates and management
good,"i only worked a part time position while there, but management was always nice and helpful."
good,"productive and fun workplace"
good,"The job itself was the same everyday. Offloading and loading trailers. Preparing defrocking stock to go to the sales floor. Great team of co-workers and a great boss who was always there to help and listen if you had any problems. The work itself was hard. For example there was a lot of heavy lifting and you were on your feet for hours, but on busy days there was always enough help to make the work go faster."
good,"Wwll first jon was in the womens department in Paramus, Leared everything ."

good,"comfortable learning enviroment with leniency, only need basic tools to start"
good,open cashier at 9:30am when the store open you can see a lot customer walking in the store. i am learn how to communicate with the customer help customer to find their items. Good managers and good co-wokers. The hardest part is try to offer credit cards and file the complete application and some customer don't like credit card. And that work you need file application because is a requisite to stay in sears.
good,"Management is a double sided coin, some are great to work with and follow through while others are unprofessional and say they will get things done but never do. The hardest part of the job is taking back to back calls with angry customers and not being able to assist them due to restrictions, even if it was something Sears did wrong."
good,hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who work the system and have no thought as to how many people they are hurting with their unreasonable demands and complaints
good,The job is all customer related and if you know bother its fine.
good,"Great retail work environment. Not for me with the active customer involvement at the moment. Tried it for a while, but took its toll on my disabilities. Was recommended by VA that I focus on health. Other than that, I would have still been there. Management was great and co-workers were amazing. I miss it at time and would re=apply if I knew I wanted it as a career."
good,On a typical day I spend most of my time assisting customers find the perfect product for them. It could be anything from a treadmill to a tractor. We have a wide selection of products so I am required to know my products inside and out so that I may effectively sell them. It is a commission environment so I am always very competitive with my co-workers. My favorite part of the job is not knowing what i'm going into on any given day. There are always new problems that need solving or new products to learn about.
good,"Cashier , hours go by fast , they have a great rewards program , I got along very well with employees and management,  ive learned they may also be closing"
good,"Being that this was a course for school, unfortunately I did not get the full experience of working for the tux shoppe. Although I was not an actual employee, and unable to learn much about the tuxedo and suit industry, the manager and other co-workers were beyond pleasant."
good,"Sears was my first job and while I had some issues with how some things were managed, it was an overall great experience. Management was very helpful and accommodating but HR was useless. Working at seas invoked an overall sense of unity, All of the workers knew each other and were always around to mend things if one of your actions went astray. The workplace had a sense of causality about it while still having a professional appeal."
good,Fun store to work at. Lots of stuff to do. Management is nice and easy to talk to.
good,"Sometimes its just a drag working there, other days its quick and easy."

good,I was new to this country when I had job at Sears. I did not have any experince in sales. It was just a job.
good,Typically day starts with data modeling activities to be finished off before end of day calls with onsite (USA) Overseer Data Modelers. Productive environment with well defined roles and skilled co-workers. Especially impressive was the business knowledge amongst the Business Analysts. Hardest part was the meeting schedule expectation of project managers with quality reviews taking time. But great satisfaction was gleaned at end of Design phase by producing a data model that fitted seamlessly into the existing architecture and provided the necessary reports.
good,Managers always notice employees hard work and reward them. We had lunch together everyone was friendly and welcoming. The store was kept clean and organized and well stocked.

I learned to work with different people, I learned to how to convince customers to get a credit card, how to deal with a lot of money and many customers. Some of my co-workers were sympathetic and kind. The hardest part was working with a co-worker that she did not like me. The most enjoyable part was to work for clients with a beautiful smile and do good customer service and get a ""Thank You"" that was the best part. Feel good by having customers happy with my service, and receive many positive feedback's to my name."
good,"Enjoy working with my hands, rebuilding and repairing 3 cycle lawnmowers. Fast paced and fun job. You have to be okay with getting dirty. Everyday was a new experience "

good,"Sears is a great place to work where associates can have fun on the job.  My only complaint about Sears is that they are  not as technologically advanced as I would have thought, i.e. old software programs, outdated registers and phone systems."
good,A great team w/ many seasoned managers that bring with them a breadth of knowledge about the field.  As long as you put in the effort and show initiative there is a lot of opportunity for growth and advancement.
good,"This company helped develop me into someone who is highly dedicated and motivated.  I have worked there for 15 years and although we had our times of despair, as a company, the people I worked with were amazing.

good,"-Assists customers with buying tools or lawn and garden equipment."
good,"Fast pace going work place. It felt as if I was in a shark tank, It was every man or woman for themselves when it came down to sales. The hardest part of the job was trying to make your sales mark while there are 6 other people pouncing on every customer that comes into the department. The most enjoyable is satisfying the customer and making their experience as enjoyable as possible"

good,It was a part-time job while I was in college.  I loved the people I worked with and really enjoyed my job.
good,worked in call center was cool but the amount of work and stress is not worth the pay and the company want you to handle situations with little power that's what make it stressful. it could be a OK starter job
good,"I started working for Sears as a exterior contractor from 1985 until 2004 in which time Sears offered me a exterior field inspector job to manage the crews and do customer service which was a great job. The management team was excellent as well as most of the office staff great place to work. "

I enjoyed keeping a smile on my face and treating customers with respect and making them happy.
good,"good place to work "
good,"Give customers the best possible service, attend other co-workers needs , bring a competitive actitude and determination to the work place, giving stability and leadership to the working area"
good,"-customer service"
good,"As a team lead, I was responsible for managing a staff of up to 12.  Our team arranged all marketing layouts, signage, pricing, and displays.  It was easy to go from entry level retail sales to staff supervision.  Being in lower management, you still had the knowledge and experience of upper management to draw upon and learn from, while making your own departmental decisions.  The hours are varied from week to week and season to season, and since available staffing hours came from a corporate office, sometimes it seemed you had too much work with not enough staff.  This position allowed me to learn proper time management for project completion, and the ability to make supervisory decisions."
good,"Typically my day began by confirming appointments, checking on existing orders, following up on completed sales. It was a great opportunity and I had a many wonderful experiences but  unfortunatley it has ended. The hardest part of my job was breaking promises to clients, because their product went missing, but the reward was offering them a solution until orginal order was replaced."
good,"review current ads,  making the department was clean and neat."

good,"A corporation with a well branded suite of legacy brick and mortar store formats that struggles to maintain marketshare while strategically positioning themselves for the digital age of retail. "
good,"Productive and Stringent deadlines."
good,"Working at the small appliance store was really nice. Most of the customers were either contractors that knew exactly what they needed, or they were looking for a new appliance. So my job was mainly directing people to where something was, or getting a appliance associate to help someone. I also had a (old) computer where I could easily look up something that I needed to know (like if a part went with another part). I learned a lot about parts and how things work in general. I even learned how to repair ratchets. But when it can to the check out process I was ""heavily recommended"" by the managers to ""not take no for an answer"" when it came to making people sign up for the rewards program and credit cards. It was so bad that I always had at least 1 customer that came up to my register, slammed the merchandise down, yelled ""NO, NO, NO, I DON'T WANT IT, NO"", then slammed the money down and walked away. He rarely waited for the change. I eventually quit because of two reasons 1- I already had a full time job at that point, and 2- I found it morally wrong to harass people for products that they don't want, and that can easily hurt them more than help them."
good,I enjoyed Sears Park Seniors in the beginning because we had more seniors & volunteers who would chip in without being asked. I enjoyed working with the seniors overall. However I did not appreciate being told one Friday afternoon that starting the following Monday I would be cut back an hour a day. This was not ample warning or proper to tell an employee who had been with you for over 5 yrs.
good,"- fast paced"
good,"My day at work starts with the first caller, I assist with their concern and tell them instructions of what to do. "
good,I worked there after school and on weekends. I learned about electronic/appliances from my managers and co-workers. It was fun and enjoyable because the people I worked with I also went to school with.
good,"great place to work, i learned a lot from my managers and my co-workers. a typical day would be a day where u serve customers, take care of there needs. being the best while having fun. the hardest part of the job is to deal with issues created by another departement, dealing with customers frustration, and the most enjoyable is when u take care of clients issues and they thank you deeply for it"

good,"A warehouse worker’s job tends to vary somewhat depending on the specifics of the warehouse and what is stocked or processed there, but this person’s primary tasks usually have to do with selecting, organizing, and processing merchandise."
good,It was a great learning experience.  My co-workers were very easy going and management was always helpful.
good,"days vary from rather slow, spent cleaning the shop, to slammed, working 4 times faster than flat rate. I have learned a lot as far as training goes. started as lube tech and have advanced to brake training and performing minor engine repair and diagnostics and all suspension and alignment services. management is strict, which to a degree is good, but stoking any change is all but impossible. coworkers are great, teamwork is common, and most of us all spend time outside of work. hardest part of the job is dealing with the heat in the shop during summer, and being bombarded by confused customers. the best part of the job is completing a job on time or early and making customers happy with my service."
good,Had no problem with sales and cashier. And as my background has been with tools and fixing electrical and mechanical things for most of my life.
good,"Arrive."

I worked always in the same department except for a few months when I tried something else in the delivery department.A typical day would be entering orders into their system and then making sure the right merchandise was shipped to the right store. At times I would also do some manual packing."
good,"Being a cashier/mattress sales at sears you are working in a slow paced store, you have a lot of time throughout a shift to meet required jobs. Being in a slow paced environment can also be the most difficult part if you have no customers to satisfy, but also enjoyable because everyone has a fun time while waiting for more customers. Management is always friendly as well as co- workers"
good,My Co-workers are amazing and I am proud to a part of the Risk Management Team. I truly love my job and take pride in the work that I do. It is especially rewarding when I see specific results that prove that my efforts save the company money!

good,bon superviseur et compagnon de travail toujours apprendre nouvelle technologie
good,"Working is pretty consistent everyday. There is a normal routine to clean your work space, make sure most clothes are put away and you just need to make sure to greet customers in a professional manner. Managers/Supervisors are very nice and understanding, coworkers are fun and lively. The hardest part of the job is to keep up with metrics but once you get a hang of it it isn't that tough."

good,"The only that takes alot of paper work is Inventory, but everything else i can handle. I learned more responsibility of keeping record of information, speaking with customers over the phone, and elevating my customer service skills"
good,Very flexible with hours so when you are going to school it can be worked around. Company direction is very confusing for the most part and always cutting jobs to save money.
good,"The company worked to try to make things successful, however sometimes it seemed the upper management forgot what it was like working at the store level.  Some changes were made to save money but they also lowered moral."
good,"Working in one of the largest stores in the east bay with low hours (except holidays) is dificult but Sears as a part time job is fun. The assosciates there are fun which made my job less than a job, Everything was great except management during the time I was there, too many ""supervisors"" but not enough department leads, but overall fun place for a first job."
good,"Working as a sales associate is both fun and frustrating at times. It is a good place to start working, but I would not recommend it as a career. You get a lot of training in customer relations, and how to sell product, and can be a value that can be translated to any career."
good,"Requires lots of customer service, good attitude, co-workers were great and I enjoyed fixing the merchandise and stocking it."
good,Great job. I value customer service and working with the public.
good,The customer was always number one. There was nothing management didn't do to keep the customer happy.
good,Great Job for a part time associates. Not enough work hours for associates. Very competitive associates to work with. Some senior associates are unable to work with. Plotting against other associates. 
good,"Overall, I loved my job at Sears! It was exciting, professional, and a great place to grow professionally while I was finishing college. Unfortunately, there were some cliques within management that led to me losing my job, and myself and my coworkers did suffer from some of the economic issues. If they offered me another position, I would go back and work there gladly."
good,Great company with good pay and good benefits.  Plenty of time off if you want it.
good,"A normal day working Sears going in unloading trucks, breaking down boxes and stocking and locating also carrying out ordered packages. learned how to put together a lawnmower and how to use a locator. Some of the co-workers were cool people and funny. The hardest part about the job will be unloading the truck on appliances day especially during the heat. The part i enjoy is the using the baylor to crunch the boxes it make a lot of noise. "
good,"Fast pace big box retail environment with many challenges, rewards and opportunity to interface with internal associates and external customers. I was over 11 stores in the South Carolina and Georgia markets with opportunity to travel and make a difference daily. Responsible for P&L, Top Line Sales, Bottom Line profit and building a high caliber team, Human Talent recruiting, mentoring and development. The hardest part of the job was the extensive travel and being away from home 3 to 4 days every week. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my team and seeing them succeed, grow and develop personally.   "
good,"A typical day at work consists of writing up Repair Orders, explain car needs to customers (sales). It also consists of administrative tasks such as answering phone calls, filing paper work, setting appointments and data entry. I provided over four years of excellent customer service with recognition from management. I gained management skills and met strict deadlines daily. I was also standing supervisor for 3 months.  I was unable to take position because of school."
good,"Sears Rochester has a great upper management team, but the rigid corporate structure makes for a tough work experience."
good,Ok place to work. Coworkers are great. Management is great. the company is always looking for ways to bring in new customers and also keep the old customers.
good,Days could be busy or dead slow but great co-workers and great environment under the right management.
good,"Meet new people everyday. Constantly working. Good commission on tires, labor hours and parts. Good benefits if on full-time. "
good,"I really enjoyed my time @ Sears. Learned a whole lot! There were many different brands that I designed for with a lot of skilled, trained and professional people."
good,Sears was a part time job for me while I started college. Many of my co-workers were around my age which also made the experience enjoyable. Here is where I learned I was a people person. Working the sales floor you come across a variety of people and cultures. Managers were always available when we had a costumer or personal problem. The hardest part of this job was working on commission. I knew had to sale my products but there was a lot of competitiveness between us. 
good,"Manage all aspects of retail construction management form planning to contracting, budgeting, monitoring, scheduling, administrate meetings, contracts and personel, project managers and project coordinators, Manage travel to construction job sites in the Western, US Region"

good,"En tant que superviseure dans un centre contact client, ma journée commençait par lire les nouvelles instructions, accueillir les associés(es) et en m'assurant de transmettre à tous et chacun ces instructions. "
good,Was a fun goal oriented place. Management was easy going and motivating. Their were good opportunities to increase your pay on a daily basis. Promoted from within when possible.
good,"Management, my store manager to be specific, is terrible. Meaningless meetings and constant harassment about performance prevent any real work from being done. No recognition is given for being above the norm which creates resentment and gives no reason to work harder than the next guy. However, the actual job is still fulfilling, and being able to help people every day truly does the heart good. My co-workers are by far the best part of the job. No day is a boring day with them."
good,"My manager was so nice, and encouraging to all of us. I enjoyed working the many different aspects of the store, so no day seemed the same.  The hardest was getting the hours I needed being part time and going to school. "
good,Sears moral is excellent. Everyone is willing to learn so that everyone will be cross train.I Ioved workingwith all my coworkrs.
good,Decent place to work for. Pay is a little higher than competitors but the hours aren't that good and management needs improvement.
good,My typical day began from 2:00pm- 10:00pm which was Monday thur Friday. My day consisted of assisting customers whom had complaints or in hiring potential employees. I enjoyed assisting customers and to reslove issues as an Human Resource Office Assistant.
good,"A typical day at work would include variety of jobs ranging from oil and tire changes to most common brake work. The only items not serviced would include emission repairs and in depth electrical diagnosis. Majority of the co-workers I worked with are fun loving and very helpful bunch of guys that I could rely on and trust with even my car for service. The management can be quite helpful, but can also not be as helpful at times."
good,"This location was very dated, but the personel at this location was very knowledgeable about how to run this facility and had a zero tolerance for any operator errors."
good,"Solid company with many talented people. Day to day activites include customer service, problem solving, and team training."
good,I enjoyed the exprience I had with Cpi Images. I wish things could have been different. I would still be there if it wasn't for the company closing. The first time I had a job that I loved.
good,I loved the holidays and interacting with the kids. The hard part sometimes were the parents more than they kids. My co workers were great and we worked really well as a team.
good,the culture that has built there makes you want to wake up in the morning and go to work
good,"dealing with customers was great, a very quick day. You get a bonus for store to homes and credit application. a day filled with clothing every womans dream job."

good,"load and unload a trucks, assist customers. take therre merchandise too there cars/trucks"
good,Typical day at work is staying focused and protecting the merchandise of the company. Conducting arrest daily!
good,"An oridnary day at work was pretty much just open my register, have the money counted and ready to use. Be ready for customers who at opening time they were ready to walk-in and give payments, purchase something, or asked questions about anything. One of the departments that was always busy was the kids department. As a cashier one of our duties was to ask each customer to apply for credit and for someone as myself I found out that was the place to ask since it was always busy. Another department that was also busy and gave me knowledge and skills was the Tools department. I learned quite a lot new things. My co-workers, which were the consultants, were really helpful because we worked as a team to get things done. They taught me a lot about tools that I never knew existed. Management was never really around. They were always busy doing their own job. Only when we needed an approval or their help was the only time they were around. I would say the hardest part of the day was when we had a line of customers and management wasn't around to help us out. The most enjoyable part of the day was seeing customers leave happy because I helped them find an easier way to help their needs. I learned a lot working for this company. They showed me great skills that made me job a lot easier."
good,Given great opportunity for advancement
good,"Sears taught me responsibility, leadership and what it's like to be professional. Selling shoes everyday was fun and getting to know your product was important."
good,*Greet and Welcome each customer
good,"A typical day included answering phones, and assisting customers. I broke into retail and commission sales here. I sharpened my sales skills, phone skills and negotiation skills. The management was very inconsistent at that time. My coworkers were skilled, competent and knowledgeable. The hardest part of that job was making ends meet after the holidays. The customers were the bright spot of everyday there."
good,The average work week for a Sears cashier consists of four to five six-hour shifts totaling 20 to 30 hours a week. Actual shift length and total weekly hours may vary by Sears. Sears requires you to get customers to sign for credit applications. I average about six a day. Depends on my shift because usually nights are really slow. Based on our quota for credit applications it indicats on our hours we recieve for the week. I've learned how to ineract with people more. My co-workers were excellent. Great learning enviroment with handling cash and customer service.
good,Get the latest fashion once it comes out because more people will go to a place with the latest male and female fashion and tech like other places.
good,"Over a period of several years I worked as:an appliance salesman, sold men's clothing and managed the shoe department. I got the shoe department profitable after less than a year. It had been non-profit making for several years before I took over."

It set my foundation for my work ethics that I possess now."
good,overall decent place to work good advancement opportunities and a very relaxed work environment
good,The store as a whole strives to be customer friendly. We are always trying everything we can to make the customers happy and feel important. We always want them to come back to shop with us.

good,Loved this job and associates but Military called! Great place to work and compensation package is good. Learned lots about the retail business.
good,Great learning experience
good,"Working at Sears has taught me if you want to get ahead, work hard. So many people believe that the are under appreciated at their job and have nothing to show for hard work. My hard work with the company has always been acknowledged and rewarded."
good,It's a fairly decent and fun place to work. Not so much if you're looking for a long term career with greater financial benefits. Time management is strict. Dealing with irate customers. Co-workers and management are great and the cafeteria staff is awesome. The sales department is the best.
good,This is a great place to work if you are use to a fast paced environment. The people there are more than friendly and helpful. They even have different businesses cater to the employees for lunch. They have different contest within the company to give the employees more drive to push for sales.
good,Just Pretty Much Talk To Customers All Day..Pretty Chill And Laid Back Enviroment
good,"I enjoy a productive fast pace working environment, where everyone around me is competent and reliable in every task they take part in. I've learned to develop and maintain outstanding professional relationships with co-workers and clients. I've learned how to quickly plan and implement new strategies to acquire desires results. The most difficult part of a job for me is working with people who are not productive and unreliable. The most enjoyable part of a job for me is the end result of productive collaborated efforts."
good,"Sears was a wonderful and loving place to work for. This is a company to work for if you are looking for a part-time job who treats you like a family. The management was wonderful, you made friends also while you worked and team work was valued. They did have benefits but I dunno if they were good or not because I never received any when I was working there except the employee discount. The job security seemed to be there but I worked there before the economy started getting bad."
good,Travel to customer home using company provided vehicle to service various appliance products.
good,"The management team recognized the need for change as new retailers emerged that were very competitive and they made every effort to meet the challenges of these companies with positive changes in merchandise, team workmanship, and re-organization. My co-workers were a great team, lots of fun and willing to share in the workload. Seasonal changes kept the workplace interesting and inviting and motivated the staff to look forward to working everyday."
good,I would walk in put my things in my locker. Go onto the floor and grab my sales sheet. I would wait for customers to enter the store. I would greet and assist customers as they entered. I would write down product on the sales sheet then go to the computer and enter all the info and price on the computer. I would ask for the customers credit or debit card and finalise the sale. At the end of the day I would total up all my days sales and enter it in the computer.
good,"Everyday is a challenging day, there is always something to do. Its an interactive job, dealing with both customers and coworkers. My customer service and sales experience became better. The pay wasn't all that great and the travel and distance weren't compensating."
good,"Sears is a fast pace company it great for students and housewives, or a second part-time job with benefits."
good,"I had a really good time working here. I met a lot of defferent people. At times it was hard you had to make sure the order was right, and the customer was happy. sometime kids would be kids and you just had to try your hardess. an make sure the pictures were right"

good,I loved working for Sears Portrait Studio. Just wished they offered more hours! only down fall! :(
good,"Every day was an typical work day, never knew that it was so many different shoes for different people, management was alright, co-workers kept to them selfs, the hardest part of the job was helping out with the little babies shoes, the most enjoyable part was the discounts."

good,I mostly worked nights as I rapidly grew in advancement on all the knowledge I gained working with the main morning people. I often would have to handle busy times by myself or close myself due to call ins or no shows of other employees. But overall it was a very work friendly environment and friendly coworkers.
good,this job had improved my customer service and communication skills. they work with my school schedule.
good,"Good company, Enjoyed working with employees and customers while having a fun environment."
good,A typical day at work in sales was challenging as the economy slowed down.
good,"My typical day at work consisted of selling TV's and other add ons. I explained the proper functions on how to opperate the many TV's that were being sold. I learned how to sell to many different people, how to allow my customers to trust and believe in what i'm saying is true about the products that the store was selling. The management tried to help out where they could. Most of them didn't know much about the Electronics departement, which is where I worked. My co-workers were a lot of fun to work with; of course we had a few that just stood around, but I still made the best of it. The hardest part of the job was selling protection to the TV as well as delieveries. Both of those are expensive depending on the TV size. I enjoyed just working with customers, they made the job go by fast and the smiles that I recieved after a sale is great."

I also straighten up the departments and make sure the departments are neat and clean. I also change the prices of the merchandise and put out new merchandise on the sales floor. I believe the hardest part of my job is when i have to be patient with customers as well as my employees."
good,"This job was a hands on repair job where I repaired vacuum cleaners for different Sears stores to be sold as refurbished vacs or jsut repaired customer vacs that needed it. I learned how to install vac motors, unclog the hoses and bases of the vac, change the bases of the upright vacs where the bases were melted by either the brush or belt, and much more. Management was good, they were always willing to lend a helping hand if you needed it and would always check on you as you worked to make sure the team was doing a good job. They would always tell us they appreciated our hard work and would sometimes show it with luncheons, barbques, etc. My coworkers were all like family and we treated each other with the utmost respect. We helped each other out when needed. There wasn't really a hard part of the job unless you couldn't lift the vacs which weighed about 30- 40lbs. I enjoyed being able to see my coworkers everyday, the comraderie we all shared and the knowledge i learned everyday about the different floorcare products that we repaired daily. i also did a little data entry by inputing box numbers on a spreadsheet or Bill of Lading form that was used when shipping the finished product back out for the freight liners such as Southeastern Freight."

good,"all the benefits and the scheduling was great, the management needed some work but it was bearable, but needs more job security people were constantly getting fired from our office."
good,I liked working for Sears cause it helped me build strong friendships and values as well as a good career opportunity and good relationships with professional people.
good,Sears has a great training department. They are very detailed and take the time to listen to the employees who are having issues. The employees are able to trade hour and work as little or as much as they would like this is also a plus.
good,Sear was a great place to learn some of your basics as far as changing tires and changing oil. Like my job very much should of never left.
good,"I have enjoyed working at Sears, however I need something full time to take care of my family. I am currently part time, and for me that just dont cut it."

good,"It wasnt that bad, good employee discount and great fellow employees. I enjoyed most of the customers as well. "
good,Company went bankrupt and is no longer open in most states.  management changes often.  Helping customers with various tasks were very rewarding. Learning new skills and technologies were also rewarding.
good,Hired for holiday season employment in 1999. Completion finished in 2000 with my moving into another seasonal employment opportunity at Liberty Tax Service
good,It was a nice enviroment where I was pressured enough to try my best with every customer I helped at the register or the aisles of my workplace. Manegers provided closure and helped insure that the employees were fine with the tasks provided.
good,"Es una empresa con mucho prestigio a nivel nacional, ambiente laboral competitivo pero se requiere modernizar los sistemas de gestion administrativa."
good,"Los días normales son bastante tranquilos, en ocasiones puden llegar a haber tiempos muertos, sin embargo un día con muchos clientes puede llegar a saturar un poco, pero mantienen al personal bien capacitado constantemente, y el programa de venta al cliente esmuy sencillo de entender y usar."
good,"always loved it when we would have a friends and family night  for everyone to shop one night on a weekend , and get extra discounts, was very rewarding opening credit cards for people , and getting paid to do so, training new associates and learning new things as well for myself"
good,Learned a lot about retail and pricing. Developed customer service skills and sales skills. The most difficult part was dealing with upset customers but it wasn't that difficult.
good,I was General Mngr of the store. Had an excellent team of Asstt. Mngrs. It was professional environment to thrive in. The Upper mngmnt was great and were always there for support.
good,Worked with Multi-Store in different states. The Management team was great! Lots of work but a great experience. Very sad with the actual company conditions.
good,"This is a job that requires an individual who can  adapt to his or her customer, put in long hours and stay mentally sharp. You need to be a closer. If you can close you will make great money."
good,I worked at sears a little over 2 years and it taught me alot about how the retail system works along with trying to sell outdoor equipment. Gave me a good perspective on the general public is and how you should deal with situations. Had issues here and there with customers and/or co-workers but were all resolved in a good manor.
good,"As long as your doing your work and catching up with everything then your good, very relaxed job most days of the week until the weekends maybe where it can be a little crazy but other than that no problems."
good,"Loving people is what it's all about if you work at Sears and any people driven daily interactions. I LOVE the people.  If the pay was better and the future vibrancy had been in tact and not skewered by gossips of company going out of business, and kept the cockroaches out, and the locations kept it cleaner from people trashing the ladies rooms, then I would have stayed without question!  The mall itself was rampant with that same junk too. Truly unsanitary and disgusting."
good,Overall really enjoyed the employees and the hard line managers. A typical day at work would be addressing every customer and making sure there every needs and questions were fulfilled.
good,this was my first true big box management situation was a great learning experience and I had my own problems but I learned to get past them it'll be made me a better manager for the future
good,"Store was under liquidation, very much learn on the fly and adapt to ever changing situations. Constantly challenged with new hurdles as store constantly changing as product diminished."
good,I had so many GREAT EXPERIENCES working here and i was fortunate to meet so many unique and amazing individuals who helped shape me into the manager I am today. The only downfall out of my 4 years with the company is at the last location i managed the turnover rate for managers and staff was ridiculously high and at times unbearable . Due to the lack of support when a management position was left unoccupied often times candidates without proper knowledge or qualification was  promoted out of desperation to fill the management position because of this particular stores extreme high volume and this caused even more strain and inefficiency. Overall the environment and family like atmosphere made working at both locations an unforgettable experience which Ive found to be priceless!
good,"Sears helped me better myself in different aspects, I tried out new job titles and tasks which helped me manage what I am capable of. Beyond just working certain days a week, I was able to establish how much I should work or able to work for myself."
good,I was making good money sometimes. I was in commission 100% so selling was not that difficult for me on daily basis it was easy but I was working very minimum hours not full time
good,Really enjoyed this job got to learn new things all the time always helping to advance with product knowledge when needed would of been great if company didnt shut down
good,"Good place but no benifits , for delivery drivers ,contractors only . No set work hours , finish when done but great people fun on the road ,money's good"
good,It was a great place to work if you into fixing things. Your never in the same place every day. They keep you busy. You have to be on it. Focus on the task in front of you.
good,"pros: fun people to work with"
good,"I learned many things while working there, such as stepping out of my comfort zone and the management and staff whee always great to be around. I felt that the work culture was great, there was a lot of respect, trust, and teamwork between the employees and the management."
good,I was alright not completely terrible. I liked working with the people there except for one. she would always get mad at the fact i would take a customer before her. my favorite part to work in was the tools register because the people in that part were just really nice to me and cared to talk if it wasnt busy!
good,When you work there for over 2 years you see almost everyone leave and get new including managers. customers are always rude but coworkers usually make up for it.
good,"My short time at Sears was very laid, I love that you can do returns and purchases at the same time and you are able to make you credit card payments at the store instead of online or over the phone; it is very customer friendly and convenient for the customers. I personally didn't like to have to ask customers to sign up for credit cards; it kind of sucked because you get paid very little but the more credit cards people sign up for then you get like a little commission. It probably would have been great if the location wasn't so far from me and it was like I was working for gas."
good,A typical day at work consists of opening of the registers and making sure  my Department is picked up and ready for business.  Next we assist customers with their purchases and any problems they may have with previous purchases.
good,"I worked for Sears back in 1994, I was very happy there, so after 25 years, I decided to work for Sears again. I really enjoy working there the employees and customer were very friendly,I was sad to see the store closed on March 10/2019, I would have retired from Sears if I had the chance."
good,Management was greatly run by one guy. Loved the bonuses and the chances to advance and learn more. Downsides where when no customers walked in the door. No cust I'll mess no sales no commissions.
good,Had Great leadership years ago. Was able to be very flexible on family and work life. Was also very flexible on school life as well. People are great to work with young and mature.
good,"I started at sears in the summer of 2015 working in mattresses and I left in October 2018. It was a very motivating job. I loved going to work. The potential was unlimited in terms of money. I learned a lot about mattresses and being in a hourly + commission based job made me not want to go back to just hourly anymore. Some of the managers were great, whereas others were just useless. Everyday was a learning process for me, and as a salesperson I got better and better. There were changes to the commission here and there, but overall it was fair and I believe it's better than what any other company offers. Things weren't the same anymore after they declared bankruptcy, so I made the tough choice to leave. I truly hope they recover and make a comeback."
good,Worked Monday through Saturday. Busy environment but no job security with down sizing and bankruptcy. Would of been a good place to stay if there was job security and not all the downsizing and restructuring.
good,I worked in the automotive part in two different states. It is very difficult to get fired and they are very willing to work with you. Time wise they do expect a lot out of you so the work/life balance is not too good. Compensation was fair to above average in both places I worked
good,Sears was a great place to work at. I was able to learn so much and move up rather quickly. Cross training into different departments and job functions.
good,Great coworkers and good work environment.  I enjoyed interaction with customers and helping them find what they wanted.  Very good training was provided.
good,"Procesos de intervención para resolución de problemas muy burocráticos, centralizados y con fallas en la logística con el almacén general."
good,Taking photos of clients on a daily basis. Designing photographs to enhance pictures and try to make a bigger sales. Overall making customers happy with pictures that were taken and show them enhancements that were made to photographs.
good,"unfortunately sears closed down near me, if your attitude is good, youll make a great employee. Employees became friends, made working much easier as well as the want to be at work."
good,We had get togethers and contests. They acknowledged the associates that hit their sales goals monthly.  Everyone always were their when you needed any help.

good,"Sears was a great work environment. Hi energy, great co workers, smiling customers. Always something to do. Never bored or twiddling your thumbs. They hired from within most times first so there was room for advancement."
good,"A typical day at work in the Jewelry Department included coming in, clock in, and setting up signs, jewelry pieces, and cash registers. It was easy, but the hardest part of the job would probably be when the store isn't busy."
good,Sears has been a great company for a long time. The management there during my employment was outstanding. Providing equal opportunity for everyone was their secondary focus. Providing great customer service of course was their first priority. I certainly would recommend Sears to my friend and family.
good,"A smaller sears right in youe neighberhood  was great              while it lasted and at the time fewer  employees so we all took care of mechandising, store upkeep, unlading and stocking trucks mixing paint, everyone there knew how to do any job in the store  My inro to retailing,"
good,Company struggled for awhile but was led by a devoted district manager who never focused on struggles but gave motivation to help you succeed. Wages would be better if not so many hours were required for salaried employees.
good,"A regular work day consised of loading and unlaoding trucks and pallets, aswell as provide basic customer serivce. I worked there a total of 8 years, so to say the least it was a awsome job."
good,"Company was great to work for, but the constant threat of the company going out of business is enough to drive people away.  Work/life balance was great."
good,"Great team managers and decent work environment. However, advancement is limited and job security is low due to Sears struggling as a business. Still, great people and good company culture."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Sears for the most part. The store manager was nice and was willing to make schedules to accommodate my schedule for classes. The pay was generous and I the customers were mostly nice. The only bad thing I really have to say is a sales lead would constantly harass people for no reason and has done many things that would be considered fireable offenses. If I had the opportunity, I would go back in a heartbeat (as long as the sales lead was not there)."
good,"I have worked at sears for 23 years, I love it! The only reason I'm leaving is because my store is closing and I cannot relocate at this time. The culture is members first, truly the best thing about retail!"
good,A typical day at work is helping customers out and then when there is nobody in line just go around making sure the store is presentable. The managers are very fun and outgoing.
good,"Nice summer job, great employees, co workers and managers are friendly, easy to communicate with manager, easy to change availability, great place to work as a part time during highschool"

good,"I started working as a Sales agent and was promoted internally based on professional and Academic achievements."
good,"- A typical day consists of watching over the sales floor and greeting customers as they walk by and helping out the cliental with any questions they have."
good,"I was employed there for several years which was pretty good.  Management at Sears was not very honest when asking about the rumors that our department was relocating, and they waiting to the last minute to tell us the truth."
good,"I became an expert in the products I sold,  lawn & garden particularly where I had no prior knowledge; tools I had a very solid foundation and built on that.  Store manager was very helpful in learning the most I could about my position."
good,I can only speak for my local store but my local store has flexible hours and solid management. There are problems beyond the control of the local staff but everything that local management can realistically do for the staff they do.
good,Dealing with customers was the main component of my work and also performing office administration functions. I learned how to appropriately deal with all sorts of customers. I enjoyed working with people.
good,I enjoy working with a group of researchers trying to solve the hard problems of supply chain and operation management. Work place is pretty chilled out and you are given time to develop new methods and try
good,I liked the sales job because it allowed me to be in touch with different group of people. I made relationships with my costumers and helped them to find their need. I liked my Job and did my best to promote the store and sell merchandise. It went sought after sears began having financial troubles that led them to close all their stores in Canada.
good,"Management is the best I've ever had. a regular work day flies by. very low stress and flexible hours, The people there are definitely the best part of this job."
good,working at sears is a good job if you were married or have room mates only because it won't be enough for a single life style. i loved it but i think it was a good job for after high school.
good,I really enjoyed myself  at Sears hate to see it has to come to an end.I worked there for 12 years got to know a lot of great people. This company has a feeling of family I have made some lifetime friends.
good,"Not a bad company, you get to meet a bunch of interesting people. The only complaint that I have is the lack of social life. There is just too many calls to handle"
good,"Working with a great group of people and helping customers."
good,Sears is company that  helps you grow professionally as well as personally giving you training in different work environments adding better training every year.
good,As the store manager I really enjoyed my job.  Unfortunately Sears is closing their doors all over the country.  My store was on of those stores.  I definitely would still be there.  My bonus was bigger than my regular check.  I always hit my metrics.
good,Ive learned alot at Sears. Learned how to do alot of stuff with reporting and computers. Learned how to deal with customers. Learned how to become a manager.
good,"Good company  to work for but just need to work on the pay for the kind of job. Good place and people to work around ,will wil Orkney there again. ..."
good,"I worked for Sears for 5 years ,in 2015 they stopped doing home warranty work and cut service technicians from 165 to 80 and could only offer part time hours."
good,Hard work not enough compensation. Unloading trucks is very pressing on the body and the rate that they offer to me is not sufficient but it is a job and one that i will do to my full capabilities.
good,Was given encouragement and opportunity to learn and advance.  Liked planning and seeing the final results of marketing plan.  Enjoyed the complexity of analyzing sales numbers and budgets.
good,except center is closing at end of Nov. great management team. great work pace and environment also the team managers take personal pride in agents progression

good,"I've learned so many things during the time I work at Sears, for example, learned how to satisfy the customer, that means help to find what they need, work efficiently. The hardest part of the job is I had to work eight hours minimum a day, They have a nice kitchen where I can relax and have lunch."
good,"Working for Sears Canada was a great experience. They valued our opinions, we were often asked to give feedback on sales, promotions because we dealt one on one with our customers. Above all, the customer came first. This is important to keep them satisfied and coming back."
good,"It was a fun place to work Tasks were easy and the team was great. I would have still been there but the doors closed to the public in July. Store closed, but after 20 years I did not want to go forward with company no longer."
good,I loved my job there. Using tactics to help stop theft both internally and externally was very very rewarding. My manager at the time was not very sympathetic to anyone having a family and that conflicted with work/home balance.
good,Great place to work. has provided for my family for a very long time. the hours are very flexible. i learned how to work on cars there. The store manager is awesome!
good,Started there as an employee and quickly got promoted to the staff. In its better days Sears was a good company to work for. As the the corporate positions changed it seemed like the company went downhill without any breaks.
good,Sears is a company that takes ppl in that are of good work ethics. They give you an understanding of making money and striving to make it further in the business of retail and management.
good,Good place to start in sales if looking for a part time setup with another job or school. Position was base salary + commission. Great management (at the location I work at).
good,"Difficile de vivre une fermeture après 24 ans dans cette entreprise."
good,"I enjoyed working at sears manor, it was a very family oriented environment. I loved all of my patients and fellow employees. I was given the opportunity to grow within the company and become supervisor of the nursing dept. We all worked together to create a loving environment for our patients in an effort for them to enjoy their stay as well as complete their goals to return home and function independently."
good,"Job duties were monotonous. Emptying fitting rooms, returning clothes to sales floor, etc.Really enjoyed cashier duties. Management was fine. Very fast paced during certain times; Christmas, back to shcool. These were my favorite seasons."
good,I worked with a lot of great people at SEARS. My job as a Loss Prevention Officer was demanding but very rewarding. The biggest challenge I had when first hired was working shift work. Fun place to work with lots of perks.
good,Dommage que cette grande société soit fermé  beaucoup de plaisir à y travailler il avait une belle équipe de direction.
good,the work environment is great. Everyone has to do their job but when one department get busy and the other is not busy they used to call on the associate to help. Working there gave me a good work experience in many different things.
good,If you just wanna stand around and cash a customer out every so often it’s perfect you don’t have to be stressed about anything there it’s a nice slow pace very good for a first job
good,"A fun place to work and help make a difference with customers and associates.  Upper management shows value of the hard work performed and appreciates teams sacrifice in achieving results."
good,"Great Place to work if you want to have chance of working in an corporate industry like Sears. great people great training provided for new software and new tools if you in an IT sector."
good,Good company to work for especially for a tool enthusiast and anyone that likes to meet people and explain how tools  work. They also  give good employee discounts.
good,"Overall I would say this is the hardest job I've ever had. On the regular, a truck would come and you would have to unload its contents and move it to the store floor."
good,"I worked in the photography studio. We took the pictures and sold them to customers. I learned more about photography than what I had known before being hired. It was a lot of fun. My manager was really kind and funny and yet still productive as a manager. All of us employees had fun setting up, posing customers, and taking photos. Getting customers to buy more pictures than what their discounted and sometimes free coupons included could sometimes be very difficult."
good,"Flexible hours. Part time & full time. Great work environment, Upbeat & fast pace. Management was very understanding & accommodating. Employee discounts offered."
good,"Fixing appliances, L.earned about different appliances and how they functioned. Management was very hard. Work place culture was good. When working on appliance and not able to figure out the problem. It took more time to troubleshoot. When get  employees"

good,Since the the managers were informed so were You you had ways to grow with company and benefits people were willing to help you grow in the company people were friendly and helpful.
good,"Customer service"
good,Worked there in high school.  Management and staff were great to work with and very know knowledgeable.  Left to get full time hours and better pay and benefits.
good,It was a rather relaxed environment with good coworkers and the managenent was very positive and encouraging. If it was still open I would recommend it fir anyone lookimg for a partime position
good,"Sucks that they closed, was an easy job. Location was great, and managers were mostly nice. Made good friends, customers were a pain in the butt though not very nice lol."
good,"- Learned to be prepared for anything that could happen in a shift, plan ahead, and always be friendly "
good,Working with Sears was enjoyable day in and day out because everybody looks after each other. It was a diverse company not just for the staff but for the clients/customers as well. It was a pleassure working with Sears.
good,"Very team centered work place, morning & evening meetings held daily, strict floor rules, competitive sales techniques pushed, and very involved management in each department"
good,"We welcome customers by greeting them in the morning, we make sure everything  is in place and also start a day with a positive attitude,open  I had the chance of having a great  manager, and also amazing coworkers, we're worked as a team and also. I learn a lot about new products.We provide a great customers service, but sometime not everyone is satisfy and we have to find the way to satisfy everyone.The most enjoyable part is when a customer walk away very happy."
good,Long leases in outdated buildings.  Stores look old and  little is being invested to improve maintenance. Annual raises have not been given in several years.
good,Was a great first management experience . Learned all about ordering product and procedures. The only down fall was Sears was starting to close the Automotive shops across the country.
good,The location it which I worked was great.  Had a lot of talent within the store location.  SM was very focused on the people within the store location.
good,"It was a god experience overall"
good,Taking portraits of Families and individuals was an exciting and fun experience.Working in the store part of Sears was a little more challenging .The only thing about this job was it was part-time and a lot of work.
good,Sears was a decent first job. It was stressful at times but had great people working there. The hours went a little long at times when folks weren't working fast enough but besides that it was fine.
good,Sears over the years has been flexible with my hours. It's very difficult to move up from a starting position. What makes the store really is the management team.
good,nothing I can say matters any more because the higher ups ran the company into the ground. they had a great discount of 25% on almost everything but they shout down
good,Mauvaises décisions administratives ont causé la perte de Sears.
good,Working at Sears was fun. When there weren't any customers in the store you were able to take a break and also catch up on your work if you were falling behind. Working at Sears I learned to build my customer  service skills throughout time. Learning the computer system was the hardest part when working there but it came to me during time
good,The fact that they equip you with your own work van and tools is very convenient... This jobs allows you to start your work day from home and end at home...
good,Every day was different because you never knew what type of customer would come through the door.  Always interesting and challenging.  Good working environment and great coworkers.
good,"I learned about security, job process, The hardest part is standing on your feet all day long. The most enjoyable part is TV on lunch and break. Nice/ hard working persons."
good,"A typical day at work required reps to remain standing."
good,"The job is straightforward, but there is a lot of responsibility on your shoulders. You are the only thing standing between an upset customer and quality service."
good,"Fluctuating customer traffic. Made for some boring afternoons."
good,"Sears is a nice place to work, except that there isn't enough traffic to sell. Whenever people visit the store, the commission is good. It would have a great job if they had benefits."
good,"I enjoyed my job. I had excellent co-workers. The expectations were not realistic that are set by field management,"
good,"I was young and work was work.... The job was too much for too little pay. Eight dollars a hour, and you had to unload truck, stock warehouse/shelves, deal with customer orders, prepare repair tickets for lawn mowers and weed eaters, address the customers with exceptional public relation skills. Not a bad job, just back in the early two thousands, it seemed underpaid for the work you were responsible for. I have worked for twice the paid amount with far less responsibility. The job is very fulfilling, just was under paid in my opinion."
good,"easy job but the management was awful. they worked alright with school. didnt like having to be pressured to get credit apps, they depended on how many hours you would get"
good,"I loved managing the department I had sold in for 30 years. I was able to assist my associates with obtaining their monthly bonuses. I love taking care of the members, resolving their issues.  A typical day would start by having a store meeting that would start with accolades for the high achievers from the day before. Keeping associates up to date with the stores performance and give daily goals. Opening the store and support the team throughout the day. I learned that I am able to excel as a manager.  I am able to get the job done and be respected by the entire team. "
good,enjoyed most of the 13 yrs there.   the last few years were difficult with the end coming. co workers were excellent and an overall great work environment.
good,good place to start a work place. and hopefully move on up. slow at time but always treated as family. management is always helpful and eager to teach.
good,"Pros are you get an hour lunch break, work with supportive team members."
good,Relaxed environment. friendly managers and good work culture. Lot of scope for learning. good support system for new comers. Good infrastructure and office location
good,"Typical day is straightening clothing or items sold, ringing out customers, helping customers find things, and upselling if possible.  Credit applications are highly recommended and can have an affect on hours.  I learned at lot about setting up different areas of the store, putting items in selling points of the store.  Management changes happened a lot recently as well as other store changes, can get hectic and confusing.  Management is organized and gives recognition regularly, they are highly motivated.  The hardest part is dealing with irate customers, the most enjoyable is working with the co-workers, or most of them."
good,"Overall, as a high school kid working at the time, the work was easy, but very tiring. there were many days where the work was a bit too much. the management team were very nice, they were nice, except for the head boss, he over worked us."
good,"I was in sales and though they really push meeting certain metrics (credit card sign ups, protection plans... etc). Other than that it is a decent place to work and I made more than I expected to."
good,Learn lot of thing which helps me to upgrade my technical knowledge. Lot of thing you can do on your own. Total freedom to implement your knowledge in the project.
good,"Nothing must to say.it was a good work place everybody knew each other. it was a good company at first then it went downhill from there."
good,During the holiday season the work was very time consuming and demanding. The culture of the company was laid back and employees were a joy to work with. Management was always willing to step in and stand up for the store and employees.
good,"To do a monthly review on associates so they would know where they stand with metrics."
good,Fair and relaxed place to work. I was paid by the car so I had a lot of opportunity to make a lot of money. Management was great and always helpful. Very enjoyable placed to work.
good,"volunteering there was quite fun, I've learned how to maintain and restock inventory, communicating and helping out customers, and having experiences on working with retail."
good,"The company was a great place to work, the associates were great,"
good,I felt extremely under trained most of my time at the company. I was perhaps under prepared on my part as a young employee to meet the challenge. Truely would enjoy another go around with this position.
good,The Auto Center was great place to work at a great team and was great leading them unfortunately it had to come to an end because the main store closed and since we're connected to them in the same building we had to leave as well however if we were in a separate building we would have remained open because we were very profitable
good,"My typical day consisted of selling hardware products to customers such as tools, lawnmowers, and tractors. Other than that, I would always lend a hand by helping and co-workers with projects they had.  The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely how close all the workers were and how they were always willing to lend a hand."
good,"Commis à l'entrée des données"
good,When i had worked there we had a small amount of employees in our department and we all worked with the exception of our mgr. So during a transfer to another department the mgr. was let go. So i stepped into a mgr. role that was doomed from the start.
good,"If you're a self starter this is for you!  Very fast paced, always changing, seems like it never closes, inbound madness :)  great folks that really ca re about each other"
good,Really enjoyed my time with Sears Canada.  Great people that fostered a family environment.  Hours were reasonable.  Management was great.  Sad to see this company is closing.
good,"Enjoyed working there,  The people were great, management helpful in career advancement.  Benefits were great.  positive and negative feedback when required was very helpful to improve skills"
good,"best part of the job high pace, have to deal with different people and their needs."
good,"Easily one of the best jobs I've ever had. I was only part time, but I consistently logged full time hours. There was always a feel that we were having fun but we always got the job done."
good,Company was Good to work for great benefits. Management seems to be all in together but employees and environment was a pleasure to work with. While working here I had a great work experience
good,"Loved the people i worked with and the job itself, always was on the move which made a day to day experience different however the company was poorly managed which resulted in company closure."
good,"Great working environment."
good,Was a good company to work for as technician. At one time this company lead the pack. Unfortunatly over the years of misspending and poor management decisions the decline of Sears Canada began.
good,"A workplace with a sense of commardority and humor, it like a second family. The managers are at the top of their game. The salesman are the best they truly care about the person before the purchase."
good,"Every day have to deal with customer complaint and resolve according to Sears policies."
good,"Working at Sears allowed me the opportunity to be able to see many different departments and positions. Working with merchandising I was able to do/see a bit of everything from sales to management, even to the warehouses. Mostly younger and older people who work there so there can be some sort of power struggle that takes place most times."
good,"- Coordinated sale goals with the Sales Manager"
good,Fun environment managers always had us ready to do our job the only issue was the long driving to different homes weren’t in the area of where we lived at
good,I started working here during a construction reno.  I enjoyed the people so much I applied for a job with the store.  I started at car pickup and then went to stocker.  With time I made it to shipping and receiving and became asst. doc lead.  2 years later Sears svc center opened up at our store and I was able to transfer over to work for them.
good,"Sears ma permis de développé les QUALITÉS ET APTITUDES ci-dessous:"
good,I liked working at sears it was a great place to work. The pay was good for the work. Most of the team stayed in a good mood from day to day and enjoyed there job.
good,"This is my first experience in Canada . I was speaking different language and dealing with different people."
good,"I have worked in several stores and have had a different experience in all of them."
good,"Management is fair, responsive, and supportive. Relevant training is provided for new hires. While the workplace culture is relaxed, there is still a strong sense of individual accountability and teamwork."
good,"It was a pleasure to work for Sears holdings, Workplace culture is very big with Sears and I felt very comfortable with my managers and the company.  The hardest part of my job has been the last year and a half, job security has been tough not knowing from one day to the next if your job would be eliminated and you would be let go or given new tasks, your job was all ways a risk."
good,"Buenas prestaciones, pero horarios de trabajo muy duros en ocasiones"
good,The department required constant knowledge of equipment also be able to assemble for part time plus commission was unfair but the store discount was good
good,"It sales what do you expect; huge turn overs. The people that stay, they stay for the obvious because they obviously were the best of their class.  Lot of people make great money here, just not for those that cannot succeed at this kind of job."
good,"i enjoyed the experience but the co workers always were too competitive and lacked connection most of the time, fortunately i didn't let it bother me and i learned alot about photography and sales"
good,"Sears is an easy place to work at if you're a cashier. There's really nothing to complain about other than customers being dirty and leaving trash throughout the store and finding piles of clothes in the dressing room stalls. Also, the company cares A LOT about how many credit cards you get customers to apply for. If you have a strict boss they may even fire you for not meeting your daily goal of credits. However, my boss wasn't like that but I heard of it happening at another Sears within the same area."
good,"j'ai appris plusieurs affaires au Sears surtout le fait de bien servir les clients aussi la patience pendant le travail , la rapidité quand le magasin est rempli tout ça m'a rendu meilleur dans mon poste."
good,As a cashier you have multiple options to make extra money if you are able to close online deals and credit card applications which are good opportunities to make the job worth it.
good,"I you want to learn about Home Improvement this the place for an opportunity to learn and grow. They always have training opportunity, coaching is always available by management if needed. Always opportunity for winning trips depending on your work performance."
good,When I get to work I get right on the phone to make calls to clients to sale protection coverage for Sears appliances.  I very stressful job because times are hard.  Trying to talk someone in to buying coverage they turned down in the store is no easy task.
good,"Utilized CCTV to track and recognize theft situations, analyzed reports to ensure minimal internal and external theft, Inventory, Logged all high value items arriving and departing the store. Ran monthly safety meetings and handled any bio-hazard situations. This position required me to hold a private security license."
good,I workked for sears for 5 years ..started off as a seasonal worker but i did so well they hired me on permanently..i really enjoyed working for sears as a part time cashier .. I received vacation time afer 1 year..
good,Una empresa en la que permite trabajar y otorga prestaciones superiores a las de la ley.
good,"Sears have a great training process for all sears associates , the LP on-boarding process is one of a kind, the management support  is very good , the store team always have high engagement with coworkers and customers , opportunity cratering  and keeping talent"
good,"Fun place to work. Competitive environment with fast paced day to day activities. Overall, enjoyable and was difficult to say good-bye to co-workers and managers."
good,Sears was an excellent work experience solely because of the team that I was part of. I had easily the best manager I have ever worked under while I was there. But even at a store level it was obvious that the company is heading towards its end. A terrible fate for a company that built so much of this country.
good,My tasks where mostly controlled  by preventive maintenance from Corporate and work orders from local Manager. As long as you completely finished these tasks all was good. District Manager easy to work with. Engagement with customers was great.
good,"the job was great, but the management there was awful. when i say management i mean corporate. the manager directly above me was fine, but corporate will not allow for more the the bare min employees to be hired. so we were severely understaffed at all times."
good,"Contact 200 customers by phone daily to upgrade, renew or add extended warranties for various items. Solve customer problems/concerns as they arise. While in this position I have also received numerous awards, including top salesman in the nation. I was able increase productivity, and exceed goals on a daily basis."
good,"A once thriving pillar of the community, trying to compete with an online company that they are taking away from the consumer who comes into a brick and mortar store, also with so many closing security is now an issue."
good,"Arrive at work 8am, enter in my time code. Check the daily list of things which are needed to be done for the day. Check in with head manager after head to the floor making sure that shelves are stocked and the store is clean. Customers begin to arrive I place myself near the entrance to greet everyone. Then I go to the back and unloading new products, informing my team. The hardest part of the job is staying on top of everything and making sure it all gets done, so that everyone is happy. I truly enjoy meeting customers and assisting them in any way I can and building a friendship with returning customers which is good for the store and the company I have learned to handle difficult tasks, to think outside the box and be creative. to be able to take the initiative and to speak my mind in a respectful manner."
good,Me parece una muy buena empresa y con un ambiente de trabajo muy agradable pero el sueldo era muy inestable
good,If you want to be the owner of a business then look into a Sears Hometown stores. It will take a lot of your time and it is a lot of work but very satisfying. If you work for an owner of one of these stores you can expect them to be very hands on for you.
good,What i learned from this job is that no matter what type of customers that come in always keep a positive and healthy enviroment .. Also that it is important to make sure your area and around the store has to be neat !
good,"Sears was a great place to work, the Associates were like Family."
good,Must use your time wisely. Your routes are given to you each morning but you must take ownership of each customer. Must be willing to develop a repoire with other co-workers for shared knowledge. Management was very supportive but you are the technician and they simply do not have the knowledge you are suppose to have. If you enjoy basically running your own company without the stress of finding work or customer service(to a degree).
good,Great Place for career advancement. A typical work day for a Store manager will be to check email and plan out the day. Usually I have an agenda and a checklist of tasks that must be achieved to have a successful day.
good,"job was okay, for a temp a job, for a short time, some times  had free lunches, when i did my job no one bother me the was goody had three days a week, for about 8 months, had a few rough times, not bad,"
good,"Overall, and easy going job that had a lot of outgoing personalities. Managers were always very helpful and always encouraging. I worked in the automotive department where I would be in charge of inspecting customers vehicles and assist them with any repairs and replacements they may have needed. For the calm days, I would deal in day to day customer service and maintaining the workplace neatness."
good,"If you have the motivation you will make mor money, raises depend on personal performances, pleasent work environment, hectic at times, must be a multi tasker."
good,I worked in Sears Product Services. They closed it about 30 years ago. Making it tough to recommend to others. It was a good job though. The teamwork was great. Wish I could go back.
good,It is a fun place to work where you can learn a lot. The management is very cooperative and willing to teach. There are also a lot of opportunities to grow within the company.
good,"A good company to work. Culture/management of the company is very good, avg work pressure."
good,"Sears isnt a bad place to work for. It isnt the place that you expect to work at for years; for obvious reasons. There are some managers that are great, others fall flat. Everyone works to help each other and with the different departments, there is a possibility to get something you would like. Hours at times, do suck but if you talk to your manager, they will try to work with you."
good,This was a high school job and it was a nice little start up place to be an employee. I enjoyed the discounts to buy small things when I was on break. I had no problems with the employer during that time of my life.
good,"I learned and experienced a great deal at sears from both sides of the business from the call center point of view their is rarely a dull moment there is always something to do rather inbound or outbound call the people you work with almost become family due to working so many hours, also I had a great manager who took the time to actually teach the ins and outs of business not only because it was her job but she actually cared she was fair but if you got out of line she knew how to speak with you and deal with the issue.....On the delivery side of thing I believe I had best manager in the ware house he was stern but he was fair he taught everything he knew and always went the extra mile for customers and it showed in his\our work and by the customer reaction\interaction of the experience very professional and aware of all issues at hand never a compliant against our team or our boss we were so good we actually started getting request to have our team to make deliveries which was very flattering but he made sure we were humble and treated as a privilege"
good,"Nice job, good staff, nice pay and benefits. have worked for almost 2 years I enjoyed a lot. we were given good support from Manager and collegues. Nice place ot work ."
good,this job requires excellent phone communication and tact in dealing with difficult situations can be very rewarding and excellent support is always available
good,"I would receive a job from my truck in the morning, and ride out to the customer house about 8:30 Am. I would call the customer to let them know that I have a work oder for their washer or dryer. I would arrive at the home greet the customer and enter the home and make the necessary repairs. explain my finding to the customer. management  would track you inside of your vehicle throughout your route during the day.If you had a problem with anything they would be there to help fix it, either on the phone or would send someone to help you. The workplace culture was good, you show up to work and work all day long and then clockout once the job was done, if the job took longer to do, you stayed until completed. The hardest part of the job was selling additional product to customers after you complete a job.The most enjoyable part of the job was my freedom to drive to each location and managing my own time."
good,"Good for a first job. Opportunities for advancement are limited. Required breaks can be frustrating. Management varied in whether they were good or bad, hard to get along with or friendly. Mostly enjoyable customers."
good,"Fast ever changing environment, lots of travel. best trade show schedule. Very exciting lace to work. So much technology to learn you are always being trained."
good,This role gave me a good work life balance.  I work with and manage a diverse group of associates.  I enjoy the overall day in the life of retail working with members and associates.
good,"Lo único que puedo decir que no me gusto de este trabajo es que es muchísimo tiempo, porque de hay en fuera es un buen trabajo con muchas posibilidades."
good,Many good upper management people at Sears.  You must be committed to excel.  Changing gears quickly is necessary and you will feel you have accomplished something important at the end of the work day
good,"As a custom decorator, I had to be organized and on top of keeping up with all my accounts. The harder you worked the more you would get out of the job."
good,Trabajar para está empresa para mi fue una etapa de crecimiento personal ... Muy buen ambiente laboral y apoyo de mis jefes en piso
good,"I learned a great deal with Sears. Mostly, I learned how to be a stronger leader. I am part of the management that believes in an ""open door policy"", and  ""no question is stupid as long as you learn from the answer"". The hardest part of my job is a customer having an issue and not having a  resolution for there problem. I love being part of a team that works and plays well together."
good,buen ambiente de area de trabajo en la central con compañeros
good,"Sears has been around for a very long time, so the structure is tgere. However the ceo will cut his lost if  he feels the stores are not producing the revenue to clear the bottom line. This means that you  may be our of a job next quarter."
good,The work environment was fun and constantly had productive work. Everything was hands on so you really had to be attentive to details. Management was good for the most part.
good,"very hot in summer season and very cold in the winter seasons, the culture was good and the pay was acceptable.The job was easy, sometime employees wasn't pleasant"

good,"Es una gran empresa en donde te puedes desarrollar laboral y personalmente, además de que hay mucha oportunidad de promocionarse"
good,I sold lawn and garden equipment was great until the economy died and then sales died. I would of moved to Brand Central but I went back into the electrical field
good,A highly member focused environment with strong accountability and performance expectations.   Sears employs a coaching environment to train and support its associates so they can achieve success.
good,"Sears does not always have traffic unless in the juniors department, but because it's a huge store, there are a lot of things to do; fold clothes, put up displays, etc. The people you work with make you want to stay."
good,"Assist in opening and closing warehouse daily. I operated forklifts and other warehouse equipment. I maintained a safe, clean, healthy and organized warehouse. I ensured on-time, accurate delivery of products to dealer, distributors and customer. I assisted in maintaining records of inventory and loaded and unloaded trucks."
good,"Typical day at work consisted of obtaining multiple tasks through out the day including : merching, signing, putbacks. Friendly work environment between coworkers and management."
good,"Typical Work Day- work in a fast pace, unload trailer, open merchandise, tag & hang merchandise, serve customer in timely manner, sell merchandise, follow up with my staff on tasks for the day, complete schedules, process returns to vendors."
good,"My time at Sears has encouraged me to be more productive as a whole. My current manager was a manager in the Hard Lines department on the main side of the store previously and his return brought about quite the change in the Auto Center. The overall morale improved and our team became more cohesive. "
good,"Every morning between 7:30-8:20 you will receive your appointments for the day for your Sales manager."
good,"Alesys something to do on thr job."
good,On a day to day basis things can get tedious unless of course you push yourself to move up and learn more so that new jobs in the work place can come about such as moving up from just being a lube/tire tech you could move up to where you could be doing alignments on many different brands of vehicles. Management is good depending on the store you work at. The hardest part of the job is when the store is understaffed and you're trying to bring in and keep up with the flow of customer requests.
good,"No había oportunidad de crecimiento, es una empresa limitante en ese aspecto."
good,"the short time i was employed by sears, i realize the potential this company has and wanted to be apart of the growth, still a great place to work, and grow in the near future."
good,"Everyday we have a morning meeting before we open the store.  The manager discuss the performance of every department, how the daily goals are met. Learn how to improve sales everyday.  How to deal with customers complaints and how to please them.  We were required to always put stocks at the beginning of the day...and make sure all new stocks that arrive are well taken care and merchandise properly.  The hardest part of the job are some employees not helping to finish the job on time.  But for those team players its enjoyable to work because we can finish the job easily.  Cooperation is the most important part of the job."
good,"Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores is a great place to work. The people who work in the stores, as well as the owners and field teams all want to succeed and continue the legacy of Sears legacy for years to come."
good,"Good company to work for with appropriate work life balance, pay and benefits.  The company offers many positions from sales to service so depending on your career path, there is something for everyone."
good,"fun to work at great for college aged. not great for a career prefect start up job, management is poor sales are low moral is lacking. Pay Is low and forget raises are none"
good,"SEARS was my first experience in the sales and marketing industry."
good,"Plug in your laptop at night to download and upload your route, wake up and grab your gear and jump in your van parked outside, head to your first job and start the day, work hard and fast and diligently to get home but you wont because the faster your work and harder, the more jobs get added to you, hope that no jobs hold up your time otherwise you work from 8am to 8pm, get home and have enough time to eat and shower, rinse and repeat looking forward for the weekend."
good,"A great place to work a family oriented place to work I have been there almost 16 years .I have learned a lot and grew with the needs of the company I am a sales associate helping customers ,cleaning department also cash capable"
good,"SEARS es una empresa con un excelente ambiente laboral, una empresa organizada."
good,"Most days are always what to expect from internal and external whether dealing with customers , management or our peers. I learned that you can always take a difficult task and turns it into something wonderful. Management was not always the best but overall some of the managers did what they taught to do best. The hardest part of the job was the insults and abused behavior  that we had to take from dealing with the customer everyday. The most enjoyable part of the job was making a customer satisfied."
good,This job was great in terms of flexibility with my school schedule and requesting days off for events. There was opportunity for growth if management saw you were hard worker. They offered paid vacation and personal/sick days. In terms of the work environment it was horrible! Customers are rude and mean. The checkout process is tedious. You have to ask the customer so many questions before you actually get to payment step. Mangers definitely have their favorites and having to get credit cards was annoying. Overall if you worked on the floor or any other department besides cashier this job wasn't bad at all.
good,"Prepared merchandise for sales floor"
good,Sears is a fun place to work. Its company culture supports the employees and the company vision. At Sears there is no shortage of fun because you will always be interacting with customers. Work is plenty especially when there is a sale. The most fun part of the job is interacting with employees to get a job done. The hardest part of the job is dreading the amount of work that is unfinished. Overall Sears is a fun place to work at. It is great as a starting entry level job for anyone who is looking to put their foot in the door and become part of the workforce.
good,"I have enjoyed my time at Sears and am grateful for the opportunities they have provided.  I have gained a great deal of knowledge throughout my 12 years of working for them, and trust that my level of service has either met or exceeded their expectations.  Although I am often tasked with maintaining the clean and well stocked presence of our sales floor, I am always willing to stop what I am doing to serve a customer, as they are my top priority.   Depending on the day I can usually be found reading and implementing planograms, scanning inventory, completing price changes, stocking shelves, putting away freight, securing our products and assisting customers.  I know what my bosses expect out of me, and I work hard every day to meet their expectations.  I enjoy helping people, and take pride in being able to sit back at the end of the day and know that I achieved what I set out to do."
good,"it was the first job that gave me an opportunity to advance in my carreer and get an experience in HR. my direct boss was the one who gave me a shot, no one else per say. the team was fine. culture was okay. a lot of new commers to canada."
good,A typical work day started with counting the drawers and preparing for customers. I learned the different types of jewelry. I learned the importance of good customer service. My manager was great with answering any questions or concerns I may have had. She was a wonderful teacher. The hardest part of the job was boosting sales on promotional items. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping my customers.
good,"Open Cash, morning meeting, meet and greet customers, assist customers with purchases.  Process sales, exchanges, returns.  Sell credit cards, collect donations for Kids with cancer.  Keep work area tidy.  The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers with their purchases."
good,"At the store where I worked we were a very busy store. Great team of leaders and sales associates. Very easy to be promoted, this store especially looks internally. The hardest part is the rushes and if you dont have a supportive team can be stressful."
good,"A typical day at work was long hours with various shifts. At times I would work grave yard for about 12+ hours, and at time I would work half days during the week. The workplace culture was not the best I have experience but we got by. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers and an unstable schedule."
good,"On typical work day the position has very stressful"
good,"Look, it's a job.  I have worked for a literal handful of companies that have gone under...Sears is going to be one of them in the next five years.  There were busy days and there were slow days.  Some management was flawed and some management understood that we needed incentives and they tried really hard to make it exciting to work and ""sell"" Sears.  I enjoyed my job on most days.  I enjoyed the customers on most days.  I enjoyed my coworkers and management and even didn't have that difficult of a time dealing with ""upper"" could not be seen management most days.  Work is what you make it (as is life).  If you want to be difficult then everything around you will be too."
good,"Again another comapny that is barely hanging on. Sears is a great company. I learned a lot from my short time there. I would have loved to stay longer. However  military life calls and we had to move suddenly. The training was horrible. The software was ungodly outdated with all sorts of bugs. After a month of paid training I was more than ready to be an active sales associate.  Good pay. Decent commision if done right. Lots of ways to earn money. Bit tough if you worked with ""sharks"".  Management was great. Very helpful and supportive. Made me feel right at home."
good,They are a great place to work for they really care for their customers. They also make sure that you are trained well before being scheduled by yourself.
good,A completive place. It is a changeling company to work for. It could be stressful at times.  But rewarding to.  Employees get paid well and great benefits.
good,"Working during the holidays is probably the worst thing about retail. During Black Friday, we were yelled at and the bad thing the system crashed on us, so we had to enter everything in manually."
good,I worked at Sears as a Seasonal Sales Associate. I was lucky to have a great co-workers within the soft line department. My Supervisor was  very fun and motivated that makes her employee to feels the same.
good,"An okay place to work, just not enough work available. I enjoy being a Drivers instructor. I enjoy teaching teenagers how to drive. Sometimes job can be a challenge due to students who have never been behind the wheel of a car."
good,"Easy work balance where you made a second family.  Fast pace and competitive,  managers are welcoming and put employees first. Never  a  dull  moment."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is that you meet people with different backgrounds and needs that makes the hours go by easy. At times, the most hardest part of the job is unable to satisfy some individuals needs but with communication and customer friendliness and kindness one is able to turn the person point of view. There are employees with diversities background."
good,"Bueno los días en el trabajo suelen ser muy entretenidos ya que tanto en embarque como en recibo suele haber carga de trabajo diariamente, eso hace que el día sea más ameno. Así mismo eh aprendido la recepción de mercancía y el embarcarla para ue valla a distintos destinos"
good,Cheerful atmosphere where I worked with amazing people who love their job and work real hard.  Scheduled rooms for the daily visits of vendors and I enjoyed helping anyone with whatever was needed from a pencil to processing their expense report.
good,Sears portrait studio was my first job.  It was a great place to start and get experience. You got to provide families with memories that they will have forever.
good,"I cannot speak for all locations but the Sears at the auburn mall was slightly disorganized. At first I thought this was because of the holiday season but long time employees told me ""its always like this"" so In that regard use caution when applying. On a side note the employee discount was nice to have during the holiday season."
good,"I had a good client base who would call me as often as their business demanded. I would try to help the dept manager or counter person to increase their sales when it was requested of me. I enjoyed that inter action with my client base, because that displayed trust in myself & Sears, so I feed off of that."
good,"Tener que laborar el sabado y domingo ,trabajar en baae a metas"
good,Modèle d'affaire en constant changement. Proactif dans les nouveaux concepts d'affaire.
good,"Every time i had to work the morning shift, the Supervisor would always have a morning meeting to ensure we were all on the same page. He would inform us on any goals that were set, any contributions that increased our sales, and any suspicious activities we needed to keep an eye out for."
good,"Sears is my favorite retailer that I have worked for. I have a great balance in my life and I am well compensated. "
good,"I enjoy working with the staff and management."
good,Very productive place with multi task duties which inspired me to learn more and assist the customers and advance for the last 12 years of service. Having my customer to come back to me and refer others to me to assist with their future needs. Just knowing so many people can trust in my knowledge and always return.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Sears. I was a seasoned Operations Manager, but not in the retail sales environment. For this reason I learned a great deal about the retail industry, and the challenges this fast paced industry presents."
good,"Some days you would receive back to back calls, relentlessly; that was by far the most stressful part. Management does notice when you're a top performer and I was quickly chosen for a promotion to development training.The environment was very much friendly, yet still oriented around competitive sales."
good,"Fast paced great customers."
good,Need to be level-headed and flexible. Many issues with management when I was there. Keep an open mind and be patient. Customer service is always a difficult field.
good,"Very fast paced job, you must be able to multi task. I have learned a lot of patience with this job. I was able to move from a shoe associate to a manager very quickly. I enjoy making customers happy which is what the job is all about. However, there is no job security."
good,"Sears was a great place to work. I enjoyed working for the leadership team, and was on the cutting edge of many new projects, and directives. I received national recognition for my ability to identify quality associates, and coach and develop them into high performance team players."
good,I loved the job and the customers. However some of the co workers would not come in and the manager was never to be found. Therefore I had some troubles. & This was within a week of being hired.
good,high call volume call center/ answering inbound calls regarding sears home warranty/ unlimited schedule change request// 30 min lunches // full an part time available
good,Gives opportunities to learn new technologies. Trainings are arranged at regular intervals. Good work life balance. There is office timing flexibility. Cab services are available.
good,Enjoy working here. Store is well run and has friendly employees. Employee discount is now hooked in with there shop your way rewards program. Promotes from within when they have a viable candidate.
good,Typically the days were very stressful due to the work that needs to be done and the amount of time and help that are available to perform the tasks.  One of the hardest parts of the job was being the only manager that was in the store and everyone asking for your assistance at the same time.
good,"En general, el empleo no es demasiado exigente, hay buenos compañeros y el ambiente en general es bueno, hay facilidades de crecimiento en la empresa y buenas prestaciones además de las que exige la ley."
good,my typical day involved answering phones and directing customers to the correct department for assistance and closing at night collecting the cash and receipts from all the registers and securing it in the safe. Everyone I worked with was very friendly there were a lot of employees with many years there and there were some young workers who would come and go.
good,This is a fast paced environment that challenges the manager in dealing with multiple issues at the same time and making quick decisions to resolve customer issues and repairs while driving sales. I learned how to effectively manage in a virtual environment as well as project leadership as i collaborated with several departments and management teams across the business acumen. the hardest part of the job is trying to stay on task when dealing with multiple issues especially when unexpected safety issues arise. I most enjoy the sales competitions and training events.
good,"I worked whatever they needed, and when they needed. stayed on call, thats how I got most of my hours because we got alot of no calls and no shows. management were awesome before they retired.Had to sell protection plans and if you didnt meet your quota , you were fired the following month."
good,Really fast paced work with plenty of travel. Learn great communication skills and company will invest in you to learn and grow within the company. Hardest part of the job would be managing life and work. Most enjoyable part is meeting new people everyday and nice scenery drives.
good,"Unload appliances from trucks, carry customers purchases to vehicles, organize appliances after arriving, box and send out customers online orders, unbox arrived shipped clothing and hang them. What I've learned about sears is that you have to have muscles and be fast at the job. The hardest past of the job is when the trucks comes with all the appliances and we have to start unloading them. interacting with customers"
good,"good place to work, average compensation, average upward mobility. Like other types of retail stores. Company is moving to a online based market place to compete with amazon- closing many stores."
good,"When I started working with Sears 8 years before Things was very smooth and positive. All of sudden changes start happening to improve the finance and sale of company, but failing every time. Finally company started to closing the  retail stores and one of them was mine."
good,Work is usual at a steady pace. I've learned how to pitch sales also. Management is okay but some are more professional than others. The work place was very childish and needs more work on professionalism. Better hiring skills also.
good,"Good company to join,"
good,"It's a fun fast paced job, with a lot of your attention needed. Management is good but they try to be friends before co workers. They comply with your needs in scheduling your hours."
good,I really enjoyed working at this job My coworkers as well as store management were all really friendly and professional. unfortunately Sears corporate has just eliminated all QMA positions throughout the company.
good,"Everyone is very friendly, company pays very well."
good,It was a pleasure to work for this company. The coworkers were great and the calmness of the work environment kept the stress low
good,"The greatest satisfaction was to ensure that the customer was happy with on time delivery, the handling of their merchandise and helping load and unload merchandise."
good,"A typical day working at Sears as a cashier would consist of me assisting members with their purchases at my register, or on the floor if there is no line. Everyday we are encouraged my management to persuade our members into applying for a Sears store or Mastercard, and good member feedbacks by providing the best customer service we can provide. Working at Sears I learned the value of patience with a customer, which also improved my patience outside of the workplace. The most enjoyable part of the job was the competition between the cashiers to earn more credits (Sears card applications) every month because it helped give the job a purpose."
good,"Amazing people and management there. Very understanding when it came to family and crises times. Made me feel comfortable and actually made me want to come into my job everyday with a smile on my face, even though it was retail. It was an amazing experience for me and ill sure miss being able to work for such a great company for so many years."
good,"Typical Day: This was an appliance  sales position with set daily quotas and variable schedules. I learned how to sell appliances. how they function, offering  protection programs and giving the best customer service possible. I also helped train new sales members. I had a wonderful boss who encouraged you to be the best and becoming great team players helping each other. The hardest part of the job was keeping your quotas as some days sales were not the best. The most enjoyable part was achieving and surpassing  my goals and sales  becoming and staying  the number one sales associate for the four consecutive years."
good,"As a cashier working for sears, I would start the day by checking the cash registers and make sure they had an amount to start the day. Then I would have to clean my area. Then get ready to have a wonderful day."
good,"Sears was a great place to work at regarding the experience of knowing the business, assisted on generating sales and merchandising, sales and revenue, working with a great team of sale associates and giving great service to customers."
good,"The management and staff at the store I worked for were nice and worked well together. It was a good stepping stone, and provided a good learning experience along the way."
good,Decent place to work. There isnt much room for advancement but the managment staff is out of this work and will bend over backwards to take care of their associates.
good,"I have spent over 13 years with Sears. For the most part, I have enjoyed my time there. I feel like Sears tries to have a positive and engaging culture with good communication from upper level corporate down through store level associates. The most enjoyable part of this job has always been the relationships I built with my peers. Unfortunately, there have been many layoffs the last couple of years and many great workers are being displaced due to company struggles."
good,"As a technical specialist, my main goal was to help troubleshoot and issue over the phone and or send a technican. This involved dealing with a lot of upset members which taught me how to approach different kinds of people. Upper management was always very great, understanding and willing to help which was comforting and allowed room for growth. The work hours are rough, but there are so many different departments at sears so if you don't enjoy one you can try another!"
good,Everything was in order in the workplace. There was so much to learn from there. The management team was always there whenever you needed them. Overall it was a great experience working there.
good,"On a typical day, I would oversee 30 cashiers and ensuring that their tills are accurate at the beginning and at the end of their shifts. Also, that all cashiers duties are done in a timely and fashionable manner.  In addition,  upholding the standards set fourth by corporate."
good,All seemed great until the company's stock started to plummet.  A company wide downsizing began a couple of year after I'd started.  The people were great to work around and the store was located in a part of town that was considered the business side four decades ago.  Newer and more updated businesses erected in the more shopping mall area of town and we suffered.  They devised a plan to reduce labor cost and I was unfortunately a victim.
good,"I started working for the Sears store, in  September, at a very busy time, I worked a few weeks but  was told and new It would be getting much more crazy being Christmas was coming,"
good,"diario hay junta motivacional, trabajo en equipo, limpieza, adminitracion, oragnizacion,orden y atencion al cliente"

good,"Needing some money for the holidays and such this was a great place to turn too with great people within, that were always looking to help whether it was with my personal life or work life."
good,"sears is a stable long term employer that will allow its staff to sink or swim at there own pace. you mst be self motivated to succseed here."
good,"It doesn't matter whether you win or lose... No, really, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if you do the greatest job and help everyone get exactly what they need and are friendly and helpful. It also doesn't matter if you show up late everyday and do the bare minimum. "
good,"Managed incoming calls for company employees seeking leaves of absence; at times employees needed more assistance than what was available to them.  Some calls were of an emergency nature, referred called back to home store for assistance."
good,"sears auto was one of my best jobs and i would be there to this day if the company didnt close most of its locations. I learned alot and got along with most of my co workers, the only thing i didnt like was the relationship between HR and workers."
good,"In footwear a normal day consists of assisting customers with the right fit and searching back stockroom for available sizes.  Employees are also responsible for ringing up customers and advising them on any current sales in different departments.  While working at Sears I learned about different styles and fits of shoes and sandals.  "
good,Sears is a good job to start at. Pretty good management team the last time I was there. Can sometimes be frustrating with the schedule but for rhe most part they try to work with you.
good,"Fun enthusiastic great friendly environment love the pay some managers were a little too above their job it was fast paced great overtime, and I loved my co-workers"

good,Often shift times vary from morning to afternoon or afternoon to close regardless of position. The environment is very multicultural in all departments. The jobs available in store are what you would expect an average retail location to offer.
good,Great job to strengthen sales ability. Sears has amazing appliance sales team and management. hardest part of job is lack of traffic. Best part of job is busy day when your actually able to help people.
good,"mucho compañerismo, me gusta mucho el trabajo de caja el manejo de dinero lo malo es que es trabajar casi todo el día"
good,"aprendí la importancia de tener mi lugar de trabajo presentable para que el cliente, el trabajo con los compañeros en complicado ya que trabajas a base de comisiones"
good,"A very good place to work at. I learned some great sales, relationship  building skills and management skills. Management is very friendly, supportive and knowledgeable. The hardest part of the job for me is that some of the things needs to be stream lined and Sears needs to be more technology friendly as well as the communication with in the management needs to be more effective and improved. The most enjoyable thing for me is the recognition on the leader board email and by my direct manager when week over week and month over month my team comes at the 1st or 2nd place in sales stack ranking."
good,"A typical day at work consists of performing all the jobs of a cashier while keeping station clean. Co-workers very nice and very enjoyable. The management is good, they did schedule me on days I said perform hand that I was unable to work. Overall decent place to work."
good,"Ive worked in hardware at sears for a few years before and i absoloytley loved it. I loved the people and the environment. Everyone was happy and funny and we all worked together we were like a big family and i continue to be friends with many of them to this day. It took me months to finally get up the courage to leave because it broke my heart to leave everyone behind, however, the company cut our commission nearly in half and i just wasnt making what i use to. I was pretty much getting paid peanuts and it was quite depressing. Now i have a job that is okay pay but i dont like the people or the stressfull environment and i kind of regret leaving sears. at least i loved everyone there and going to work everyday wasnt stressful. just paying the bills was stressfull! if money is your main focus, maybe this company isnt for you, if you just need a job for a litte extra change and want to kill some time then definately consider sears you will find some friends that you are happy you met and will have a fun time"
good,"The day to day at Sears call center was very fast paced, very high stress, with ample breaks and good support from the management."
good,loved working with customers and helping them with their problems. Sometimes drove 200 plus miles a day. got along well with co workers. Hardest part was the driving and most enjoyable was dealing with problems others couldn't solve. Management was extremely time oriented. so u had to perform quickly  and efficiently.
good,"Flexible hours "
good,"Es una empresa muy bien estructurada, mas sin embargo cuesta trabajar sobresalir"
good,"A typical day on the job was always on edge seeing that my job was mainly to protect the company assets at all times.  While working there, I also learned a great amount of information in customer service from a different standpoint as in approaching shoplifters and apprehending them in a professional manner. The management along with my co-workers were always a pleasure to work for and with. They were all professional and fair across the board.  The hardest part of the job was violent apprehensions when lives were at stake.  Aside from that, the most enjoyable part of the job was giving back to the community, by pairing up with the city fire and police department giving out free missing children protection packets to all families to protect them in case of danger."
good,"Enjoyed working around other people and interacting with people all day. Throughout the day I would help people find mattresses or furniture or help them in other departments if the other associates were busy. I learned plenty in this job, such as how to do ad-setup and ad-take down, how to sell, how to properly help a customer based on their wants/needs, and placing special orders for customers into the system."
good,"I learned how to manage employees and customer, which can be difficult at times. With the experience I have gained I can handle different types of employees and customers."
good,My review is I didn't have a problem with the place it was just some people didn't want to be nice and give everybody an attitude. But the workers it was fun working with all of them.
good,Great people to work with. feel likes family. busy or not its a good experience. wish for more hours. Training was explained and practiced a lot.
good,great place to learn how to SELL a person an item. I enjoyed trying to get the customer to buy the product that we are selling
good,"Typical day includes greeting the members as they walk into our department and ensuring they leave satisfied and with all the information they need on their new appliance. The hardest part of the job was the commission and the fact that most days we would have no customers at all. This made it very hard to do my job as well as have a paycheck with straight commission. I enjoyed working with members and informing them on appliances they were interested in. Having that interaction was the highlight of my day. I was difficult at times when I had a member come in that was upset with delivery and they blamed us for that when we had no control over that, but I did everything in my power to fix the problem. I learned a lot about appliances and how they work from my year at Sears and I an grateful to carry that experience and information with me from now on."
good,"-Assisted customers with their shopping needs with emphasis on rewards program and Sears credit cards"
good,"Each day had different tasks to complete. Overall was a great job, and did not dread going into work everyday. Most of the time there was jobs to complete which made the day go by faster."
good,"Usually the shift starts at 5am in the morning, and begins with 3 people. One of them including me, the two co-workers with me are kind and cooperative, hard working as well that uses time efficiently and effectively. Hardest part of the job is making it on time to finish the delivered skids to us in a set amount of time, but the most enjoyable part of the job is when everything gets done on time. You sense the feeling of accomplishment after such a busy morning."
good,"Sears is my first real job that I started working at. I went through training and started on the floor within a few weeks of being hired. A normal day consist of checking customers out with their items, doing returns, taking payments, and helping out customers with other issues of their own. I have learned a lot on how to work the register and doing online orders. The mangers are very helpful and patient. Whenever there is an issue the mangers help to the best of their ability at Sears. The co workers are very easy to work with even when i had to train new ones who came in after me. The hardest part of the job is when there are issues with returns because some customers loose their receits which makes it harder to take back the item. What I enjoyed most at sears is when I could help put items and cloths away and helping customers in general."
good,My experience here was pleasant. I  I learned alot of new things and skills that I can utilize else where. Management was great as well.
good,"As a field service tech, you never really know what to expect. You have to love this job to do it well and I love working with machines and people, so this was a perfect fit for me.  The hours can be long, so it's really important to be flexible with your schedule, especially if you have young kids, as I do. My supervisor was great to work with, plus he had been in the field before so he was more sympathetic to our real life occurrences than other supervisors would have been.  I've worked with good supers before, but he was the best. My co-workers were always willing to help me, and I had no problem returning the favor.  Training was awesome and I felt like a pro by the time I hit the road on my own for Sears. Overall, since I love doing what I do, it's hard to find much fault.  I was not happy with the benefits, but it wasn't the worse of companies for which I've worked."
good,"A typical day was preparing for the mornings quickhit meeting, reviewing previous days results and motivating and informing the sales team of the days targets: sales, and account acquisitions.  I was on the selling floor providing customer service, monitoring associates performance and reviewing store standards: merchandising presentation, in store signing accuracy and product replenishment.  What I learned the most was about people, customers, co workers, and associates how they interact with each other and how day to day interactions can improve the customers experience and improve associate knowledge.  I was part of a strong management team that supported one in other to achieve store results.  The most difficult part of the job was at times not able to resolve customer disappointment in product failure, warranty issues, service and delivery concerns.  The most enjoyable part of the job was  long time customer loyalty and the satisfaction of helping customers and building relationships with customers and staff."
good,Great Teamwork in Management. Long Hours but very flexible hours. Average Pay but there is room for advancement in your career if you are open to relocation. Hardest part about the job is to motivating the associates who are being paid minimum wage to do variety of tasks that our competitors don't ask for with a higher pay.
good,"Journée de travail bien chargée, chacun à son poste, tâches bien définies, tout est fait pour satisfaire le client, ambiance de travail très agréable et professionnelle, travail avec un grand esprit d'équipe, le travail est parfois difficile avec la clientèle donc maîtrise de soi et débrouillardise sont nécessaires."

good,"the most enjoyable part is learning about the sales and new items. Also becoming friends with coworkers, and having fun at the same time."
good,aprendí mucho de la empresa Sears mas que nada por mis jefes que me tocaron con vivir ya que fueron mis maestros y me enseñaron mucho
good,"Some days would just be a handful of us unpacking and assembling reclining chairs, tables, and couches. The occasional wrapping of something to send downstairs for a customer to pick-up. Other days we were moving heavy fixtures and organizing them so they could be picked up by whoever purchased them after the store closed. So it was easy one day and tiring another."
good,"Sears es una empresa donde aprendi a hacer muchas cosas, buen ambiente para desarrollarte."
good,It was a fun place to work at with a very flexible schedule for a University student. The work environment was friendly and nice.

good,"I enjoyed this position and the schedule it provided, they worked with my FMLA leave for the birth of my son. I was able to work comfortably."
good,"A typical day consist of being a cashier and assisting customers when needed. I learned that it is important to stay calm when things may go array and to make sure the customer ALWAYS have a WOW experience. Management was okay, while I was working there we went through several bosses so it was kinda hard to keep up with management because it kept changing. Co-Workers were AWESOME, definitely made it easy and fun to go to work.The hardest part was multitasking when there weren't much support or coworkers present but I got through it. The part I loved most was the conversations I had with my customers because they were so opened to me and easy to talk to."
good,"In the 10 years I worked for Sears, I learned a lot about working as a team, and also I was able to advance my ability to work with people on a daily basis. My coworkers and managers all worked very hard, but the infrastructure of the company was the most difficult aspect."
good,"My opinion on a day at work was pretty easy, and fun. The work environment there was good. Employee you got to get close with and build relationships with."
good,"Nice place to work, you can move departments/positions as they open with new application. Low hours, low staffing to maintain a profit at the time. Loyal customers, make it feel like home, customers are involved with you if you let them :)"
good,Sears is okay. It's more for highschoolers than anything else. If you just want a part time job and you still live with your parents then this job is for you. But if you have bills to pay then you should probably find something else.
good,"Working here was okay. It was my first job in retail, and it was during this past holiday season, so I was there for all the excitement between Black Friday to Christmas Eve."
good,"llegar a las 10:30 para junta "
good,"I have no issue with the people or co-workers, just when better job come alone with a better future, I have to take it.Nobody force me to quit, I left it on my own well being."
good,"A great team of hard working people that unfortunately was only a seasonal position. I enjoyed praise from management, co workers and customers."
good,"I loved this job there was excellent room for advancement, the benefits and pay is great. The only problem with sears is the main corporation doesn't care about there employees.  They did what they called an employee reduction where they laid off 35,000 employees.  They gave us little to no warning because we was told 1 week prior to being laid off which gave us no opportunity to seek employment prior to being laid off."
good,Great place for a starting job and possibility to grow with the company. Training is provided and everyone was very friendly.
good,"Greet customers to give them their big item such as a dryer or fridge and load in their car. Unload huge trucks full or merchandise, then out on floor or into stock by locating them. It was fun working with certain people because they were funny and easy to talk to. When it gets busy there is a lot of running around and a lot of things in the way. Management was very organized."
good,"coming in putting up stock or seeing what planogram need to be done. checking expiration dates on product. doing some cashier work if need. pulling product to the front of shelve and cleaning shelves.. what I learned is how to do planograms. coworkers help full and trying to help you when needed. hardest part of job unloading semi trailers, most reward dealing with customers and helping them find what they are looking for."
good,"I work commission sales.  People trust the sears name and it makes my job easier.  However it's sales so as on manager told me-- ""You eat chicken one day, but feathers the next."""
good,"Learned a lot about management, customer service and sales at this company. Good work life and home life balance, good fellow employees and managers that make a great team to achieve daily company goals."
good,"Adjointe administrative"
good,"The training was thorough. My co-workers and managers were there to help and the customer was our top priority. However, This was my first experienc with telemaketing and working with computers. there were multiple systems that I had to master. You would have to deal with so many different ypes of people in various states of dissatisfaction.  conflict resolution was a constant."
good,A typical work day would include making sure that the work space was presentable. I learned how to deal with people and have improved my people skills. Management has done what they can to make sure all of the employees are doing their best. They help us improve in areas they feel are needed. The hardest part of the job is when we have many customers to tend to but happen to be short staffed.
good,"A typical day is around 8-5 and might have a meeting or 2. Work/Life balance is so incredible here. They're always allowing parents to come in late for school functions and leave early occasionally. Summer hours during the summer (work until 6 M-Th, half day on Friday)."
good,"they expect too much and their short staffed, but overall it is a great company. I just think Luxxotica could put in an effort for Sears"
good,Fast paced work environment. Management was not very attentive and did not seem to communicate with each other. Co workers were very helpful and kept the work day enjoyable

good,"The job is 100% commission and that is ok during the busy season, but very hard during the slow season. I enjoyed the managers though."
good,"I really liked working on digital projects.  No one project was ever the same. I worked with a lot of fun and creative people.  "
good,I enjoyed working with the people at Sears on the retail floor. I learned how to produce the documents that I only saw at month end when working at the District Office.
good,Busy work days and helpful co-workers and management. Same customers developed rapport and first name relationship..
good,I liked the environment and the connection with the customers and the staff. Would love to go back however the pay was just to low.
good,"adding service."
good,Sears offered a lot of challenges while also offering opportunity to move up. Some weeks were longer than others due to the nature of retail
good,"Became Electronic Certified to sell televisions, speakers, exc. Helped me realize sells as career. Acknowledgement of selling methodology. Became efficient and up-selling, and most importantly closing."
good,Enjoyed my job. Passing all my certifications was great. Seeing new-hires perform their duties at their best after teaching them the company procedures made me happy. Installing custom wheels and having customers ask me what other modifications I would suggest was awesome as I am a gearhead and enjoy modifying cars/trucks.
good,Would be helping walk in customers daily.  My manger taught me some new computer skills.  The manager I had was helpful all the time. My co-workers were ok. The hardest part of this job was when I tried to transfer back to the store manger was set to have me come back and the DMS said no.  Most enjoyable part of the job was working with the floor manger.
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company. the most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them. there were a lot of variety in what we did each day, ranging from monotonous tasks to new projects that were challenging and exciting."
good,Working at Sears was always fun and challenging. I had great co-workers and I was compensated well considering it was only part-time work. Hardest part of the job was staying busy during slow times. Most enjoyable part of the job was selling when times were very busy. Sears offered flexibility in job position and opportunities for advancement; I was able to shift between multiple departments.
good,"Typical day unloading the truck,putting merchandise away set for the floor and stock area. Retrieving customers items, controlling audits in the stockroom. which i work with so amazing co-workers. And best part of the job is everything easy learning process on hand. So easy to have a band of friends that works well with you day in day out."
good,"After 40 years of employment, Sears eliminated my position as ASM/Lands End manager after many successful years. Worked my way into a very profitable and large Lands End shop. I worked with my team to grow the Hyannis store into a top 50 store in the company."

good,the people that worked there where nice to everyone and they like to have fun and not be super serious all the time the management know what they where doing and where like by the other staff
good,"hay buen ambiente de trabajo, solo que los supervisores del area de prevencion osea monitores no se prestan con los empleados respecto a que es muy dificil que si te deben dias batallabas mucho para que te los pagaran, las vacaciones tampoco te las querian dar y no te apoyan con respecto a las necesidades del empleado"
good,"They give you lots of training before hitting the floor, AWSOME! A fun place to work, lots of work, excellent coworkers and very good managers."
good,"Excelente empresa para trabajar, mucha rotación de personal, muchos eventos fuera de horario tales como ventas nocturnas y especiales, buenos gerentes."
good,We sat at cubicals all day and answered phone calls for Sears stores across the united states. I loved this aspect because i got to interact with all different kinds of people.  The job itself could be stressful but I didn't mind.
good,"Ringing up customers purchases,helping customers make decisions maintaining floor.Co-workers worked great as a team.Mangement made our job easier."
good,I really enjoyed working here. There were very good co-workers and the bosses were excellent. I enjoyed going to work. If I would not have moved I would probably still be there.
good,"typical day is slow moving, great coworkers, extremely friendly staff. in this department you will learn basic warehouse skills as well as the AS400 program. hardest part of the job would have to be loading large items into the customers cars/trucks."
good,"A busy, high intensity work environment. Requires great communication skills and problem solving skills. Must be able to multitask and consciously assist members in need of specific appliances. The co-workers are friendly and knowledgeable. The hardest part is keeping customers satisfied with their high dollar purchases when logistic issues surface, this can get quite stressful with pressure heavy situations. The most enjoyable part of the job is when the customers express their satisfaction with the customer service provided. If you are looking for a well paying job with some challenges, this is a good option."
good,"hi, I was working  for sears for over 12 years, 2014 I was traveling to texas on new mexico state I suffer a vehicule accidente after a years late I try to get back my job with sears but nobody in care about my reapplication for home services tech but is a good place to star and learning or getting some experience about domestic appliances, the uncomfortable moment is that the tech managers will be every day messaging and calling to sale but that is the way the company will continue surviving but is a good company better then others.."
good,"Original head of marketing was innovative, supportive and fun to work with. The head of marketing during my last couple of years had no people skills, although she was brilliant. I had the opportunity to lead several high exposure product development and pilot a Hispanic consumer loan product with a venture capital company in CA that was innovative and exciting!"
good,Sears was a Monday to Friday job working 6:30 am to 2:30 pm . I loved those hours. Sears was flexible with hours if you needed time off. The people were great to work with. The Sears warehouse was then shut down and moved to Calgary . We were like a family there. Alot of us worked together for many years and it was sad to leave everyone.
good,This job was ok. Nothing to really say. Was a contract for Federal Goverment. Framed walls and done other tasks as needed.
good,A typical day at work meant being around people and making sure that everyone needs are met. The managers at this company were the best managers I have ever had. They made sure that every employee had a good day.
good,"In a day's work I handled a cash register, helped customers, and organized merchandise. It was a fast paced job, but I learned a lot."
good,fun love helping out members and helping them find the right product for what ever they are working on a little slow on truck days because we are short staffed
good,"I worked in a call center environment.I had to call past due customers and collect on their past due credit card accounts. The management was very good. The dress code was business casual. The co-workers were nice and helpful when learning about the business. The hardest part of the job was trying to get the customers on the line and get them to agree to payment arrangements. I got my start in collections at this job and I learned how credit and the credit report work. The most enjoyable part of the day is making customers  feel at ease when you are able to assist them in bringing there account up to date. The company required days, nights and weekend shifts. There were monthly bonuses if quota was met."
good,"I learned quite a bit from this job. It was my first job in retail, so I had to learn about salesmanship. I worked mostly independent, but the team is available for when I needed advice or assistance."
good,Truly enjoyed working at Sears...Management was great as were the employees...My employment with the company for one year flew by... most enjoyable part of the job being a woman was working with shoes
good,"I had a great time working for this company. It was a nice, professional environment with great staff members. Being located in one of the busiest areas of the city, it was a perfect location to access different amenities."
good,"My favorite part about Sears was the people I worked with. Everyone there is friendly, helpful and proactive. The management does everything they can to keep the store a happy, safe and inviting place. We were a team who helped each other when needed and worked together to make the store a better place.It was also really nice because it was either slow or steady. It had the occasional rush, but it was never too busy. Which in turn meant that all customers were able to be helped in a timely manner and you could finish what needed to be done sooner rather than later.The hardest part about the job was probably the training and/or getting credits. The training mostly consisted of computer work: videos, quizzes, and documents. Then, once you finished the computer portion, they give you a couple hours to job shadow and after that, you're basically on your own. All in all, this store was a great place to work."
good,Normal day. I learned how to used a cash register. Management was great I had great supervisor. I felt very comfortable working there.The part I most enjoyed was helping with the translation.
good,"On a typical day at work, it would usually be slow in the morning but I find something to do, for example, walk around and fold or straighten out the clothes. Then customers will come in and I would assist them with the help they need and cash them out in a quickly but efficiently manner."
good,i live a large distance form this job. i love being there and the people who i work with. very good atmosphere. too far for me to continue working.
good,"Even with all the challenges, Sears is still a good company to work for and grow with.  Several categories are continued bright spots within the company."
good,"Fun place to work, the job culture is good and the people for the most part is good. You can learn a lot about retail from working here but the pay is a big turn off. At the end of the day we all have bills to pay."
good,This job was good for the learning a lot in sale great teacher but management need a little work but all in all nice place to work.
good,To deliver excellent Customer Service to impact Customer Satisfaction and to reduce product returns. Assist in meeting and surpassing all sales goals.
good,"A typical day would include coming to work at 9:30 AM, collecting cash bags, counting amount in each register and recording it. We would all then gather for a morning meeting and make goals for each individual section of the store. I love my coworkers and making new friends is always a must. The hardest part of the job would be convincing people to apply for a Sears credit card, this was a basic daily goal. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with people I really enjoy and getting to meet people and talk to people from around the town."
good,The Culture of The Sears Corporation is a nurturing environment.  In which management wants to give everyone the tools and skills they need to be successful with the corporation.  From the top down everyone is always willing to teach and mentor those around them.
good,"Each workday was different in the shoe department. Once a week entered at 7am for inventory count of shoes, very easy (scan). Every Sunday entered at 6am for price changes. Other days it was hard labor like constantly opening 40lbs boxes, loading new shoes onto the sales floor, and the extra shoes go back in the stock room lifting heavy work boots 3 or 4 at a time climbing a ladder for 6hours straight. Hardest part about this job was when you wanted to add a new style of shoes on the sales floor and there is no room so then you have to shift like 8 columns just to put it in its correct location. I learned a lot about working in shoes. co-workers where awesome we had good times."
good,"It was a good work experience, I met interesting people, worked in a team organizing a product, such as kitchen and house supplies, fashion clothes. sport equipment and others."
good,"I would be in charge of the apparel, customer assistance, and cash handling. I also would assist in helping customers with finding what they needed."
good,Management is good and very considerate with their employees needs. Happy to work with my co-workers as a team.The most hardest thing to do in this job is to deal with the customer attitude. The best thing that I learned in this place is to be very patient with the people that you never thought you were going to deal with.
good,"I have enjoyed my job at Sears Home Appliances. I learned a lot from the initial training. I was able to move up in the store and gained responsibilities and management experience. I spearheaded customer issues and stayed on top of them until they got completed, only escalating issues in extreme circumstances. I enjoyed getting repeat customers in the store and having them look for me specifically. Customer retention is key to any successful business."
good,job was not good for me i did not learn anything not did i have any help most days i worked alone unloading trucks as well as assisting customers with goods to their cars
good,Great place of employment. Great customers and love selling jewelry. The management is awesome and very flexible. I enjoy helping the customers and providing great customer service.
good,"I enjoyed this position as it always offered something new and exciting everyday. I learned a great deal through hands on experience and was able to witness many new things that furthered my experience in customer service, and in handling emergency situations. "
good,"a typical day at work was an experience with the potential to perform new tasks on a daily basis, during my time on each assignment I learned how to use a RF scan gun, process orders and labels, read invoices for shipping and receiving, production procedures, basic safety procedures, my co-workers were team players and we all showed attention to detail and ensured the quality of products and correct labels as well as quantity, the hardest part of the job was not having enough products to complete some orders and the occasional delay of product shipping but the most enjoyable part of any job is ensuring that the customer orders are shipped and received on a timely basis"
good,"The one thing I always like about this job is that there is no such thing as ""down time"".  You are always moving and always have something else to do.  I like that it keeps the time moving by fast."
good,"I learned about different kinds of tools and about how to work a different type of cash register than I was used to. The management knew what they were doing and really cared about their cashiers and other workers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the difficult customers, even though they were few and far between. The best part of the job was working with people that actually cared about what happened to the customers and the employees."
good,"wasnt sad about leaving, the job was fun, but the upper management was seriously lacking and managment/leadership skills"
good,"This was a fun place to work, but not all managers here are caring and/or knowledgeable. "
good,"I was working at Sears while many changes were taking place, such as cosmetics being pulled out of the department. I was scared for my job security and returned to school."
good,"I would clock in and perform PMs on conveyors throughout the night. I gained a lot of conveyor experience, building maintenance, and repairs. The management was good. I worked with a close knit team and a partner during my night shift."
good,"Typical day at work: Tour entire store in the Coaches playbook. Hire and recruit and train existing and new associates. Open and react to 50 emails a day, recap all emails twice a week for the District 13 stores. Tour with Assistant Managers and Lead looking at thier areas of responsibility. Conferance calls, take care of Members as they shop. Create and post schedules for the Team once a week. Responsible for meeting all Profit and Loss budgets monthly. The hardest part of the job is knowing Kmart closed 200 plus stores a year. The most fun at the job is the challenge of making a profit at our store. Working with associates and working with each and every Member/Customer. Just when one challenge ends another starts that is the fun part of the job."
good,"supervisors will work around your schedule but hours very on commission sales even as a cashier. My Manage is awesome, very down to earth and understanding."
good,as long as you are willing to work and learn you have a lot. even small task make you learn. dealing customers and and all. but long term you have no growth here.
good,"Typical day would be to expect the unexpected.  With over 850 employees to support you never know what might be coming your way.  I have learned to listen to employees concerns and help them as needed."
good,"Typically you go to your designated department to help check customers out. On our down time, we go check the dressing rooms and put the clothes back onto the floor to sale. The management is really good, and they are always willing to help if we have any problems."
good,I love working at Sears. The customer were great. I work full-time as a cashier and sales floor associate. I check customer out and help them find items around the store. I change sign and mark down items on sales every week.
good,"I loved working at Sears. I would love to be able to work there again. I learned so much about everything from hardware, to electronics, to clothing. It was a very fun work environment, everyone got along with everyone. The hardest part of the job was probably the hours, unless you're full time the part time hours were very scarce. There were a couple weeks where I had 4 hours for the whole week. I enjoyed every part of my job aside from that. My supervisors were very down to Earth and likable, yet knew how to be the supervisor they needed to be when the time came."
good,"The Sears call center taught me a lot about relationship building, leadership, time management, and many others. The environment kept this as a place that I wanted to be, as the employees become a close knit community. Only con would be the lack of competitive pay for management."
good,The most enjoyable part about work is providing customer service whether its helping a customer pick out the right steel toe boot for their new construction job to assisting customers with online ordering for items that are currently out of stock.
good,"There is a lot expected from each associates.  Although there are many ways to gain extra income via commission or bonus, management complains about numbers and metrics every single time you come to work.  The company is more focused on emails and phone numbers than sales and profit."
good,I really enjoyed working at Sears Canada. I met great people and worked with great people as well. They gave me the freedom to express my skills as a merchandising with confidence.
good,"Investigate internal theft of merchandise and monies, credit card fraud, and inventory shortages."
good,Working as a Home Electronics Sales person while in college was a great experience for me! I meet a lot of great people and got to work with electronics all day!

good,"This job has been good to me, and I love most everyone I work with. The supervisors are cooperative, fair and very accommodating as far as the schedule goes and when I have needed time off for personal issues and ensure that  we work efficiently at the front. Coworkers are helpful and always there for me when I need it. HR is too very good and helpful. I have been able to improve my customer service skills, my communication skills, and my teamwork skills as this was my first job in Canada. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I get to help people all day and talk with them about their needs and experience in the store."

good,At work on a typically day its a lot of duties to be performed before the store opens to have it running well. I learned new technology and first time of being of the registers helping to ring up customers. The management was unbearable because a new manager has just transferred there and had no idea what she was doing for awhile. The hardest part of the job was never having anyone around to cover your break or everyone would leave the salesfloor just to eat together. And also travling from a different city to another in a short time span coming from school. The most enjoyable part was getting paid.
good,"i loved my boss, i worked for the home services department which was a great experience. The job didn't quit suit me, but the company is awesome to work for they really do take great care of their associates."

good,"pues un dia tipico en el trabajo es recoger el fondo de la caja, ingresarlo, hacer la limpieza, mercadear la mercancía, realizar pendientes de transferencias, devoluciones, guía de rebajas, y pues estar al pendiente de los clientes, atenderlos, realizar el protocolo de la empresa, luego pues son las horas de comida, regresas y pues lo mismo en la tarde, antes de que la tienda cierre, se hace el cerrar para abrir, que es volver a hacer limpieza, mercadear la mercancía nuevamente para que en la mañana que la tienda abre el cliente encuentre una tienda limpia y agradable, lo que he aprendido es que hay una diversidad de caracteres, que las personas son mucho muy diferentes y tratarlos a cada uno conforme la actitud que llegan es importante siempre tratando de que el cliente se retire satisfecho, la gerencia pues exige como en todo lados, hemos pasado por diversos lideres algunos atentos, otros educados, otros vulnerables, pero al final de cuentas uno va a trabajar y pues mientras uno haga lo que le toca no debemos de tener problemas, la parte mas dificil del trabajo es obviamente el trato con los clientes, pues como ya lo mencione todos tienen diferentes caracteres y educacion y pues hay que tratarlos a todos con respeto controlando el enojo o la incomodidad que se pueda llegar a sentir cuando un cliente por ejemplo llega de malas y nos pide las cosas de mala manera, se le debe de dar un trato igual de amable que a todos, me gusta todo de mi trabajo"
good,"Loss Prevention auditors audit random outbound merchandise going to Kmart stores. Most of the job is scanning and data entry. An audit could consist of scanning almost 1000 pieces of merchandise so accuracy is important. I have consistently been able to audit many outbound loads with 100% accuracy. My manager consistently recognizes me for my work as well as professionalism. I enjoy working with the associates in this DC. Most of them have been here just as long as I have if not longer so we have built strong working relationships. I like the fact that they respect me as a Loss Prevention professional. Even though the building is closing, the friendships I have built here and the lessons learned I will keep with me forever."
good,"It helped me to be better at customer service and enhance my skills with people."
good,Working for this company helped me gain knowledge that I know I will use at my next career opportunity. The management team starts to feel like family due to always helping in any shape and form. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to interact with all of the employees.
good,Sears was a interesting learning curve for myself. It was my first retail experience and I really enjoyed working there; co-workers were great but management lacked heavily in clarity of instructions and leadership skills.
good,Older employees take advantage of new employees. As a new employee I was left alone at cash during a busy time while my co workers went for lunch. Very stressful
good,Great place to work. Great employees some even know still friends with. Really wish the company had never been sold or that i had taken chance to follow as i was offered.
good,"Dispense medications, provide nursing care daily skilled nursing reports, monthly summaries, health status notes, PEG tube feedings, skin assessments.  Most rewarding providing care to resident being able to listen to their concerns and needs and in some cases just being there to listen to them means a lot to me.

good,Great people and atmosphere.  Wonderful dedicated customers that give repeat business.  I was hired directly on by the store manager whom I had previously worked with at The Home Depot.  I was happy to be under his lead again.  I have fantastic co-workers who helped job start my career with the company by sharing their information and helping better understand the parameters of my position.  The most difficult part of my job was watching the company lose so many great people after years of dedicated work to the company.  I would love to stay but advancement is really not an option in this company.
good,"Excellent company to work for."

good,I worked mostly Ladies Wear and Lingerie.I loved working with my co-workers.
good,Great company to begin your career.  Lots of opportunity to move across business units.
good,"The management, environment, training and all were really quite fine.  The hardest thing is that every two months or so there were hugh layoffs.  Which one expects in a call center but nothing compared to this.  The first department I worked for went from 120 people to about 30 in two years.  The next department I worked for went from about 50 to 18 in one year."
good,I loved working for the company but there was little to no advancement. There was unlimited overtime which is what kept me there for the period of time I was there.
good,"Being an appliance salesperson at sears creates great opportunities make all of the money you possibly can.  It is not a high pressure environment, but you will be held accountable if you do not produce.  It is an extremely laid back environment."

Poor Team Lead Management, loved my co-workers! The most difficult part of my job when parts where no longer available and also when parts where backordered, but that when the fun happens. I enjoyed pleasing customer so they can have a great experience and being able to get a thank you from irrate customers."
good,"Starting from 5:00 am to 1:00 pm on Sunday and 7:00 am to 1:00 pm on weekdays.  Early starting is required to assure that all of the Sunday ads are appropriately placed, according to the sale merchandise.  "

good,Everyday at Randalls was very interesting. I learned about customer service at a very fast rate considering this was my first job. Management was diligent and very focused on store goals. They help me become a very good and dependable worker. The hardest part of the job was that I was new to the city being that I'm from New Orleans. I got adjusted quick an became a person the store relied on very much. The most enjoyable part of this job was the overtime and tips I received.

Along with that, i had to keep my protection agreement percentage up, and my sears loyalty cards percentage up. I needed to sell a certain percentage of attachments with my big purchases as well.

good,The best part about working at Sears was the constant change that was occurring.  Whether it be the technology or the management there was always something new and exciting.  The company worked hard to keep its employees engaged in bringing about a new culture where creative thinking and new ideas were encouraged.
good,"My brief time at sears was very enjoyable. I was forced to leave my position due to personal reasons. I liked the people I worked with and for. The scheduling was a little iffy, but that happens in most part-time jobs."
good,"Co Workers were fun and easy to get along with."

good,"My typical day at work would consist of me turning all the lights on in the building, putting the money in the cash register, Sweeping, mopping, helping customers find the items they wanted (Giving them the correct information that they needed), Then I would make sure all the aisles were clean and organized. I learned very valuable communication skills while working at Sears also I learned how to fix lawnmowers, electric chainsaws, and other mechanical objects. The hardest part of the day would have to be when the trucks came and I had to unload everything by myself. The most enjoyable was spending time helping the customers. Although the only other co-worker there (besides the boss) was extremely lazy and the times he did do anything he would just start Ten projects and forget about them making me have to fix everything."
good,"As long as you're able to handle upset customer on the phone, you will be fine. Unlimited overtime hours with great pay."
good,Sears is a very friendly environment workplace. Everyone knows everyone and people will work togather as a team to get things down.

good,everybody was helpful and wanted to do the best they could everyday.
good,A typical day at sears would be ringing up clothes and trying to get customers to sign up for sear's credit cards. I learned how to handle large amounts of money. My co-workers were great and always helped me along the watt. They were a great team. The hardest part about my job was trying to convoke customers to see if they can get approved for a sears card. The most enjoyable part of the job was being #1 in credit since I started working there.
good,"I came to Sears Parts & Service Laguna Hills after staying home and raising my three children for 21 years.  Although I stayed busy in many volunteer positions supporting my children's activities I was challenged in a way that I had never experienced before.  I was hired for my organizational/administrative skills as well as computer knowledge.  What I was not prepared for was the sales position.  While I have worked in sales before never had I experienced repair parts for major home appliances and lawn and garden machines nor was I prepared to consult on these products.  I was also not prepared for the task of learning how to run the store administratively.  There were no handbooks.  It was learn as you go and seek advice from those that had gone before me.  "
good,Nice management. Was a really boring place to work though. Had to sit in an office all day without breaks.
good,"Sears is very team oriented. Our managers make sure to hold a morning meeting every day to go over the pros and cons of the last days sales. It really keeps the employees feeling included and lets them know what they need to work on so that they can do their job to the best of their ability. Managers are so understanding of their employees that they have a rule that allows you to be up to 6 minutes late to work without it counting against you, so long as you don't abuse the rule. The best part of my job is probably whenever I get a large sale. The commission that you can get on certain TVs can be such a randomly large amount that it could double your paycheck for a week."
good,working here was sometimes stressful but overall it was a very enjoyable experience
good,"Sears is good place to work that gives you work life balance but if you are looking for a place that is highly organized and follows all practices and standards, ,then you have landed in a wrong place."
good,"A typical day was unpredictable and interesting. Sears is a world renounced establishment and well known for their hard to beat offers on certain products. So this makes theft and other related crimes well sought after and occurred very often. Overall I learned a great deal of things such as; how to work a kiosk, how to engage customers that may have an issue with something, and how to sell customers on products using basic/advanced information about the company. "
good,"Training in every position in store so that you could fully help customers, along with everyday jobs that needed to be done."
good,"A typical day at work includes opening up the register and counting the money, then checking out customers in line for their purchases. The coworkers I worked with were all relatively young in their 20's and 30's. The managers are fair but do stress the obligations of getting people to apply for credit cards. The hardest part is dealing with rude customers."
good,"Mal Horario"
good,"Sears is a great place to work in, but you must stay on your toes and make sure your actions are good ones. They have their eyes on you at all times--I guess you can say they want to maintain their good name..."

I love multi tasking and keeping organized, Working at Sears kept me busy, focused and helped me expand customer service skills."
good,My time associated with loss prevention and auditing of product leaving the warehouse led me to feel that Sears has a great process in maximizing efficiency and profitability. Co workers are generally pretty hard working but also fun to work with.
good,"En general estoy muy conforme con haber laborado en la empresa ya que fueron muy accesibles en cuanto a las necesidades personales que se me presentaban, así el valor que le dan al esfuerzo diario de trabajo y reconocimiento, ademas de tener oportunidad de subir de puesto."
good,"I had great days as I like to talk to customer and resolve issues . I do that every day in my home life .  the hardest part of the job with getting customers to calm down and explain the issue,  so I can assist them in resolving the problems"

good,Sears Is an ever growing organization that is testing various initiatives to drive sales and improve staff loyalty.
good,Sears was a good company tow work with in regards to co-workers and management. Compensation and benefits were not up to pair. For most position Sears ranks the lowest in compensation. This was a turnoff.
good,"Given the financial hardships the company is facing, the job of the Project / Product Manager is crucial as he/she is responsible to meet the goal within strict financial controls."
good,Coworkers were genuinely nice and were motivated to do a good job.
good,Took out trash and opened dock doors to start receiving merchandise and jewelry with scanner. checked for damaged merchandise up front and brought back to wrap up and send to Genco. Kept place in order. Worked with good co-workers. Hardest part of job was keeping up with all the work and trying to keep deadlines
good,"A typical day is coming in at 9:45am and grabbing an ipad and a money bag for the register. It consists of answering phone calls with issues, selling matrresses and vacuums and dealing with a wide array of issues and all sorts of people from friendly to unhappy and rude. The hardest part of my job is that sometimes it is rather slow and I am ususally ahead on projects so It does get boring, I like to keep productive and busy while at work. The most enjoyable part of my job is when it is really busy."
good,"This is a very good job to have to start a career in warehousing or shipping and receiving.  There is a lot of physical labor but you're never expected to do anything outside normal capabilities without a partner (though I often do so myself, as I'm the strongest guy at the workplace).  Management is professional and while there are strict rules and regulations, still provide an easy-going environment that can even be downright fun at times.  The most enjoyable part of the job, for me anyways, is the workout I can get out of the various lifting, moving and unboxing tasks."
good,"It was an interesting work experience working with multi racial environment for the first time. Some days are better than others. Fridays was my happy days since I get to get off on weekends. Learned from the mistakes I made occasionally handling the cash register. The hardest thing is to hear a co-worker got fired! "
good,"•	Provide technical support to customer service representatives and technicians."
good,"My manager was continuously teaching me new things on the Ipad, SNC and register.I felt like a team member."
good,Mangers are very helpful and friendly which crates a good and decent environment to work. Although i only work on weekends as i am a student still i always look forward to go to work and meet my co workers and customers
good,"Typical work day kept you on your feet and busy. Wasn't much time to goof off, or sit around (unless that's all you wanted to do). Management was much of a delegation, instead they showed you how to do things and at least helped out when they could. Managers never made you feel like a slave or a number. I definitely learned a lot of my people/customer interaction skills with this job. Learned how to build a relationship with returning customers (regulars) and how to make non-returning customers, regulars as well. Every Thursday, the store got its usual ""truck"" of new merchandise. From 6AM to about 12PM or 1PM, I'd be in the truck unloading merchandise and stocking the sales floor. This was definitely the highlight of working for Sears. I was able to put in some physical work, while still doing my daily tasks. Never was a dull moment at Sears."
good,Loved the job but Sears closed so the job ended.  When I started I had a 3 year contract with them but due to the economy they closed.
good,while i was employed with the sears call center it was a great experience. Great co workers and kind team leaders. The hours where good and pay was alright.
good,As I worked I would greet everyone as I walked in and reviewed the inventory list and see what was on stock or on sale. Then I would go to the nearest loud speaker and announce to the customers over the loud speaker the different items they should buy and at times I would assist other co- workers with customers or I was given my own section. I learned how to develop communication skills and how to deliver results on time.
good,"Working in lost prevention gave me a good view of the working environment at Sears in Greenville, NC. The workers are kind and hard working however the pull for business is slow do to the location of the store. The management team is fairly decent and the pay is not bad as long as you do not work in sales."

good,Loved the job and the boss made his schedule around me. my co workers were excellent and the environment was productive.
good,Work was taking catalog orders from customers all over Canada. Learned alot about Canada from the customers. The managers were great and the co-workers were fun to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job was speaking to the customers from Newfoundland. The hardest part was the customers that were so irrate that they would only speak with managers.

good,Meeting new customers and satisfying their shopping experience with me as the cashier.
good,This job was a great learning experience dealing with customer service and working with a team.
good,Management is great but it varies on the person you are dealing with. Sometimes security takes extreme measures when it is unnecessary but it is respected. The employees get along and there is a long lunch break which is great. The customer service provided is pleasant.
good,"Good company to work for. They are flexible, friendly environment, and the pay is good as well."
good,"No Frills environment is a family environment. Everyone who works there are considered family. The management is very good. A lot of hours given. They train their employees well. Pay is minimum wage, good starter job."

good,"Good place to work with cars and not be hassled. Know your job, learn more positions and do your work accurately and timely. Work hard and play hard. Dirty equals experience"

good,"My coworkers at this job, are going to be the best ones I would probably ever have. I have created such a relationship with them that it is hard to leave the job. But the reason why I want to leave the job is so I do not have to worry about making certain sales just to make my paycheck. I want to just come into work for 8 hours a day and know that I am going to make money that day. The best part about the job is that you can make a $1,000 in a day. But those days only happen not even once a year. There are weeks that you are bringing home less than $200."
good,"A typical day at Sears, consists of organizing clothing, and customer service. However, the hardest part of the job is credit applications, asking customers to apply for credit then overcoming objections."

good,Good experience.  Great people to work with.  My manager was very good!

good,"Good company, good management. Opportunity for advancement."
good,Check customers out on register and assist on floor if needed.
good,Sears is over all a great company to work for. A typical day would be just focused on replenishing our sales floor and maintaining its cleanliness. The most enjoyable part of my job is setting up the different monthly displays its pretty fun to know that you did it. The hardest part of my job is trying to get things done when our equipment decides it doesn't want to work that day. Management and co-workers are great we all communicate work together to make our store better.
good,"Loved working at Sears, I learned and gained a lot. I enjoyed my position and enjoyed working, helping and meeting new  people everyday. I loved working with the management team.

Friendly staff and customers and I always tried to find a way to make a difference in a customer's experience that would set me apart from other employees they've encountered at competitor stores. It was difficult at times especially when having to meet a sales quota or deadline but I love to work under pressure. It keeps things interesting.
good,I learned how to size people for bras. The backrooms are very unorganized. Very hard to find stuff in the back. The hardest part of the job was looking for products for customers that i couldn't find because of the mess in the back room.
good,"Sears was a good job it was my first every it had nice atmosphere, I just go around helping customers out with the product or whatever they need. Hardest part about that job is when its slow. The good part about sears is it had good people there to  make it easy to work there"

I guess it would be nice to have some weekend off once in a while since i am a mother of 4. i love working and like my workload done on a daily basis.The hardest part about this job is not being able to take vacation, whenever you plan to with the family as the events are every month and we are not allowed to take off. I have learned to multi-task and not to get overwhelmed with one event after the other. The most enjoyable part of the job is serving people and attending seminars."
good,"Battery, oil, tires, maintenance, mechanic, I learned that a team gets a lot more done than an individual and the management was a big part to play in that. The co- workers were always great to work around and the hardest part was some of the tires on certain rims that were difficult to get off. The job itself was enjoyable to be a part of."
good,I enjoy every minute at work. I have formed so many connections with my co-workers. We have a great team that works hard and together to achieve our daily goals. I have learned all forms of management here. I learned how to speak and motivate others. There are different aspects of the job that can be tough at times. I try to keep the noise out and keep the team focused at all times mainly it is location. I love the visual merchandising. Putting things together is such a passion that I hold.
good,"Left because of advancement in new job, I had no advancement possibilities at the time"
good,"Non-stop go from the moment I walked in.  Quite often asked to assist in other areas, always enjoyed helping.  And, each day was a little different based on the needs or requirements of the Company, the store Management or the Associates.  Meeting the ever changing requirements of the company could be a challenge at times. The people I worked with every day made walking in the door something to look forward to."
good,I enjoyed every day working in this company.  My experience was good.
good,"If you can handle a varied schedule, commission only, travel, working nights and weekends, this is a great opportunity for big money."
good,Great people to work with..Enjoy is immensely..Pay is a detractor..
good,fast paced good place to build sale skills and learn new things.
good,"Replace, balance, rotate, oil changes, and replace batteries."
good,"Helped a lot of people with basic automotive issues.  Retail is a low wage job unless you are in upper management, but it is a pretty easy job.  Co-workers range from great to horrible like any job with few qualifications.  I liked working here but I can't support a family on a retail wage.  Helping so many people is rewarding.  If there was a negative it would be the wage or rotating schedule, but given the meager demands on employees I would have to say it was fair."
good,"A typical day would be making sure customers were taking care of delivering a WOW member experience, also associates keeping them busy. Running metrics and numbers to be able to deliver that WOW member experience and have more customers return"
good,I wasn't able to find competent child care at this time and was forced to quit. The job is super easy and sometimes fun

good,Always something new and interesting going on every now and then. You meet lots of new and different people.
good,Very busy certain times of the year....no appointments necessary at that time so customers sometimes had a long wait for their turn.  Fun photographing babies and small children. Limited creativity as camera is mounted.
good,My days were good. Had a good boss & some coworkers were okay. I was the only girl that worked there so it could get tense. There was no hard part about the job i liked it just wasnt enough pay. I was having problems at home at the time so i had to leave my job.
good,"We start with a brief discussion with my manager about the work I was expected to do for the day. Sometimes this would consist of the manager telling me what register I was working at and nothing more. Other times I would learn about another department that I was going to help for part of the day, or a project at the front that I was going to be in charge of. The days that I spent in other departments were usually right after large shipments, where my manager would need help getting as much merchandise to the sales floor as possible. The projects at the front were typically displays that I would be organizing or new promotional items that I would be putting up in place of old ones."
good,"I had a few ups and downs within this company but overall I enjoyed working there. Sometimes it was confusing, trying to figure out exactly what they wanted from us. Some days it was all about the customers, but often times it was all about the numbers."
good,"Sears was on of my first jobs were I worked in the Men's department. It helped to ease my transition into the job field with experiences in cash handling and customer service. A typical day entailed tidying my department, cleaning and organizing the tables/clothing and also the dressing room. I learned a lot regarding how to dress from this job which helped to better assist customers with their fitting and giving some recommendations of not just pricing but styles as well."
good,"Cashier/sales"

good,Restock shelves. Maintain clean stock area .Keep accurate inventory. Help floor director move and set up seasonal displays.
good,"work rotated shifts."

good,Sears creates a professional environment with a great family feel.
good,"A typical day at work is busy from the moment you walk in the door.  Keeping busy is definitely a good thing. I have learned working in retail you must wear many hats, be a team player and wear comfortable shoes :)   ... The Managers are very hands on. Always there when you need them.  My co-workers are definitely a team. When there is a project to be done, or if someone is overloaded with work, there is always someone to give a helping hand.  The hardest part of the job are the hours. The hours that you work fluctuate so much. Its hard to depend on. Also working holidays, nights and weekends really takes away from family time. The part I enjoyed most about working at my job are the customers. I have met so many nice people, I love helping them. I find my work very rewarding and love the camaraderie I share with my co-workers and managers."
good,"It was a wonderful experience for me to be able to manage about 15 employees in my department. A typical work day entails: making schedule for employees, verifying inventory quantity, assigning employees and making sure that my department is running effectively. As a supervisor, I learned how to effectively handle misunderstanding between employees and amicably resolve them."
good,"I very much enjoyed working at Sears but left for a better paying job."
good,Typical day is spent coaching and motivating associates to provide world class customer service and driving company programs that drive profitable sales
good,"Pretty much what you would expect from a department store. Nothing bad to say. Easy work, made transactions for customers, learned how to maintain a till, as a cashier you really are not around your co workers, The hardest part of the job is when it is dead and there is nothing to do. The best part is when it is busy and the line is long cause it keeps you busy and you get to interact with people."
good,"As a full time position the hardest part of my job was dialing with different management levels and find the point they had in common, also the more rewarding  "
good,"I liked my managers at sears a lot, the hours were flexible and I learned a lot of new skills."
good,"I would get to work, punch in go get my ipod to make sales with and get to work, I learned a lot about tools and tracktors and the difference between the many different kinds, the coworkers were somewhat nice most of the time, but get jealous if you work harder or do better then them. the most enjoyable part to me was making big sales and the worst part was when the days were slow and there were barely any customers "
good,"The only department I would suggest, is Loss Prevention. Everywhere else was chaotic. This may only be because, I was fortunate to work for a great boss."
good,I'm happy this was my first retail job. I had fun working with the public and making kids laugh while they waited for their parents to make choices while folding clothing on display tables and helping new parents make selections for cribs or car seats or giving an opinion when asked by a customer.  Still I shop their as an adult 15 plus years later.
good,"There is no typical day at Sears. Especially in the receiving area. You meet the most interesting customers. As a customer comes to pick up there tools, or appliances. You can easily start up a conversation about what projects they are working on. Or up grades they are doing to there homes. "

good,"mi dia empezaba a las 10am mi dedicacion atender a los clientes amablemente y terminaba a las 8pm"
good,"Great job for challenging ones ability to react quickly to various situations. Learning potential was vast with almost an endless supply of helpful tools and information for all employees. Management team was improving store metrics, but had no decision on store closing. Co-workers were generally complaining about wages and scheduling. The majority of them still did what was asked of them. The hardest aspect of the job was keeping all employees and management to adhere to all company policies and procedures as they were written. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing the impact had on the community through great customer service and knowing the importance of safety."
good,"A typical day at work is answering phones, checking emails, and helping customers. I have learned that helping people isn't as bad as i thought it would be and a lot of people like Sears. The management is very good and knows how to do his job. The hardest part of my job is when customers are very rude. The most enjoyable part of my job is when someone tells me that i made their day and im a very good sales associate. "
good,"Did designer work, stocked and was manager on duty throughout the day."
good,This place doesn't always get busy so there is a lot of down time.
good,Sears was one of the more favorable jobs I have had. I enjoyed the work and the people I worked with.
good,"I worked here during my high school years, and it was a great place for a high school student.  The people I worked with were lovely, and the management was very good about working around my school/exam schedules.  Working here helped me learn better communication skills and made it easier for me to help customers with whatever they need.  The hardest part of the job was that it was slow frequently, and the most enjoyable part was the people you work with."
good,drove to work for a part time shift. no co workers to work with. 
good,"Worked retail, cashier duties. Some of the things I would do, would be talking to customers about new products being branded, or ringing up the customers.

good,"my day starts out with paper work,then i'm helping customer find a solution for their problems.Weather it be getting them parts for their lawn equipment or mixing paint. Management is great if i have any issues they're quick to help resolve them. the people i work with are great to work with. and make the fun no matter how the day goes."
good,my manager was never around then when she was would sit about and yell about everything even revoked bathroom privileges at one point angered everyone off on a daily basis also other then that management is really good and the people are fun to work around
good,"A day at work would consist of a meeting with everyone in the morning, next open my registers, then clean and help customers, and keep area clean. I also offer a program and credit to customers in three min or less per customer. I talk to about 100 plus customers a day. What I've learned is to be patient with each customer answer questions to the best of my knowledge and if I can't answer it or the customer starts getting upset I just call a manager and let them assest the situation."

good,"Sears was a great job with good health benefits, an active environment, great for learning groupwork and creative thinking skills. The management there were very understanding and employees were able to obtain skills for advancement. The hardest part of the job would have to be the heavy equipment that was required to execute the task at hand. The most enjoyable would have had to been the co-workers I had an exceptional relationship with most of the employees there."
good,Early Mornings and long day traveling from place to place.
good,"Everyday starts off the same going in at 10am to open the studio get the money counted and make sure everything is up and running, then if there was down time between appointments and walk-ins we will call our customers that either have children with birthdays coming up or who haven't been to the studio in quite some time, then from there it would be either taking pictures of the next appointment and selling to them or call the appoints for the next day and session planning them. There have been times where I was left incharge of the studio when the manager was either out because of health or on vacation. I also helped trane the new employees as well. The only thing thats hard about the job other then making sure the children smile for the pictures is hoping that we make enough to get hours to keep the job."

The hardest part of the job was unloading the appliance deliveries, but with the team that we had, even that wasn't too big of an issue."
good,"There was always something to do in our department. There was never "" nothing to do"" and I liked the constant need to keep actively on top of things while still being aware of potential customers and satisfying their needs.

Also, we had rotating department managers. They brought with them new ideas to be incorporated into the everyday workings of the department."

good,"HVAC/R service and installation,I have managed 30 employes and enjoy working with the general public."
good,The job keep me busy which I liked.
good,"Start by unloading and loading trucks as well as scan the products and placing them in logistical order. Put the products out on the sales floor and have them shelved. Clean up the cardboard and pick up customer orders. When customers come to pick up their orders, paperwork is signed and then placed into their vehicles. Sales associates occasionally call whether or not certain products are in stock or if they need help with department arrangement. UPS and cosmetic trucks come almost everyday and the products are to be scanned and recorded then put out on stock. Everyday after the unloading is finished we sort the overstock and large stock products in alphabetical order. Loss prevention checks the stocks from time to time to see if the inventory is recorded accurately and nothing is stolen. The management wasn't very good at keeping up with their standards. Too much product was always shipped to the receiving docks and there was always too much overstock and we always had to have workers overstocking the shelves. The management lost a lot of money because they were not focusing on these certain issues. The co-workers in my department were all hard workers, we would get the job done but also help out the sales associates because out store was very understaffed. The hardest part of the job was always having to manage the tasks you were assigned and also having to help customer orders or complaints. There have been many times I had to work by myself in the department and having to multitask was very difficult because there were too many things going on. I had to push myself all"
good,"a typical day at work ive learned that the costumers are always right, my co-workers have your back when help is needed as well the managment. I would say the hardest part of work was keeping up the efficiency making sure the line as a cashier was always moving fast considering sears is a busy company and there is always lots of costumers. The most enjoyable part of the job was giving my costumers that satifaction when helping them shop for what they need/ want."
good,Days were long for managers but that can be expected. I didnt feel that there was much work/life balance.
good,Sears was a great company to work for. I worked for them on two different occassions but the seem to restructor themselves every three years so it has hurt their core business.
good,"During a typical day at work, I am opening Sears financial credit card accounts for customers and helping them complete their Sears credit card monthly payments. I answer the customers' questions and help find the items they are searching for while treating them with kindness and respect before completing the clients' sale/return transactions at the cash counter. I make sure the clients have their mechandise at the best/accurate price. I also replace any merchandise by the cash counter in their rightful places and sometimes stock the items directly after receiving a shipment. I answer phone calls from fellow employees at many Sears companies and customers at home. I count the money in cash register when opening and closing the store. I keep the area in and around the cash counter clean and keep necessary work supplies on hand daily. I also deposit the money bags in the safe at the end of the night."
good,"everything was great! The job, the co-workers, the management, nothing was hard."
good,As an MCA i was in charge of assisting customers by finding items and cashing them out at the time of purchase. I was also in charge of cleaning the fitting rooms. I was responsible for putting out new merchandise as it came out and keeping the rest of the merchandise neatly organized.
good,the pay it is not too good but the discounts make up for that. the job itself was fairly easy yet boring.
good,One of my favorite places to have worked simply because it was a second home and everyone pretty much became like family. Also management and supervisors did their best to take care each employees needs without losing the integrity of work ethic needed and expected.
good,"One of the better companies I have worked for. Once you work there for a while and management gets to know you, you start getting good hours."
good,"Get leads early in the morning between 730-800 then off to 3 appointments during the day,Drive can consist of 4 hours away."
good,A typical day at work required meeting your quotas and providing great customer service.
good,Worked as a cashier/sales associate. Helped customers with payments and purchases.
good,"Sears empowers its managers to own ""their"" business. Simplistic and realisted approach to Operations and Management. Very enjoyable organization to work for."
good,Just handled incoming calls to assist customers with purchases on Sears.com and out of sears catalogs.
good,"Given Sears stability at this current time it is in my best interest to start pursuing a new career. Sears is and has been an excellent place to work,"
good,"It is enjoyable to work in a company that provides you with a breadth of opportunities to develop your career. You can move from a business unit to a support unit, manage individual contributors and managers and also be provided with challenging individual contributor assignments."
good,Days at work was great. I learned how too handle money and developed good customer service skills. Management was fine. Co-workers was fun too work with. Best part of the entire day was meeting new people.
good,I enjoyed working there. Everyone was wonderful and I loved learning new things. It was difficult to meet the expectations for the job because they set such high ones that not even the managers can meet.
good,A typical work day at Sears is usually busy. The managers work hard to make sure that you perform at you best. When the call volume is slow they tend to send reps home for the day.That was the only thing I really didn't like about the company.
good,checking e-mails
good,I enjoy the experience it was not a heavy hard job cause when you like what you do then you don't feel stress out waking up to go to work.
good,"My typical work day at Sears was always pretty busy. I would always be doing something or learning about something new. For example, I was hied on as a cashier but I was doing everything from setting up new displays to selling lawn tractors. It was alot of work but I enjoyed it and met a few great people."
good,"Challenging goal oriented organization, if you are up to the challenge you have the capability of advancement. Continuous changes in the company and learning new systems is a part of the structure. Associates involvement is encouraged and rewarded."
good,Working at Sears was a good experience where it bettered my knowledge of teamwork and customer care. I feel thankful for having worked there
good,"Clean place to work. Management are always friendly & works get with your schedule. If you dont' mind standing on feet mostly, preparing food, interacting with guest and cleaning this is a job place to work at."
good,The job was pretty easy the management was terrible. The co-workers were pretty easy to work with.
good,"Punch in, login, start recieving phone calls, fifteen minute break, finish. Basics of Salesmanship, management was keen and incisive, coworker were great, sweating in seats was hard. I enjoyed my coworkers."
good,"A typical day at Sears is like any other job, you go to work, you help customers and then your day is over. I feel that the job is fun, but not challenging. Many days go by without seeing a customer and we usually end up sitting around and talking to people. Also, there is no room for advancement."
good,I very much enjoyed my co-workers and my manager was amazing. Stable place to work.
good,Sears was very nice company to work for as far as business side of it very organized! I learned a lot from management!
good,"typical day at work was to serve clients as best as possible. I leaned a lot about mattress and sales, co-workers were good. the most enjoyable part of the job was to meet new people and being able to help them"
good,A work day at Sears started off with Daily stand-up where we being agile development team signed up for our tasks and solved blockers for peer team-members if any.
good,The joy of solving customer problems and the use of many skill sets were the main reason I enjoyed work for Sears as a In Home Appliance Service Technician.
good,"A typical would consist of cleaning the department, opening the registers and assisting all customers needs. It was a pretty laid back environment when the store was doing well but when numbers dropped the managers were pretty cut throat."
good,"My day included reading & preparing reports. I would visit at least 2 studios daily where the studio manager & I would do a studio visit which included crititing photoraphy, sales & customer service scores. We would then set a plan of action & date when results were excepted. I would also spend time with the customers listen to them about concerns & compliments"
good,"there is really no typical day at work. I ring up sales and put merchandise on the floor. The circumstances aound these tasks are always different due the customer interaction. What I have learnes i that despite the economy, people still like and want to shop. The management is supportive and approachable. But they are so overwhelmed with trying to run a store these days without the resources available to the in the past, they really do not have the time to train as extensively as they did once before. My co-workers are the most enjoyable part of the job. They are there when you need them most during a tough day at the store. The hardest part of the job is the low pay and the lack of hours."
good,"I would recommend this job to anyone that is new to the workforce and would like a job in sales. Sears is a place of commitment to selling protection agreements and giving the customer the ""total solution"" which means sell the product in anyway possible."
good,"you have a chance to explore, experience and learn on diverse areas of the retail marketing."
good,Overall good company to work for but the core values of the company seemed to be changing alot.
good,"It's been 10 years since I worked for Sears and the Office Center. At that time, it was a new dawn to computers and cell phones. Initially, it was fun working at the Office Center because it was a business within a business. We were an entity within Sears governed by our own rules. It became less fun to work when we were under the arm of the Sears Organization and management. They initially had no understanding of computers. They knew lawnmowers and washer machines. It was insulting when they put undereducated managers in charge of a sophisticated division such as computers and told us to show them everything we knew. As a result, Sears and their management destroyed the computer concept and eventually ruined the whole business within."
good,"As Office Assistant, then Human Resources Manager, I received rewarding careers at Sears."
good,"overall, good company to work for, with opportunity for advancement"
good,"Very good benefits for full time employees, High turnover rate, most employees seek employment elsewhere quite often"
good,Nice atmosphere and nice work environment. I appreciated the opportunity to work in a fast paced company where customer satisfaction was a priority. Nice wages also.
good,"Sears Appliance sales is still alive and well, and offer good tools for the salesperson willing to help customers find the right appliance. With good interpersonal skills, success can be had here. Of course, as a commission based job, the pay can vary between months, so be prepared."
good,je livrais  les article catalogue sears verification des cplie pour livre a bonne etas  et  cetais relaxent de travailler pour sears  on etais bien
good,There was a great work life balance and great opportunity for advancement but financial future of the company is in question as the weather it will continue.
good,"Honestly working at Sears was an amazing experience. Everyone gets along, like a second family. Yes even though the sears I worked at closer down, I stay in contact with my old coworkers."
good,"Working is sometimes hard yet there is a since of accomplishment at the end of the day"
good,I drove to Wyoming sometimes. I was all over Colorado. I even was sent to Chicago to help with the productivity. It was really cool. Everyday I met new people.
good,"I worked as a marketing coordinator and loved the work environment. The management was amazing, it was a fun workplace. I made alot of good friends there."
good,My review is that me personally I have had a good experience with the company the employees help me learn things in a day and the manager are kind and nice.
good,This company has a very old history in our country and has proven to stand the test of time even through the change in how people shop.  Sears has a rich culture in America which is hard to compare to any other retail store.
good,"I love working at Sears because they have flexible hours that meets my needs. Pay is decent and co-workers are mostly nice. I can't complain, the only one down side is that management only cares about numbers and not so much inventory. Hope they could keep stores stacked."
good,"I am a smart/bright young man trying to work hard, better myself, strive for greatness, to impress my skills and abilities. To improve and focus harder"
good,"working in retail definitely advances your customer service skills, dealing with hundreds of people a day you have to learn how to deal with different people. retail requires a lot of patients as well. time efficiency is a staple when it comes to retail being able to check out customers in a timely manner is important."
good,"I have been working at sears for a good while now, and it can be fun at times while still having that good work ethic. The managers are hard on us, because they want us to succeed when were in a professional manner, so we can make our company name reputable."
good,"Unfortunately the sears corporation (Kmart) that I worked for has closed down in my location. However, I loved my job. It didn't take long for me to advance. I feel like I should have been paid better but overall it was a fun place to work. I LOVED my customers and my coworkers. Management was good and we got along great. I didn't really have problems at my location."
good,help to load and fulfill orders for customers and for stores. usually a pretty easy steady pace all day long. always making sure that load quality is good and that everyone is doing their job
good,Sears was a fast-paced worked place in retail sectors. Working environment  and employers  in Sears were very co-operative. All employers were treated fairly but unfortunately they are out of business now.
good,toujours. meeting pour informer les démarches a suivre nouveaux projet ex 2.0
good,Great company to work for when they were still operating. Things tailed off as they began to struggle financially! They finally reached decision to outsource in 2013.
good,A typical day working for Sears for me started with an employee meeting to make sure everyone was on track with sale targets and daily cleaning tasks. The job was easy and fun.
good,"I worked  there for 5 year they never raised my salary, but I enjoy the job for so many years . I work in the shoe department it is very stressful more in holydays."
good,Sears was very fun to work with when you have nice co-workers to be around helping you put clothes back where they go and help clean up the area. If things got stressful others would come and help you with whatever you are doing.
good,Great place to learn and start your Automotive career. Management was nice and understanding and all ways willing to help. It was great learning experience for me
good,"Only hired to help close the store, part time temporary work.  Didn't like getting minimum wage.  No overtime allowed.  No benefits except discounts on purchases. Loved selling jewelry."
good,Sears is a good place to work and good pay for the way you work. Help you on costumer service help you build different kind of skills . Fun place to work everything is organized in the store and no mix up on what need to be done when you come in .
good,Good place to work; no weekends; closing time 7pm; good management; long lunch breaks; flexibility with schedule; relaxed environment but the building is old and needs a lot of work
good,"Loved the job  Management was just OK. There appear to be certain negativity at times for no apparent reason"
good,"The people all work well and hard. Short staff really impacts the customers and the team. It was fun and it's too bad they are going out of business. Asking the staff about style, allowing the sales associate to help control the merchandising would have had a positive impact on the store."
good,", Lamentablemente ahi dependes mucho de las ventas Y si son temporadas bajas te irá muy mal pero si tienes la actitud y las ganas podrás lograrlo sean temporadas buenas o malas"
good,"Like all retail jobs, your experience is going to vary depending on the store you work at. Our store manager was very strict but her expectations were not unreasonable. Sales jobs are commission-based, so you have to work for what you earn. Rather than an influx of new customers coming and going, Sears seems to moreso have a steady stream of regular customers who come in every week or every month. I enjoyed getting to know the familiar faces."
good,"Buenas prestaciones, buen trato, pero llega a ser tedioso di no tienes pasión por el área, a mi me fue muy bien, si hubo mal plan de algunos ni lo noté, tu compromiso debe ser al cien o no durarás, en mi caso fue contratiempo personal, buena empresa!!!"
good,It’s was a good starting job for someone either in college or someone who is looking for a job. I was at minimum wage until I left but the people and job wasn’t bad.
good,"Sears was a very fun as well as very diverse place to work, Customers will always be customers. The only hectic thing was having to pressure customers into applying for sears credit cards."
good,Sears is a great place to work. Although job stability is a huge challenge.  Some of the top technical people I met work/ed at Sears. Several in Senior leadership are awesome. However senior leaders are in a revolving door not lasting even 2 years at times. The leaders at the very top are in complete control and driving the company to where it is heading. It is not an accident or result of anything else.other than intent at the very top.
good,"It's been torn down, so a review for other potential hires is kind of redundant now. Oh, its a 150 character minimum... Well here we go, blah blah blah done."
good,"I had a great time working at Sears and it breaks my heart that they are no longer around here.  The management team I worked for was great and help me when I needed them to.  Co-workers were good, for the most part, but you always have that one or two people.  My ideas were considered and some were in place upon closing.  I always though of going back part time but they closed."
good,le esprit de le equipe et  l aide entre un et l autres
good,Aprendí muchas cosas sobre el trato a los clientes
good,This job was very different for me. I learned a lot about household appliances. Management was nice and understanding also willing to help when needed.
good,"I enjoyed the experience I received working at the call center. It is a very fast paced environment. It is also a very stressful. You are ""helping"" customers who have bought large expensive appliances. These customers are usually very, very angry as their appliance has usually quit working and they have had multiple technicians out to repair them. You do not receive raises as they have put those on a unknown time frame, freeze. I enjoyed the other employees I worked with. During down times , between calls you are able to read, color, crochet, etc. The biggest issues are the constant policy changes. The low pay compared to the intense stress of extremely irate customers. Feeling increasingly useless as there is not a lot of help you can the customers."
good,"Management is helpful on getting you hours when your able to work and available. Co-workers and managers help you to reach your goals. A day of working there could start by opening up, taking down the old signs putting up new ones."
good,"A typical day at work would be easy with a manageable number of customers. If there was no cash wrap duty to be done,employees were told to assist in cleaning and organizing the store environment including the fitting rooms and the store floor. Sometimes, I would be handling a customer`s transactions when another customer would be asking a question or for assistance. In this case, I would have to multitask and make sure I meet the needs of both customers. This would be the most difficult during the weekend. Despite the busy crowd and number of tasks I would have to take care of, the job was still enjoyable as I was able to assist the customers and satisfy them."
good,Great first job. Hours are very flexible so it is a good job for students. Work is fairly easy and the discount is nice. The dress code is pretty simple.
good,"•	Verificar apertura y cierre de la tienda diariamente."
good,Was a fun relaxed place to work most days. During holidays it could get stressful but by no fault of management. Pay wasn't good though and there was a severe lack of hours available
good,If you didn't get people to sign up for credit cards then you didn't get hours and if the store was dirty you didn't leave on time. The managers were okay.
good,"I enjoyed my time while I was there, had great promotion opportunities. Left the company due to the company being in financial trouble and is closing most of it's stores."
good,"the place was a good part time job to work for, but during the summer months it was full time, i found a new full time job allowing me to end my job at Sears. Sears closed it doors at this location"
good,There was a mix of high schoolers and middle aged people working together. The management was very helpful when I snapped my ancle and was out of work for months.
good,Only worked at Sears for a few months before it closed but it was the best job I ever had. I quickly moved up the ranks and enjoyed working for 95% of the time I was there. My managers were very helpful and always willing to help whenever they could.
good,Working at sears was a learning experience. I did level up quickly from retail sales to lead in six months. If you work hard you could evolve quickly with the right management.
good,Although they did not offer pay raises for part-time workers it was still a nice place to work. They gave a great number of hours a week and if you needed time off you would get it.
good,"Working For Sears In Home Repair Was Fun You Rode In A Service Van, Drove To Customers Home To Repair Appliances. Pay Was Ok But Raises Were Ok Too!!!"
good,Easy job everyone was nice and i learned a lot of new things working here only problem was we didn’t have enough employees on my shift so i often had to do everything in my own while other shifts had more than enough workers
good,fun work place. Chalenging goals (selling Sears credit.) happy and friendly work environment. Good managers. They appreciate good proformance. flexible scheduling.
good,"1.  Striving to improve your assignment objectives."
good,I enjoyed working for this company very much. Had great management and a fun environment to work. Unfortunately I don’t believe sears as a company will be around for much longer.
good,My day always started with a store meeting to go over sales and expectations. I learned a lot about product knowledge and closing the sales. Management was very helpful and supportive. The ability to make great commissions was the best part of the job.The worst part was when management had to many salespeople working at one time.
good,"It was a nice place to work, friendly and a good place to exercise my customer skills  Had the store remained opened, I believe there would have been room for advancement"
good,"I start  the day planning the assignments for the associates, having a start up meeting to discuss the days projects and letting them know of any up coming events. Continue to look for any repairs that may have to be done."
good,"I did multi tasking at Sears. Cashiering, stock, floor sales. Work was easy and the hours wre there but I didn't like to close because you can't leave until everyone is done. Sometimes I wouldn't get home until 12 midnight. Gets very busy on weekends as any store so it's expected. They pressure you hard to get people to apply for credit cards and Sears rewards card. Overtime offered first come first serve."
good,great place to work nice people long hours but not too bad according to breaks . good pay and just an overall nice place to work. Managment is very helpful for new employees
good,it was a fun place to work. the schedules were pretty flexible and the people their were great. it was a lot of heavy lifting involved but it made for a great way to stay in shape
good,"Working for 50 years with Sears was enjoyable.  Typical day was counting money and balancing registers.  researched shortages and made bank deposit.  I learned patience and diversity.  Management I had was great, upper management not so.  The hardest part of my job was having to deal with situations I could not control and having to e mail for help rather than talking to someone.  Most enjoyable part of my job was co workers and satisfaction of helping not only customers but co workers and management and doing a good job."
good,"The store management is stellar here, able to work with you and make sure you are supported"
good,Very fast  and patch handler skills unloading skills crasftman line worker good money good hours good salary cap good people good business fast pace  good environment
good,"Sale goals are posted daily. You can review where you are at anytime of the day, and most of the time management is just a phone call away.  Love helping customers make a informed decision on our products. Would like to work in a clean and organized area."
good,I liked working there I just needed more hours. The staff was great and helpful when I was training. I liked all of the managers they were nice and friendly and nice to work with.

good,Working on all kinds different products. Being trainer / mentor to other technicians. Going to all my great customers over my 35 years of work like  interacting with customer. Enjoy working with people.
good,friendly people and we would get payed 2 dollars for each person we signed up for a credit card so by the end of the it would add up however they push you to sign them up.
good,"It was a great company, good people and great products. Its had an abundant resources for solving problems.  I loved working with the customers and guiding them in purchasing the right products."
good,"Es un buen trabajo pero no es un sueldo suficiente, para todo el trabajo que se realiza."
good,I enjoyed working here.  Employees are easy to get along with.  Do see my manager at least once a day.  Spend time contacting previous customers to remind them of current sales.  Spend time communicating with customers.  Help other associates as needed.
good,Team meeting with coworkers and get information on  prior sells from day before. What’s expected with credit applications and shop your way rewards needs to build customers. Open register and greet customers and help with any of their needs.
good,"Overall I enjoyed working for Sears. I would still be working there if they had not had a management layoff. I was able to start out as a cashier and worked my way up into management with in 5 years. I learned a lot about every day store procedures and policies and attribute that learning to my success in the retail field. I enjoyed working with all of the management team as they were all willing to teach me, as long as I was willing to learn."
good,worked for a very nice couple that ran a small garage door division for sears. love working for them just wasn't a whole lot of room for growth. driving a lot and for long distances was really hard.
good,"Besides all the pressure put on you to make credit card applications, I enjoy my time as a Cashier at a retail store. It's calm and you're very independent and thats what I usually prefer in a job."
good,Sears was one of the best jobs I had at a young age. This job was great I learned/worked on different levels for the Credit Center. Data Entry/investigations and Credit reviews.
good,I love sears very much I relocated 3 times twice in California and to Phoenix AZ all my bosses were very friendly and nice I got a long with all employees I stayed at sear for 4 years total.
good,"The most part I enjoyed is meeting and assisting the customers"
good,"It was pretty sad that the store was closing, but working here showed me what was it like working at a retail store. They were times the day was slow and where did the day go. All in all, it was sad to see the store had to close."
good,Decent management depending on the manager. I liked my coworkers great and fun to get along with. Sears allowed flexible work hours that fit well with my schedule.
good,"Working at Sears is different from Tim Horton, you have your own paced when working in Sears."
good,There's a lot of potential to make good money as a sales associate here especially with the bonuses that are offered every month if goals are hit. Workplace culture was kind of sad and management is given many tasks which makes them stressed out. Nonetheless I enjoyed working here and were very good with my schedule.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, mucho compañerismo, sueldos acordes a la competencia, beneficios como empleado"
good,Sears was a place to work while you are looking for other job opportunities. Great place to gain experience in sales and customer service and a great beginner job.

good,My first 6 years I was assistant visual merchandiser which prepared me for merchandise support supervisor.  These positions proved invaluable to me for my management of 6 Bombay store locations.
good,"I only came in to close the store, they hired anyone and everyone to close the store. It was fun to work at a place that had no rules basically we took care of customers and tore everything down."
good,"Not a bad job, you work in the back so you don't have to have much interaction with customers.  VERY flexible schedule for this job as long as the work gets done there isn't really a specific time of the day needed to be there.  Compensation is not bad for the type of work you are doing."
good,It was a good company. I had good Loss prevention management at my store. I most enjoyed the flexibility I had with my schedule.  The hardest part of the job was self training myself.
good,I looked jobs every kind of proffesions and easy to apply with indeed resume apply . Ineed site is very helpful for job explorning . Helping creating resume and helpful links all over canada

good,"Empresa donde cuenta con departamentos muy nobles , ya que te puede ir bien en cuquier temporada del año."
good,"Nice hours with paid breaks. This was my first job and i worked it while in high school, it wasnt bad at all I enjoyed it. My biggest complaint would be having to sell the credit cards because people either already have them or dont qualify but you are required to sell a certain amount every day. Personally, I wont force people to get something they dont want but if you are good at selling stuff youll do great here. I loved the employees I worked with and though my manager Norma wasnt a great manager i really enjoyed this place."
good,It was a fun place to work and I learned a lot. There were a lot of unhappy customers and the management seemed more interested in profit than retention.
good,"it was a fun work environment, but everyone hated their job. it was hard to gain much professional experience from sears, and it got pretty boring at times. it was also a pretty easy-paced job and it wasn't hard"
good,"J'ai adoré mon expérience chez Sears."
good,"I absolutely loved working at Sears. I was an office associate, and my manager was the best I'd ever worked with. I really hate that I had to leave for better opportunities. The pay isn't the best and its extremely difficult to get hired for full time, but the coworkers, managers, and atmosphere almost made me want to stay longer. There were of course bad days and bickering between people when something didn't go right, but overall a good experience."
good,"I've worked with Sears Canada for almost 7 years. I never wanted to quit. They have been so cooperative with my schooling schedule since day one. Everyone I worked with felt like family. It was a very easy going, fun work place that I will never forget."

good,Typical day was supervising and coaching my associates on how to reach their sales goal potential. I also supervised a team of associates that took escalated calls and trained on how to handle these type of calls. Hardest part of the job was training people that the company hired that were not a fit for the job.

good,"While being an operations manager for Sears I was in accountable for  the P&L , contractor bid meetings and overall facilities maintenance.  I found it rewarding coming meeting my goals and leading my team to many achievements."
good,"no review"
good,"Sears did a more than great job in training  employees on the products they will be selling . probably the best in the business. The problem is Malls are going away and probably will be gone in this country in the next 10 years. and with the CEO of Sears being a land investor not a retail guy. He's after the land under the stores and could care less about Sears its self, it employees or that its even been in business as long as it has over 150 years.  There web site sucks big time and never cared about Sears or Kmart at all, let alone the employees. And that has trickled down to Store Managers and Dept. Managers as well."

good,"Dans un environnement très positif et agréable, chez Sears j'ai grandit  professionnellement et personnellement."

good,"La mayor parte del liderazgo (gerente de tienda, recursos humanos, gerentes de ventas) se involucran con el personal muy a la ligera, si algo sale mal, son los vendedores quienes tienen la culpa."
good,I have spent 8 years with them and the workplace culture is amazing.  I have made life long friends and connections.  If the company was going in better direction I would recommend more to work there.

good,"Not a place to look for a career given their current situation.  I did enjoy the workplace culture and the individuals working there. A typical day would consist of checking the ratchet bins to see what size ratchets need to be repaired and checking on customer orders staged for pickup. If a freight truck had arrived that day, ones duty was to check an see what needed to be put away and clothes that needed to be unboxed."
good,"Sears was a great place to work, I started with co-op and feel in love with the environment, the people and the customers.

The job was a fast paced environment I gave my all selling credit apps and I was the top selling credit card seller you just didn't get rewarded for it ."

good,"Es un buen empleo para aquellas personas con experiencia, y no tanto, hay un buen ambiente y compañerismo. "
good,Loved working for Lands End. Sears cuts to many staff members. Puts to much on one person. With no raises. Does not help in making people want to work harder. If you will never get a raise.

good,"I absolutely love working for Sears, however in light of recent news I need to find a job with security in order to support my growing family. They are a great company to work for."
good,"In a tipical day of work, I have the responsible for dispatching calls to techs in several regions. As well, I have to route their calls for the next day. As I do that, I have to answer questions  from the call center, which are calls either asking for sooner service or to make changes in the system that we use to keep track of the service orders."
good,Talk to various members daily and problem solve to meet customer needs. You will learn various sales processes and techniques. Management will help as delegated. Friendly sales staff but sales can come far and few on slow days which can make difficult. Hardest part of the job is trying to resolve issues that sometimes you have no control over and the most enjoyable is closing those big ticket sales.
good,Sears was a good place to work. I learned many things as this was the training ground for my customer service experience with the public. I loved the details of the auditing and accounting experience. I loved helping customers.

good,"If you are getting into the field of sales, this job is a great way to learn many of the basics. If you can take the time to know your products and are generally friendly, you will do great."
good,Great place to get your foot in and have a hand-on experience. You will have the opportunity to see the top down management style versus Mom and Pop type of style.
good,"it was good working there, the management was very nice and very cooperative, very understanding. One of the major problem would be very less hours..."
good,"It was a fun job for the first two years. After that, it became boring for me. Also the driving all over East TX to meet customers became problematic for me."
good,Sears was a very slow place to work for. Sold jewelry once in a while and had to get credit card sales on a daily basis and would get verbal warnings if you didn't get a credit card sale once a day. Had to literally count every single high priced jewelry at night and put all of it in a vault and count a cash drawer and balance the store before anyone could leave for the night.
good,I have been working at Sears part-time (More than a year).The managers are fair and for the most part nice. The employees tend to get along fairly well.
good,"Es muy esclavisante, los jefes de personal son groseros y Rh carece de principios éticos asi conos sus jefes de seguridad"
good,"Working with Sears was a great experience for me. I was blessed to work with a great team. Sears gave me many ground-base skills for me to work with and to bring into many other jobs in my future. Sadly, Sears had to close due to financial problems which lead to everyone losing their jobs and most without severance."
good,"Aggressive and a great workplace environment for business "
good,"It was an ok job, good money, and hours were ok depending on which manager did the scheduling which was always an issue, brakes wear slim to none, and competions in the store were ridiculous. But store was well organized and laid out."
good,"Sears was an interesting place to work. When customers came in, and you could sell, it was one of the best places to be a part of. When customer base slowed down due to online sales, selling became very cutthroat. Ceo's came in and started layoffs and I was one of the first to go."
good,Es una gran empresa para laborar si eres soltero. Los ahorros son buenos
good,"Working for Sears Automotive as a customer service writer/sales trainer and assistant manager, gave me the opportunity to work with customers and clients for many different backgrounds and diversities."
good,"Had fun working here, great people learned a lot from management, pay wasn't so good but as a first job it's a great option yo get your experience started"
good,"Sears sales consultants must be ready for any holidays or special events, similar to any other retail business. Much of the years business happens during these times. All other sales skills are assumed."
good,"Sears était un endroit fantastique a travaillé, beaucoup de clients tous différent, j ai appris a être a l écoute des gens . Sears donnait beaucoup de formation pour la vente , les connaissances de produit ,la gérance ,la sécurité au travail etc...."
good,"Very good to their employees, allot of incentives at the time. The only draw back is the head of the security dept. She was more worried of what the employees were doing or not going then the customers i.e steeling ect...you are watched very closely"
good,The company slowly took away all of the great things that kept the 25 year plus employees around. They wouldn't invest any money into the stores to update or provide enough resources necessary for everyone to get the job done.
good,"Customers at my Sears location were far and few between, so you often ran out of things to do and we're left sitting with nothing. Although, that may not be bad for some. Management are good, fun people."
good,"Sears has many areas of work that one can choose from. However in every area of work, one thing that I noticed and liked the most is there is always space for one to grow. There are no limitations to earning more income for oneself. Base pay or not, we are all eligible for extra commission in different ways. "
good,Hard work is required but fun and nice to work at. Mangers are very nice and understanding as long as you show up and do your job. Mangers will back you as long as you show respect to them and the customers.
good,"When I was working there (a long time ago), it was pretty fast-paced. I got along great with my coworkers and the field offices I was assigned. My immediate supervisor though...she was the reason why I transferred to another department. It was an office where the women outnumbered the men by about 5 to 1, so the culture was very high school, Mean Girl clique-y. But, I did enjoy my work, and I also enjoyed communicating with the field offices and the vendors."
good,"Initially this was a good customer service job with decent pay, but over time it transitioned into a job based on statistics and metrics.  We became more like a machine that was evaluated primarily by our production, which was the number of incoming customer calls handled in a short time frame and the number of outbound calls made for specified purposes.  The work environment was good and often great people to work with, but the stress became overwhelming.  Sears is struggling and eventually all 9 employee jobs like mine in the NE Portland office were reassigned to Fresno, CA in October, 2016 as a cost-savings decision."
good,I personally really enjoy working with my coworkers over these last almost 6 years. I have had great growing opportunities. It melts my heart to see each and every happy customer.
good,"You do get training on the differences of all the washer and dryers and the benefits of each. The also show you which dishwashers are better than others. The training you on the difference of gas, electric and what duel fuel is on the ranges."
good,"I absolutely loved working here. I made so many work friendships through the great work environment and even was able to network and use the rapport I built with management to help me with advancing my knowledge in other departments as well as earn extra hours overnight. I was always the one my manager called to come in when he needed an extra hand. As someone who made sure the shelves were stocked and the displays were set up according to plans, I was tasked with a lot of independent work. I loved that. I also had to help customers with simple requests or get them connected with a sales rep who could assist with the heavier purchases. I loved that I could do so many different jobs in this store that I was really like a jack of all trades. I did signs, merchandising in hardlines and in softlinks (as needed). I did support roles as a cashier and even helped with sales. The independent work and the freedom to grow was great. The hours varied, but I had plenty of opportunities to make it up. At this time, I had no kids or relationships, so I loved all the hours. I enjoyed coming to work. I had the best managers and co-workers here."
good,"other than the fact you don't really get the hours you requested,  it's a nice environment to work in. The coworkers are very nice and helpful. Maybe a couple coworkers don't know how to do their job. But it's okay. I like working there up until they changed everything."
good,Best job I ever had. Fun fast paced work environment. Felt more like a family. Great team members and even better management. Job security is not great because many stores are closing.
good,Used to be a great place to work before we merged with k-mart.Storemanagement was good but corporate was unwilling to invest in stores to increase sales. Secondly never asked people on front line for advice e.g. Sales associates.
good,"I have loved my time working at Sears Holdings. The culture, management, and opportunity to grow were great. The only downside to working in Sears is that there is no real job security as they are constantly having layoffs and the compensation is poor compared to other companies."
good,"A typical day at work started at 4 am every other week with cycle count.  Then part parts where they went and helping out in the office with customer service.  I learned a lot about appliances and lawn mowers, how to do cycle count.  Management was great and the workplace culture was also great.  I cant think of anything hard about this job.  The most enjoyable part of the job was just coming to work"
good,"Dollar Tree is a task oriented job that allows one to enhance their skills and abilities in customer service, store organization, team building, and task management."
good,Friendly and professional work place. Very clean and well organized Good benefits. Staff and Management work will together. Social events very regular.
good,"Flexible work schedule, worked in the lands end department part time and my supervisor was great.  Teach you the skills you need for the job and I generally enjoyed speaking with my co-workers."
good,"Productive place but mostly fast past with date sensitive events."
good,Most of the time I usually spent time engaging customers with questions they had of certain products. I also applied customers for Sears rewards programs and credit cards.
good,"This company is great with work life balance which I love. Management is very flexible with when you start and leave as long as you put your time in, and get your work done on time. We are able to work from home on a weekly bases which helps tremendously."
good,"Es un excelente ambiente laboral, cuenta con valores fundamentales a aplicar y desarrollar."
good,Working in the backroom of Sears taught me a lot of skills revolving around time management and the importance of efficiency throughout a team of employees. It was a great experience I had during the middle of my schooling for Master of Arts in Education.
good,"Customer service was always first and foremost.Flexible schedules.Fun but fast work environment,especially during holidays. Management team was exceptional. They were very helpful and understanding."
good,"It was one of the better retail service employers, staff were well trained and bonus structure provided incentive to do your best. However working for large companies can limit ones feedback as well as policy flexibility."
good,"Work hard, and do the job that you are hired to do, and you wont have any problems, this however can be said about many companies. Communicate with your leadership your thoughts in a constructive manner and it , on occasion,will lead to changes in the work place, or a further explanation from leadership about your thoughts and how they apply to whatever the manner at hand is."
good,"As long as you are able to keep yourself busy and find things to do this is a fun job. Be careful if you take a commission based pay job, you may end up with very small pay checks if you don't fight till the death to get a sale."
good,"Great staff, management was on a power trip and racist in everyones opinion. Not great pay but steady work. Was a great store back in the day but sales are not keeping up."
good,I developed a close relationship with many of the managers. I enjoyed the people I have worked with. I only wish they paid more. The Hardware department is a very competitive field where your pay check is based on how much you sell rather then the actual hours you worked.
good,makes getting a job easy. a friend showed me this and i got hooked asap. First time using this website. many friends told me of this website for a job.
good,"take care of the customers, work hard and great place to work. Able to move up if you are willing to learn and put firth the effort. hardest part is biting your tongue at rude people"

good,this company builds up your skills and knowledge to be added to your carreer. good benefits. opportunities for advancement into other departments and time management.
good,"Everyday was exactly the same, we would answer calls until we go home. Some days were stressful, some weren't. I feel like it is not easy to those who do not have customer service experience."
good,"sears was not to bad, the only thing was the credits, your credit goal determined your schedule, which was difficult selling to a store with limited foot traffic"
good,Sears Holdings is a great company. They take pride in having the best trained associates and treat customers like members of the family. Great training and overall benefits.
good,Was able to communicate with may different customers via telephone. Was able to adapt and learn new things from my coworkers as well as the many different customers I spoke to daily.
good,"Pour un étudiant, c'est le travail rêvé."

good,"Good stable company to work for, good interaction with the customers and a great work environment, very decent benefits and room for advancement. Although had to deal with poor management from time to time. Overall a good place to work."
good,Loved working here. They worked with my school schedule but they needed more hours from everyone that I couldn't give. Putting away clothes and helping customers to recovery at the end was easy work.
good,Working in their hardware store was a great first job back when I was in high school years ago. I learned a lot that has been useful. It was a shame to loose my job when the store closed.
good,I'm looking for a work environment with growth & and a  friendly job setting. .what I enjoy the most is working with people in a positive environment . I can adapt to almost any job setting . I look forward to new and exciting  challenges.
good,Working for Sears Holding was decent.  They give you great discounts and there are great opportunities for advancement.  They give overtime if you want it.
good,Very positive experience during my 13 years with Sears. Only concern for prospective applicants would be the current financial difficulties faced by the company and how they may impact long term employment.
good,"Lots of fun, Managers are knowledgeable and good to work for."
good,"I worked as an MCA. The work was not hard, very easy going. Everyone there was kind. No one gave me  a hard time. Only compliant is that I still made minimum wage. I got paid more working in fast food."
good,"The one I worked at had it's fair share of ups and downs. I didn't stay there to long since I returned to college but it's an alright job for what it is. I don't see any kinda of advancement, but I can honestly see plenty of Job security."
good,Responsible for assisting customer with shopping needs while delivering superior customer service I handle cash and credit transaction providing gift advice. I enjoyed working with the customers talking to the children. The staff I worked with was friendly and nice people.

good,"No job security,Company is going on great loss."
good,"The store was never extremely busy, so there wasn't much commotion. My coworkers and supervisor were always very helpful. The store was never dirty, and all items were always in the right spot."
good,Sears is a easy going professional company. Management is nice and professional. The company really cares about helping the customers to keep their account active.
good,"A typical day at work is generally really good, especially when it gets busy. It is great for a first time job that is in customer service industry. The customers you interact with on the sales side are fantastic. You really can build relationships with them. Management is always willing to help you out when you need it. The relationships in the building between co-workers is great. The hardest part is when you have to call to any call center. They are usually very difficult to work with, and none of the call centers are interconnected and you will stand there with the customer for two hours before you finally get something done, and a lot of the time you will have to tell the customer that you couldn't do anything to help them. Sears shuts out the actual associates from doing anything other than ringing people up for their merchandise."
good,"I really liked everyone I worked with. I had fun taking care of customers and enjoyed my job overall. The staff was nice. I enjoyed the atmosphere, and got discounts on items for working there."
good,Great company to work for.  Not enough business to keep locations profitable.  High pressure from upper management to reach goals that sometimes are not realistic.
good,i loved working here i was so upset when the store closed but i have nothing bad to say about this company. sometimes the management was useless but other than that all was well.
good,such an amazing company to work with. dressed code is relaxed I was allowed to dress up for work in a multitude of colors. I had a base pay of 6 hr and also plenty of commission!
good,Great  training- Great team-good incentives   Loyal customers--Too many goals to meet. Good commission rates.employees helped each other. staffing was not always good
good,Sears was a safe place to work. The management was good as well especially my manager. My coworkers were a pleasure to work with as well. The job was pretty hectic and there was always something to do. I learned better customer service and learned more about working the register. The hardest part of the job was that it got overwhelming at times. The best part of my job was helping people in any way I could.
good,"""I've worked at Sears for a number of years now, as a contractor in this latest stint, but previously, as a full-time employee.The culture at Sears has changed over time. I remember it as a friendly, congenial atmosphere, rather like one big, happy family.At present, the company is still interested in hiring the best and brightest recent graduates, which I admire. But the willingness to separate and compartmentalize important product development functions may hurt them in the end."""
good,"The most enjoyable part of the day were the people I  worked with."
good,i loved my time at sears. This was a seasonal position for the holidays. their managers and supervisors were very educational and supportive. they made sure we were very educated and clear on what we were expected o do and how to do it. if you needed help there was always someone to assist. co workers were great and fun to work with. They pay could be. better but overall a great experience
good,"Typical day at work is kind of quiet first thing at opening but picks up some business towards the afternoon. I have learned from there is how to be more outgoing and not so shy to talk to people or a group of people. Learned new techniques that can help improve metrics. The workplace culture is like family, there are plenty of people that stayed with this company for many of years. The hardest part of the job is that they are very pushy with metrics. Now the most enjoyable parts of the job is that they are there to help you with anything that maybe struggling with."
good,The Sears Co. was a great experience for me. I really like the selection of merchandise to sell. The typical day was for me was to greeting customers and to produce a sale by providing additional information of the appliances to sell. The employees were very friendly and easy to get along with. Management wasn't overbearing. Just one thing they would not hire full time to any new employee. I also learn to maximize each customer to make a sale.

good,A typical day at my work is filled with interactions with customers. We see hundreds of new people every day and provide satisfying transactions for each of them. Management is responsible for making sure I reach my credit goal and keep my area organized. The hardest part of the job is dealing with an unhappy or discriminatory customer. I have learned to be patient and respectful even when being discriminated against. The most important part of the job would be the relationships I make with new people on a daily basis and being able to deliver a satisfying experience to my customers.
good,I really enjoyed working for sears. The benefits were amazing and the people were very friendly. HR was very helpful with any questions I had. I was sad to see the site be closed.

good,This company is great for experience especially when you need to start looking to get experience for future jobs with better coordination and better compensation. I have been here for almost 3 years now and still working here. But there are nice and rude people here. You just have to know who to talk to and when to avoid them. These new people that recently got hired or transferred from another location are sort of lazy.

The company did an excellent job, training me and making me feel comfortable about getting on the phones. I would recommend this company to anyone looking to step their way into the call center career."
good,"This is a very good company to work for but perhaps like many retail places, unless your getting paid added commission to an hourly pay... the compensation isn't very good. The staff is great though and its a good environment to work for."
good,"Sears is a interesting place to work, the customers are great and the whole Sears team is very hands on and friendly. You learn a lot on a daily basis whether its stock control or floor presentation. The most enjoyable part about working in sears is working as a team and meeting new people."
good,"Flexible schedule, decent work hours, advancement opportunities, training program is extensive, goals are clear, diverse workforce, subpar management."
good,"A typical day was to meet with people and fix what ever was not working, no matter how big or small the problem. Sometimes go back to finish the repairs. I learned the many types of machines and the simplest things can make them stop working but be the hardest to fix. Management was good and kept me busy. The workplaces sometimes was not the best but others was outstanding. The hardest part was telling someone that you can not repair it, it was to far gone. The enjoyable part was learning more about thing and how to repair them, meeting new people, and traveling around in different areas of the state."

good,The workers at Sears were always helpful and friendly to new employees. They work hard and well. The job is often very tedious.
good,"I liked working for the company, I was told I would be made full time and never was.  I was working full time hours but did not get the benefits.  I ended up having to leave for medical reasons."
good,It was a very easy job any people that I worked with barely even spoke to one another.  I would arrive at about 7 am. At that time I would check my emails to see if i had any responses. Throughout the day I would call a certain business to find out the cost of the parts that were used during a customer's appliance which made it stop working. So we would send a sears maintenance person to look at the appliance in question at that time. If he put in anything new i would receive an email stating the parts and the costs which I would have to verify making sure the maintenance man priced everything properly and didn't call it something other than what it was.

good,Sears was my first sales job and it allowed me to find a love for sales. This is a great company to work for if you're still in college and want to start getting into sales.
good,"The retail business can be challenging and if you don't mind low salary plus low commission rate its not that bad of a field to get into. There is little advancement in smaller stores and of course more opportunities in much larger stores. If you stick to it and learn the business, you can do very well in it."
good,"I learned many skills at this firm, especially client services and customer care. It helped me learn and improve my skills. I was also able to gain many new experience regarding customer service as a sales represantative."
good,This is a call center so you know what to really expect. The difference with this department is its not just all phones there's a lot of work that goes into what you do in the fraud department and it actually opened my eyes to what i need to look out for
good,The store that I worked in was very poorly managed.The assistant manager was too young and immature to be in the position. Also management had their favorites and allowed let them get away with unethical behaviors.
good,"i have learned alot at sears , worked at cash register was so much fun my manage was very good. they appreciate good customer service and motivate employees by encouraging them."
good,"It was an awesome job, had a lot to learn about but eventually learned and conquer it. It was a fun experience and i enjoyed every little thing regarding it. It was temporary"
good,"A typical work day starts off with a morning prep-talk meeting with my managers and all of my co-workers. Then you start by opening all of the cash registers at your designated checkout. Typically during a workday, you ring out customers, greet them as walk by and ask if they are finding everything okay, customer returns/exchanges, putting away ""go-backs"", and folding/organizing clothing and display racks. I have learned a lot of customer service and retail skills including computer and register skills and offering customers to apply for store credit and master card. Most of my co-workers are very friendly and open to answer any questions I may have. The hardest part of my job is selling credit. They really push you to have around 10-15 a day. The most enjoyable part of my job is my co-workers."
good,Associates are very nice and friendy. Management are very nice as well except for one ASM. I enjoy helping customers and fellow associates.

I also must complete ""help tickets"" which the stores submit for help in changing job data for associates, pay adjustments, transfers and things of that nature. I am a people person so i get along well with all managers and co-workers. The most enjoyable part of my day is working with the people (customer service). I cannot say there is a ""hard part"" of my job but just handling 29 different stores can become quite tedious."

good,The work environment was a great place to be especially during my high school years. They were always lenient on coming late or requesting days off which made the job more likely to be kept.
good,"As a Field Trainer I was responsible for the training and certification of associates in the Pacific Northwest. I set my own schedule and arranged for the training sites and associates to be trained. I approved associate promotions and held seminars for Managers, Sales and Technicians in all aspects of the daily operation of theAuto Center."
good,"But the community isn't always strong, as while at Sears there was  high turn over rate for employees. Managers were often struggling with how to manage the problems employees were having, and what corporate was telling them they had to do. All of my best managers were managers that worked with the associates in order to resolve conflict or challenges. Any time the manager cared more about what corporate was telling them, than they did about helping the sales associate improve on their own, the worse success became. On the floor, community is important as well, because one sales associate should avoid stealing sales as much as possible. But if a sales associate helps another nail down their sale, they will often reciprocate."
good,Really cool management. Pay wasn't good at all. Great if you need some part time money and if you have a second job. Overall cool culture just bad pay if you're full time.

What I learned at Sears was to greet and serve the customer with a friendly attitude and to work as a team player with the rest of the team, as well as product knowledge.

good,"Sears was a job I held a long time ago, but I remember that there was a lot of pressure put on associates to sell credit cards and promote rewards memberships, which doesn't sound bad, but the amount it was pushed put a lot of stress on our associates, which also put a lot of stress on our shoppers who didn't always want to be members for various reasons, and overall made the experience very uncomfortable at times. However we were somewhat well-rewarded for selling credit cards, even though we only received very little for getting an actual sign-up. There were months where we received very special compensation based on our ability to get credit card sign ups, but they were occurred only once every six or seven months."

good,"things like the elevators and machines to do the job break easily or don't work right."
good,"My department was very slow but I would always find something to do, from building TVs to dealing with customer solutions. Very rarely had to seek advice from management, From the beginning I asked co-workers and management for advice and information to learn more about the company and how to find solutions. Worked in 3 different departments, wherever they needed me and that help me how to understand the company more as well. I drive for success and determined to grow further into the company. Management was great, they were always encouraging me to bigger and better things. I learned so much from them, from the company policies to how to manage and find solutions. Not only did they gave me a Lead title but, gave me an opportunity to learn different departments and taught me things about me that I didn't know before. Like going with my instincts, determined to help people and the importance of finding my true and better self. Co-workers were like family and I think that was the best part of making your work place a team spirit environment. The hardest part of my job was when I made a mistake and disappointed the customer, although it was very rarely it does happen to anyone. But my motto was if you are capable of making a mistake then you are capable of fixing it. The most enjoyable part of my job was making my customers happy and they were very grateful."

good,I came here knowing nothing about sales. the sales staff taught me everything I know. and I became quite good at it. being ex-military they have a very strong training environment management truly believes in doing everything they can to make the sales staff successful
good,"* Well the working condition was great and the day to day work is always fun and interesting. "
good,Loved retail industry.  Kept bust all day and night.  Potential for advancement.  Worked with many people.  Opportunity for delegating work load.  Loved meeting the public.  Customer Service was top notch.
good,The difficulty is not at all servicing the needs of customers. It is doing that while balancing the work you already have. Working the Home Improvement department challenged my ability to multitask assigned projects with customer service on a daily basis. I was happy to help where I could and sometimes it took me two days to finish a floor plan. Nevertheless Sears offers a great learning experience and good service.
good,Just wish they had given more hours to work and a fun place to work with the tem players.  The day goes by quickly and its always willing to advance as well.
good,Sears was my first real sales job. I really learned to ropes on how to seal and manage a team of sales associates. The management is great in my experience
good,I really enjoyed working at Sears. It's a fun environment. Everyone that works there is friendly and you make friends as soon as you start there.
good,"Daily I would walk all departments and identify accomplishments and opportunities."
good,The job was great considering a family friend was the owner of the Sears store. Overall co-workers were not adequate and were very hypocritical in the work place.
good,la empresa es muy buena y las prestaciones y el servicio son excelentes me dio un gusto trabajar ahí y aprender mucho con la vida laboral y personal.
good,Fun place to work with great environment. Had my own office and enjoyed moving at my own pace and staying busy. Slow paced and I had to work alone 90% of the time.

good,"It was a part time job that turned into a full time position. I worked in the hardware department and it was fun."
good,Working out staffing and customer issues. Learned problem solving. I worked for the company for 34 years and learned a great deal. worked with a great team of associates.  Being in customer service not being able to solve a issue.  Learning something new every day.
good,A typical work day at Sears included a customer coming in who was interested in some appliances. The first thing to do would be to greet the customer and find out his or her needs. Once you find out  his or her need then you can match them to the appliance that would best serve the customer. There were also days that you had to take a customer and show them where things were located in other departments in the store.
good,"The internship is a great opportunity for aspiring college students to immerse themselves in a stable retail environment. The opportunities to learn and advance are enormous but cutbacks over the time since the position concluded make that much more difficult now than previously. Management was knowledgeable, inviting and supportive. The schedule is wholly inflexible as most workers there are full time."
good,The work environment was wonderful. The employees treated each other like a family which is always a plus for me.I loved it
good,A typical day at work would be clocking in doing daily .in cash office. Inputing the totals from each register in the cash over/shortqge tool. What I have learned at Sears is the you will get all kinds of attitudes and people that come in to shop. Your first impression of the store will determine if a customer comes back to the store to shop. I work with a group of nice friendly co-workers who works together to get things done with in a timely matter. The hardest part of my job is not being able to wow a member when merchandise is out of stock or can not be ordered. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help anyone I can in any situation.
good,"I start at 10am at my workplace."
good,Get to meet different people each day. Short days and work for several day at a time. I learned a lot about different appliances while I worked their.

good,"I was very Happy with my job, I was promoted twice in the 4 years I was there, I was very upset when they said they were closing the call center to transition over seas, but I understand that Sears had to do what they felt was necessary at the time."
good,Sears is a Great place to learn job skills.  I have found that what they expect from you prepares you for many jobs at the same level or higher in other markets.
good,"This job has been good to me, and I love most everyone I work with. The supervisors are tough, but fair and ensure we work efficiently at the front. Coworkers are fun, caring, and always there for me when I need it. HR is very accommodating as far as the schedule goes and when I have needed time off for personal and family issues. I have been able to improve my customer service skills, my communication skills, and my teamwork skills. As service desk associate and supervisor in the front, I have learned leadership skills and am better able to delegate staff while contributing to a safe work atmosphere. The hardest part of the job is dealing with unreasonable customers, but that is normal in any retail job. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I get to help people all day and talk with them about their needs and experience in the store."

good,there were no typical days at sears you could work the morning shift or the evening. each day brought it's on set of challenges--whether from a customer or an employee. if there was a problem I made sure it was resolved to both the customer and the company. the co-workers were fun to be with because they had their ups and downs and as an manager you had to be able to bring out the best in all. the hardest part was making sure I was satisfied that I treated my co-workers as well as my customers fairly and with the respect they deserved.  the most enjoyable was to see the smiles on the faces of my customers and co-workers.  that made my day
good,work days varied from difficult to easy. I valuable communication skills while employed at sears. the upper management didn't have a good gasp of what the problem of the company were at the time and how to fix them. the hard part the lack of hours given.
good,Sears a été mon premier emploie et j ai adoré i travailler pendant 5 ans
good,"I was one of three managers that ran the apparel dept. I focused on all signing for the team, while other managers focus on there area. Including signing/pricing I was over the 2nd floor. I had to ensure all planograms were set in home fashion to kids and woman's basics. I to ensure ordering was done every week. I managed over 30 plus people daily. I had to ensure floorsets were set every month. Ect."
good,Sears gave me a good work experience. The environment was very competitive.
good,"I gained valuable experience and knowledge about all aspects of warehousing and management. Great place to start a career however the future of the company is very unstable. With the negative impact on the retail industry due to the economy we have seen a very large decrease in the amount of freight that we are both receiving and shipping. Great place to gain experience in a large-scale warehouse environment that is primarily driven on production. Also a great place to learn how to manage associates, manage time, gain communication skills, and also identify opportunities to increase production."
good,The company is a fun place to work at.Management works with you closely to make sure your sucessful
good,Sears Parts and Service was great place to work. I worked for them for a few years was very happy with the management.
good,I enjoyed that there was always something to do and someone to help. the management was on point and it was an easy place to work with people.
good,"A typical day at work for me had to do with unloading the truck , taking merchandise to customers cars , and cleaning the warehouse. I learned how to use a forklift. The management was great at first then they started to lack and didn't do certain parts of their jobs correctly. I loved all my co-workers and got along with everyone. The hardest part of the job to me was unloading the truck but i also enjoyed it and i enjoyed helping the customers to their cars with the merchandise."
good,I enjoyed working there and dealing with the daily faithful customers. They really made to job itself enjoyable. The work was not hard and was very easy to forget the time so the time spent working was always a breeze.
good,The better you do the more you make. They run lots of contests and free lunches
good,"Loved it here. Learned marketing, time management and cold calling skills. Met new people daily and loved my co workers. I did have 3 managers 4 years but I learned so much from each one of them. Travel is a ever changing industry and so is a travel office. so much to learn and keep up with!"
good,Sears is a great place to work. I learned about how to supervise and how to work faster staffs were all welcoming and hard working. My co-workers and I were always on time and we work diligently to meet project deadlines and accurately. I learned how to supervise people.
good,"Allways learning, getting better understanding of the sears way of doing things and doing them right the 1st time so people would come back!"
good,"I learned a lot while working there I learned how to sell credit and talk to people. I was able to meet my monthly goals and continue to try to exceed expectation. My manger wasn't always around I needed him but I was able to learn more due to that disadvantage. My coworkers were mainly men, I worked with one other woman and everyone was very lively and fun to be around. We did have slackers, so me and the other female employee picked up the slack. Once her and I sales were noticeably better the men got themselves together. Best way to teach is to lead by example. "
good,"I worked in appliance sales, and my experience is likely much different than that of a cashier or another non commissioned position. The pay was fair for the amount of work put into the job, and while there were always big cuts to commission when big sales occurred, the commission was generally equal to the amount of effort that you needed to put into a sale. there were no fantastic benefits to working there, but most of the managers were laid back enough that they did not mind if you had a life other than work, which is about opposite to the majority of the sales positions that I have interviewed for."
good,"Productive work place. Good customer service with a quickly and efficiently attitude!!!! Management is great very understanding as well as helpful , Co-worker really put the T in team it's never a problem with asking for help overall a great place... Keeping up with metrics is so so it becomes very challenging when there's not any customers."
good,"A typical day at work was going over to the job board and picking up the highest priority customer ticket and performing the repairs and maintenance needed in a timely manner.  I learned proper techniques for basic automotive repairs.  I also learned the importance of following protocols for performing certain tasks so as to make sure nothing got skipped or overlooked.  Management was great.  They were there to make sure jobs got done on time, so they would come out to the shop to speed things up if they were going slow.  They were also very approachable and never had problems accommodating to my needs.  My co-workers were great as well.  Always friendly and willing to lend a helping hand.  They would also lend me tools if I didn't have the proper tool for the job.  The hardest part of the job was having to work on all different makes and models of cars, and memorizing  the different procedures for each one. The most enjoyable part was getting to work on cars all day which is a true passion of mine."
good,"As a Sears Sales Associate, I have a passion for customer service and thrive in a fast-paced environment. I am a team oriented individual who enjoys working with others to accomplish both common and personal goals."
good,"good place to work, good compensation and benefits. call center enviornment with just inbound calls with room for advancement."

good,"Long days, but the team I work with is fantastic.  Management is very ""for the associate"" and works well together."
good,"A normal day requires the abitlity to multi task while servicing customers, training the associates and managers, ensuring merchandising, delivery, service and sales are completed in company guidelines. Working with people and seeing when someone learns something new is the highlight of my day.  I have had the opportuntity to learn, develop and grow with a company willing to teach me."
good,"I have learned concepts of Teradata, Java, Shell scripting while working in Sears. It was a great time to work with wonderful teammates. Working environment was nice. Hardest part of job was to rectify the bug in existing system. This also seems to be most enjoyable part, as every time we get to know more minute details about the general mistakes."
good,"Responding to emails from stores with information to address their needs with customers. Researching information on customer orders and processing overnight reports from the day before.  Have learned a new warehouse management system ""Highjump"" to be able to do third party deliveries.  All SLS workers are assigned responsibilities in steps from time of receiving merchandise to delivering to the customers and we work well together to achieve customer satisfaction.  Hardest part of job are the holidays, they are crazy with the enormous amount of sales.  But we do it and actually enjoy the challenge.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when we have an unsatisfied customer and we pull together to make it right and end up with a happy, returning customer."
good,Sears closed down becauce of bad management. manager was stealing from the company
good,"This is a nice place to work for advancement. Promotions are earned, but most hiring is accepted from within before elsewhere. Pay is decent, and raises are done annually off of review results. The day consists of sitting at a cubical in front of the computer, talking to customers continuously, while documenting and switching though programs and tools."
good,Its really nothing to the day in the stock room when our day starts at 5 am we open the truck and the fastest person will get in the truck and load the merchandise onto the conveyer belt once everything is off the truck then we will start to unpack the items and put them in there proper place to go to the departments they needed to and then everything that has to get put in the stock room we will put those items on there shelf so they can be found when the time comes
good,The workday revolves around helping customers and selling various products as needed which is lots of fun.  The worst part comes in when there are no customers during which most of the time there is a lot of standing around and talking with coworkers.  Sometimes we are asked to work on projects as needed but those aren't very common.  Most coworkers get fed up with the management due to their poor time management skills and playing favorites.  All in all it is a good place to learn and get a paycheck but most people use Sears as a stepping stone into a better job somewhere else.
good,"Sears, Cornwall ON has a strong focus on success with consistent acknowledgement and recognition for individual as well as team accomplishments. Associates and management employment anniversaries and successes are celebrated daily and monthly. Senior Management is extremely flexible, understanding both the needs of the business as well as balance in their management and associates personal life. The General Manager, is extremely approachable with an Open Door Policy which she has implemented for everyone."

good,This was a career turning point of my life. Learned a lot working for this company especially the Loss Prevention Department.
good,i love working with new people. the areas that I work in have many people around that need to be taught how to adapt to a new place.
good,Sears is a great company to work for great hours and great people.
good,i work 10 hour days and off three days a week and i love my schudule. working ona computer all day has given me more experience on a computer
good,"Clean/detail appliances for showroom floor"
good,I learned to verify merchandise such as TVs and other merchandise from delivery trucks. I learned how to detect signs of theft and write reports.Management is all amazing!  Co-workers are all amazing as well! Writing reports would be the most difficult part of Sears. As Loss Prevention every part of your job is enjoyable!
good,"Who does not like working around Video Games.  If you don't well this is not the job for you. "
good,I am enjoying working at SEARS because of the management and co-workers that are very kind and supportive to all the people participating in the work place.
good,"Nice workplace, but very unfair management. They would expect you to hit your sales goals no matter what (even if they know that it is not busy). They don't care how you did it, as long as it gets done. Other than that, I was surrounded by nice and friendly co-workers who I still keep in touch with every now and then."
good,"Working for a franchise of a once powerful corporation that changes the rules of operation on a seemingly weekly basis requires keeping up with the latest changes while trying to sell your store's assets over the dot com. I have been of service to a variety of customers and am amazed at the diversity at times. The commission scale is not a permanent structure, it changes according to various influences too. It definitely make life interesting."
good,It was great to be apart of the Sears management team. It gives everyone an opportunity to show what you can offer.
good,"Lo que aprendí fue a administrar una empresa porque parte de mis responsabilidades es tener el control total de mis departamentos a mi cargo para dar un buen resultado en ventas e inventario también a saber ubicar al personal dependiendo de su perfil."
good,"Mon expérience fut brêve au sein de cette entreprise  a cause des coupures de postes  survenues cet hiver.Ce qui rend un peu la tâche difficile a décrire .  Grosso modo c est une entreprise qui prend soin de ses employés en general . La formation est un point fort que je lui donnerai, ainsi que l aspect securité ."
good,worked there for 5 years and my co-workers and boss were pretty good to me.
good,"Sears is a laid back job, but the managers put themselves at a high pedestal, so they can reach their goals as a very organized business."
good,"Assist customers with shoe selections, make sure shelves are stocked"
good,Overall a fun and enjoyable place to work. Co-workers were very nice and helpful when teaching how the system works. Everyone worked as a team and were always there to help one another out. Personally found it enjoyable to show up everyday to work.
good,Enjoyed conversating and meeting new people everyday. This particular company had no freedom though because you have no time for yourself management really wouldn't let you get up to use the restroom
good,"Working at Sears has been a fun, experiencing job. The management staff and coworkers are very interesting people. The hardest part of the job is the long hours required to work at times. But besides that the company is a great place to work. I would continue working for this company if I was a Buisness major"
good,"Assisted customers with payments, returns, new credit card applications"
good,Working at Sears has taught me a lot about customers. There is problems that need solving and working there we learned how to deal with that. The staff was always great and friendly. Management was there to help when needed. You have you slow days but there was always something to do for example clean the floor and fitting rooms.
good,"This place was absolutely amazing to work at. Management cared about us, the job was purely helping people, and there was the opportunity to move around and learn new things and sales techniques. The only thing I wish was better is the pay. If I would have been paid more per hour plus my commission, it would have been a job I could have done for years."
good,"The store is consistently busy and there is very little downtime. It can be tiring, but makes the shift go quicker. Department management tends to be more accommodating and willing to listen to employees than upper management. They are flexible around ""life"" schedules, but the pay is relatively poor with little in the way of raises."
good,"drive delivery rote an set up customers prodects, long drive time and fast assembley of products, exelnent coworks and managment"
good,"- worked 8 hour shifts"
good,"Create visual displays and maintain selling floor"
good,Good place to work. The management was always willing to help with a difficult task and I really love handling customers all day. Very little to complain about got to work in an air-conditioned warehouse in the summer and mainly worked by myself. Very little micromanaging by bosses helped me feel like I was trusted.
good,"Clock in/Clock out. This was a first job, somewhere I knew I wouldn't stay long"
good,Recieve calls from sales associates and provide them with Sears credit card info for various customers.
good,"There was never a ""typical day"", because the schedule had to flex with all shifts covered. "
good,"The main objective of a person working as a retail sales associate is to sell. Assist with customer needs, and help them with what their looking for. You also help keep the sales floor organized and clean. I also have experience with Loss Prevention. We would be in the camera room looking out for people who would steal merchandise without the attempt of paying."
good,"For credit card application pitching, be prepared. I personally was unable to become confident in selling them and was terminated for that only reason. I did, however, leave with good terms, and good graces. I never minded coming in and working side by side with others. The ability to take on Sears as a first job was a good experience to have, unfortunately I was not cut out for the one part of the description. The rest is fair, and straight-forward. I appreciated everything they did for me and hopefully will find somewhere else to further my future."
good,this was a fun job depending if you like to work with other people and a fast enviornment. i liked it and the people i worked with were awesome people
good,"It's a monotonous position where you go in and handle calls that vary from a broken appliance to treatment received at the Sears or Kmart store. You will have issues created by different departments that you will need to figure out and solve. The call centers from outside the US aren't much help. The company does provide you with the tools to pull this job off, though the systems in use need a major upgrade"
good,"Get into work clean up while we wait for the truck to arrive."
good,"It's not a bad place to work but there were a lot of politics, that slowed down advancement. scheduling was ok only if you were full time you got yours hours first , and what ever was left went to part time. Which was not much."
good,Sears was my first job that I ever got.  It was tough because I did not know anything about lawn equipment or tools.  Over the course of three years though I learned a lot.  At first if a customer came in and asked a question about a specific power tool or lawn equipment I would have to get another employee to assist them.  I learned though by shadowing my coworkers and was able to begin to help customers on a daily basis. I learned a lot about tools that I will now be able to use in the future.
good,"A typical day would be busy because i worked for the holidays. My first job so I learned how to run a register, greet customers and do call backs with the clothing. Mostly would be working by myself but when I needed help the co-workers would be more then happy to help out."
good,"Awesome Management who trains you to be successful."
good,As stated above it was a good job. Limited mobility and income
good,A typical day at work for me during my time there as a cashier was to cash out customers and on down time I would walk around and organize the sales floor. My co-workers were always fun and laid back and management was ok. The hardest part of the job for me was keeping up because at times it would get extremely busy since it was located in the mall. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to work with my co-workers.
good,The people are fun and easy to get along with.  Compensation is high on the starting end but due to the poor financial situation of the company bonuses and raises are rare unless you're promoted.
good,Was able to advance from intern to Senior Designer. Great work environment with very talented teams.
good,"A typical work day contains of Processing sales to installation and completion the jobs and all relatated paper work. Analyzing sales commisions, preparing settlements, paying installers. Communicating with customers. Resolving issues related to install project, billing issues and rebates."
good,"On a given day there is a lot to learn about the business of Delivery and installation. The work day is always filled with consistent pace. On going updates to improve the customer service. There is a new computer system introduce frequently.   Manager are very encouraging always supportive. Co-workers are very positive about the work place, but we manage to have fun here and there. The hardest part of the job is paying attention to the details.  Rallys for best employee of the month."
good,"A typical day at Sears involved ringing up members when they would come to your cash wrap, marketing to them and explaining the benefits of a Sears Credit Card, then assisting other departments with their jobs and tasks. Cross training and social skills were a large part of the job, and demanding goals were the norm. The goals did not bother me, however, and striving to meet and exceed them was challenging and rewarding. "
good,"a typical day at work would consist of handling customer transactions such as purchases, returns, payments/applications for the department credit cards, setting displays, organizing merchandise, and filling in for co-workers lunch/break times. i learned exceptional communication skills and time management, how to use a cash register, how to handle extremely high stress shoppers ect. the hardest part of the job was working during the black friday frenzy. the most enjoyable part of the job was constantly having something to do and getting to talk to people all the time."
good,"muy buen ambiente desde inicio del horario laboral com trabajo en equipo y aprendizaje compañerismo,aprendi que no ay que ser duro como jefe pero si exigente,un buen apoyo con mi gerente asi como le aprendi tambien,lo dificil erea lidiar con clientes exigentes y poco agradables pero siempre tratandolos con respeto,lo quemas me gusto y voy a extrañar es el compañerismo que teniamos."
good,I loved this Job! I was able to make several connections and was able to make a great impact on the organization.
good,"	Answer customers' questions about merchandise and advise customers on merchandise selection."
good,"The Staff is amazing! You're always learning new things from your peers. It's a place that is always growing. The most enjoyable part of the job is coming to work with people I truly enjoy working with everyday. The hardest part of the job is keeping everyone focused on working even after moments of fun. Keeping associates on track when they just want to talk all day is the hardest part of the job. A typical day: Depending on the needs of business I can be running the sales floor, ringing on the register, completing store resets, or directing associates as to what to do on the floor. I learned so much in my time working here but I think the most important thing I have learned is not to allow personal relationships interfere with how you feel about business."
good,Works great for me because I am a college student so the pay was phenomenal! I had a great manager but the down side is most managers there are very negative.
good,"It's a nice place to work for."
good,Strong team working to build long lasting relationship with their customers.
good,"I got to work and start projects, or returns. I learn communication skills everyday. My co-workers, and management make it fun place to work. I enjoy my job very much."

good,"Good Pension Plan, Good Benefits"
good,"Learned how to manage a team."
good,"On a daily basis im on the phones with Sears Technicians. I like the job that I do assisting technicians and sometimes customers. The sales aspect is good, they have a great product to sell which is a Protection Agreement for home appliances and other items like televisions etc. The only thing that is not great is the changes in the job. It does not affect our customer service but it makes it difficult to sell the product by taking away tools that we use on a daily basis to sell. Sears work with my life events like school, they're very good with schedule. Overall sears is a good company to work for and I would recommend to anyone that is in need of a job. But you do need to have a strong will power because the sales aspect could be very frustrating."
good,"I have a strong passion for cars. It taught me teamwork, time management, and efficiency. A typical workday at sears starts with a job and a diagnosis of a problem or opportunity. It was my job to meet the clients needs regardless of the issue. I partnered with a strong parts specialist to get the job done timely. "
good,"The company is like any large corporation in regard to compensation and benefits. They are not so much concerned about the individual as the bottom line. To level that out, however, the local management did what the could and would go to bat for employees that really deserved advancement and promotion. "
good,"working in the decor department, responsibilities included,"
good,Management is great and encouraging. Co-workers are fun and it is a family type setting. The hardest part of the job is to make sure I have all elements before I stop a shoplifter. The most enjoyable part is when the team catches shoplifters.
good,Great place to work! definitely a team environment!! Love the morning pep rally's!
good,"i worked third shift  and our time would vary, we would go in get the equipment ready to start our shift and went to work, it was like a family enviroment among our department. we would each help out as it was needed to get the job done, we had no supervisor on our shift so we would go in and do our job take breaks and lunch and go home. we were let go because of lack of work and it was very hard after 16 years at a job. but while i was there i did my best every day"

good,"Sears, is a great place to work at through college. I am able to get days off I need and breaks during summer and winters breaks from school. It pays well for a college job, probably better than a lot of other jobs. I work as a sales consultant in the Lawn and Garden and Fitness departments. A typical day at work consists of on going customer service with past and present customers, whether its finding part for their lawn mowers or getting them set up with a new one. The management treated everyone equally and didn't treat us like they were our superiors. I worked with a lot of other college students and that made the workplace fun working with people my own age. The hardest part of the job was being able to keep busy while the store wasn't busy so I would find something to clean or something to set up as a display. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work overnight from Thanksgiving day to Black Friday."
good,"I would arrive at 5:45 each morning to make sure that I had everything that I needed to proceed with the tasks that were set for the day."
good,"I started working at sears a year before My husband received new order to California, but before leaving I made some great friends while working there."
good,"Overall it was kind of fun, I got along with most of my co-workers and they were really fun to be around and real cool to work with. I was a cashier and management was very strict, we had to be doing something at all time. If there wasn't a customer at our register we would have to help fold and straighten out clothes. The hardest part of the job was getting the customer to apply for the sears master card which we were required to do, and if the customers didn't want to signup we would be penalized."

good,"I had worked for the company for almost 4 years.  I had been one of the best employees they had.  Especially when I had 2 years straight of Top Customer Service and got recognized for it.  But for me the company still lacked attention to my details as far as getting a better position along with low pay.  Unfortunately now, Sears Portrait Studio has gone out of business and is no longer in CPI Inc."
good,Enjoyed capturing smiles of those who came in for portraits. Enjoyed putting together photos as a piece of art and looking at the customers faces glow as they loved their pictures etc. Hardest part was working the cash registered because I enjoyed being the studio more and interacting with the customers on a interpersonal level.

good,Sears has given me many opportunities over my career with them.
good,The most enjoyable part of my lines of work is the friendly work environment and been surrounded by a very hard working and friendly group whom are open minded to on  suggestion on how to make the work place conducive for all the worker.
good,"A typical day at sears is boring not very many customers, very slow, but during the holidays very busy don't get much time to do anything else can't leave registers the lines are backed up. The two most important things that i learned working for this company is having a great personality/ being patient, and working at a fast pace but being efficiently while doing it. Most of the managers were great but there was one that was always rude, and mean to everyone no matter how nice you was to her. The other Co-workers were great got along with all of them, even others from other departments. The hardest part of this job was getting credit apps for the company. The most enjoyable   moment about working at this job was the free food around the holidays and secret Santa for Christmas."
good,"sometimes a slow pace job, I worked with a small team, but we got the job done, and the most part I enjoyed about my job is stopping shoplifters"

good,"Straight to your station, cashier and customer service ."
good,"On a typical day at Sears as an apparel sales associate, I would come in and open my register if needed, or I would join my coworker who was usually present. If I wasn't assisting customers, I was recovering and cleaning my area, assisting with signing, pricing and merchandising, keeping up with employee training on one of the kiosks, moving merchandise from the stock room to the floor, or offering assistance with displays in our Lands End Department. Also if there was a new employee in my the department, whoever was working that area was assigned to assist in training the new employee. I was cross trained in nearly every non supervisory position.  "
good,"A typical day at Sears starts with opening the store, having a coaching session with the techs in the shop. Then assigning them techs with their tickets for the cars that I assign them to work on. I have learned how to do alignments and work on cars, learned more about inventory and making the schedule. Hardest part of job was making the schedules for 15 people they want different schedules. I really enjoy working with the public."
good,"Personally, I've spend a lot of time with this company. A few times I was offered what I thought was a better opportunity, however, I always found myself coming back to this company. I've always really enjoyed the people that I worked with, the managers were always amazing and every day was a new experience. I think that I learned the most from working for this company. It not only prepared me for the future but kept it fun in the process."

Most of the customers there was very understanding and genuine. My managers kept a positive attitude and if they had any problems they'll approach you in a respectable way. The coworkers was fun, it was never a dull moment with them. Wasn't really any hard parts of the job. The most enjoyable part of the was smiling and greating each customer and they did the same in return"
good,"My typical work day consisted of opening the registers and cleaning the displays. Helping customers over the phone or in store. Making special orders. "
good,"Managing Sears portrait studios was an exciting, fast paced, rewarding experience. A typical day started at 9 am when I would arrive to open the studio, check the v.m and email and return calls and emails. once a week I would have to arrive an hour early for a conference call with the district and manager, where we would discuss the previous weeks sales, goals and new marketing strategies, as well as any customer service issues. I would then prepare the camera rooms for sittings. I had two camera rooms and most of the time was working by myself or with one other person on busy days. (During the Christmas season it was all hands on deck). I was responsible for the day to day tasks of customer service, cash control, nightly deposits, making and verifying appointments, customer service, outreach, hiring, training, disciplinary issues, termination, keeping a clean tidy studio, inventory, organizing and filing pictures and paper work,sales, manager specials, portrait packages,  marketing, keeping a good working relationship with the Sears manager, customer satisfaction, employee relations, scheduling, ensuring accurate time keeping, and 5 star photography as well as reviewing my employees photography and sales processes.

good,My years at Sears Product service department were great. I worked wit the same 6 people for 7 years. I was able to complete my college degree and still work full time in this position I am forever grateful to my two managers. Everything I learned about business I learned on this job before I encountered it in my college curriculum. The hardest part was when my department was downsized and we were all separated to different departments and companies.
good,Great sales training for its employees and gave free rein to them for pursuing personal and company goals.
good,"As an Intern on the Inventory Team, my main project was to create a new way of forecasting with vendors. I ultimately created an Microsoft Excel based form, using Macros and Visual Basic coding. I enjoyed working on this project because it gave me exposure to the various components of Sears as a company."
good,"My overall experience at Sears was a good one. Easy work, great customers, friendly managers, cool co workers and good hours. The commission system wasn't bad but the hourly pay could have been better."

good,Working at Sears was a great experience I enjoyed the environment and the team I worked with. If it wasn't for the pay I would still be there 
good,"I loved helping people feel better about themselves and get healthier. I would hold their hand during shots or any other difficult time. I would be prepared for any possible scenario I could think of and could switch gears to a different procedure if needed. I learned that I work well under pressure and can manage myself through even difficult or shocking times. I have always gotten along with the many people I have worked with and we have helped each other do whatever is needed. I really enjoyed helping people, but now I have had  surgery to repair a total tear of my rotator cuff, and even though I'm fine, I can't do assisting anymore. So, I must look forward to new adventures and new things to learn and share. Thank you for your time in reading my application."
good,"like every other material handler job"
good,"I was able to travel both internationally and domestically with onesight and luxottica.  I ran the optical department in various locations for 14 years. I recruited, hired and trained hundreds of associates for our entire region.  "
good,"I designed, created and placed displays and endcaps for the Sears store at Regency Square."

good,"A typical day of work consists of ready all day, and helping members make purchases. If an item is not available in store then we will order it online for them, if it is available. If its not available then we try to suggest other options of where to look. My co-workers help each other when needed. Overall the management is great except for a few issues with one particular manager. The most enjoyable part of the day is when a customer is able to get something they originally thought they could not afford because I was able to help them. The hardest part of the job is helping the MCAs put out merchandise but it is also one of my favorite things to do. It can be a great work out. The chances of advancement are very low."

My co-workers were also supportive in teaching me the basics to help me get the knowledge of the company and its functions."
good,While working at this career you are consistantly challenged to take your work skills to the next step. Management strives to ensure that you are constantly busy and helping customers while working with you to find a solution that works best for your unique life style. The only disadvantage about the job is the relatively low opportunities for advancement and minimal compensation and benefit packages. Sears/Kmart would much rather keep you as a part time associate working just below full time (with frequent full time hour weeks).

I enjoyed most working with the customers and making their experience unforgetable, and also having loyal customers as to where when they come to the store they work with me and only me."
good,I liked the people I worked with. Sears is a good company the benefits were good. The hours were good as well
good,"Work day is about 5-9 hr, you learn how to photograph, sell, and deal with customers. Management there a good amout of the time if you need help with anything. Hardest part of the job is learning possing of infents. It is a enjoyable and creative place to work."
good,"Good, free trainings, good start for a future in sales. Management very supportive, understanding and knowledgeable."
good,You could have a good day or a bad day it depends really on the customer's mood. You learn a lot of stuff they put you on a computer training where you learn about the company. The management team is good there always busy doing there job but is the most stressfulist job. The co-worker's are friendly and they all get along. They all get together sometimes for lunch and decide what they want a do. The hardest part of the job would be when a really angry customer comes in and start's getting aggresive about a purchase. I enjoy to me when the customer is in a good mood and is really patience. We could have a good conversation and that would be so much easy.

However, there is a lot of pressure to meet personal and company quotas. I personally have never had a problem keeping up with the company quotas, and occasionally up and beyond them. However, many coworkers have come and gone because of their inability to do so. Since this is a retail company, the satisfaction of customers is key. Sometimes as a technology support associate, explanation can be difficult but satisfying when a customer is helped."

good,"Phiscally exhausting , but fun. there was a sence of accomplishment and a feeling that we were appeciated.

good,"I was an Express Automotive Technician, and I basically enjoyed it there. Although I really didn't care for the pay systems and schedule, or the way everything was rushed, I feel that I came a long, long way. I have had customers return due to a high level of satisfaction, and I feel that I connected with the customers well. However, I do feel that I learned a lot as far as work methods, quicker ways to perform my duties, and what I was doing wrong and how to correct them. It was all due to working with top-notch, professional and very knowledgeable coworkers. These guys would challenge me to do a better job faster by placing bets on how fast and accurate I could get the job done. It worked like a charm. The management was very helpful, more constructive than critical, which boosted morale exponentially. The hardest part WAS the outdated equipment we worked with, but much of it has been updated. Again, thejob basically more like pley than work. The more difficult jobs were more of a challenge than anything else. All in all, not a bad place to work."
good,I've worked there for about 16 years so I must admit to myself...I LOVE SEARS! It has been a wonderful company for me and has been there thru all the ups and downs in my life. I'm quite thankful and grateful for the opportunities that were given to me. It has been as flexible as the company can allow it to be for me.

Once everyone is sent to their respective departments (cash register in my case) I would sign onto my register and stand there until customers start to enter the store. I'd clean the area around me while it is slow.  When a customer comes to the register to pay I would suggest they sign up for the Shop Your Way rewards program if they haven't already been signed up, and also offer the Sears credit card for a discount if pre-approved. At the end of the day when closing we would fold all of the clothes and tidy up the store to prepare for the next day."

Our store in Vancouver, WA WAS a PROFITABLE STORE; news media said it closed because it wasn't profitable; that was not true.  We had many loyal customers.  We also had an amazing team where all associates in the store worked together to make our store strong.  I suppose one of our overall biggest disadvantage was having to work near the border of Washington and Oregon.  No tax in Oregon, so there were always customers who used our expertise to shop and then went over to Oregon to buy.  However, we worked harder and smarter because of that.  It was a great store and a great staff."

good,"Typical day at work was usually fast paced, competitive work based on commission compensation. I learned a lot of basic beginning Automotive repair. In store Auto Managers are very much willing to get the Mechanic\Technician to advance their knowledge which drives an increase on pay. Workplace culture of SAC is pretty much like anywhere else except everyone is joined around something with Cars. Hardest part of the job is the competition that arose among Auto Technicians because of Commission based pay."
good,management is cool and co workers are honest and fair. working atmosphere is very open with no one from management over your back constantly making you feel uncomfortable

good,Lot's of downtime.  Many set appointments are not really for home improvement...customers sometime think they are getting maintenance.  No-shows also happen where you drive to someone's home & they aren't there.  Closing ratio seems to be 20-30% when you have experience.
good,I really enjoyed working for sears. The fact that they have been around for so long is very impressive. The training was very good and the people are very nice but i was unhappy with the pressure to get people to get credit cards there. There is even a quota!

Complete paperwork, either completed the task or ordered parts.  Returned to the van to got to the next house on my route etc.  How to repair some appliances I had never worked on before.  Our managers usually contacted us daily or weekly, depending on our repair or service ratings.  There was a very diverse culture on this job.

La parte más difícil es no tener tiempo libre para pasarlos con la familia de sangre.

good,"A typical workday at Sears can be quick paced or slow paced depending on time of day or year. The busiest time of the workweek for Backroom Associates is when receive our freight deliveries. The unloading of freight must be completed in a set amount of time. Freight must be dispersed to it's appropriate department as soon as possible. There are several other daily tasks that must also be completed. Hence the Backroom department is always busy."
good,"I worked at several different locations, as an In-Store Marketer, for Sears Home Improvement. I had a great time, as an employee, getting to know, both, customers and employees. All were generally very pleasant and respectful. I would love to work there, again someday, if given the chance!"

good,I loved working at sears I loved whom I worked with and I enjoyed going above and beyond to help customers But sadly I had to leave because Bills were going up because I had just graduated high school and they didn't have any raise opportunities so I sadly had to go find a better paying job.
good,"Its a Good company, they have great merchandise . Management  was strong. Work there for my first job out of school and it was not bad at all. Would recommend it to anyone."
good,You can work up levels to improve your employment.   Schedules when working  part time didn't always accommodate your needs. Group meetings could of be done different time. Like working with the public was fun.  No more to say
good,Sears is an awesome company. The company is however failing. Foot traffic seemed to get slower and slower everyday I showed up to work. Its a great place to learn and find great mentors for your career but not a good career venture itself.

good,"It was very friendly place to work at. The job was never boarding at all. Each alarm call was alway different and keep you on your toes."
good,"Every day was unpredictable because you always dealt with different customers. I learned how to work amongst people who have different personalities, and handle situations that needed proper assistance."
good,"Great Place to work, good employees, if you work hard show up for work and actually do some work you can advance quickly. Hard on the employee for not selling store charges to the customers but if you did sell the charges you get paid for it. All full time Employees got 40 hours a week."
good,"Good company to contract for.  Was great untill sears started to slide and started receiving less and less work.  As far as working, I have no complaints and like I said, they were great until they ran out of work."

good,"Una experiencia espectacular , pero por situaciones de la economía en nuestro país  muchas empresas se han visto obligadas a muchos cambios para seguir en pie.  Dedique 27 años a esta empresa , y me encantaba el trabajo que realizaba. Levanre a mi familia y aporte al país  por todos estos años .."
good,This company was very driven and was very committed to being number one. Retail was very competitive and was very hard to compete with the other brick and mortar.
good,"Lots of uncertainty with company direction. "
good,Well for starters you need to build your team in order to be successful in this team. You will have to couch your team into success some times its hard due to poor management decision prior to you working there but if your patient you should be able to turn it around quick. Very stressful at first due to all the things required to do on a daily basis but after a while it become repetition. I personally have nothing bad to say about the company nor the staff if you build it right. Good environment and decent pay if you wanted to work for sears auto.
good,"Nice working conditions. Friendly co-workers. Great benefits and hours. "
good,Not enough hours or business to maintain a good lively hood to care for 3 children and being a single mom.  I did enjoy the overall experience there and meeting new people constantly.
good,Great place to work and opportunities to move up within the company. I was able to win trips and incentives based on my dedication and hard work to the industry.  Recognized my efforts.
good,"I loved working here, the people were great to work with. Management and upper management was pretty easy to communicate with. If you work hard enough and prove that you can hold your ground here, they will offer you oppurtunities for advancement and training. I was offered to be trained to be a manager a couple times, but I slowly learned that this career that didn't fit me. And with the company losing money and sales, they are letting people go, and merging job positions, etc. So who knows where Sears will be in a few years. Asset and Profit Protection is an adrenaline rush, it can be a lot of fun if you make it that way and especially if you get to work with an awesome team! But the worst part of the job, in my opinion, is that lot of the shoplifters can be vicious, and they will say anything to you to scare you away so they can get away with it. This can include straight up verbally assaulting you and other associates, threats, making a scene to embarrass you/everyone in the store, they get pretty creative. Gotta be good at thinking on your feet! Also, one of the lowest(or probably is) the lowest paying company for Asset and Profit Protection.. and they are stingy on raises. A great way to enter this field though if you have no experience in it!"
good,A normal day at Sears very fun day to do. The good thing about working for retail is you never know what the day we'll bring bit I enjoyed every day because it taught me many lessons

good,"Greet customers for auto repairs, write tickets for repair, ring out final sales, order parts, follow up with delivery.  Management was great with overseeing mechanics and assuring timely repairs. The hardest part of job was when a customer would become angry about their car not being ready on time because they had to go to work."
good,I feel they are as caring about their employees as they are their customers.  They are very vested to make their employees succeed.  The hardest part was getting the sale done.
good,"Muy buena empresa responsable, exigente, y de muy buena calidad, para la sociedad."
good,On a normal day the warehouse facility in the store would take care of shipping/receiving items from UPS. Taking care of customers is the number one priority for the backroom whether that would be loading up a refrigerator or taking one out of a vehicle. Backroom crew is one of the friendliest groups of people I have had the pleasure of working with.
good,"good place to work as a student. Very low pay, and the store is sometimes basically dead, so time goes by very slow. Management is all right, and customers can sometimes give you a very hard time"
good,"Much of my day was spent coaching associates and validating standards.  I truly enjoyed teaching associate the selling process.  Ensuring that each customer or member received a ""WOW"" experience.  In addition, I worked closely with each Store Manager and Assistant Store Manager to guarantee a high level of product presentation and pricing."
good,Great place to learn about everything.  There was everything from tools to auto parts and even clothing.  Good discount for employees.  Being on feet all day was the hard part and nasty customers at times.
good,"stocking shelves, working with customers making sure that they got everything that they needed, working with new technology so we didn't have to run to that cash register every time we had to ring someone out. Management was understanding for the most part. there were some upset customer that would take out their anger on us because we happened to be the ones their to hear them out. work with people that you feel you can trust without having them get to much into life outside of work"

good,"Stock vehicle with inventory to make mobile repairs"
good,me agradaba la manera en que se relacionaba a los empleados con las funciones de la empresa. A mi opinión la manera para lograr desarrollarse dentro de la misma es un poco deficiente.

good,"A typical day at work involves organizing, pricing merchandise and then presenting it in a way that makes people want to shop there. I've learned how to multi-task and my customer service skills have improved greatly. The most enjoyable part of the job is finishing a big project."
good,"Welcomes customers by greeting them; offering them assistance."
good,"•     Responsible for maintaining inventory control of new merchandise."
good,"The best people to work with anywhere. There is a real sense of teamwork, of trying to make our city the best it can be, and that every person is important."
good,Worked there 10 years always was good to me We always had training do to know our products we were selling It was enjoyable to close a sale and know I made my customer happy

good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, buen trato con supervisores, se brinda buena atención, pero horarios no flexibles y falta de personal"
good,I t was a good company to work for and you were enpoered to do do any thing reasanable to take care of the customers.The management trusted and respected employees as long as they did their duties as described.The company also invested in training workers.
good,I would definitely go back to sears if given the opportunity. A great place to work. Great management. Hardest part of the job is language barriers.
good,"A typical day at work will be to come in, and sign into my desktop. Set up all necessary systems to assist the member once the call comes in. Our team managers and supervisors are extremely active with the team. We play games every day to push us to land more sales in which we are rewarded with either tickets or a snack for doing so. The tickets go into a raffle each week for a possible chance  to win a Gift card. I have been to a total of 4 Top performer luncheons in which we are catered to for an hour and presented with a reward/ certificate. It is a very fun, up-beat environment."

good,"When I come in to work the first thing I do is sign out proper equipment: I-phone and printer, then I go to our warehouse to see if any Home Fashion freight has come in; if so, I put it out on the floor.  If no freight is available I have a Monthly Planner which tells me what needs to be done in the department for a particular week and I prioritize what needs to be done.  In between my duties I help the Cashiers when they are backed up with customers, I also help in the Jewelry and Shoe department.  I help sale and I help with organization of department, product placement and signing. "
good,"A slowly dying retailer, with great Merchandise, associates, and leaders that care about you. I really enjoy working at Sears, but unfortunately, there is not room to grow, that places me in a position where I have to leave."
good,"As a Cashier the strictest requirement of the job was to stay behind the cash register, cash out customers, handle returns, sell credit card applications, and keep your work area clean.  Unfortunately, the store I worked at had low traffic so it often was a dull experience. As a result of my employment,  I learned how to make a face to face sales pitch by selling credit card applications and how to fold clothes.  As a whole the management was very professional, and my coworkers enjoyable to work with.  I had some trouble selling credit card applications, though not from a lack of training.  I ended up beginning to transition to a different position, but unfortunately the hours began to negatively affect my education and I had to end my employment."
good,Employees and employers were friendly and made the job enjoyable. Teamwork was heavily instilled as the environment of the workplace when I was working there. I would definitely recommend this job to anyone who is looking for a great place to work!

However, after becoming acclimated with policies and procedures, I was able to find alternative solutions that not only was in compliance with company's guidelines but ensured the customer longevity and loyalty with the company. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customer's satisfaction with their interaction and experience with me."
