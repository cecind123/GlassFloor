rating,review
good,Enjoyed working there.  Wish management had been more honest with employees.  Would recommend others to apply with the Kroger family.
good,"Serving customers was always number one priority. I did just that. I made my customers happy. Only problem is that some customers require more attention than what management is allowing you to give. This was a problem for me as I did not like to be rude or short with customers. Benefits were good. Vacations, sick days, and personal days. However rules were strick and changed often. It was hard to keep up with changes."
good,"Well on a normal day I would clock in about 5 min before my shift started and get to my station. Once in my department I would find out what needed to be completed and get right on it. I would make salads and begin prep for the food bars for the next day. All the while keeping my eye on the counter to assist customers as they need it."
good,Within the Kroger Co. is a very good company to gain solid management experience.  I have had several successes within the organization and have not complaints.
good,"I found that the job was pretty easy but didn't get many hours each week. other than that its a nice place to work, the people are fun and friendly. Also they offer great benefits."
good,I was a cashier at Kroger for a while and a typical day included one on one time with customers for the entire shift. Working here has improved my customer service skills including how to deal with mistakes or bad situations with a level head. I worked with a great group of people that kept me entertained during long shifts yet we all worked hard to reach our goal for that specific day.
good,"Mostly pretty busy, many people always around to help. Learned a decent amount about how to help customers and how to deal with difficult customers. Management was at times absent and not always easy to get help from. Lack of communication and sometimes incompetent coworkers were a fairly common problem. Meeting many new friendly people and building friendships."
good,The benefits that Kroger offers is better than most other retail businesses.
good,A typical day at depends on the time of year. A typical day can start off slow and gradually pick up. I see that in a job like this I feel that in most instances that Kroger takes care of their employees such as discounts and adequate pay. I also have learned a smile can make a big difference in a person's day. My co-workers are very loving and approachable. The hardest part about my job is dealing with situations I can't change. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the people. Satisfying the needs of others and being helpful to those in need.
good,"A typical day of work entailed unloading pallets off of a grocery truck, followed by breaking down the pallets and organizing the product on to u-boat type carts. then we'd take the carts out and stock the product to the shelves. "
good,Overall this is a great job if you are in great condition and have no restrictions. after being here for 2 months i became pregnant and was given a not by my dr on my restriction of no heavy lifting. upon giving this to my manager i was told it was not a good enough excuse and i should still continue to unload the truck and carry the 50 gal icing buckets which weigh a good 40 lbs frozen. Upon refusing to risk my pregnancy i was fired.
good,"The work environment in stores seems like it was better when I worked there years ago. Currently I believe cut-throat budgeting has made it difficult for employees to do their jobs well (I'm told), but that's the case everywhere."
good,"A typical day included bagging groceries, providing carry out service, conduct price checks, gather shopping carts, sweep and mop floors, quick checkout service. I learned how to be quick and efficient in multitasking. In addition i learned how to work alone efficiently as well as being a team player. The hardest part of the job was learning the store quickly enough to assist customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers."
good,"Its retail so holidays and weekends are a must. After a while i was allowed Sunday's off because I got cool with the manager. The pay was deplorable compared to the likes of HEB for example, the benefits were ok on the other hand. Most of my coworkers hated the job, but i enjoyed it after a while. My only meaningful complaint is the pay which is so low to the ground its not even funny. And don't even think about a raise, not even if one moved up to a supervisor did one get a raise."
good,"Well typical day at the place break down pallets, and sorting them to what aisle they belong to. and trying to finish everything under certain time limit.  I've learn that multi-tasking is very much the key on how to get the job done, interact with customers and stocking shelves. some managers are okay others.... my co-workers are awesome helping me out much as I can to be able to get my part of the work done."
good,This job was on of the most fast-paced job i have ever had.I got a chance to meet all different types of people.
good,The Kroger store I worked at was always busy so I never was bored. The pay was outstanding even though it was a minimum wage job as a college student I enjoyed working there and with the other employees that also worked there. My co- workers were very friendly and me being in produce they were always happy to see my face from time to time.
good,"Duties would consist of: Oven prep,Deli prep,Showcase prep,Food prep,buffet prep,Taking special order request,"
good,"Work there was nice, had a really nice working environment, but there were not many places for advancement. The job was not very hard but it was tiring."
good,I was a front end cashier at Kroger. They trained me very well at the beginning of my time there. I also learned many new things along the way that made the job easier. But overall being a cashier was not that difficult.
good,"On a typical day at Kroger, I will bounce continuously between different departments helping out and performing different tasks. I've learned how to provide excellent customer service and how to quickly master any task. "
good,"I had a good time working for Kroger, I can't really say there is much to complain about there is definitely a few things I could have handled differently. I may consider working again for something similar."
good,"stock product, recieve trks and ship trucks, receive milk trucks and break down work trucks, assist customers find the products they need and came in for"
good,"I made a lot of friends while working here, its a very easy place to work in."
good,"The employer is good to work for but the management team is very unfair, they wrongfully terminate employees whom dedicated to there work."
good,"My days at Kroger, is terrible. I have learned that you go to work and do what you have to do. The management their is lack of communication. They walk around  NOT doing nothing, and its NOT far. I only had one enjoyable moment at work, that was when we got a chance to pie one of our ex managers in his face."
good,"My Kroger store has the unfortunate reputation for being unruly and too much overtime (something I'm guilty as well) We often get complaints from the Headquarter in Atlanta on why we have so much overtime. For a long time I was a bitter person on the inside of myself. I left in a effort to work on my shortcomings, strive to becoming a better person and let go of my bitterness. I want to live."
good,You worked from the time you started to the time you went home.
good,"This job is good for college kids and teenagers and older people who don't have families to support. The Union sucks they do nothing for you, but take your money, management only cares about the bonus they get at the end of the year. You are not paid for the work you do. the raises suck."
good,i loved working in the deli it was fun and exciting most days. management could have been a little better
good,"very easy going, no leadership, no motivation, no benefits unless your fulltime"
good,I enjoy working at Kroger. I feel as though Im very underpaid and the extra money I put out in union dues isnt worth it. I just recieved a raise but dont see any of it on my check. My hours are constantly wrong. I have to wait until the following week until I can get my page/ Whick in turn is taxed again so i really dont see it. I like the people and what I do. I just dont make enough to stay afloat.
good,Most of my career at Kroger I would describe as a above average experience. I didn't leave as I would've preferred but while I was there I enjoyed working there for the most part.
good,"Courtesy Clerk"
good,A typical day at work was hard working and continuous movement. Management could've been a lot better the associates seemed to do way more work. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers in person and being able to assist them.
good,"I wanted to change my professional state."
good,"my review over Kroger would be that when i walk in i clock in, i walk outside and get a row of carts bring them in for about a half an hour than i come inside and i find the check lane with the most groceries, i ask the customer how their day is going and how they would like their groceries bagged and its pretty much repetitive. Just them two things occasionally il clean the bathrooms or pick up a spill if be needed. Also i help load heavier merchandise into cars and help customers out that need it. Mostly i enjoy talking to all the customers and doing labor outside like pushing carts."
good,"The weeks go from Monday-Sunday and you don't know until 2-3 days before the week starts when you will be working so it makes it very hard to have a personal life."
good,At Kroger Grocery Store I've learned to also deal with satisfied and unsatisfied customers which was a very good experience because before Krogers I didn't know how to deal with unsatisfied customers in a polite and understanding way until now.
good,"The immediate work environments at Kroger can be close-knit and have flexible scheduling. "
good,I worked night shift from 11 pm to 7:30 am. It is a pretty physically demanding job sometimes; some pallets of stock are really heavy.  Management is ok but can sometimes expect a little too much from night shift employees.  The hardest part of the job is the shift itself:  trying to balance life with night shift can be hard. I really didn't enjoy the job.
good,"Not too much to say about the company, was no room for advancement."
good,"Good if you are in high school, otherwise it can seem like a drag."
good,"Good experience."
good,"A typical day of work includes a great amount of customer service. I have learned to be more patient because this position requires patience and precision. Management is generally available to assist with issues that need higher authorization. Many of my coworkers are young adults, many of which are still in school. There isn't really a hard part to the job. The most enjoyable part however is learning, problem solving and constantly interacting with customers and coworkers."
good,"A typical day at work in insanely busy, barely time to eat lunch, get yelled at by customers, no one appreciates what you do. If you happen to not do what you are supposed to do then you will know right away. It is virtually impossible to move up in the company unless you are someone ""chosen"" they do not base any of that on work ethic."
good,"I learned how to work as a team, as well as alone in the deli. Management was very friendly, which made working there pleasant."
good,Great insurance and pay. Mostly afternoons and evening shifts.
good,I could say so many things in a negative manner. it has its good and bad days and legendary bad days.
good,"I have worked for Kroger for over 5 years.  The job is ok but they dont pay enough to survive on."
good,Typical day is a lil hectic sometime depending on the week . Co workers and managers are always friendly . Works great with your schedule
good,"stocked shelves, bagged groceries, and cleared the parking lot of carts."
good,"for the past year I have been the administrative assistant as well as the manager on duty.  I closed the store three to four times a week.  During that time, I would be in charge of the store and its employees.  The hardest part of the job is the number of hours I am away from my family."
good,Provided customer service to customers who needed help with groceries.
good,"-bagged groceries for customers"
good,"This company is good to work for, but I felt as if it wasn't the right place for me to stay at for a long period of time.  The employees are very nice and are close to each other.  I enjoyed being apart of the team, working with my co-workers, and learning how to prepare food in the bakery department."
good,"The hardest part of the job is trying to get stuff done in less time that you have In the scheduled hours given. Ex: An employee has 3 things to do that would take 45 min. to complete. Well the time they have is ten min. That employee ends up staying after the scheduled time to get it done. Typical day at work: wait on customers and refill stock as necessary, cleaning and keeping up with the log books, cleaning the dishes, cooking the food for the customers and making sure mistakes are taken care of if they happen. Customer complaints etc. The most enjoyable part of the job is it's fast paced and there's always something to do. Plus dealing with customers and keeping them happy. With the product etc. Management is ok...... sometimes they seem to forget things that really need to be addressed. Taken care of.... Employees get annoyed with that. Problem solving and communication seems to be lacking."
good,"It was not a place where anyone can move up in the company, the only ones that can move up was their own friends it did not matter if one that had experience and schooling."
good,"I loved working at Smiths , overall it was a very beneficial job. I was welcomed and trained from the moment I started till my last day there. Learning new skills everyday was an amazing opportunities for me. A typical day at work would be for me to go in with a smile on my face and greet wonderful customers and strike up conversations with them while preparing their orders, keeping and maintaining the work areas clean while making sure all the other employees were happy and didn't have a hard time with anything (asking if they needed help ) , I'd prepare whole chicken for the oven every hour and thirty minutes or so following the cooking guidelines , I'd also keep the dishes washed and hot case filled with fresh items for the customers. We'd sometimes have samples to pass out on the hour for more up front and personal sales. Management was good, everyone knew what needed to be done and what needed to be fixed and that's what amazed me most. With all that we had to do as is the ladies kept up on sales and kept on their numbers and I even learned and asked questions on why certain things were done the way they were and understood more clearly by asking. I was never afraid to ask anything about the department and I enjoyed that. overall I knew what to do , because I was trained and guided correctly. Which gave me confidence with customers even more. The hardest part of the job was to remain calm even throughout busy days such as holidays or beginning of the month etc. This job taught me how to keep my cool under pressure and that's something that I will forever be thankful for."
good,easy work good benefits. lower management knows how to handle not enough associates but upper management just cant handle their job
good,My first job ever. I njoyed my co- wrokers and the daily customers.
good,"The daily routine varies depending on what shift I get, rather it be early from 7-4 or late from 2-11, there are different tasks that need to be completed.  Early morning tasks are to get the store running and prepared for the day.  I'll hold a morning huddle with department heads to pass out reports (sales, out-of-stocks, Front-End Que, OSAT) and discuss these reports with them.  Also, a store walk is performed, which consist of collecting go-backs, straightening the store and displays as I go, checking on departments to make sure they are set on time, have the correct things on display, etc.   The late shift routine is basically keeping it all together.  A second store walk needs to be performed.  Check on departments to make sure things are running well and go over the closing procedures for each department.  Of course, I deal with employees problems and concerns.  Management is here to make sure company initiatives are implemented correctly, rather it be from an operational or merchandising position, and to ensure that our associates are following the best practices.  Currently I would rate the enjoyment of my career at a 7.  The biggest plus to my career is the opportunity for advancement within the company.  In my time here at Kroger I have learned how to better analyze and make use of reports to achieve positve and sustained results within the operation.  I have also been able to refine my managerial skills and have learned new ways to empower and motivate my associates.  I really enjoy the interactions that I get to have with my customers and associates. Nothings hard"
good,"At first starting out it tend to be a fun job, but mostly its on how management is run."
good,"Has benefits such as tuition reimbursement, not much room for advancement. Work all different hours, no set schedule. Okay job for student"
good,"I work in a small community where everybody knows everybody and we have some kind of relationship with most of our customers. My co-workers and l are like one big happy family who works together for the good of our customers, while building life long friendships with each other."
good,"I learned How to Handle Large Amounts Of Money ."
good,"A typical day at this store drains you. The amount of work they expect you to achieve while pulling your attention in a million different directions is staggering. They fill your day with meaningless paperwork if you stock, thus defeating the purpose of stocking quickly or effectively. I was a Drug/GM clerk and I spent up to half of my work week bailing the front end out when they were busy. But much of the problem with them maintaining customer flow was self-inflicted. The company appointed a ""front end manager"" who spent much of the day doing little to nothing aside from telling people what to do for probably $8/hour. The front end manager was not allowed to run a register or bag so you essentially had a useless person up there ready to cry wolf at a moments notice. This understandably led to some discourse between the front end and stock workers (who were trying to get their work done). I would still be held accountable for work I would be unable to finish because of the vast amount of time I had to spend on the register. The stress was unbearable for most of my co-workers. "
good,"Supervise  cashiers on the floor, day to day and give breaks."
good,"My coworkers were awesome, the work is hard but doable, overall a fun place to work besides a few manangement personnel."
good,Kroger like many retail oriented places pays you little but demands alot
good,"I stocked shelves third shift to get some extra money, good group of people I worked with but didn't need to work there for long."
good,only had an internship here. staff was welcoming and helpful. pharmacy was clean and up to standards. organized in operations and systems. salary was not what I was looking for.
good,"This job has very flexible hours, which is great because you can work around just about all schedules, school, home, another job etc."
good,"Great place to shop, The management was fair. Baggers operate the entire store."
good,"After clocking in I would do the duties the Floor Manager would schedule me for: Cash drawer counts, customer service, making sure the lines stay short and people are helped, working a register, cash handling and working the self check out machines. The hardest part of the job was customers who would argue for a certain price regardless if we knew the price of the item. I had fun interacting with the customers and other employees."
good,"I learned so much. I was how to engage customers, problem solve, how accounting works in a retail setting, how to interact with different personalities."
good,"I do not think working for the Kroger company is awful in general, simply that my personal experience working there wasn't very pleasant. I had a supervisor and manager who didn't organize things very well or communicate well (and were both re-assigned shortly after I left) and the bakery/deli where I worked was very under staffed so everyone was always asked to do the job of two or more people. Sometimes only one person would be in each section, having to do stock work, and custom orders, as well as assist any customers that came by, and were often chastised when we were unable to do all of these during our shifts. A day of organization and a bit more staff would have easily fixed any problems I had with my position. I also didn't realize that my employee discount was never applied to my shopping card until nearly the week I left because no one explained how it was supposed to be showing up on the cash register so I never noticed. They were not very diligent about making sure their employees were educated on store procedures, policies, and benefits."
good,Early morning hours waking up about 3am. The hardest part is working weekends all the time.
good,Union dues along with low pay after 3 years of working made it completely not worth it
good,"Our main focus is making sure the customer gets through our check out lane with friendly and fast service. We make sure we have one customer checking and one customer waiting before we open another lane. We make sure to engage with our customers that come across the the front end and through out the store by smiling, greeting, and engaging with every customer we come in contact with."
good,"It was a great place to work but, after a year it just didn't feel like it was a career"
good,It was a stepping stone in my life. Lots of great people to work with but was not a fan of the job itself.
good,Kroger had horrible communication and the managers did not always work with there employees. Everything was a mess and there were many misunderstandings. Sure you would have good days but there were more bad days. The pay was not good and you had to work 50 hours a week for a nice check.
good,"at first a good place to work but then you come to see that they are all about money they dont care about there workers nor coustomers, mannagers do not talk well with each other so you will have 3 of them asking you to get something done at the same time and they dont take no for an asnwer, no familey time at all"
good,"I liked my job at one time, but with the declining economy and the all mighty dollar in control it makes it more difficult. Having any restrictions at all means you won't get very many hours. Not being full time means you won't get many hours. Generallly its hard to make a career out of kroger if you don't plan on moving up. I was a studnet and really needed the hours but am not allowed to get full time because of my restrictions. This gave me less hours and eventually lead me to not be able to afford to go to back to school."
good,"I started at krogers as just a bagger, within 2 weeks i was also a surge checker. at two months i was recruited into maintanence work and that was very suitable for me. i thought i was doing well, and several of the management spoke well of me. but one of the managers, a new hire from a different store, said that my performance had deteriorated just as almost every othe manager thought i was doing well. she probably disliked me because i got hurt, and missed work. if i didnt have a doctors note, i maybe would have been fired. its sad because i had faith in my superiors but after i came back to work to find my hours cut down, i lost the trust. i never felt secure at the job again. i still do a good job, i work more than one position daily. i work any schedule from 7am to 12midnight. but i guess i just wanst lucky. i will miss some of the friendly coworkers i have should i not continue to work there."
good,It is great company to work for. Unfortunately as you work your way up you may find that senior employees hold too much power with their seniority. Some days you work as a team and others you get no help at all. The greatest part is the low cost healthcare benefits you receive as a full time employee.
good,From the time I had worked there to the the day before I quit was the worse job experience I have had yet. They hire very young employees that don't want to work and don't do the job right. Also they tell you you're getting benefits when they're actually taking it away from those who had already been there.They just don't want to pay for it. Also they are very unorganized..even the adults will stand around and socialize rather than work.
good,"I was a grocery manager for 4 years. Kroger is held back by the union , in my opinion. Everything is based off seniority, with set pay tables. "
good,"In the two months I was employed with Kroger I was not impressed with their benefits package, or their job advancement."
good,Ok to work for but we had our differences did not like the fact that they let me go when i was on disabilty
good,I would go in at 2 p.m. and work until 10 p.m. During my work shift I would just put away freight and help customers if needed. After I was finished with my stocking i would go back and zone my area until my scheduled time to leave. I learned about the importance of stocking the correct medicines in the correct places and product rotation. Management was very professional and wanted to know what tasks we had to do and know when once finished. My co- workers were older than me at the time but nice and helped me out whenever I needed. The hardest part of the job was the labor part of unloading the truck and sorting out what was my departments and other departments. The most enjoyable part was working with my friends who were in other departments.
good,"A typical day at work consists of breaking down a dairy/frozen load. The dairy/frozen department is always understaffed so to complete tasks we always have to hustle. "
good,"I took this job when I  was at school at DeVry Institute of Technology in Columbus, OH.  I bagged groceries in this place and gathered carts from those cart corrals.  I left when I had to drop out of school."
good,"Making people happy for what they are getting ,"
good,"I made sure that product was full and neat, that it was coming in at a timely manner and that customers were satisfied. I really loved my co-workers."
good,"I bagged the groceries, I didn't particularly like this job and I had a problem with one of the managers, She always got on me and was always mad about something. She really tried to get me in trouble."
good,The best part of the job was working on the Register. I love working with the machines.  The customers were very nice to me.  Some of the Managers were a little strange but nice. 
good,"Department management was fantastic, however, corporate management had no idea how to run the maintenance department effectively.  Most times upper management used threats and intimidation tactics to try and motivate employees.  However, my mechanical skills imporved greatly, due to the diverse amount of equipment that was worked on.  Stress levels became too much to live with because of the continuously added responsibility implemented by corporate and upper management."
good,"A typical day at work goes by very fast, I've lot a lot about running and maintaining a fuel center, I've mastered my customer service skills here, I've also built very strong leadership because I've been trained by great people. Management is great to work with most of the time. When it comes to breaks... well we don't get them maybe an occasional bathroom break which sometimes we wait for up to two hours for a washroom break. The hardest part of the job is trying to keep up with management and who has what rules. My favorite part of the job is building and maintaining relationships with the employees and customers."
good,Kroger is a very productive company. We are trained to work at a fast pace and we are taught that good customer service is the number one thing to strive for in the store. There is always something to do yet you never know what hours you are working for the next week until the end of the week of. Benefits are wonderful for part time employees. Overall an okay company to work for.
good,Great Position for who ever wants to stay in the retail industry.
good,"Great benefits for employees, Great people work there , made new friends, time conserving"
good,Company is a leading contender in the retail business.  Excellent marketing and merchandising strategies.
good,it a job where teenagers starts I was one of the oldest one who works there ...nuff said
good,"Great part time job for 7 years, loved my coworkers and customers."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to give the customer satisfaction. 
good,"A normal day was to come into work in the afternoon, to prepare any orders for pick up along with taking care of customers that would approach the counter. be prepared for the evening crowd that came in  along with the nightly cleaning of the deli area."
good,average work not much to say really.  i stood in one spot for 10 hrs. 
good,very secure job just not a lot of advancement not a good life work balance
good,"The work-day pace can vary depending on the time of your shift-you have to be prepared for a very fast pace, as the work ebbs and flows. The management changes quite often at the store, which can cause inconsistencies in scheduling, hours, etc.It depends on your store-some are good, helpful managers, not afraid to help out on the floor, while others simply turn their noses up, choosing instead to chill upstairs, even the floor is packed. Co-workers are pretty friendly, mostly agreeable people, yet at the same time, your coworkers can make the job very difficult-lazy younger workers can cause everyone to have to pick up the slack, with very little to no consequences to them. This causes disorganization and unnecessary stress. What I enjoyed is the flexibility of the days you work."
good,great customers and management needed to try and give better chances to possible employees to advance in management.
good,"Kroger was pretty cool. Easy work, good benefits. They don't give you any hours but overall it was ok."
good,"Unload truck, separate merchandise in Freezer. Take sorted merchandise to sales floor and stock in a timely manner. Scan backstock and adjust counts as needed. Print stocking reports and inventory adjustments. Block shelves and endcaps. Make an order, check lows. Clean up aisle and Frozen area as needed."
good,Kroger over all is a great company and I would work for them again. However if management does not support good work ethic the job flat out sucks. My former supervisor would be nice in public but behind closed doors she would show her true colors
good,"A typical day involved getting to work, and immediately working on customers. I learned to work in a Deli and Bakery, also the Bistro. The hardest part of the job was that a manger took a disliking to me for reasons that were never discussed, The most enjoyable was when I was placed on the Magic Pop machine I was able to be more independent and take the job into my own hands."
good,* Supervises and directs the operation of the total store to ensure the Customer First culture.
good,wish i got the chance to learn more is the only bad thing i have to say.
good,"I did enjoy working in a deli yes there was times when it was hard but you learn as you go along. I enjoyed helping the customers, and i even enjoyed doing some of the cooking,"
good,I have learned a lot since working with Roundy's. I have obsereved and absorbed knowledge of the retail world. Roundy's does expect a lot from thier employees and may be somewhat too demanding of their employees with expectations and when we can have off.
good,Update information almost every month with a reminder on a yearly basis is a part of the typical work time. Co-workers are respected people of all age group and are team players. Engaging with customers of different personalities and experiences is an enjoyable part of the job.
good,Rude inner city employees and customers.
good,"Working up front, the supervisor was sexist against men and always had his little high school females up front at customer service even though I had more experience and more qualifications than them. The management was corrupt and showed favoritism. Ever since I quit there, after 3 dreadfully long years, I refuse to return to that store in hopes that I never have to see them ever again."
good,"I worked for the Kroger company during my teenage years and it was an enjoyable place to work at overall. Benefits are amazing(or were when I was employed), pay is meager, management is fair, and there is a really good management program within the company. Scheduling flexibility is some of the best I have ever seen and management is willing to work with their employees. The company is also Union. The only bad thing about the company is the low pay and part-time status, which is extremely hard to get out of. It takes many years to gain full-time status and this is the reason why I chose to end my employment with Kroger. Good job if you are in high school or need a part time job and great benefits."
good,There were not enough hours to be used to have adequate coverage during the days.
good,It's an ok place to work I just wish the pay was more and the hours was better.
good,"I usually start my day off reporting to my front end manager or acting supervisor in order to get a heads up on whats going on in the front end of the store and also outside of the store. Things I need to know to get my work day started: Who is the manager on duty, If we have enough help to get us through the work day, cashiers and courtesy clerks currently on break, courtesy clerks on the lot, courtesy clerks doing go backs, and utility clerks doing utility work. By knowing these few little details I am able to take over and begin supervising the front end. What I have learned during my six years working at kroger is how to be patient, courteous, and more social with people. Our management team works together to provide the highest quality service and products for our customers to ensure they are highly satisfied. Most of my co-workers are enjoyable to work with. I have never really had any problems with any of them once I got to know their different personalities. The hardest part of this job is of course dealing with the customers and knowing how to handle certain situations where the customer is not being nice. The most enjoyable is developing almost family like relationships with the customers mostly the regulars where you know them by name and can have a nice casual conversation. This interaction with the customer helps the day go by a lot smoother and makes the customer feel more welcomed."
good,"Kroger was a nice place to work, although I had to leave the position due to surgery on my hands. I felt the workers were not paid as well as they should be, it was a very demanding position."
good,It was a nice play to work each day i worked it was relaxing and everyone got along with one another and i also liked that i could work at my own pace.
good,meet and greet customers and make sure they found everything they were looking for
good,"it was actually a great experiance for me, when i first arrived i was hte only young person working there but when i left they had hired multiple people on my account."
good,"Basic stocking and moving of palates of products from docking bay to down stacking, organised and moved consistently. Plenty of work, to keep one moving at all times. Work is overseen by managers and supervisors, requires excellent teamwork skills and to be proactive at all times."
good,you work for a union. and the pay is okay. the management there is really great and they are understanding
good,Very busy company. I learned how to manage a large department and brushed up on my customer service skills.
good,Roundys is a good company to work for if you are a person with a higher power and is able to get some were in the business
good,I pretty much just stocked shelves while employed here.
good,The company discriminates on promotione. The working conditions are lacking respect for workers.
good,I would that Kroger a F beacsue the people wasn't at the post when customers come looking for them and I have to take on their part in the store and to get the people what they wanted and then do my part as a cashier and bagged there food.
good,"I worked here for 4 years, and never obtained a raise when eligible. If you're still in school, it may be good. But personally, there are many jobs far more worth while."
good,Kroger was a great company its just you get pay good but you get no hours there.
good,"The company is going through a big transition from making a product in which they produced for over 30 years, to several products in which they had never made before. The food industry has pretty strict standards, and Owens is having a hard time adhering to these standards at the present moment. The company is still in beer bottle mode, and having quite a hard time with the transition. It can be quite stressful at times, wondering whether your job is there in the future. I am just looking for a more stable solid future for myself."
good,I loved my job at Ralphs but they loved to cut corners from everything from scheduling to rules and regulations. I wouldnt not recommend the deli to anyone.
good,You have to be able to work all kinds of hours. It's hard balancing work and home with this job. You only know your schedule week to week.
good,It is a nice place to work. There is always new things to learn.Management is always up beat willing to listen.The hardest part is tring to get eight hours of work done in four hours.People i work with are nice and compermizing like if you need a day off that you are scheuld someone will trade a day with you.It is very hard to get full time.
good,There was considerable Favoritism at smiths and it was difficult to move to another department. It was always challenging Nd new. Some managers were difficult to work with
good,"A typical day here is basically providing efficient customer services. I've learned the importance of dealing with customers working here. However, management is far from the best. My fellow co-workers falls under one of two categories: driven or lazy. The hardest part about this job is that we're punished for doing wrong more than we're complimented for doing right. On the other hand, the joys I get from this job is working with some employees that are eager to help out and able to choose my desired time to work."
good,"This is a decent company to work for, great benlefits, shaky on company policies, they keep changing from day to day. The merchandise is ok, I was disappointed when they went from mid to high end jewelry to sterling silver and lab created stones."
good,would not choose as first choice. will shoot you in the back when you are not an asset when they see as a liability
good,"The pay relative to workload is insufficient, as with all minimum wage jobs. Large company that preys on the uneducated for essentially free labor - large portions of small wages are returned to the company in the form of it being a preferred shopping location since you're already there. Nothing to be done about it because every position is easily replaceable. This is exemplified by the fact that rather than giving current employees more hours, new people are hired. Overtime - regardless of the quality of one's work - is frowned upon because paying that extra 4 bucks an hour would seriously cut into the higher-ups' overflowing wallets. That said, as far as minimum wage jobs go, it's not really any different from the rest."
good,I worked as a front end clerk (cashier). I also helped bag groceries and was eventually asked to help set up sales on Sunday nights.
good,Very flexible with your schedule as long as you are not in management position.
good,First job. Enjoyed working with co workers and gaining customer service skills.
good,"I started out as a cashier/bagger and with in 3 months I was working 3 different departments until they put me on night stock. I really enjoyed my job for the most, part not to stressful. Pretty much everybody got a long. The most enjoyable part of this job was helping the customers find what their looking for."
good,I was able to go to school and obtain my Medical Billing and Coding degree.
good,Hot and tiring
good,"when i was there i was a jack of all trades there. i use to push carts in, clean, stock, and put displays up"
good,Good job it's just that everyone in retail are cutting hours.
good,"What I learned from Kroger,was how to be a manager.I learned a variety of managerial styles,skills and tools."
good,filled prescriptions typically. Learned how to input prescriptions into data base. co-workers were great. no real hard parts. overall enjoyable though.
good,"The work is not horrible, repetitive but not overwhelming. Granted as long as we are given bodies to help get the work done which does not always happen sadly. I personally enjoy the people I work with, they are hard workers and good people. It is the opening management I do not like or most of the early/mid day workers. I have learned as promising and safe a grocery store is, working freight may put some things in perspective for you. It sure did for me. The most difficult thing about this job is the hours, if I could do what I do right now from 4 or 5 Am till 2 or 3 in the afternoon I would not be looking for another job. I enjoy the sense of freedom while working because no customers are around to bother me so I can focus on the work at hand and get done what needs to be done. Sure enough the workers during the day are not going to do it."
good,The company is very diversity and opportunity to advance within the company.
good,I really enjoyed being able to work independently. It really gave me the chance to be accountable for my actions.
good,"Was overall a very good store,stayed clean and up to date...but management was horrible.In my opinion management did not use their authority the way it should have been used.By being there for over six months i gained the knowledge of how to use the cash register,interact with people on a daily basis',and bag and clean grocery's.My co-workers were more than amazing they were more helpful than moth managers.I would say the hardest part of my job was learning the store and everything in it and where it all needed to be,the easiest part of my day would have to be scanning the grocery's and conversing with the customers everyday."
good,"Loved working here for the most part. Would glaze donuts, set out bread to be baked for the next day, set out donuts for the next day..."
good,guests are very delightful but associates are lazy and disrespectful
good,"While focusing on core values & safety, management frequently fails to follow through (ie, address issues, communicate information/results on a timely basis, even admit when mistakes occur). The fact that mgmt doesn't ""own up"" sets morale within the plant. It's all talk and no action."
good,i liked working here when busy didnt like having to stand around when we were slow
good,The company was ok. They only care for the job and will do any sort of negative action to their employes to do so. So if someone is looking for a job where you want to be treated badly and still work then this is the job for you.
good,I would like to advance my career in warehousing and take a step out into a new field.
good,"I worked in the retail portion i.e. not as a cashier or bagger. I primarily handled apparel. The job was easy, sometimes to the point of being mind-numbing or feeling like there was no point to me being there. I had no issues with the job or most managers but some of the managers were thoroughly unpleasant to deal with."
good,"I learned a lot working here, I worked very hard, and  learned to do the manager's of the departments job, such as ordering supplies, performing inventory, and putting up stock"
good,I worked a Kroger for many years it was a steady job when the kids where young. although the schedule didn't always let me spend the time I would like with the family.
good,"It was a good first job I would recommend it for anyone starting out. You have to be ready to work as a team and work with customers on the regular. Also at my position you had to work in any weather rain,snow, or hail."
good,"really just mass chaos everyday, not enough staff, constant management changes and very little support, all kinds of extra tasks without any extra support or resources allotted."
good,"The company is very repetitious. Meaning, if you get on, you do the same thing every day and it tends to get boring. Not very challenging in the everyday work experience. I would not work at this company again."
good,This is not cool you guys are making me put a review for every job that comes up I don’t really feel like doing it’s already hard enough trying to get a job this is just irritating
good,This job is A unfairly treated job low pay not enough hours given they don’t have bonuses or holiday pay not willing to give you a raise or in everyone at the job is not worried about the job there worry about personal business
good,The people are very welcoming and polite. A average work day is filled with smiles and good mornings from all employees and costumers. They are flexible with your schedule and the management is really easy to communicate with as well.
good,"I loved it at first and then after the 3 months grace period, it went downhill. The co-workers were super sweet to me as I was new, and then once I started doing more, they didn’t like me as much. Management was constantly telling me I wasn’t doing my job even though I was actually doing mine and other peoples work."
good,"Knowledge of assigned tasks."
good,Its was nice learning how to prep the food. Serving samples to people and persuade them ti buy was fun. Working at kroger you can learn a few good characteristics that you can carry in life
good,Pay real low for employment. Working only part time. Employ that work there a awesome. Work can be overload sometime and barely get help. If i am a student i would work there.
good,It’s a good place for young people to start working at some stay as they get older but it’s a very easy job I liked working there just wasn’t making a lot.
good,This job was fine. I have no complaints about the work. Got along with my co workers and suggested you apply if there's an opening for the meat department
good,I rather talk in person. If you have any more questions please email me or give me a call. Again I feel more comfortable we talk in person. Have a good day.
good,Too many carts and only one person per cart schedule every hour sometimes call at any time to come in for another worker.Vacations every year If you can work 8 hours there is two breaks and a lunch.
good,Flexible work hours and job Sercuity with Kroger. Great opportunities to advance within the company to multiple different positions. Management is always willing to help others.
good,The pay is normal if your full time. Part time you get paid next to nothing. Expect to always be understaffed be expected to perform more than the expected company requirements.
good,"It's a decent place for a first job for anyone looking to get started, but I personally wouldn't really stay long. I had the feeling we were understaffed, so we ended up getting so much work piled up. I'd honestly improve by hiring 1-2 more people and it'd be pretty nice."
good,"Kroger is great place to work at and The pay is ok it could be better. They are willing to cross train you in different departments such as courtesy Clerk, cashier, bakery/deli, and more. Management is ok"
good,Lots of time to move up. If you do not suck up good luck. Most of the department coordinators only promote people the befriend. I didn't agree with mine so I was never promoted outside if training my own customer service manager.
good,"As Sous Chef, I enjoyed and appreciated Kroger allowing me to express myself, our community, sporting events, etc. within the Chef Case. It made my job enjoyable and our customers loved it."
good,"A place in the company is like a place in a family outside your home. "
good,The management did not do well with listening to availability. They did not post schedules at a regular time. I bagged and was a cashier. It was an easy position but could be hard at times standing for that long.
good,"The main reason that I, and most other employees stayed at Kroger, was because of their extremely affordable health insurance.  Management there is hit or miss. If you stay with the company long enough, you are guaranteed to work under several different managers.  They are also a union based company, so if you survive the first 90 days, it is very hard to lose your job.  Good job security and benefits, for full time employees at least."
good,"I stock all night, what's the big deal an all the question about this job?- still there, still looking for a day job period.  Now tell me about your company."
good,while working there my personal experience was that I got stuck working the late shift more than not keeping me away from my family instead of the rotating shifts it started out to be.
good,It’s okay. There is a lot of busy work they put you through rather than actually letting you do what you have to. The management is sub-par but they leave you alone if you work.
good,Co-workers were enjoyable. The pay was not good but I learned a lot as it was my first job. Learned a lot about customer service and business. Would recommend to someone who is looking for a first job.
good,"I needed 20 hours a week. Kroger has gone out of their way to be very flexible to suit my scheduling needs. The only downside is I feel I'm somewhat discriminated against. I'm somewhat older, and I'm not included in with a lot of the hi tech parts of the job, that many younger co-workers perform."
good,"I worked as a Cashier/Bagger and also a stockroom worker for Vail, CO City Market and I thought it was a great job overall I got to learn the differences between departments and different management. Since the store is so small you get to know everyone in the store and everyone treats you like a family because Kroger is really good at making everyone feel welcomed weather a worker or customer."
good,"I felt as though the pay wasn't enough for all of the different tasks that needed to be filled. I'd expect at least two more dollars. However, the people were lovely and I felt like I belonged with them."
good,"Kroger was my first job and it was a great experience, I started off as a bagger then i learned how to be a cashier. After my first year i moved up to the Meat Department and Dairy Department"
good,Job was easy and was good pay for job asked little unfair with letting me go was on short notice and had no reason for letting me go would work there agian
good,"asst.manager responsible for day to day merchandising ,ordering, training,safety values as provided by Kroger. Uphold cleanliness of produce department. Cross-train in other departments ."
good,"Kroger gave me quite a bit of retail experience. Also, it showed me how to work with people. The corporate level employee didn't always have the workers backs."
good,My typical workday usually consists of coming in to work with an optimistic attitude but being immediately rained upon by the spoiled and entitled customers.
good,Kroger was a good place to work although it had its moments. The benefits were great and the pay was fair. It would have been wonderful if they treated your hard work like it was valued.
good,I worked there for four months and was never officially put on a schedule. When interviewed I gave them my availability and told them I would be out of town in Missouri for Christmas they scheduled me to work and I told them I couldn’t come in but when I returned my availability would remain the same. They never put me back on the schedule.
good,"Overall my experience there was not terrible. I was able to gain great friendships with my co-workers. My department manager was a great guy, but had a very non-flexible schedule which made it difficult while attending college. Yet, great guy and he is willing teach you if you are willing to learn."
good,My time at kroger was very short. Would it have been a good career for me. I dont reappy think so it was an ok job at the end of it all i can say this. It was a job.
good,"Working at Kroger was not a hard job however, the management was very poor and it seemed like the managers did not care how you felt. There has been times where I’ve went to the manager to talk about personal things and was told to get out of their face. I keep how I feel on the inside and they rarely show. When I had to quit due to me moving there were things I wanted to say for people and things I wanted to say for people and things I wanted to say for myself but I still chose to be respectful but I will never work there again."
good,I like my job and happy come to work with people at work and the customer. but  I want something better and change job and different   and make more money.
good,All that you see cashier's do at Kroger is all you will do. If you enjoy greeting people and repetition then by all means apply. Expect to have your schedule changed without your Knowing as well.
good,"My time at Kroger was cool. It was my first job and I had a good time working there for the most part due to having great co-workers. I didn't get paid as much as I would've liked and management could've been a little better, but it was really just a bad area in the city."
good,"Don’t work well with school kids and doesn’t give you your desired schedule that would work for you"
good,Friendly people who shops at Krogers as well respective! Glad it was helpful employees that work as a team. Adorable talking to regulars and new people. Happy to serve people and get new experience
good,I learned so much from this company. They taught me about good customer service. The  employees wore blue t- shirt. The hardest part of my job was bringing the carts out of the parking lot.
good,Kroger is an easy place to work u just have to play your position because there’s everything else covered you just have to worry In keeping fresh products
good,"They Very Friendly Well Understanding Kind,Polite,I Liked It There Even Tho There Training Sucks I Was There For A Month And Was Fired For Stupidity But Other Then That It Was Okay"
good,"I started working at kroger when i was just fifteen years old. I made many great friends many of which I am still friends with along with. Overall, it was great first working experience that I took many useful tips out of."
good,There are many departments within the company to prosper in your career. Also many opportunities  to move up within the company and benefits for your family.
good,"This was my first job when I was 17 and it was a great opportunity to learn how the corporate world works while also earning money for my first car. However, I don't recommend staying at this job long as it gets tedious once you know everything and there's nothing new to learn."
good,Good place to work some really good people and some other people kind of odd a lot of cold departments so carful what  direction you move towards can be fun environment.
good,I personally have a problem with some of the customers that come in and complain about things I have no control over. The department I work in could also use some tweaking.
good,Working in produce I mostly did a lot of stocking and making sure the product was fresh for the customers. The hardest part of the job was making sure all out reports and task were done while filling up out section of the store. I enjoyed seeing my regular customers and helping them out in any way I could.
good,"Working at Kroger was a good first job experience."
good,It was my first job so pretty standard. Got trained in every position when working there and the only real bad days were when I got stuck as a bagger or when management decided they wanted things stocked differently and breathed down the back of every ones necks
good,Working there sucked you never had scheduled breaks your schedule would change non stop throughout the week. You were never allowed to miss work for school functions
good,"My time at Dillons varied by location massively.  When working in a smaller environment it can be sorta pleasant, listening to the radio on the speakers as the aisles are organized.  It's nice seeing the same people come by as you start to build a relationship with the costumers.  As for the bigger Dillons, it is busy, busy, busy!  I often never got time to interact with the customers, and there never seemed to be a dull moment, much less a peaceful one.  While it was nice being busy at first, I never got the sense that I was appreciated, especially when I would lean against the counter for a minute to take a break and immediately get lightly chewed for slacking from the supervisor.  It was this neglect that influenced me to leave when I had finally had enough.  If you can find a small quiet Dillons, then I would highly recommend working there, anyplace bigger will only be half as good."
good,The pharmacy had a lot to offer but it was not flexible enough. The hours varied the pay wasn't reasonable for the work necessary. Other than those things great experience
good,"The people I work with are like a family we’re very busy and fill up to 300+ prescriptions a day. I answer phones, help customers, count and bottle prescriptions, enter scripts into the computer, call dr offices, do shelf counts, work the drive thru."
good,I did not agree with such low wages and having to pay union dues on top of it. The people are ok. I just didn’t make enough to get myself ahead and accomplish my goals.
good,Alright job depending in what department you're in. Can take some years to reach top pay. Not the best to employees and high turnover rate. Not strict on tardys.
good,"While at times there is more hustle necessary to achieve all metrics, the work is very mundane. Not much creative thought or variability from day to day operations."
good,It was a wonderful work environment. With a few hiccups here and there. Had interesting employees and customers that were wonderful to work with and manage.
good,"Kroger is a great company with great employees"
good,a lot of loading and unloading heavy product.  Never enough staff. Very fair for time off and the benefit are wonderful. the discount also very good. closed for xmas
good,Typical day at work was stocking the shelves management was good most enjoyable part was being able to listen to music while working workplace culture was good enjoyed the people I worked with for the most part
good,They have there favorite the management if don't like you they will find a way to 🔥 you.That is how kroger works the works I like everyone help.You can retire from them.If they liked you. Dillon with costumer.
good,"In my time there I was treated poorly, I was accused of a lot of things and I was pushing my body and health way more than I should have been. Other than that most of my coworkers were nice and I loved seeing all the customers smile and hearing about their days."
good,"As far as the management position goes, you are scheduled 50 hours, paid salary and often work much more than that. The pay is decent but, being retail, you were most weekends and holidays. You are moved from store to store at the whim of the district manager, regardless of how far the drive."
good,When I originally started with Kroger it was a store with associates who felt like family and management who showed care and appreciation for a job well done. As the years have passed the company has slowly changed into only being concerned for the money it makes and if the customers are happy with no regards to whether employees are being treated well by supervisors or management.
good,Management never help with employees just say to do things. They will just stand around talking about unrelated work things while everyone else has to work hard.
good,Working at the store I did wasn't that great so I can I say to much on it. The company isn't bad just the store I worked in HS many issues that need fixed
good,"Pros= diverse workers, lots to do while you are there, you can learn all the positions, customer care, great employees work there."
good,The job itself was great I was the fastest cashier at this Kroger at this time and still made the customers smile.  The managment and other workers were really rude i worked there for a few months!
good,A typical day at work would be get your skids off the dock get them to the isle they need to go to and get them done before the store opens. I learned that it’s very important to have the isles looking nice for the customers. The management was great they were always there when you needed help. The store didn’t have any culture. The hardest part of the job was getting your skids done before the store opened
good,"The place is always looking to raise the standard.  But there are few areas that just dont make sense, the training has went out the window which makes employees really unhappy.  Un-happy employees equals unhappy customers.  We are in a society that gets emotionally hurt by unsual situations.  So in customer service you have to let things roll off your shoulders and move on.  The Company says they care about their employees, but doesnt give them the benefit of truly speaking their case before a real decision is made by the corporate folks.  The corporate only notices the customers' feedback and not thier employees."
good,i enjoy kroger but it is a starter job and it is a very demanding job due to being understaffed. Management is good but has extremely high standards due to kroger being a corporate entity. it is a very friendly and social environment that allows you to make friends easily.
good,"Ive enjoyed working at kroger, they give me close to 40 hours a week and the work environment was very friendly. My only problem with working there is seeing baggers/stockers with no experience being hired in at $2 more an hour than i make after ive already received a raise."
good,Good place to work. Great benefits. Fast paced. The people are great. The prices are good and Kroger gives you the experience that makes you want to return.
good,it taught me alot about working in a team setting and finishing the task at hand on time. I also acquired a number of different skill sets from kroger
good,Really friendly office staff understanding an caring other friendly workers but some like night management always tried an override the office personel.. Causing chaos an aggervations
good,"Kroger Pharmacy is very high paced. You have to have patience and excellent customer service skills. Also teamwork is a big factor when working in a retail pharmacy, so you have to be a team player."
good,"Wished the manger would understood what I was going though."
good,"I HIGHLY reccomend kroger if you truly wish to spend your life in a grocery store. They offer the highest topout pay and the best benefits(80/20). It does however take about 8 years to reach that lovely topout. They manage their hour allocation really poorly though and lower sq footage stores get boned hard when it comes to labor, as they could move more than anyone in the state and get 1/5 the hours to do it. Good otherwise."
good,It was a fine place to work.  The store was just opening.  It was slow at first but grew.  This is a great place to work for your first job.  Nice place to get basic skills.
good,"The management does not listen to your availability at all, I have to do school work and they were working me 40 hours a week without being full-time."
good,Store was a friendly but high stress work enviorment as it was during the regrand opening that I was working there.  There was too much responsibilities put on all of the workers who were paid to little
good,Kroger’s is nice relaxing place and can be stressful sometimes on busy days but a lot of time it can be ok but I would recommend my friends and family to work here
good,Kroger has been a great job for me for the past couple of years. My team and I work quickly to get product out on the sale's floor while having plenty of laughs together.
good,"Employees had to make sure that the customers got what they needed in do time, but also that each employee had freshly rotated stock to do so with. Employees had to be on their toes and always ready to do something to help either the customer or fellow employees."
good,My deli manager was great. The management over the store as whole was a problem. I was fired after three weeks because i talked to my customers too much. I then needed SNAP benefits and needed them to sign a paper to say I no longer work there. I was given excuse one after the other. I finally got a signature after 1 month and a half.
good,"Workplace culture changed dramatically after Kroger acquisition. Became very impersonal; felt like a ""number"" instead of an individual.  New management was condescending ."
good,An okay place to get a job. Pretty average place big management isn’t kinda sloppy and messy at times. Not to strict get more hours by coming in when they call not on the schedule.
good,Stressfull as you are in constant fear of losing your job. The average work day is about 10+ hours. You are constantly on your feet at least 9 hours per day.
good,Kroger isnt really a bad place to work for. Its the location and managers you have to look after. My location had horrible workers and managers. Krogers had some good benifits but you have to be in the right department to get them benifits
good,"Kroger is a good overall company, but of course has its flaws. I enjoyed myself while working there, most people were friendly and helpful, but others were not so up for it."
good,Job duties can vary day to day and is often very busy. There are many opportunities to transfer department within a national chain and many places throughout the United States to work.
good,It was. A great job. I would reccomend it easy to get along with other workers and the manager was a very nice peraon tbey helped me becone a better person for the incitement
good,"will miss some people, did not want to work with my hours after three years of working here with the company. I honestly didn’t want to leave and pushed work on me while i went to school. they had plenty of time to have someone take over my position"
good,I would love to just be out of Kroger working with adults I am very easy going and flexible. There is so many children Working there and I can do so much more. I don't want to settle if I can help it.
good,"Good job for the retail setting.  It was the best job ever until they changed their hourly policy.  Vacation policy is the worst, for example if I take a day off where I generally work 12 hours, I only get credit for 8 hours vacation time, so I essentially have to work an extra day to make up for a ""vacation day"""
good,"Great place, undervalued employees as work was eventually outsourced and everyone lost their jobs. Growing and stable company and would definitely recommend, I was unfortunate but very loyal to employees."
good,"Kroger is a friendly place to work and shop, they pay you well,they have great benefits,they even help pay for college.. I really had a great experience working with Kroger."
good,"My typical day went as such; I would walk in, clock in and get to the employ room to obtain a communication walkie talkie. Then I would seek out a PIC or the manager if they were in to find out about specific things they planned to be done for the day. If I was bagging that shift, I would then head to bagging. If I was not bagging I would go check restrooms, check the back of check stands to return products back to the sales counter, Check Cart lobbies and bring in carts, and interact with customers as needed to help them around the store."
good,Pretty ok.  Productive and busy workplace.  Not enough hours.  Not enough pay.  I basically moved baskets and carried groceries to the customer's cars.
good,I was glad I worked there and got experience but in the long run not something I wanted to make a career out of and not all of it was on Kroger. Most of it was the fact that it was retail but you also have to pick your locations well cuz transferring is a pain.
good,N/a ok place to work worked hard.work 7-430not much to say about it.hard to fill up 150 characters. Don.t like being forced into thisstill 20 more to go. Just filling up space
good,The work culture is pretty straightforward and to the point. There was not a lot of time to sit and talk to your coworkers as it was always busy and much work to be done.
good,"Depending on the Department you're working in the whole shift could be so busy and hectic or just moderately steady."
good,The people I worked with including management were all great people but no realistic advancement opportunities and the pay could've been better. Yeahh
good,"It was an okay experience working for kroger, they were not able to offer steady hours. Some weeks it would be alot others would be short and i would be on some mornings and some nights making finding a babysitter hard. Other then that it was okay."
good,"Let's be honest, if they'd just put a ping-pong table in the break room I don't think their employee turnaround would be so high. Every workplace can be improved with a leisurely ping-pong table."
good,"If you had a very good front desk personal the employees did not mind taking additional shift ."
good,it was ok. management sucked. they would walk by and tell you what to do but they never worked in that department. the job would have been ok but there were so many rules that actually stop being beneficial they just became ridiculous and burden
good,Working at Kroger I learned A lot I’ve learned to be patient and understanding I’ve learned how to Fried chicken I know that might sound Easy Frying chicken but It wasn’t keeping up with the temp logs and the books and all that but it was fun
good,Not nice to the customers  other employers  won't and employees were disrespectful  to customers  also and I didn't like how they treat people there..
good,It's good for benefits like health insurance. You meet a lot of good people working here too. They can teach you many new skills and you learn customer service.
good,"Store management treats regular employees like they are peons.  They put up signs NO OVERTIME NO EXCEPTIONS.  If you work over your scheduled hours to get your work done you have to take that time off elsewhere.  I was told the reason for that was it cut into their bonuses.  They were always running out of gloves, paper towels and trash bags.  You RARELY get weekend days off and the only people who are full time employees are managers. People who worked in customer service and the office got their birthdays announced over the loud speaker but no one else did.  People in Customer Service were shown HUGE favoritism.  I don't recommend working here at all."
good,I worked hard there and kept up the pace and liked some of the front end managers.The one thing that I had trouble with was the casiers were suppose to ruing up so many items a minute and if they didn't they would get in trouble.How that made it hard for me at times was the groceries would keep coming down to my end faster than I could load them.If I asked them to stop for a minute or 2 some would but others wouldn't.
good,I'm having scheduling conflicts therefore I'm looking for another job. I go to school fulltime and want to work part time but every week I get more hours
good,"I enjoyed working at Kroger off and on while I was attending college. It was a good job for the situation that I was in with being in school. Overall, this was a decent company to work for."
good,"Pros"
good,"For a first job, it's an alright one, but the flaws in scheduling and management generally show themselves very quickly. The pay is extremely lackluster, and the hours are extremely inconsistent and you may even get scheduled onto times you have unavailable, which inevitably results in call-ins."
good,"Constantly working 10 hours or more when scheduled for 8 hours monday through friday. Management is constantly changing the system and the way things are done. But, it pays decently, especially if you're picking or driving the lift truck."
good,"Schedules were unpredictable, some weeks working as few as 12 hours some as many as 39. Management was good. I was a student at the time and they understood when I needed fewer hours to work on school and accommodated me when I had to the time to work more. Pay was lower than similar jobs in the area, but was increased during the busier summer months."
good,"Girlfriend's dad got hurt at work pretty bad so I had to take a few days off to bring her to go see him a few states over and instead of getting people to cover for me, they threatened me with suspension."
good,"Kroger's is a nice place to work "
good,"If you enjoy working long hours and still only having the things that are wrong pointed out, Kroger is the place for you.  The pay is not bad, but the culture could use some work"
good,"A typical day at work includes handling money, interacting with customers and co workers and helping to provide a quality shopping experience for customers. This job has taught me how to be a better problem solver, how to engage with people and time management. Everyone is respectful of each other and ind and helpful to the customers. The hardest part of the job is dealing with upset customers but the most enjoyable part of the job is helping that customer and knowing that you made a difference in making their shopping trip fast, friendly and efficient."
good,I enjoy my part time job and my boss in Apparel was a very  considerate and  great person to work for.  For as management I give them a 4 rating. They do not take up for their workers. In Apparel we worked as a team. We all got a long with each other. I enjoy working for my boss in Apparel he was fair and did as much as he could got. his employees.
good,"for the 11 months that i worked at Kroger it was alright, i feel like management and supervisors could of done better by trying to get more people work apply for Kroger, we were low on staff and having to call people in that didn't work that day to come and fill peoples position"
good,"Kroger is always trying new things to stay on top of the competition. They will always push and strive for excellence and perfection, and do whatever they can to keep being on top."
good,It's a good job to have for if you need some work experience and a little money. It's a little tedious given the nature oft he job and dealing with customers can be frustrating.
good,It wasn’t a forever job. I was there for my teenage years. I started as a bagger and then moved to cashier. I did a little bit of everything in my three years there. I helped all over.
good,Okay place to work. Too many meetings about the same thing. The salary could be a whole lot better. Managers from other retail companies make far more.
good,Great company with family values. Good learning lessons and great value when it comes to learning customer service. If you needed something explained or didn't know how to work a machine they would gladly train you properly
good,"Sometimes it's very busy, and sometimes it's very slow. Sometimes it's really fun, and sometimes not so much. The team-members are the key factor there. They always make the day better."
good,"Kroger is a nice place to learn the basics of retail, but it’s not the type of job you want in adult life. There were many union fees that did not seem worth it. The pay wasn’t enough to save up for a car if I wanted to enjoy some of my money."
good,"The job itself wasn't bad, it was the environment. Managers were hardly seen and at times it felt like there should have been more help in the store because of how much was required to stock. All in all I would not work for them again unless they have a pay increase."
good,"I worked in the meat department and I enjoyed my time spent there. There were days that some customers that were frustrated or just rude made it tough, but the management team there was wonderful and most of the time responsive. Good first job to have and nice work environment."
good,Because the Covington store had so many problems we were stuck with not just people from latonia but from Taylor mill and Covington. It was hard because we could never take regular breaks and we would always be busy and understaff.
good,"not much to say about working here. it's the type of place you'd expect to work for if you don't have a collage degree. One perk though, unless you're a manager, you'll be in a union, so you'll get cheap and comprehensive health insurance that covers a lot."
good,"I like working their. Got along with not only the employees, but the customers as well.  Some nights it was okay working depending on how the day started."
good,"Typical day,come in walk through dept.,check inventory than condition dept. Customer service above anything else..cut meat/seafood.clean/sanitize dept. Management was ok but slow."
good,"You shouldn't come in with big expectations, it is a grocery store at face value and nothing shy of the sort once you actually get employed. most supervisors are willing to work with you when it comes to changing availability or needing time off."
good,The hours were great at first but would be cut back from week to week I couldn't depend on a set schedule from Week to week managers was not very helpful
good,Kroger need to pay their employees more money per hour. If a person have nothing else to say about the company then why do make them say something when they have nothing to say. Good Bye
good,It's a okay place to work. Just don't get injured because that's what happened to me and it's been a long drawn out process that has cost me my job of 12 years and 19 hour pay
good,"I've been at Kroger for 6 years, and I want to advance in my job but there is no opportunity to do so. I want to advance in a company, and Kroger isn't it."
good,"The job is easy. It pays a little over minimum wage. The management was the only issue I had with working there. It can be a lot of work, but once you learn how everything works, it goes by quickly."
good,"Kroger does let the firemen come set up for cheerfund,do fund raiser for riley.cancer walk.relay for life participation.trick or treating for kids,santa visits"
good,"Most management had trouble communicating with their employees about basic things they required from us. Only a handful of good managers that I met while working there. The job was fun, but management made it stressful."
good,The work environment is very fast paced. The job itself isn't challenging but the constant stocking is. The workers are friendly and share in the struggle of the job. I learned how to have good task management and maintain a food safe environment.
good,Needs to improve in the company. Management needs to improve. There are lack of achievements. Work is very under appreciated and a lot of hard work goes unnoticed.
good,In the beginning I was not getting paid much for all the work I was doing. Then we all got a raise and that helped but the managers were getting tiring and it started to suck going to work.
good,"As a pharmacy tech, I would assist pharmacist and patients with medication."
good,Worked there for awhile but glad to be moving on with my life. Working in a union was enjoyable but almost impossible to get into contact with the union rep.
good,I loved working at my store and building relationships with the customers. The store I worked at was very good but wouldn’t only let managers have a guarantee 40 hours a week.
good,"It is alright to work there at first. Then you get tired of the same repetitive work. The managers try to control everything, and the customers are annoying. Fast paced, short breaks."
good,"I think it depends on the location of which store you are working at. I believe my location is poorly run, but as I visited other locations they seemed to be in a better position."
good,"A typical work day is good I like the flow"
good,I find the union system there stifling. I do not have key tools to motivate others. I find the workers to be of poor quality. Senior management is unwilling to enforce rules. Work is physical demanding
good,I had a very good boss.  Liked the long-term customers.  Safety was very much stressed through out the store.  Our store manager had been there long term.  He set the example for us all.
good,"If you are looking for a job to work during school, this is a great one to have. If you like a fast paced environment and customer service, I definitely recommend working here. Unfortunately, courtesy clerks (baggers) have a pretty demanding job and aren’t compensated fairly. Minimum wage with no opportunity for a raise. If you’re looking to move up, it’s a good job."
good,they don't like to hire a lot of full time help. managers make very little compared to the responsibilities and hours required. moving up can be tedious.
good,"Was one of the first people to work in the new at the time Click List, and it was a decent enough first job. Was really fast paced and they would call me in one a week to once every other week."
good,"In training the executives paint a beautiful picture of the company. However, in reality everyday can be trying physically or mentally depending on the demands of the day."
good,"a typical day at work is relax most of time, dealing with rude customers is the hardest part of the job, but coworkers are nice and fun to work with, you can learn a lot of thing there"
good,They tell you that there flexable with scheduling but once you're hired the schedule is ridiculous also try to overwork you not enough baggers or cashiers
good,I personally say it depends on the store you get too. I worked for the Preston and Campbell that is an amazing store. I transferred to the Kroger on Forest and Greenville it was hard on me.
good,I worked in the bakery it was ok got a lot busier in winter with holidays. the management was meh and culture was alright everyone got along. Also got dirty a lot though
good,It's a retail job. Coworkers are always friendly but management is very hit or miss. It's a union job so pay and benefits are a little better compared to Meijers. Don't expect overtime or consistent hours unless you have tenure.
good,"They do have a union, which is nice. So you have some level of security and managers definitely know y'all are unionized. That said, there's basically everything else awful that comes with a low paying position. Managers move around a lot, don't stay at stores longer than a year or two."
good,Management always treats workers poorly at this company and have little understanding of what workers need to have done or how hard theyre actually working.
good,"Not the best place to work, depending the store and the coworkers can make the days easier. But kroger does not care about their employees they expect so much with little to get back"
good,I did not like it I was a bagger but they had me cleaning bathrooms because the cleaner did not show up for weeks and they did not even pay goo if they did I would se myself working again there
good,I have worked there for a while but they just didn’t care about me enough for me to stay there. I loved the work environment but the management and whole team there were not on the same page and made me angry at times.
good,kroger is a nice place to work at. It really just depends who your co workers are. The breaks sucks. You only get a 15 mins break if you work 6 hours or less. You get a 30 mins break if you work 7 hours or more.
good,Recommendable place to work with different shift schedules. A place that is diverse and open to all people. Opportunity to learn and provide good customer service.
good,Kroger was a decent first job starting out as a high school kid who could only work certain hours. They did well accommodating my schedule and created a welcoming environment.
good,Keeps you busy so the work goes by fast. All different types of schedule. Not a very good job for someone with young kids. They do work with a school schedule and 2nd job schedule. You get a week vacation after one year. You can request off unpaid days two weeks ahead of time. Management isn't the best but coworkers are great.
good,"Make sure u get the rite pay!! Always talk to your union rep. When u have a problem, she will fight for u. Stay busy at all time. Make sure when u get your check to keep up with your hours you have worked"
good,"Great place, there will always has ups & downs. Need to stay focused and do not get discouraged by people, places and things that can alter your teamwork."
good,I really didn’t like working at Kroger’s because they was unorganized. They had bad customer service. They was rude to the customers. Got so many complaints
good,"Each store management is different place to place, some are really good, some are really bad. Stuff work there, some are great, some are just slobs, great people overwork all the time, slobs just take the money and don't do their job well."
good,It was a normal cashier job and you are making me have a minimum of characters that’s ridiculous I don’t have much to say about I didn’t work there that long
good,"My experince with the managers was good, and so was the work, hours was decent i just wasnt able to keep up with krogers and school at the same time, though it is a good place to work and id recommend it to friends in the future"
good,One thing is what they say another thing is what they do they gonna rip you off botton line not a good company to work they jus careabout themselves poor management  not supporting employees
good,"Good company to work for in high school and if you choose, a pretty good company to retire from. They have decent benefits and offer plenty of room for growth."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to assist clients and build relationships. Good experience and management team is knowledgable and easy to work with.
good,My job was night stock supervisor it was a full time position. I enjoyed working there just looking for a change from night shift. Working at Kroger was a great experience. I have worked for this company for 10 years. I enjoy working with the public.
good,I learned people skills and patience. Management was friendly at first till I asked to rearrange my schedule around my school schedule then there was a problem. He was completely rude about it.
good,"The job is not difficult for an advanced clerk, usually difficulties with the job entails having to meet unrealistic corporate demands with extreme time restrictions."
good,There should never be a time when nobody is doing nothing. Everyone should always be moving/working. customer service is an always ever present situation.
good,Sorry for tthe typos. I couldnt see what i was typing after a certain point on the page. ...I worked for Krogers in high school. I loved it and always regretted leaving and was excited to get a part time job as a cashier 20 years later. I loved the job as a cashier and I looked forward to being around people but i was only there for 4 months. Do to already having a full time job during the week during the day I worked nights and weekrnds. Well they started to schedule me til midnight alot and 2 to 4 days in a row plus still only giving me 16 hours a week even tho i was one of the ones that wpuld come in early or stay late . Well do to my 40 hr week job and my 12 year old kid I went in and changed my availability for week nights and management denied it the scheduled me 4 days in a row to work til midnight 3 or days were weeldays. So when i discussed it with a management he complained about one of the other managers and the schedule and I had informed him I was putting my notice in do to Deming my request. He asked me to write it on a piece of paper and put it on his desk so he could discuss it with the general manager in the morbing. So i did. Well not only did this manager not talk to the U.N. like he promised he just told every one i put my 2 weeks in writting. Then they asked me to cover a shift that Friday but after my notice was in they told me not to worry about it and gave the hours to someone else. Other I had another manager say whatever and hang up on me cause I couldn't run over to the gas station across the street to check something on kroger pumps a customer had
good,Have really enjoyed my 12 years at Kroger but a change is needed. Over the past few years there has been some significant changes in the company and feel like the place has gotten stale to me so looking to expand somewhere else.
good,I resigned from my job as a cashier and a bagger because all of my coworkers we’re very disrespectful calling me names and foul words. I felt very toxic in the environment so I left.
good,"Great job to start with, the pay has since increased. Not much room to move up. Hours can either be exactly what you ask for or completely random at any given time."
good,A typical day working at Kroger was me getting the carts and me bagging groceries. I also had to stock from time to time. The hardest part about working here is they have you running in and out the store trying to get carts and bag groceries.
good,They were always kind accept for when I asked for a day off due to my religion. But other than that they’re a great company. I would definitely work there again.
good,"it was fun at times, its just a lot of young teenagers that work there and sometimes they can get a little carried away and management was good and was always positive"
good,"The grocery stores in my area pay $10-12/hr but Kroger only pays $8.25/hr. It's not enough if you have to pay for rent in the area.  (I live near Houston, Texas)"
good,"I struggled at Kroger, but I had stress at home. The management team was very caring and tried to be fair."
good,"For me my co-workers made the job tolerable. Its a decent job for a teenager, young adult, student. The pay is not enough to make a decent living. Everything is based on seniority."
good,"I really just just bagged groceries, I would always ask to put up the stuff at the front that people didn’t want just because I liked it. Then sometimes when we weren’t busy at all I would just clean."
good,Depending on who your CSM is they may or may not have clue on how to run the front-end. It is pretty easy to move up as long as you stay on your toes.
good,the job was very busy and steady. i learned how to rotate the produce and make sure everything was fresh. the management was poor. the hardest part of the job was when i had to do my job and other jobs as well that i was not responsible for.
good,"Kroger have by far has been a great workplace to learn and grow from. I learned things such as basic customer service such as creating a friendly environment , The importance of arriving on time which says alot about a person , buliding up patience when handling certain customers, and also the company overall helped me build up your customer service sikills ."
good,Between the customers coming in during rush hour and management coming down on young employees hard at the time.  It was a really stressful environment at times
good,Your hours varies. Sometime you don't get the same amount of hours or the same shifts every week. I have some vary caring and loving coworkers. Its also fast pased
good,I like the people I work with. We are like family. They can accommodate your family schedule and are determined to help other try to succeed in your career
good,It is good and also stressful sometimes depending on how much help you have . Must be able to stand on feet for long periods of time and be people oriented
good,The management was decent and pretty much left us alone at the front.  The job really wasn't that bad with the benefits and supplementing my income working at Denny's on midnights as a waiter.
good,Here I worked third shift. I was responsible for bringing skids from dairy cooler. I then would stock off those skids. Got breaks every 2 hours. It was 8 hr shifts. I liked working thirds.
good,"Kroger is a okay place to work and  great job to start out at, but for todays generation it's not for the long haul. It's hard to move up in the company and it's more about who you know instead of what you know."
good,It’s a job. Do it and go home. Can be stressful as you are working with the public. It all depends on your management team and how much they support your department
good,While working for Kroger many of the employees told me not to get stuck working there. As many of my superiors only planed on worker for a year and then leave. However many have been there for 4+ years now.
good,"Working here wasn’t the best job for me considering it was my first. I met some good people along the way but the environment just wasn’t happy, there was a lot of drama."
good,A place where you can learn and mature as a leader as long as you dedicate yourself to being the best you that you can possibly be. The earning potential is minimal.
good,"Bagging Prescriptions, putting on shelf in appropriate locations and when time to open, open gate. Help customers while bagging prescriptions and putting away when not busy with"
good,Everything about Kroger is overall pretty good except for being in a union which doesn’t give us good employees chances for raises based on quality of work.
good,"Fast paced. No micromanagement (at least in my dept). Although since is a call center, once you log on the phone you're being tracked every time you move from your desk. "
good,"I've been happy with all of my managers so far until recently. I feel like my current department manager isn't totally qualified for the position. Previous managers often worked on the same kinds of tasks as the other employees in the department to get the job done faster and share the work. The current manager doesn't do this very often and it feels more like I'm working for him than with him. The new store director has odd priorities and seems to care more about meticulously organizing things than anything else. The most important thing to him is organizing the backroom and facing the dairy and frozen departments, which I have to spend a lot of my time doing rather than my normal grocery stocker jobs."
good,"Kroger was an okay job for a little while, but as my life advances and the need for more financial stability is higher, the company just wasn’t an option anymore."
good,"I started to work at Kroger's because I was told by multiple people that it's an easy work environment. "
good,"When I was working here, the upper level management was very neglective of my needs as a student. But for entry level work, this is a very good place to start."
good,"I did not work there too long but it was pretty good, it was my first job so i was excited. I liked the daily meetings to motivate the associates, you get to meet people from all walks of life."
good,Management was unprofessional . If you weren't in the managers favorite  group of people  then you were mistreated . Last minute schedule changes and no notice are your main concerns
good,Stressful and Unsafe work environment. High seniority employees can pretty much to whatever they want and are complacent and unsafe and there are no repercussions for them.
good,It was ok to work there I didnt care for it much because you had to deal with people that was drunk and would go off on you and the boss wouldnt do anything about it
good,I learned a lot because i was put into situations to learn because we were short staffed and continuous personnel issues. I had to clean up behind most of everybody even when it was not my role to.
good,The hours and pay are not great. They are better then nothing. The management was ok.  The customers were great to work with and serve. They closed all the stores here in NC a year ago.
good,"The job it’s self wasn’t bad, but the rules they had set didn’t make much since, like not providing breaks, or areas for employees to eat. Especially if they work 8 hours, I never understood that."
good,"Customers are friendly and the employees are great. Kroger is a good place, I just needed a change in my career. It is a great first job. I will miss the employees I work with."
good,Simple yet a fast paced environment surrounded by customers. Everyone is pretty nice and friendly. Somewhere that you can find just about anything. Great selections.
good,This was not a place for me. I enjoy upbeat work environments. Kroger is a company in which you are expected to work non-stop. The managers were rude and never gave constructive criticism.
good,"Just need more hours, more pe to people could and would stay there if they could be hired in full time.. Great benefits for full time employees.  A single mother needs a full time job"
good,Kroger is a great place to work for people balancing a lifestyle in which they must work alongside going to school. Hours are flexible if you are not full time.
good,"It was a fun place to work, you were always busy and the co-workers were lovely and hard working, however the management were rude and didn't want to work with you for anything. They really treated us all like dirt."
good,Overworked and Underpaid. No empathy in the workplace culture. The hardest part of the job was management not too much caring about employees just about Kroger itself.
good,"There are many great employees at Kroger, but the managers don't know how to treat them correctly. They cut many hours due to automation, but don't give any type of stress relief for the people. Employees know their jobs will be taken soon, and it is obvious Kroger does not care about them. They want what will make them the most money and to make sure they keep their jobs."
good,working can be exciting if you are with the right co workers. everyone will be doing their own order picking but others can help you when you fall behind.
good,it was a lot going on them days it was stressful people drinking  I was nervous at times due to me being young it was a life experience . taught me to handle to job world
good,"Analyzed the department workflows (including cash application and collections) in order to reduce outstanding receivables and identify causes for non-payment."
good,The first store I worked at was solid for a minimum wage job the staff were friendly and helpful. Then I transferred to a different store and I was treated like I didn't know how to anything and given menial tasks and undesirable shifts.
good,"Overall not a bad job. Learned how to properly rotate, clean and fill product. My biggest complaint was what was expected of me and how much I was paid. Management was nice but a little incompetent on how to manage based on skill. My favorite part of the job was the co-workers."
good,This job can have a relaxed work environment or stressful anytime depending on customers as well as coworkers. It is mostly relaxed and the hours can be flexible to allow for school.
good,"Just not the best management. I honestly think it would have been much better if management was willing to  listen to you which they  almost never were, however the people i worked with were awesome."
good,"As a grocery cashier, you barely get time to catch your breath. This environment is very fast paced. Customers are the most rewarding part of the job, hearing about their day. When you first start at a grocery store, you have an idea of how stressful it will be. The customers are very reassuring that you are doing well, but do not hesitate to critique anything out of place - which is helpful for someone learning."
good,Fast paced at times and must be able to have displays and prices available and easily accessible.  Be able to move products and placed in the designated locations.
good,Decent first-time job or temporary work for a student. Doesn't pay particularly well and they sometimes sacrifice quality for speed. Refused to accommodate changing schedules outside of work.
good,"Overall it was a pleasurable work experience, however, there was no room for growth in the company without staying for several years. It didn't meet my time frame for effort I was inputting. Regardless of hard work and drive, promotions are always offered to employees based on seniority."
good,Awful manager but the rest of management is sweet. Fast paced but fairly easily. Not big on the dress code but not hard to follow. Wonderful benefits after awhile.
good,"Not bad for high schoolers, had a bad manager who constantly micromanaged, overall not a terrible experience but did not get paid enough for the work performed"
good,"Kroger was fun, I met a bunch of great people but the pay/hours weren’t enough. Closed to the end of my time at Kroger the time keepers wouldn’t let me take sick days even though I was working the bakery dept."
good,Working at Kroger was a hard but important period in my life as it taught me a good amount about hard work and workplace communication. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a retail job.
good,this is a ok place to work for a few year but it not a place to work the rest of your life or get a career grocery stores are only good for a part or full time job for a little while
good,"This specific Kroger was not clean, I would spend all of my free time cleaning but to no avail. Other krogers out there are clean. I worked in the deli."
good,This job is for high school students trying to gain work experience. Its not for long term employment. Great experience for my first  job. It taught me how to manage my money.
good,"The Kroger I work at is a large store and has a variety of different people, most of which are just trying to make enough money to get by. The best part about this company is you can tell them when you can work and they usually only schedule you when you want them too."
good,It would have been a great place to work if management was a lot more profesional they don't know what they are doing in that store it is an awful place to work until management is changed I wouln't recomend
good,coming into kroger on the time of your shift you have to find manager of that day to tell what register you will be on. it gets very busy during the evening days and the baggers aren't around when it gets crazy so the cashier has to scan fast and help bag lastly so you can get everyone out quickly as you can so no one gets angry.
good,Kroger is a nice and calm work environment. It has its pros and cons just like every work place. The pay could be more or the hours could be set better.
good,"I personally did not have the best experience working there. I worked in the pharmacy and the pharmacy manager was very rude, immature, and had o business being a manager. Also the amount of hours I would get each week was very very inconsistent."
good,Disconnect from crew to managers. Union that doesn't have a big enough effect to make it worth paying for. Career advancement is minimal depending on your department.
good,Worked at Kroger for almost four years while I was in high school/ college. I did try to advance my career but HR seemed that they did not want to be bothered.
good,I enjoyed working at Kroger and the people I worked with. I didn't always have the best/most ideal schedule but I knew I'd always have scheduled hours to work
good,good place to work for. had to sell steaks at a meat counter. had to clean meat cutting equipment. had to take temperatures of food to make sure the cold chain was kept.
good,"I was a bagger and really got only few hours a week maybe 18 to 22 hours, so minimum pay wasnt great either, it was a simple first official job, so starting there is ok"
good,"Pretty good place to work for college students and also people needing a second job. The pay is pretty low, but the benefits are good. It's not a viable career unless you want to work in the meat department which offers better pay and more career advancement. If you want to be a manager, a degree is almost necessary with some exceptions."
good,"Kroger’s overall Is an okay job. It’s great for resumé building, and offers plenty of hours to those who apply themselves in the work place. However, it can be difficult to negotiate a proper pay wage if you’re rather new to the company."
good,"I've been with this company for 5 years. In the beginning, it was fine and I had no issues. As time went on, working there became awful. Kroger goes through managers like crazy. Courtesy clerks get treated very poorly and are underpaid for the work they do."
good,"Kroger is a nice starting job and that is really it, they did provide healthcare but it was limited. You did get paid time off but they made it hard to take the time off. The management most of the time just didn't care. The wages where low and raise you got every six months also were really low."
good,it was often understaffed and more challenging for both the employees and managers but we all worked together and while I cannot give much on the company itself I can say most of the employees were good at team building and cooperation. The greatest challenge faced was accessing the schedule which was often obscured or not present on the time it was required to be. however shopping there was quite a positive experience and the red-vested managers or other employees who were responsible for overseeing us were always attentive and helpful and were always willing to help when not to busy with customers and never slacking.
good,"You come in, do your job, and leave. Customers aren't terrible. Management's pretty fair. Only problem being the promised 20 hours a week fluctuate. Besides that, the job isn't a hard one."
good,It was a pretty relaxed working environment for me because i was a cashier and my best friend was my assigned bagger so the days would go by pretty fast because we were actually having fun while getting work done
good,"-The environment is really nice and productive. "
good,"I was a basic customer service employee. My position was taken less than seriously to others, management had too many cooks in the kitchen and couldn't decide proper policy between them all. A good first job."
good,"At a typical day at the Kroger, which starts at three pm, I usually spend the first of eight hours on cart duty, pushing carts into rows inside the store. Once the hour is over, I come back inside and the next three or four hours bagging groceries for customers. Then I go out on cart duty once again for an hour, then come back inside. For the next hour or two, I continue to bag groceries, and the final hour or two of my shift is spent pushing in the last of the carts for the night before clocking out and heading home. "
good,"The typical day at work in each department is fast pace if your working a four hour shift you only get a 15 min break. If you work a nine hour shift you have a 15 min, 30 min, and another 15 min break."
good,It’s a good first job for a teenager. It’s very flexible with school and the union helps protect you from unfair treatment. You work with some good people.
good,I liked that is was fast paced and friendly. Management could have been more understanding and useful. They also could have raised the employment payment
good,The managers there was so rude that I couldn’t stand to be there with them they needed to be more nicer and respectful to their customers into their coworkers because it was so wrong for the way they treated me and I can’t stand it I couldn’t stand it then I can’t stand it now to see someone To be miss treated
good,"Working at kroger was a great learning experience as i got to work with about 10 different managers who taught me numerous things that had to do with customer service and providing care to both other associates and future customers. Although there were a few clashes that happen between other managers and i, i still found a sense of understanding and peace within working in this quick-paced surrounding. It changed me for the better and got me to work on my procrastination and problem-solving skills."
good,I only worked at this company for a month. I didn't get to know much about the company. I know it was fun and has the option of being in a union. I left the company because the only offered me 15 hours a week.
good,"it was ok wasn't scheduled much. the pay was awful. the hours was less that twenty a week , which could not help me to even pay daycare for my children at the time."
good,"Great company to work for  with benefits"
good,"Worked as a bag boy and I also had to get the carts that the customers would use. I mainly enjoyed conversing with the customers while bagging their groceries, like I got to know them."
good,I'm sure the wonderful employees that work there okay with the company and that's good however I didn't care much for how the management hardly helped with simple things
good,"I was a bagger, cart collector, cleaner, customer service. The manager doesn't have considered when it comes on our schedule like leave. He approved and then he canceled."
good,Bad hour Rotation but Good Work inverment to me it was Pretty Easy working At a Fast Past lifting And Stocking and the one pf the best Parts of the job was meeting new people from diffrent backgrounds
good,"I didn't work as a Kroger as a courtesy clerk for long only 3months. A typical day as a Kroger courtesy clerk included pushing carts, bagging groceries, and cleaning the store. As expected in any customer service job there are pretty bad customers, however, the employees just make the job less bearable. The employees in the front end are the worst. Most are crazy, prone to fight, aggressive and just annoying to deal with. If you work at Kroger dont work at the Front End. Management just depends on the person and the good ones usually don't last. Management generally very rude, and most importantly don't follow availability and work schedules. If you are looking to work at Kroger make sure you visit the store before and don't work in the front end. While I had a bad experience working at Kroger, I've heard better things at other locations, so, I think the work environment is a store by store basis."
good,Do not know much about the company as a whole. I worked in a cube in the corporate office did my work and went home. Not much more I can say because I did not have much interaction with anyone.
good,"I've learned very great customer skill, high pace scanning and bagging. I loved making a customers day by helping them save money with the deals we had. Didn't enjoy the call outs very much. Happened all the time which made me work even longer. Management was very poor and felt like they didn't care at all"
good,Company is good to work for if it is your first time into the job market. lots of room to advance within the company if dedication is put into the job
good,"And this is a big but... Kroger is headed in a direction that is totally ignoring the employees. The ones that work at the store level anyways. They are constantly cutting hours and staff, while bragging about how good we did last quarter. It is growing worse by the passing day. I have made it quite far within the company but I have made it far enough to know when it is time to pursue a different  path in my professional life."
good,If you are looking for a good part time job. This is the place to go.. Good part time. Fast pace and you can really pick your time you want. Nothing  bad to say
good,"All in all, Kroger is a nice place to work. Plenty of opportunities and decent pay. Variety and convenience is shown throughout the store and most of the employees are very hospitable. Professionalism among management and hiring could be improved but Kroger in summation is a great company."
good,"It was a fun place to work, made a lot of friends. I highly recommend this company to anyone whether it be right out of high school or a single middle aged Mom or Dad"
good,"Management was nice, other associates were nice, timed on scans, helped out customers, breaks were efficient, had discounts on store brand items and enjoyed working in the evenings"
good,Kroger was or is an ok place for teens as there very first job or for college students just looking to nake some money while they are in college ir it can be a job fir someone who already as a full time job Kroger can be money they can just spend with no hesitation
good,Was a good company to work for...but just way to much drama and I worked there way too long. 6 years is a long time to have to deal with that and all the drama gave me major anxiety.
good,"I liked my team i worked with, they made time go by so much faster. My manager was great and very flexible with my schedule. The job itself did provide me with a lot of hours but the pay wasn’t worth it."
good,"Your entire career (pay scale, hours, benefits etc.) with Kroger will be determined by the current Union contract.  Make sure you review before you accept the job.  Management changes often so day-to-day work can change with different emphasis from each manager.  There are advancement opportunities available, if you are planning on a long term career."
good,"Deli is pretty hard, but it's an okay job when you get down to it. Friendly coworkers, and good managers. We still keep in touch, and the academic leave was a pretty big help"
good,"A very unprofessional environment, a lot of favoritism on the management side. It was a unsafe workplace.The worst set of Leadership I have ever had to work with. There were no bonuses, no incentives, no employee appreciation of any sort. Security was terrible as well."
good,"very competitive, would cut hours for every front end person if their produce and scanning numbers were low for the store, they do not give enough hours, lost a lot of people due to hours, which made the job very stressful."
good,Kroger  was a job but it was fun I was excited  to  go to work when I was  at Kroger  they closed  down  so I cam back home  at Kroger  I learned  to cut meat
good,Some good hours but not stable... always different shifts... sometimes they work with your hours .. managers are nice and it is a nice work environment.. it’s always busy
good,Ive enjoyed Kroger. Its fun and fast paced. I just need to find something that offers more money. And doesnt require me to work nights. I told them during my interview I didnt want to work nights.
good,"If you want to go into retail, this would be a solid company to join. It provides good experience in customer service, and they provide training for equipment/technology required for your specific position."
good,Great co workers were very helpful and friendly. There was only 2 cons on working their you have to work over 7 hours to get half an hour lunch and you're hired in part time it takes a long time to get full time employment.
good,Part time job. Need more training. Was hired to do one job stuck doing another. Supposed to be based on seniority. Always excuse for no training the better you do the job your in they dont want to transfer you to another department after ask for transfer. After posting Hiring for all positions and was told all employees were supposed to be doing the same job i was doing.
good,No review nothing to say about Kroger. The company is ok i guess don't have anything to say about Kroger at all. ppl wanna work there good for them. that's all.
good,"Kroger was always a great company to work for, but it's going downhill. Management seems to not care about the well being if their employees. They also do not do their job correctly."
good,awesome group of people to work with. Management was way too hard on his employee or at least those who don't kiss butt to get what they want. I have always worked for what I needed or wanted not kiss up.
good,I enjoyed working at the Starbucks in Ralph's the customers and employee's were very nice. It is a great job for a student because they will work with your schedule.
good,A typical day at work would be stocking items into their appropriate department. Assisting customers wants and needs. Bagging groceries and working the cash register. The management was very poor because people wouldn't show up to work leaving me very busy.
good,Enjoyed the position.  It was fast-paced.  Enjoyed interacting with customers.  Hours were flexible.  Pay was above-average for my experience.  People were polite.
good,I was a curtesy clerk I bagged groceries took the groceries to people cars retrieved all the carts from the parking lot and returned all unwanted items back to their shelves
good,"Some days are nice and other day suck. employees are cool but many of them take the job to seriously. pay is terrible unless you've been there for over 5 years. and with places like Target/Walmart making $3-$4 more, it's honestly not worth working here."
good,"haven't been there in years change of management, could be different atmosphere at this point and time.  I would not recommend a job there to anyone who wants to advance to higher levels of pay"
good,Unfortunately indeed is forcing this review - I worked at a Kroger during high school and remember absolutely nothing of value worth warranting a review.
good,"Nice company to work for as an teenager thru maybe 22, I started out at the bottom as a grocery shacker & worked my up the ladder, until it was time to move on to find a career."
good,I enjoyed working at Kroger. The people were great and I enjoyed the work. The reason I left the company was because I had just been divorced and I needed to be off weekends to take care of my children.
good,"The job at krogers was very fast paced and had to be done with in one night. A typical day was usually eight hours to ten hours. With the job title I was in, we only worked two nights a week."
good,They would split my paycheck so that i would get a paycheck every week. you could not request days off even if you are a student athlete and needed time off for sporting events.
good,"The general merchandising department is very dynamic and lacks the payroll hours to perform all of the duties that are required .  Store management is supposed to help with tasks, but in general they do not."
good,"Nice people to work with, job can be very rewarding.  First started out as a flex work schedule but changed without notice to structured start and  clock out times"
good,"Overall a good company, but slow in advancement. Lots of turnover in teenagers, older associates seem to stay. Mangement is tolerable but the supervisors seem to have a lot of beef."
good,A typical day at work was very stressful. Little to no breaks and it was never a consistent schedule.The pay benefits were low and the hours were never consistent.
good,The management wasn't at it's best.  They'll pull you for what you suppose to be doing and to work at a different department byt then call you back.  There was times where it was too much but we never let the stress level beat us.
good,"The main problem I had with this place was that I didn't have a flexible schedule. You had to request days off two weeks in advance, and then on top of that wait for them to actually be approved. if they weren't;t you would have to speak to the main floor manager."
good,I like it and all but the pay is not enough plus the managers didn't want to give no days I could work and everyone that works in the deli is everywhere its not organized
good,"The work can be very repetitive but also has the potential to be entertaining and fulfilling. What mattered the most for my job were the people around me, both employees and customers. People in my position were expected to be positive and help the customers around, flexible for the other branches if they were understaffed, and could come in on short notice. I learned how to be more reliable for those I work for and to my colleagues. The management could be very hit or miss, as there are managers I enjoyed working under and those I did not. The culture at the Kroger workplace was one to limit any obstructions to your best work. The hardest part of the job was when you could not do your job. Since I would need to cover for employees in other branches and still get my work done. The most enjoyable part of the job by far was being able to work with the people around me."
good,Been a few years since being there but Frys was short staffed and over ran. Employees from different departments had to be crossed trained to cover other shifts for other departments
good,"Working at Kroger is somewhat stressful because of all the customers who may come in on a regular basis, but besides the busy lines at times, it is a fun job."
good,i went in with no experience and was trained decently. department managers are not good and are never around but other than that its an okay job. some lack of training especially in the back room.
good,"The pay is not good comparing to the job you doing, I was i bagger is so stressful and you have to push grocery carts with you hands because they don't have the pushing machine."
good,"This place is easy to work at, and if you stick with it, you will get a broad array of experience you can take elsewhere. I can't reccomend it beyond an experience stepping stone however."
good,"I stayed at Kroger throughout my high school career and freshman year of college. After a while, I got fed up with the change of managers and felt that it was the appropriate time to leave and pursue a job more geared towards my study."
good,I would open the store at 6:00 in the morning and I would count the drawers and unlock doors when it was time to open watch the registers I would work at self checkout and then go home at 2:00 in the afternoon
good,"The work to life balance is okay, not great. Only because I’m on second shift. I’m looking for a first shift job somehwere in the same field or in other areas I have skills in"
good,"You really have to be a person who is consistent and very patient, hard working to be self satisfied with your work, it keeps up the motivation and moral on a team and in your department."
good,"I can't truly say there was a typical day. Certain duties are standard but can change depending on days, deals, weather and attendance. Not the most enjoyable place to work but I made some friends and it was close to home."
good,"This was my first job, and I just worked here because they hired me, but I was always looking for another job.  I go a new job and I left here for that new job."
good,Decent place to work but poor management.Co-workers were nice. Pay was decent wasn't to special. Lack of teamwork was an issue. Pressure put on you by management was bad
good,"Obtain patient information, process prescription sold and dispensed medication."
good,"Well some of the management needs a lot of work"
good,standing in the same spot for 8hrs is not much fun at all but it paid the bills and being union had good benefits but management are not nice and only care about themselves
good,"the management at the time was verbally aggressive."
good,"Extremely fast paced and stressful.  At times there is little or no help when time demands are very constricting.  When you do get noticed for a job well done, it is very nice.  But most hard workers are over looked for the outstanding job they do to make the company successful."
good,"Working for Kroger stores over the last 2 1/2 years has given me a wider spectrum of the job world. Advancement is always an option. At my particular store management was great our customer base was broad and our associates  are dedicated, but the pay reflected could be a lot better. I was hired as a cashier and quickly advanced into customer service. Customer service deals with the needs of the people. Bill payments, money orders, and a specialty in money transfers."
good,This was my second job and it wasn't bad or too hard. You are mostly on your feet all day so I recommend having a comfortable pair of shoes on. Overall the job is not hard.
good,was a my first job very helpful for building up skills like communication and time management. have to be ready for fast past work peaks. but none the less great to get to interact and meet new people consistently.
good,"faced paced, customer oriented job that i would stay with if the benefits were not being taken away from us. I enjoy making customers happy despite how many hours we worked or how much we were underappreciated."
good,"Some of the nicest and hardest working people I know work for kroger. I have learned alot and developed better as a prospective employee because of the fast paced enivronment with kroger. The management staff at store level and district level can be described as uncaring and don't care. All they worry about is their numbers. You can work hard all day and never get a thank you or compliment, but if you forget one thing they are grilling  you and trying to degrade you. Overall the job is fun, but the management staff is reasoning for me to start looking elsewhere."
good,Loved the people I worked with. Always fast paced and sometimes stressful. Breaks are very short and no benefits. You get to pick you hours so they were very flexible.
good,"Kroger is an alright place to work. Provides well for family, but is not anything to rave about. Work/Life balance all depends on the manger you work for. Some follow it better than others."
good,I've always been good at management at Albertsons/Safeway but the level Kroger is expecting I'm not achieving their expectations.  I work practically everyday 12 hours or more to achieve my tasks to no avail.  I've asked to step down to receiving or 3rd shift but they won't allow it.
good,"If it wasn’t for my co workers I would’ve left a long time ago, they make my day. But since Kroger has had the pay raise I find it that my supervisor has cut people’s hour only con about it."
good,"You are always busy, if it is not with a meat/cheese sliver. You are cleaning and sanitizing, along with makin orders from customers. It is a very productive and self paced routine."
good,"A typical day consists of traveling to the store destination to be remodeled and work with team to move aisles and reset merchandise."
good,"I would have to say, that if management was more consistent with demands, the flow would work much better.  One day its hot, the next its not.  I am loyal, but when mistreated, not so much."
good,I loved this job. I learned how to work along side all types of different personalities. Most customers are nice and that ensures you will have an enjoyable day. I feel the responsibilities of the technicians are overloaded and the technicians are not compensated enough for the tasks they do everyday. Teamwork is Key!
good,"If you have a family to take care of, i would not suggest kroger for a sole source of income, i worked there 7 years and was only making 10.50 a hour as a lead meat/seafood clerk, and the hours are not flexible"
good,the company did not pay very well but over all the workplace was fast moving and alot of job advancment opertunities. starting working in the produce department and then moving on to cashier.
good,"It was okay, typical stock job. I recommend it for college students or someone looking for a holdover. Good people to work with. It was decent and good to do."
good,"The hardest part was the mornings but after that was nice, and at times fun, always had a cool time at work, and helping others was always good. always stayed focused"
good,"I stocked the entire frozen section overnight. I had a department manager and there was an assistant manager for that shift that worked more than I did in each department.Also, there was an upper level assistant manager that supervised the productivity of each department, who only answered to the stores general manager."
good,"It was okay, it was really fast paced and understaffed. The workers didn't really communicate well, nobody really seemed like they wanted to be there. 10% off of any of krogers brands though, some other stuff as well that I never used."
good,"it's great for a first job. But to maintain a life (rent, lights, etc.)? terrible. I was definitely underpaid and overworked. The only reason I enjoyed it was because I had regular customers that I was on first name basis with that I genuinely loved seeing."
good,"I was working another job at the time of being hired at kroger. I was SURE to let them know of my weekly hours at the other place I worked. After about 2 weeks I got a schedule that would directly interfere with my other job. I let the manager know, and never heard anything back. I went to work at my primary job that day, and got an email to not come back (I was likely not going to go back anyways, due to lack of communication.)"
good,Ralphs is a great place to work because of pay. you are able to live good with pay. It does require alot of your time and energy. you definitely have to have open availability and be ready to work lots of hours.
good,"They help so many hob opening because workers would quite cause they felt disrespected, they are harsh and  competitive work environment and a lot of worker didn’t like the store management"
good,"The company is fine to work, but they tend to give only part time hours. It wasn't satisfying for me. I always wanted hours to work but they used to give lame reasons not to give it. So I left Kroger."
good,The typical work day started ok but during the day when assistant was need to catch up on online order the commerce department would always have to request repeatly in order to get an additional employee to help out. Comment like “work fast” “explain to the customer what going on” this is what made the department unorganized.
good,"During school i worked here. I started out working in Clicklist for awhile the switched to bagging. Im very small and have problems with my joints and other body pain, Clicklist requires heavy lifting and it definitely took a toll on me, not to mention working in the winter, no fun. Picking for Clicklist is definitely preferred, i kind of enjoyed it, but with my availability i didnt get to do it often because its a first shift job. Attending for Clicklist was pretty awful, lifting heavy crates, constantly going in and outside, tends to be very fast paced, rude customers. Eventually i asked to get switched to bagging, the first hour or two it was alright but standing in the same spot for hoursss would absolutely kill my back, knees, hips and feet. It was also extremely boring, especially on a slow day. On the bright side I never had to deal with rude customers, the cashiers get that often tho. Also I noticed the coworkers in Clicklist are pretty cool and chill, and in the front end most were really weird. The pay is pretty awful too. Its alright for a first job, but i dont recommend it."
good,Did not so much enjoy working for this company but it paid my bills while I was in college.  I could focus on my studies and extracurriculars while knowing I would be able to stay afloat financially.
good,This job entails the worker to push carts and put items back on shelves. The management team is great and understanding. The workers are friendly. The hardest part is some workers do not live up to expectations. The most enjoyable is the friendly environment you will get from your co-workers and managers.
good,the job i worked was kind of hard for just one man i had to stock shelves and unload payton trucks and put pallets on the floor within 8 hours . which seems like its do-able but it is not easy with customers on the floor or mess ups by others it should be a two man job and the pay should have been much more.
good,It was a quiet job since it was on store closed hours but the job was to fast paced and sometimes it got hectic when a co-worker wouldn't show up. Sometimes shipment was rough since those were the days that we got everything and had to put everything on the floor.
good,"I don't really have much to say, it's been a few years. The environment was not organized and I actually got some of my hours cut as in they didn't pay me for them."
good,Kroger was fun. I was a Cashier. I only stayed about 8 months because my checks were only 200 every week. And that was not enough to pay the bills. Customers made the day stressful. Sometimes prices were not displayed correctly so that would upset the customers. When i first started i was a bagger. Then in six months i moved up to cashier. And i started at 7.25 only moved up to 7.55 in 6 months of working there.
good,"Wasn't anything too fancy. typical work day was pushing carts, cleaning the bathroom , and bagging for customers. learned how to become more responsible"
good,"I had a great supervisor but I know others who did not. Varies store to store. High turn over for employees and managers. Hard physical labor for minimum wage, not worth it long term."
good,its an alright place to work the people there are great the management could be better about recanalization of their employees instead of always going for the bad.
good,I would clock in the go straight the front end and bag for most of my shift then be asked to go outside and grab carts to bring more in if they were low in the lobby. If i had closing i would have to get every cart inside before 12 a.
good,"The location where I worked garnished wages for union dues where the union favored the older tenured employees at the expense of newer ones.  But, it is a good place to start."
good,Was hard work for minimal pay but I learned customer service and time management. Employee environment was bearable since others shared my point of view and I made friends.
good,"e-Commerce with Kroger can be fun, exciting, and challenging, but often the challenges can be too much for a good work/life balance. The pay scale is poor in the e-Commerce department compared to other departments since it is newer and has not been negotiated for much in the union contract. Those who transition into the role of e-Commerce supervisor from a clerk role as opposed to department head role are low-balled on their salary and will have to move into higher management roles to get a worthwhile raise. How your experience goes in e-Commerce with Kroger is highly dependent on the other departments and managers in the store, as they influence what groceries and quality of groceries are available as well as quality of labor. If a good team is present throughout the store, e-Commerce is a great place to be, but if not it can lead to an excessive amount of overtime, poor customer service, and the frustration of unmet expectations. When it's going well, customers are very grateful for this useful service, which can be rewarding."
good,I found working at Kroger as a personal shopper to be a highly inconsistent situation. Some days could be extremely busy causing a high stress environment and other days it would be too slow to maintain a consistent work environment causing a lot of employee down time.
good,Old store manager is very rude and disrespectful. majority of the shift managers are the nicest people you'll ever meet. people are very nice and loving. customers are sweet and understanding if something goes wrong.
good,"Depending on which shift I was scheduled I would do freight and stock or cashier along with merchandise and markdowns. "
good,"everything depends on management, so if your manager isn't right the entire store wont be either.  everything is higher up...……………………………………………………………………………………………………."
good,Standard minimum wage job. Had to cover your shifts regardless of asking for time off or vacation and regardless of notice. Staffing was based off of $ not off of staff needed at time of the day.
good,"worked in the produce department, mostly restocking and helping customers find items.  occasional shift offloading truck and stocking the warehouse, early in the morning but other than that not too bad"
good,I start day off at 2pm when I clock in to work. My daily chores usually contain filling the milk and eggs followed by stocking a truck. Towards the end of the day I clean my cooler out and top off milk and eggs and condition.
good,Wonderful job for a first time job but is not ideal for adults looking to advance in their careers. Full time adults were given benefits and competitive pay but as a front floor supervisor at 16 I made the same pay as a cashier with a TON of added stress with no payment compensation.
good,"The department I worked for was a fast-paced environment. Product was in constant need of restocking, and at times there was only one person running the department."
good,"A typical day at work includes dealing with numerous customers, and handling money transactions. I've learned how to be patient and also how to work in high stress situations."
good,"The workplace is solid and the hours are flexible. Unfortunately due to the numerous amount of employees that work there, each person individually does not get much hours"
good,I got bored standing there at same place every day the team members were mean i felt like i didnt fit in they were just doing them thing and never asked me if i need help
good,Surviving off of the pay is the hardest part but it can a fun-filled environment for a little extra cash. Working with customers can be difficult but it teaches patience.
good,"I enjoyed working at Kroger for a short time. The coworkers were great and there were a handful of good customers. Every other customer though is kind of an idiot, they never knew what they were talking about and had the audacity to criticize me. If you want to do good work and get absolutely no appreciation from customers or managers then Kroger is the place for you."
good,The company itself is great to work for. I did not like working for some of the managers who were above me. Most of them were hired because of who they knew and not because of their qualifications.
good,You come in and go straight to work. You are always busy doing something with little rest time. You only get two 15 min breaks for a full 8 hour shift. If you want a 30min break you have to stay and extra 30mins.
good,"I loved my job and coworkers. Management made it impossible to enjoy my daily work. They were extremely combative every single day. If they were in a bad mood over anything, it was taken out on the workers, and they worked hard to work against your preferences and requests."
good,"management treated everyone equally even saw the store owner doing just about every single job in the store a one time or another."
good,"As a first job, it's great! You learn plenty about customer service, cleaning, and basic job skills. After learning, you see how much you work and how little you're paid. Minimum wage for cleaning the whole store, bagging everyone's groceries, taking outside shopping carts inside, managing shrink, and dealing with many angry and confused customers? Not enough money at all."
good,"Kroger was a very good place for me to have my first job. The store had a lot of young employees, but the managers had the same expectations for everyone. We were all held to the same standards. Although, I enjoyed working here, it is now time for me to move on to another job that will assist me in my future career."
good,"The job is great for someone who doesn't have any work experience. One of the few companies that offer jobs to those who haven't had one. "
good,the lack of time management is real. they don't do overtime and the lack of management is too much they won't be there. but the people that i work with is great as a team
good,"I do not recall of any situations, I just did my job. I was a cashier , sometimes bag groceries.  I enjoyed having a job. my scheduling was off because of life situation ."
good,"Kroger isn't the best. i hated Kroger, they say they are about team work but they are not. Kroger is only about money and customers. they do not care about the associates"
good,I love the atmosphere and management. They seem genuine and provided a positive place to work. Management genuinely care about their customers and employees needs.
good,The sceduales where hard when they would not work with u and getting moved from 1 postion to anothee is hard. But most manager where cool and good at there jobs
good,"All of the staff was very friendly, understanding, and cooperative, my only problem was that they changed my job title which in turn messed up my availability and ultimately I had to quit"
good,"A typical day would depend on whatever department my schedule whether I make a collaborative effort or get what I can done by the end of my shift. I learned a whole lot in the customer service industry as an associate. The environment is pretty laid back, but he could always get a rush mid day from time to time. Those rushes had me working double time making it a bit harder or more of a challenge in my head. I worked their fuel center, usually in the evening, and I'd have to work alone getting everything done in that department plus locking it up when I'm done. Getting to know the people in my other departments was great experience during my time their."
good,"Buen equipo de trabajo y micho compañerismo "
good,It is an easy job but you do work with others who do not seem to motivated in life and that carries into the workplace. The health care is what keeps most kroger employees to stay becuase its extremely cheap and one of the best. But overall pay is horrile and advancment in the company is not worth it.
good,I don't remember much about working at kroger other than I thought I wasn't getting paid enough to potentially have my fingers snapped off by those god awful cart collectors... I worked til around 1AM at age 15 and only earned minimum wage... I'm sure things have changed but it wasn't very good from what I remember.
good,"Was young trying to figure out what I want from football, girlfriend just in the stage of not knowing it was a easy job for a highschooler would recommend it for someone in highschool"
good,"The Kroger store I worked at had a typical day where the beginning of it would be extremely easy and a lot of waiting for customers to show up.  However, later in the day it would get very busy as customers would all show up at the same time.  This made it very difficult to get orders out efficiently, especially as some of the staff would simply leave and not help out.  I learned that it is necessary to be very patient with customers and always sound upbeat no matter how the day is going at work.  The management was overall good, however, there were times where they would make questionable decisions and move individuals from one department to another even when clicklist was busy.  The culture was not great, as most of the time coworkers would gossip about one another.  The hardest part of the job was learning how to pick the groceries though even this was not too difficult.  The most enjoyable part of the job was how customers would always be extremely grateful when you got their order to them out in a timely fashion."
good,"i didnt work there for very long, it was good to have a new experinece in the job world for once. That is about it i didnt do that much beside sweep and stock shelfs which took all night to do the whole store"
good,the job sucked the hard workers get worked in to the ground while the slakers get away with what ever they want its not fair and if a manger didn't like you that was it
good,"I corralled carts, it was not a fun job in the winter. learned new way for carts to be pushed. I cleaned when asked and used chemicals when needed. I only had 3 hours a week."
good,"When I first started at Kroger I would consider it a good place to work. The manager that hired me was one of the best I have had before and the others where decent as well. However not only does Kroger change management every few months so you never know who is the manager. They also don't communicate the changes to the employees so someone you don't even know starts telling you what to do and you have no idea who this person is."
good,"This job was good as a highschool student as it paid for my gas to and from work and school. didn't much cover the cost of living but I managed to scrape by. The job itself was fairly simple, keep the store clean, and make sure the customer has what they need. The staff was great I actually enjoyed going to work just to see them and my customers smile everyday. Pay wasn't that great but for what it was id recommend it to someone in need of starting off"
good,Fast paced work environment picking orders building pallets operating a stand up fork lift picking orders with a voice operated headset. Heavy lifting.
good,"loved the customers, management needs work, loved the atmosphere of the store. I worked at the Kroger on Hartley Bridge Rd Great sales, very clean store."
good,Jobs are good for college or high school students.  Management could be better. More updated training would be helpful.  Pay doesn't match with what you have to deal with.
good,The job does not pay much. It builds character. The job can be stressful. They hire many students. The company works well with your school schedule. The pay doesn't match the workload. If you're a courtesy clerk it is very possible to move up to cashier.
good,"Manage and the department's daily operations, demonstrated leadership and coaching skills."
good,"I was hired at 16 for my very first job. I bagged groceries, collected carts, and cleaned messes. Seniority leads to career advancement within the company. I left due to medical complications."
good,I started out as a courtesy clerk at first and then i was promoted to a cashier and then my life was made easier nd harer at the same time. I received less hours than what i asked for in the beginning and no manager cared enough to hear me out.
good,"Kroger was a good company to work for minus the salary desired. There was room for advancement depending on how committed you were to your job. Kroger was flexible with days I needed off, there was always a way to work around it. Overall I would recommend this job, if it best fit."
good,"Human dynamic is essential in surviving this company and the tactics the union is involved in.  All in all, stay to yourself and leave when your day is done."
good,"the management in this Kroger that i worked with was very unprofessional , not only in the way they dealt with customers but the way they would deal with employees."
good,A typical day at work was spent dealing with customers as a fuel clerk and maintaining a clean working environment on the outside for customer safety.
good,Not too happy with this company. Got restructured and lost job as Admin Mgr. so was demoted to Fuel Clerk. The company is very disorganized and managers are overworked.
good,"Kroger definitely promotes employees to a degree. However, promotions are almost 100% based on seniority meaning skill and productivity aren't considered when applying for a promotion. This results in a lot of frustration for growing employees. Additionally, managing a department is difficult because you cannot hold your associates to the same standards you are held to. For example, you cannot perform necessary coaching and discipline for productivity to avoid being disciplined yourself for your department's lack of productivity."
good,I do not have anything that I would like to share publicly about this company and it's procedures.  I hope that anyone looking for a job finds the job that they are looking for.
good,this company doesn't pay well and doesn't have nearly any opportunities for advancement an overall bad place to work i wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
good,"Every job I have had at Kroger has been easy.  Some are more stressful for others depending on you and your co-workers.  Pay is low compared to similar jobs in the area, but it's nearly impossible to get fired and they are flexible with your schedule, which is great if you're in school or have another job."
good,"Overall, this company is a pretty okay place to work at. Although, I would recommend it to young adults. It teaches you patience, teamwork, and discipline. The management was okay, although it changes pretty often. Easiest part of the job is talking and interacting with the customers and building relationships with them."
good,I had the opportunity to switch departments often so that helped me stay interested in the job a bit more. It can be fun to get to know the customers too.
good,Retail environment.  Great place if you like customer interaction.  Jewelry business was very rewarding especially bridal sales.  Management was very approachable.
good,typical day starts at 6am do returns or assist customers at the uscan ive had the pleasure to go to supervisor class and supervised my own shift with no problem.
good,"even as a supervisor, pay was a dollar over minimum wage. management was friendly and flexible. decent entry level workplace, but it falls apart once you spend a significant time there"
good,"prior manager of home dept rarely talked to me until we had a survey."
good,"Not bad but not great. I didn't learn anything at the training program I didn't already know. Nothing terrible about this job, but not a place to stay at for long."
good,"potential to grow within company, just not as a culinary. great people and good managers, was a fun job and gained good experience. only benefits offered to employee no family benefits."
good,"arrive at work , make chicken and fried chicken "
good,Pore Management. Did not treat employees very well. Was told this job had opportunity to grow with the company but that was not true. Make you feel like your work was not good enough.
good,"Produce clerk job discription: restock and rearrange fresh produce, organize walk in fridge, unload merchandise from kroger brand vendor trucks, trash duty, and salad bar prep."
good,Fast paced always something to do great people to work with and always busy.great place to work benefits are good as well. customers are always pleasa
good,"Started right out of high school sacking groceries,  From there became a cashier for a while. They needed help in the produce Dept. so i worked as a produce clerk for about a year before becoming produce manager in 2008-2010"
good,"Great work environment, poor hours for part time, was not paid enough, was not as flexible as should be, with okay management as well as okay teamwork on the sales floor."
good,"This place is a good place for a first job, it teaches you some responsibility, and prepares you for other places, but seemed to show no care for advancement, at least to me anyway."
good,"It was a pleasure to work around others (with equal status). It seemed to have made the high pressure support we were giving matter."
good,"Sometimes overwhelmingly stressful, poor management. People that work there were nice, but many people were lazy and management did not do anything about it."
good,"To be a stocker with the company was very relaxing, and it motivated me to do better with my lifestyle because typically I am used to working hard labor."
good,"Kroger is so much more than a grocery store. Our operations span grocery retail, fuel centers, pharmacies, jewelry stores and manufacturing, employing nearly 443,000 associates across the country. We embrace the challenges of new technology and changing customer demographics, while not losing site of the importance of friendliness, freshness and convenience. This combination of new and old creates an exceptional customer experience, and also makes Kroger a place you will love to work and learn."
good,"Currently I work from home. My daily job duties include handling contracts, sales plans, ad grids and display locations. Scheduling new item appointments with vendors and cleaning up ESP."
good,It was an okay time working there. I didn't really have much to do. And what i was told to do got done. Mostly easy to do. Trash and bathrooms were easy too.
good,Management can be slow to follow through with what they say.   3rd shift can be hard on the body.   not really a job for an older person with body pains.
good,A typical day at work is pleasant and enjoyable. I find great appreciation for my managers and co-workers. I learned how to conduct myself in a professional manner and enjoyed assisting customers.
good,*A typical work day consists on constantly walking the entire store multiple times a day helping in all areas and all associates that need help accomplishing their daily goals. *I learned a ton from Kroger as it has been almost my only career. *Management is very inconsistent. There are varying degrees of good and bad managers. *The hardest part of the job is trying to accomplish everything that is required on a daily basis and have a work life balance. *The most enjoyable part of the job is working with all the associates and most of the customers.
good,"When I went to work at Kroger the typical day consisted of stocking and replenishing shelves overnight. The management treated everyone fairly and respectfully and when i needed assistance they would help me to the best of their ability. The hardest part in the beginning was organizing the items that were given and putting them on the ""u boat"" and finding the aisles that they belong in and i learned that over a period amount of time where everything belongs."
good,"Kroger is a good first job for a highschool student, reason being that most of the front end workers are young. Kroger can be very understandable in certain situations when it comes to needing time off. I would not say that it provides a professional environment because of the high school students having the role as supervisor."
good,"I started as a bagger and moved up to produce clerk.  My pay was minimum wage at the time.  I did not enjoy being a bagger, but loved working in produce."
good,"Pretty good company to work for. They pay better than most but only give like 20 hours a week so it really isn't better all around on making enough. Friendly, good prices, some good discounts for employees"
good,Easy to apply and get hired. The training is easy to grasp and the hours are flexible. must be willing to work on holidays but has the opportunity to get time and a half payment.
good,I had a wonderful time working for kroger.The people that I met there was good people to b around.Ilove the people that came to shop at store.I will love to go back.
good,First job did not know at that time about work. Young and still in high school. Good job for someone that is in school and not looking hor a lot of hours
good,"This company has a lot of issues and trouble keeping good help. Pay depends on experience and dept you are in. After almost 3 yrs working there, I've reached my maximum pay. However, there is health, dental, vision, 401K, and discounts on store products. The people I work with have become like family."
good,"Working at Ralph's is fun and new experiences. I feel working at service deli is like working in the restaurant. However, I have worked in the restaurant on my previous jobs. I have also learn to do things that I have never done before in the restaurant like slice deli meat and cheese."
good,Mangment was never together and always sat in the office except for frank. No overtime and raises are super small. . The company had a set raises rate. And the company wasn't understanding when it came to certain health issues
good,"It is an ok job if you are a teenager or are looking for part time work, but it is not something that I would recommend if you are looking for career opportunities."
good,I moved here in the late summer and got my job here but October. was fast pace and I enjoyed meeting new people and able to have customers that was always in the store .
good,it was years ago since I worked here I don't even think I work there long the weekly pay was a plus but it only benefits when your a full time employee
good,"kroger didn’t care about the employees needs, during the time I was working there I was still in school and they didn’t work with that. they’ll complain because I could only work 5 hours on weekdays. they treat the employees poorly (the kroger I was at). I couldn’t find a new job so I stayed there."
good,"If you're looking for a starting job, this is something to put on your resume when you're fresh out of high-school. Advancement? There's plenty of it, but you have to apply yourself. It has a friendly and welcoming atmosphere, I'll give them that. Plenty of benefits, too. But beyond that, they are just a nicer and cleaner, more ethical version of Walmart."
good,"This was a good company to work for, had a great management team back then. People cared and work well together, I felt that management stood behind their employees."
good,Working here was very difficult but also very rewarding. The store is very fast paced and always moving. The customers are great and co-workers and are amazing. Very easy to get along with everyone.
good,great for when I was in school but cant really raise a family on the wages provided in and around my area.  great management room for advancement and just live within your means.
good,"ok place to work, benefits, vacation pay, sick pay, family medical leave act, transfer store locations if wanted, but has to have a job opening there."
good,It can be a fun place to be if you find the environment you want to be in. Management can be friendly at times but that is if you're apart of a friendly working environment at Kroger. They also have inconsistent hours which can vary on your everyday life.
good,"While Kroger isn't the best place to work its not the worst. For some people, its great but for most its not they are stingy with hours and do not like to promote most people which makes it hard to live on such low pay. For others, it can be great if you are a higher up you have excellent benefits."
good,Ralph's was a really good job to start for my first job. i was able to learn the role of customer service and cash handling. With the skills i gain i was able to take with me to other jobs...
good,i don't really know I guess it was ok the work there was really easy to do even when you had to rush because there were so many customers even getting the carts was easy
good,I worked as a clicklist employee and found that it was a good first job.  Most of the employees were pretty chill.  It was easy to trade shifts if needed.
good,"Hard work, decent pay. I left because i was in school and could not balance working grave yard shifts while attending full time college at the same time."
good,"A typical day at work included me cleaning the bathrooms, bagging groceries and retrieving carts/buggies. The managment there was decent. Hardest part was the customer service, getting yelled at or getting blamed for everything wasn't fair. The most enjoyable part were the people I worked with."
good,"I worked in the Deli, so my area was enough. My manager of the deli was amazing, best manager -ever-. My co-workers made it a challenge due to their racism, but it wasn't a bother on my end. I'm used to their type. Days would be long and slow, or fast-paced and short. I enjoyed my time servicing customer, or aiding in producing food for the deli to put out in the store for purchase. So far so good."
good,Enjoy working with customers and being able to move around to different positions. The employees are like family and are fun to work with. Definitely reccomend to someone else.
good,"I enjoyed working for Kroger, the days are fast-paced most of the time and definitely hard work; being on cement floors several hours a day will zap your energy so proper shoes and gel-insoles are key."
good,Not a job for me I dont like the management  and other stuff there what ca. I say lol no one takes your shifts when your sick or even care if u get in car accident
good,Decent work environment. Management team could be better though. Most of the coworkers were nice. Made some long term friendships with coworkers. Shifts go by fast because of the fast paced environment.
good,It was a great job for out of high school but I didn't feel like there was room for advancement do to favoritism they would promote who they liked and everybody else was out of luck.
good,"-Managment is so distributed and lacking in checks of power that it often squanders."
good,It's ok if you really want to work there the rest of you life. The career advancement is ok. The turnover rate is very high for management because there
good,"The stores where I've worked the customers were nice, skme were rude, others were respectful, kind amd curteous. I met some great people while working at this company within the past 11yrs. My time on the front end as a bagger, cashier, and UScan operator were fun, abit stressful, and very educational. I moved to meat in Sept of '09 and found a niche if you will say. I foumd it to be much more demanding as the years went on."
good,"since 2008, I have been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. It has been a great struggle for me, especially moving up or holding a permanent spot where I felt appreciated for all my hard work."
good,It was great for a first job. fast paced and pressure at register to move the line.  sometimes I didn't get enough hours.  Customer service had difficult times. I enjoyed lots of people
good,As a deli clerk my job was to help see to the perfect customer service experience for all customers at kroger. I was also in charge of making some of the food
good,it was an okay company to work for. Long story short I was just the guy that bagged groceries and gathered all of the shopping carts out on the lot so it was just okay.
good,"This job was a good start for me. While attending High School, they were able to work with my schedule. the pay is poor but it teaches you a lot about the customer service industry."
good,My experience was short lived because I only worked their a year. I left for a better paying job and more work experience. It was a fast paced working environment.
good,"It was my first job out of highschool. It was easy work and fun environment other then when needed to be serious, I had  some issues with one manager. Its like she was on me to do all the dirty work."
good,"The management isn't that great, and the pay is your usual minimum wage. They overwork you and don't care about medical issues you may have. Employees aren't very nice to each other either."
good,"it's a great company to work for, they have flexible hours and pays decent... You have to try to make it into management or else you can't make that much money"
good,A fast paced competitive environment where you can work together on a team. Many daily challenges working with different areas of the company to achieve your goals.
good,"Easy, yet most times very very boring. The management gets absolutely nothing done however. The hardest part is dealing with them changing anything at all."
good,i typical work day.........I go in at 4am turn on the computers.....print out the list of customers we already have and labels. I begin shopping.......i'm ther until 12:30pm
good,The job was fun due to meeting new people everyday. Easy work space and your day flies by. Easy to learn. Sometimes it gets hectic especially when you sometimes have to go without baggers and constantly having a line of customers.
good,"Too much rushing, not enough planning and organizing. More help is needed in most departments and the scheduling reflects that. Simply needs to be better staffed."
good,This is a fast paced environment.  With quality products and services.  If you are energetic and like to work this is the place for you.  Always seeking friendly people to join the team
good,The pay was not great. There is a lot of stress associated with being a pharmacy tech and it is not for people who are sensitive. You deal with a lot of individuals who are not easy to work with. Staff was alright.
good,"Job is very menial, doesn't stimulate you. Company is great working with college students schedules but you make minimum wage which is barely enough to cover bills and have money to save."
good,"Pretty much like working in any other grocery store.  Know the produce codes, take items back if people change their minds.  get carts, usually the other cashier are super friendly, as are the baggers."
good,"Job was decent, Ok hours and i can't complain on the work/Pay ratio. The work environment was decent as well. The hardest part of the job is dealing with management."
good,I enjoyed my job just not enough hours i started in fuel center and transfered inside to be a cashier everyone was very helpful and you were paid weekly
good,"The location had a strange stance on how labor was distributed throughout the store, and particularly in our department. The deli always seemed to be short of staff, as I would usually have to work shifts without any supervisor clocked in. Our clerks would usually be outsourced to other departments despite the amount of traffic and sales that would come our way. Personally, I have an inherent level of standards when undertaking a task or role, so when posed with little to no staff, equipment, and large workloads and tasks, I would coordinate tasks, breaks and any other requirements as needed."
good,"Kroger started out as a way to get through college. Now that I'm done, I'm trying to get out. The Kroger Company is more stressful than what I ever knew what stress was."
good,"Kroger is a good company to work for. my only problem is that alot of the rules has changed, and with that, they have hired managers with no experience in retail and that makes the job more difficult because they will come in and tell u to change what you have already been doing for months sometimes even years before they got there."
good,Pushing environment but managers can be overly pushy at times. The managers work with you to do better but they also talk to you in a certain type of way that may hurt people’s feelings at times.
good,"This was my first summer job, so not much to say. The job was straight forward and easy, the job just didn't fit what I was looking for in a job. Hours were good."
good,It was very busy and fast paced in the day time but slowed down in the evening. I learned a lot of social skills and how to deal with customers. The management was great and were always helping customers with their problems. The hardest part of the job was pushing the carts back inside the building. The most enjoyable part was seeing the satisfied customers.
good,"Must have excellent people skills and be willing to work with a team. Can be stressful at times, however, if given the right tools to do the job, it's a lot of fun."
good,"Decent company that often times has a high stress level "
good,Management tends to take advantage of you and your time here.  Also pay is very poor for what you are doing.  Most people seem like they leave after a short term of employment.
good,"I do enjoy working for Kroger , I just need a better job that pays more. I need a stable full time job that will be able to sustain my cost of living."
good,This job was a great first job. I really liked it here. The reason I left was because insufficient pay. Raises consisted of only 10 cents. I got promoted to supervisor and learning everything about the store and never received the raise I was promised
good,Not knowing where i was going in. one day i could be deli the next overnight. good benefits bad people. i stay out one day and they dont work me the whole next week which is the reason i left
good,its okay needs more improvement. befits are good. the way they treat there employees are not. work environment is hectic. needs betters management in high places
good,The workers are hard working and willing to help you learn but the management seems to set you up for failure and not help you learn they just throw you in and its sink or swim.
good,"I think overall, this was a good company for the time that I was there. They were nice to me most of the time, I would recommend it to people who like a fast work environment."
good,Compared to your jobs in a retail environment this is the best place to work especially if you have experience in a customer service and retail environment.
good,this job is great for a person that just needs extra money. mainly high school kids work here. its not beneficial if you have bills because they only pay you 7.65 per hour.
good,"My early days of working at Kroger were fine, and it's a great place to get an idea of being in the workforce. Put in some extra effort and you might even get to work in all the different departments like I did."
good,"Like it says above.  I like the job. I love the people I work with. But the pay is terrible.  My job (ClickList) can be somewhat physically demanding, but I like that aspect. There is a lot of turnover due to management hiring students and because of the low pay."
good,The things I learned at Kroger were. How to bag groceries. Help the customer find certain items in the store. Take the items that the customer didn't want an put back on the shelf.
good,I’v work At Kroger for 6 years and the experience was great at first some of the costumes were nice and others was ok and but when I got cancer and the the store change they took forever to give me my full-time.I had to pay for my medical bills and my hours kept getting mess up.
good,working at Kroger there is plenty of opportunity for advancement most of the environment your placed in is not toxic and in a team based setting so your never alone./
good,It was an okay place. The place is kept somewhat clean its not the cleanest place you'd want to be in but it does tend to necessary items needed when you can't get them anywhere else
good,"If you are just moving to Atlanta, kroger is a good place to start your work history because most jobs ask for 1 year of work experience. It is hard to advance because most of the full time jobs goes to people that have been there if a long time."
good,"Started this job not long out of high school. Stayed 1t yrs. Pay was good, supported and insured my family. Loved my co-workers, still keep up with them to this day. Had some Great managers and a few HORRIBLE ones."
good,This place was ok but the pay was way to little for every thing that they make you do management was a little tough but not unbearable they had there moments
good,"fun environment"
good,"depending on which department you worked in it was a fun low stress environment, not much career progression and low rate of pay. But overall a good job to start out with."
good,I think Kroger is a great company and all the people there are super nice and genuine. Kroger offered me many benefits including health care and such but you're required to work there for a year to receive it. Kroger helped me learn to move about in the working world.
good,"Corporation bottom line is a higher priority than employee benefits.  Union based, but not competitive salaries.  Flexible hours available, but part-time is the norm (max 34 hours/week), as opposed to full-time advancement."
good,most of the employees are nice and friendly hours can be a little rough when the store is short staffed.High turn over Rate more so at the fuel center
good,I worked here a long time ago. It was difficult to advance but the pay could have been worse. People that you work with are great and fun overall. Opportunities for advancement in new stores.
good,Constant moving simple but through tasks. Nice place to work not always the nicest people who work there though. semi hard work and longs days required.
good,"The workers make the job. If you’re in school or someone who just needs something on the side, this is a great job. They’re very flexible and convenient. However, this job won’t really get you anywhere."
good,"Since this was my first Job out of highschool I don't remember a lot about it. The hours were decent, the usual day was boring and people where friendly"
good,Alright Place To Work . Great Staff . Alright Pay . Manager Is Great. Certain Manager Can Be Rude At Times . In General Great Place To Work . You Can Grow There Fast
good,"Working at Kroger can be a difficult experience because management is changed frequently.  In the two and a half years that I worked for Kroger, we had three different Human Resources managers and four different store managers.  There was little consistency and so there was a constant sense of insecurity."
good,Worked before Pick'n'Save was bought by Kroger. Was a nice place to work and had good team members. Schedule was well since I went to school and it was quite flexible. Felt short handed.
good,It was fast at times and slow but mostly fast. Sometimes it was stressful but you just had to push through it. Other than that it was a nice place to work and most people were nice to work with.
good,Very easy job. Management is lazy but it’s nothing to worry about as long as you show up on time every day and do your job. Requires very little effort.
good,Ended up in a position i did not apply for.Applied for a cashiers position and ended up getting a deli clerk's position. Management has poor communication skills.
good,"Working in the pharmacy was great, pharmacists were very helpful in my training and always willing to accommodate my schedule when needed for appointments. Store management can be hit or miss but you rarely had to deal with them."
good,"it’s fine just pays the bills for a Technician it pays lower than most at least for me and I been there for 2yrs and the pay suck really bad, i don’t see why i have to been there for like 4-5 yrs to get pay that other pharmacies start at"
good,"Great co-workers that work with me and the customers. Sometimes customers will be rude to workers and workers can not talk back to them. I learned if you do not go above and beyond and in favor of the boss, you will not advance."
good,This was the rough job I have ever had.  At the time the manager could careless about your school schedule. They would never help me with my after school activities so I had to quit my job.
good,"While working under the management of Kroger, I've learned how to adapt to situations quickly that are out of my control. I've learned not to panic when things go wrong behind the kiosk. The hardest part of the job is not knowing how to please a customers needs when their application goes wrong. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to seeing the customers smile after you've reached their satisfaction. Or when they compliment you on your drink that you made for them."
good,It gave a lot of opportunities but didn't deliver the right amount of training needed to succeed. I loved the people and they were the main reason i stayed
good,"Dillons did a great job teaching me, cultivating me into the successful person I am today. However, the level of stress that all employees feel is unbearable. "
good,I have the opportunity to work with Kroger upon is inception in June 2000 .  I went from being a meat cutter to become an assistant meet manager I was well known for my customer service and strong work ethic‘s .  This allowed me to advance to meet manager where I ran a successful department for one year and rating in the top 10 for sales percentage increase .  I transferred to another store and assume the  position of assistant meet manager but for a year and a half I ran in the department .  I enjoyed my time working for this company and would recommend it .  My only problem was having Sundays off because I am a born-again Christian I want it to have time to worship on Sundays . Other than that I enjoy their daily challenge of my job and having the opportunity to train other clerks and meat cutters.
good,"On a typical day at Kroger, I complete tasks that I routinely work on such as fill prescriptions, type up prescriptions, maintain the pharmacy's stock. My job allows me to grow and improve on time management, adjusting to different personalities to provide the best customer service, and paying close attention to details."
good,it's a great place to start but be ready for major guilt trips if for any reason you cant cover your shift at any point in time. the night guard though is a great guy.
good,Where paid minimum wage for hard labor work in the hot sun. The part I really liked tho us that Starbucks would give us free water when we were tired and that we got paid every week
good,"My store wasn't the best or worst. I enjoyed our customers a lot, but the coworkers were a mixed bag of good and bad. I have heard that Kroger is beginning to actually pay their employees above minimum wage, but their hours have always been quite random. They will give you 12 if they don't like you because the union contract requires it, but beyond that it can be no more than 32 hours if you aren't full time. They try very hard to never let people be full time."
good,Taking customers of your  needs is the most important.Making sure your department is ready for the consumers on a daily basis.Providing a full and fresh  variety of merchandise and a place that your customer can appreciate.
good,I would only recommend this to people who would just want to make money pretty fast. They pay weekly with checks. They aren’t flexible with your personal schedule and don’t have the best communication skills.
good,"Kroger gives a good opportunity to begin your career if you wish to enter retail management. The management training program is open to accepting applicants with no experience in management. However, the hours required are significantly more than 45 hours per week. The schedules for each week as a manager are different and not conducive to a good work life balance. Due to the nature of retail and the busiest days of the week being weekends, it is rare to not be working at least one day per weekend. As a new manager or until you become a store manager it is likely you will be working 4+ days a week until 10:00 or 11:00 PM."
good,"this would have been a four star except for the fact that the manager team does not communicate with one another and doesn't communicate with anyone that is not a supervisor,"
good,not your solid career. but if you are looking into getting a job temporarily or just a side job this is a good company with good benefits but minimum wage.
good,"Ralphs was fast paced and busy, especially during rhe holidays. If you work 6 hours, you better believe you're expected to stay longer but overall it was ok."
good,"Hand pick the groceries for the customer after their order is placed online, then deliver it to them in the parking lot when they arrive. The hardest part of the job was trying to make every picky customer walk away with a smile. I enjoyed the hours I was given and some of my co-workers."
good,"Went into work at midnight. On grocery nights we would move pallets, and on peyton nights we would take a peyton cart to stock aisles. Most days we moved stock from 12 to 6 then conditioned the store until we left at 8:30."
good,"My overall experience with Kroger was stressful. My situation was unfair considering my role within Kroger. I see it only as a place it get experience in for the working world, a stepping stone if you will. Requirements for promotions are not communicated. Coworkers made the work space more inviting and friendlier."
good,It was a stable work environment would recommend this job to friends. the discounts are great. I would also recommend people shop in this friendly environment.
good,"Learned alot from this company, like work ethic, time management, and leading others. I had gave all i could give to this company. But its time for a change in my life."
good,A Typical Day For me was coming to work I smile greeting customers and assisted them. I learned a lot there they depended on me a lot. Management wasn't at it best.The hardest part about the job was team work. I enjoying learning new things.
good,Really easy tasks such as getting product for customers and clean up. Great first time job. Management usually is pretty bad for any part of kroger but it doesn't affect you too much.
good,"Kroger is a nice grocery store and the one I was at upheld pretty high standards, so it was an okay place to work. But the cashier position gets old before long, just standing in the same place all day, and the pay is minimum wage."
good,I can’t remember honestly it been so long since I worked for this company I really can’t say anything bad except working all holidays were horrible for me but other than that it was a ok job
good,At first it was a nice place to work.  However over time it became frustrating trying to please every manager.  Each manager has own agenda. Plus there was always lots of turnover in management positions
good,"Had more work/life balance as a part time clerk"
good,"Working as a Courtesy Clerk I was paid minimum wage, but since I have left they have raised their minimum wage to around 9 dollars. The work environment is not really that bad its kind of a boring task where you do a lot of manual labor and unless you are doing certain task you will probably be standing in the same spot for long periods of times"
good,Very boring and procedural assembly-line style work at Central Fill. On the plus side it's not all that difficult and music is allowed. Be prepared to do the exact same thing every day.
good,I worked at king soopers and I actually really liked my job and I was really good at it. Unfortunately I was involved in a bad work conflict due to an employee that was harassing me and I had to leave seeing as I couldn't relocate. However if that wasn't the case I would've been more than happy with staying.
good,Learned a lot at Roundy was a very great place to work if you can handle long hours.  Would have stayed longer if I wasn't given an other opportunity.  Great people.
good,I worked in the Deli department for a long time I wish i could have moved out of the department because they overwork you and do not have a good structure for you get be able to get everything done in the time they give you.
good,I enjoy working with the team that is in the meat/seafood department.  Good team work ethic.  Very busy due to the location.  Lots of hard work and lifting involved
good,"worked 10+ years ago but it was a decent high school job liked my manager, worked in stocking with a good crew occasionally had to get carts or bag up front"
good,It is a typical job. No room to grow where to where I see myself staying in the future. The people are nice and accommodating just be sure to be adamant about days or hours you are unavailable for.
good,Grocery manager would change dairy order after I placed order to maximum quantity store manager caught on and would change back to normal order. He would change again back to maximum!
good,"Working for Kroger was alright. I wasn't getting paid as much as I would have liked (I was being paid minimum wage.) I feel like I deserved atleast 10 dollars per hour for the position. Co-workers were not the friendliest. There was very little training. I was expected to just learn as I went. Management was not very good, there were several managers while I was there and they kept getting replaced with new ones who hardly knew their job. They made me transfer because they told me they did not have enough hours to give me even though people who were hired after me were not told they had to transfer to another store, only me."
good,"For the most part it is a great job, however their are some minor problems. The hours that a normal cashier would receive is almost never consistent. Also there are some problems with scheduling. Almost everyone is friendly or at least tries to be, but again the problems are minor."
good,"There never seems to be enough courtesy clerks in order to lighten your running around, but overall it is a decent experience. I preferred stocking rather than working in the front of the store."
good,"I did not like the bathroom policy. Also leaving at 11:15 pm by myself in the dark."
good,This job gave me the opportunity to learn much about the grocery non food industry. I learned how to order for and set ads based on the needs of the neighborhood in which the store was located.I also learned the margin of profit and markup.
good,"The benefits are great and the majority of employees are fun to work with. It's a good place to work and a good job to have, so long as you can get a good manager; then again that's probably true of any workplace."
good,It was a good job that paid decently for a for a first job. Enjoyed the people I worked with and enjoyed my job in general. It was a relaxed job but quick pace as well.
good,"I would bag groceries, jump to different isles when we had a lack of baggers. I would also retrieve carts for 30 minutes at least twice every shift. I had to have a good sense of customer service."
good,"I enjoyed working at Kroger. A typical work day was pretty relaxed, I didn't allow the potential stress opportunities of the day to get to me. I learned multiple things while working here. Customer service, money handling, conflict resolution, and multiple other skills. Management I believe did the best that they knew how. They were cooperative and tried to keep morale high. The workplace culture was mediocre. Some employees didn't enjoy their jobs, but others did, and I tried my best to continuously point out the positives of the job so that no one was miserable. The hardest part of the job was anticipating what would sell from week to week so I could ensure that I ordered the right items to keep my section in stock. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people. I was blessed enough to make relationships with several of the other associates and I enjoyed my interaction with them on a daily basis."
good,the working environment was great. the employees was great to talk to and had amazing personalty's. the management was also amazing. they treated everyone with respect.
good,"i started in the pharmacy as an extern technician, after 200 hrs i got hired at min wage.  it was a great place to start real world experience in pharmacy. I spent a year learning before moving to a different company for $4/hr raise."
good,Working in the pharmacy was good for a college student working through school. The company gave sufficient hours while being considerate of my school schedule.
good,"Kroger will not dazzle with its mundane work, but they do strive to have a friendly work environment and the people who work there are generally very nice."
good,"Not only did I cut meats and cheeses for customers, I also seasoned and cooked rotisserie chickens, made sides such as potato wedges, macaroni, green beans and more."
good,"It is a good part time or starter job if you are willing to work and put an effort into your job. Most of the people and customers are friendly, outgoing and willing to help when needed."
good,"It was a fine environment for working, especially that the other employees were ready to help. Management were good people, but sometimes, were far too short on some things."
good,Worked with an assigned Kroger purchasing manager to set uo and on line bid for services or store construction. Set parameters and find qualified suppliers to bid.
good,I wasn't very fond of the area i worked in due to its unorganized team. I consistently had to learn everything on my own wasn't taught specific ways of doing things and was reprimanded on things i still wasn't even aware of at the time.
good,although it was a fun working environment. it was my first summer job that eventually their hours would conflict with my school schedule. I have recommended several of my friends to work there.
good,"Kroger has incredibly innovative ideas. They are always looking for ways to improve the customer experience. This customer first mindset helps explain why they have been industry leaders for generations."
good,I was enjoying my role with this company until i came back from medical leave and was informed that i no longer had a job I was not treated fairly Unsatisfied
good,It was nice working overnight but the guy I worked with wanted me to know where everything I was stocking was in two nights there.He was also very rude and not very helpful in training me.The work was not hard but I was not trained correctly.
good,"Registering new customer"
good,The customers can wear you down over time and if you don't make friends with the right manager then there isn't any room for any sort of career advancement
good,"Liked the people I worked with. A quick-paced objective minded workplace. While at Kroger, I learned how to check inventory, as well as make orders for the produce department."
good,"Hard to advance into a decent wage. Good for high school student that doesn't need much to live on. Easy going and flexible schedules on front end. Good staff."
good,I was a cashier for a bit and then worked behind customer care and then I became a supervisor. I learned to lead and how to manage things like making sure the customers got the help when needed and they weren't waiting in line forever. I made sure my coworkers got the breaks they needed and on time to where it followed a pattern so one coworker would go on a 15 min break and would come back in time for another coworker to go on a 30 min break. I would cover a coworkers register sometimes while they were taking a break so customers didn't have to wait in line. Management was awful to the point when I called for help they wouldn't come down and help. They mostly sat in their office and wouldn't do anything
good,"It was a good starter job and overall isn't the worst option available. How much you like it can depend on management, so that is a hit or miss. Overall though it was fine."
good,"Dealing directly with customers and being able to help them out was a good part of the day working here. Always be knowledgeable of everything they carry or at least be aware of who you can ask to make sure that the customer gets the best service they can."
good,It was fast paced due to being a cashier but stressful at times due to customers being impatient and wanting things to move faster working with certain people was always good because if you got stuck or needed help they were there to help you
good,"The job isn't bad at all. What makes this job bad is the management. The manager I had gave us inconsistent work hours along with consistent four-hour shifts and repeatedly gave people less than their minimum hours. Other than having to deal with the unorganized management the job is pretty basic. You have to stock the shelves, help customers, and faces the isles."
good,"not bad for a first job at 16 and still in high school, works well with school schedules.  Met some great people there while working and many different departments"
good,Worked at the deli. Managers were abysmal. Teamwork and friendship was good. Customers were the enemy. Probably a typical retail/food service type of environment.
good,This was a great company to work for. I worked here many years after highschool. It was a great first job and I have great memories from all of my years here.
good,Good expierence for growth and always busy and a good environment and room for growth and a lot of hours. Fun environment with hard workers working as a team
good,ok for a part time job. this is a easy place to work for they are decent o employees just don't pay well..alot of call off to many young workers who don't care.
good,"most work days started off cleaning anything leftover from morning while helping customers, followed by making sure everything was stocked while helping customers when approached. before closing up make sure all backroom equipment is cleaned.on ocassion comunication was horrible between departments. i learned basic interations acceptable for customer service. the hardest part is when getting overwehlmed with customers and still expected to do daily routine in the normal ammount of time. the most enjoyable was getting to interact with other evening associates, as well as interacting with the same customers everday."
good,"I've had the chance to learn alot within the company which gives me a chance to move around or up in the company.  I've learned customer service,  how to stock,  fill, and build shelfs and displays.  Also learned how to receive orders, write orders,  unload trucks, ring up customers, hang tags, manage a department and employees."
good,Kroger wasnt a bafd place to mwork it just wasnt for me is all I  would recommend a friend or family member too work for Kroger they offer tutition fro college students .u get discounts for employment
good,overall kroger is a good company. some of the people that work there need to fix some things but other then that it is great. the managers are good at what they do. most of the coworkers are good at what they do as well but some of them are not.
good,"Some days are busy, other extremely slow but there was always something to be done, like make sandwiches for the next day, refill gelato cases, makke fresh coffee; etc."
good,"I liked working at kroger, because of the people not really because of the work environment. but after a while i got accustomed to it and ended up liking it"
good,"The people who work there tend to be very fun. It can be inconsistent of busy or slow and you know know how a day will be but you're never bored, there is always something you can be doing."
good,"I was an excellent worker. Hired in part time, worked full time hours. No benefits. Good people mostly that worked near me. Management chnaged quit often but they were all very polite professionals. Free water was a perk. And we had free meals at work on special occasssions. Daily huddles with employees meant snack time!"
good,"I think that Kroger is a good place to work if you are a student, or starting in the work place. Hours are flexible, however there is no set schedule, and therre is often a lack of communication through management"
good,The employees at Kroger were very friendly and fun to work with. The team members at my store were great at heling me learn the store and showing me how to do my job.
good,"Will work you to death depending on your Manager. I was a Courtesy Clerk and they expected me to bag and get the carts at the same time, and there was like 7 other courtesy clerks."
good,"The job itself wasn't very difficult, but very non-stimulating and repetitive. I was a day stocker. Although, I did learn many useful skills such as working in a sales environment, ordering items and checking inventory, cashiering, working pallet jacks, handling products correctly, etc. I worked at the front of the store in the nutritional section and was cashier trained, so they would always call me up to cashier when lines got large and a lot of the time it would create frustration in our department as half of us couldn't get our work done because we were stuck on registers half the day. Because the front end wasn't managed very well, a lot of the responsibility was placed on us to maintain the front end when we didn't even work in the front end."
good,not a bad place to work. easy going environment. management could use a little work but they have there good days. the people as always nice and your coworkers as well.
good,"Helped customers, cleaned after the managers. The morning people makes a massive mess and doesn't clean up after themselves so the night crew has to clean everything."
good,Helped to cook the food and breads. Frosted and decorated cakes and cupcakes for sale in the store and for customer orders. Stocked sales floor and did markdowns. Helped out on registers when needed
good,i worked witch customers and some of them were vary nice and others were rude. cleaning the pumps and taking out the trash. stocking the coolers cleaning the concrete when it needed to be done
good,"I assisted customers in the location of items based on needs, interests, and wants. I arranged shopping carts in the designated area for the upkeep of a clean shopping environment for the customers. Ultimately, I provided customers with assistance in transporting grocery items to vehicles to create a pleasant shopping experience."
good,I enjoyed the work I did but the managemnt was awful. There was always talking behind your back and if the store director had a problem with something I was doing he wouldn't tell me. He told everyone around me but me. It became to stressful to contiue.
good,Its a grocery store chain. It is infuriating. Very few managers actually truly value the people that work for them. The good ones don't stay in one place for long.
good,Over all the tasks were not difficult and the atmosphere was friendly. I rarly had a complaint about managment or my daily tasks being overwhelming. Overall it was a fair job.
good,"Very busy location, The management wasn't fair at times keeping me outside and not making other with the same title go get carts. I'm athletic so sometimes the girls or older courtesy clerks weren't made to go outside"
good,"I did stocking, unloading truck, inventory, many times when it was time to get off, we were then notified that we needeed to stay extra hours, they need help and the management coukld be more helpful and supportive"
good,Kroger was a okay job they also didn't pay me enough and i didn't get the hours i actually wanted they paid 8.50 a hr when i first started but besides that management was nice .
good,Ok place to work. Did not give much opportunity for in store advancement. Hours were not  consistent. Floor manager was not professional and often talked to you about personal things in front of others
good,"I wish not to leave a summary for this employer. "
good,I liked the job but the pay was low and I only received a .25 cent raise per year. The unloading of the truck was always left for the night shift whether I was by myself or not.
good,It was a good first job to keep during high school. It helped me learned the basics of customer service and cash handling. It was flexible with hours and pay was good enough.
good,"It's a job where you pretty much know what to expect, depending on the postition of course. The workload and stress depends on what sales are going on."
good,I worry that people will start working here without understanding the type of work you'll end up doing. when push comes to shove you'll be working many house 4-6 days a week with fair pay.
good,"The store I worked at was fast paced. A lot of times it would crowd up at the front because the front end was managed poorly. Hours were always changing because the supervisors, depending on who made your schedule, would change it in the middle of the week. Overall, it was laid-back but you had to put in work when it was due & they made you do unnecessary/ extra things."
good,"I was very nice at the time, mainly because i was a younger man. As my time there came to a close i began to question the pay because of the tasks we performed."
good,"A typical day is very busy, non stop customer service. My immediate manager is very easy to work for  unlike some other managers I've worked for in the company. In general the company seems to only care about the bottom line, money!"
good,It can be a fun place to work but management makes working there miserable and nobody wants to work there. Short of staff seems like nobody wants to hire people and it causes the good workers like myself to become stress and work in a hostile environment.
good,It's a great summer job or a job you do while your in collage but I don't see how someone could live off of that pay. You get a .10 cent raise every six months and you get paid minimum wage. Good luck trying to start a family in the first 2 years working there. You'd have to work there for about 5 years to even try to afford for you and a spouse.
good,"Had support and an opportunity to move up in the company. Great people to work with; very helpful, kind and patient. Im thankful for my manager who did a lot to keep my flexible schedule."
good,"I was hired alongside two other employees around the same age. However, although I worked very hard to move up in the company, I was given tougher and more labor-intensive work due to my good work ethic instead of moving up in the company. The management was terrible."
good,An excellent company and environment for those entering the workforce. Opportunities for advancement but salaries do not meet responsibility requirements.
good,"Its not that hard working at Kroger as long as you do what you're supposed to and don't slack off. The employees are nice and friendly, easy to make friends. Management gets things done and are pretty nice."
good,"They had a nice store and nice employees. The workroom was clean sometimes. They had somewhat good customer service, and it was had to work me because of my school hours."
good,If you are young trying to build a career with Kroger than start.. I personally didn't plan on being employed there this long lol..but overall it's a good company.
good,Job was fast past and each shift there was a lot to do. if it was a big load to break down that would take you a while and then stock it all would really keep you busy.
good,During my time there it was ok to work there. I didn't have enough time to really benefit from the company. I worked as a Pharmacy tech. Average day was dispersing medications to the customers.
good,On the long term the job will wear on you and the low pay isnt worth the stress. A five cent raise every 6 months isn't a good enough reason to stay more than 2 years. The people you work with will be nice but management at certain stores don't seem to live up to their job titles. Learned a lot of experience dealing with money and preventing fraud and met a lot of nice people. However the low pay and lack of opportunities to move up makes you feel very stagnant. The worst part of working here is dealing with the same customers who give the same problem every day and management not listening to complaints. The high turnover rate speaks for itself as well. When one person calls out or doesnt show up the rest of the team suffers.
good,management needs to learn from employees that are there everday and it is a good company to move up with if that is what you want to do and it can be fun if other employees don't complain all the time
good,"Kroger is a pretty typical retail-type job. The nice thing is that it has a union, making it a step above most retail jobs. If you are lucky you can get full time with pretty good benefits, from what I hear."
good,I loved working at Kroger’s. If I needed hours to be adjusted they did so I just didn’t like that I got paid minimum wage and  I barely got any hours.
good,"Again, I am applying for a job on Indeed and it is asking me to review a job on my resume that is really old.  I am typing this in so I can get through this but dont use it for making any decisions."
good,"I loved working there during my two years, but starting pay is extremely low and you only get a 5-10 cent raise each raise.  Standing on my feet for 8 plus hours also was not my favorite."
good,"The job I have at Krogers is a good job but not a job for me. The management is difficult to cooperate with, and 39 hour work weeks is not what I'm looking for."
good,"typical day was stock shelves and help the customers "
good,Great friends and good company to work for. You have to be people oriented and had good public skills at all times. You have a good opportunity to move up in the company.
good,The staff at Kroger was caring and kind. I felt overworked and was called on a lot when no one else would show up. It was a seasonal job for me because of school.
good,The culture at Kroger's could be fast pace depending upon the time of year.  Through the holidays we were extremely busy.  The most enjoyable part was getting to meet new people everyday.
good,"MGT was okay, doesn't do much to help........."
good,"A typical day at work is depending on the day and sale. Sometiems, it is stressful, busy , and tiring; however on the other days, it is slow and simple"
good,"I like working at Kroger because I get to meet a lot of diverse people that come through my check out lane. Overall they care more about how many items you ring per minute, compared to customer service."
good,It was a nice first job to have and allowed to me gain experience within the workplace and know that I wanted to get my college degree and help individuals the best way i can.
good,"It was a easy place to make money while I was in high school. Provided me with flexible hours so I could balance work, school, and track without a problem."
good,Great place for associates. Once Management the expectations are not achievable. Above store management you will receive no positive reinforcement.  Lesser than average pay for associates.
good,"great job for a retired worker or a high school kid"
good,"It's pretty standard as far as typical grocery store job. People can be kind, mean, picky etc. and you have the same expectations to deliver quality customer service. Sundays are the absolute worst days to work so be wary about Sundays. The people that work at Kroger typically don't stay for long. The older folks that have no choice but to continue to work at Kroger stay while everyone else, including managers and supervisors, come and go. If you have a lead positions, expect to be on the edge of tearing your hair out. I hear it's terrible and managers are often against you."
good,The weekly pay is amazing but the cost fight for hours and comfortable shifts is not flexible which makes life outside of work tiring and complicated.
good,"Fred Meyer is a typical Retail Store with a popular and large Deli that provides a very fast paced but stressful job environment. Daily products include fried and baked chicken to making grab and go sandwiches, salads, hot burrito bar, and freshly sliced deli meats and cheeses. Overturn is steady tho, that makes it stressful as we are usually working overtime with too few people to do the work. Management is supportive and workers are all very friendly and eager to help each other making it a better place to work."
good,"First job I ever had. Hard work, but worth the pay. Sometimes you'll find yourself working alone on 10 isles. I don't recommend a career here but it's something to get you by."
good,"Kroger was a decent place to work. I had to leave for personal reasons. They were reasonable and fair. However, I would not go back to work there. I am looking for a better opportunity."
good,"For a first time job it was okay. Was given 40 hours originally, asked for lower hours for school so they dropped me to 8 hours. Very immature and is the reason for leave."
good,Requires team spirit and collaborative attitude. Your success hinges on your ability to work with others and handle frequent interruption. Anyone can learn to do well here if they follow the rules.
good,"My particular store did not treat their good employees well. For example: if you have a good employee and cannot compensate with pay increases, one should give an accommodating schedule."
good,Bagger's are always busy with their job. The managers were always on top of things and making sure nobody is being lazy. there is always something to do around the store. They are very set on your sceduale.
good,"- Work was guaranteed and responsibilities were fairly straightforward. Although there were long hours, and lots of unscheduled overtime. (Was not hired on call)"
good,"co-workers  and managers are nice but they arn't open to new idea and changes. Hard work but friendly environment. Low cost health Insurance. Accosiates discount for Company""s products"
good,"Everything was okay, ever job has its pros an cons. I loved working for kroger but they didn't give me the hours I desired. So i had to leave. it was a great place to work for if they like you they move you up."
good,Very political place to work. Demands a lot of commitment pay is below average for industry. Will be asked to work additional alot. Turnover is very high.
good,"Being a team player builds the departments trust. You have to be able to work together in order to get the job done. As for me, I oversaw 4 divisions with 12 ASP's as well as for the accounting dept."
good,"Front end cashier, assisted with customer service, managerial duties as well. Workplace culture was very diverse and relaxed.  It was an enjoyable experience."
good,interacted with customers constantly and learned how to deal with difficult people.just a paycheck not really a job i was trying to advance in. minimal pay and minimal skills needed to do the job.
good,"Overall was a decent place to work for until they started taking away our benefits and pension.  They gave us 10 percent discount on their brand name products all the time and several times a year would make the discount bigger, which would help."
good,"Typical day was cleaning and straighting up my area which was the dairy section, then restocking anything that was low in my area. Learned good customer service and how to use floor jacks. management is good they will work with you. its pretty laid back but you need to make sure your area is taken care of and be willing to help out other areas when needed"
good,Started my career with company in high school and continued during college due to flexibility with my class schedule.  Very friendly coworkers and enjoyable atmosphere. Liked working with the public and assisting as needed.
good,"Management was rude and treated the courtesy clerks, who were mainly teenagers, with little respect. However, I had a fun time with my coworkers and made some great friends while working there."
good,"Great for a first job, most people stay in the company for a long time. Management changes so often there's no real consistency with it. Hours vary, they tend to give the bare minimum amount of hours, and don't schedule enough people."
good,"Shifts are always 8 or 7 hours, honestly nothing too crazy about that. The only way to work ""full time"" is to work mornings which starts a 5 am and goes until 1. There is quite a bit of micro-management and can be very stressful at times."
good,"the pay sucks very bad, not any raises worth working for unless you have already been there for 75 years. management has a tendency to be terrible so just be careful"
good,was a really fun place to work and is a really good starter job they help u out alot but the pay is just not that great and ur hours are never gaurenteed i started at around 35-40 then got cut all the way down to 12-20 then got sick and had to quit
good,"pretty much what I did was bag items, clean messes, and push carts around but I could accept tips so that's fun but this job definitely isn't fun during the summer time"
good,a typical work day at krogers is very busy and i feel that i was getting underpaid for the work i did for krogers and i knew the store inside and out i wasn't just an cashier i was also a front end manager sometimes. u-scan.
good,"You usually had about 10 or so orders an hour and you would just deliver the order to the car. Also, you could be someone who picks out the order which was much better in certain temperatures."
good,"They expect a lot from every employee, and do not give them a fair amount of pay for what is done. They also tend to look down their noses at employees, even those that perform their jobs exceptionally."
good,"If breathing flour into your lungs isan issue than don't work here.  Also, a very hot place to work. Clean work environment with a lot of people that are willing to help."
good,"Bagging and getting carts is an easy task but you must move quickly to get keep lines short and carts in garage. At the store in cedar bluff, managers are strict."
good,Very busy during work time. Constantly on your feet. It gets very busy in the morning and late evening. Pharmacy patients usually have a lot of insurance questions so we would help them with that. Pharmacists would answer any counseling questions.
good,the summary says it all. this was mainly my job that i had while trying to attend college at the time. however i do remember that the management was informed when i signed up for the job knew that i was going to school but still assigned me hours during class consistently even after showing them my scheduled. had to leave due to them wanting me to pick work over school.
good,it was a lot of drama and unorganized. breaks were short and part time employees were treated unfairly. management treated customers wrong and attitudes were outrageous.
good,Hours are very flexible and you get pretty good benefits. Would not want to make a career out of it. Holidays are very busy and it is hard to get off becuase of workers that have been there longer.
good,I had to work long hours. There is never a set time that you are supposed to be done working. Everybody is required to stay until the job is finished.
good,"I have learned a lot about retain by working here, however the pay isn't good and the are unfair to employees.. the place overall is a great place to work."
good,Always told there isn't enough hours to pass around so hard working associates always pick up the slack and end up doing the work of two plus people. Certain departments are told they don't need the help as much as the other and have to deal with being short handed often. I have fun when we are fully staffed and everyone feels like they accomplished their goals by the end of the day.
good,Fred Meyers gives great benefits to save money buying stuff in their store but it is difficult to advance and if you do advance you have to sign paperwork that you will relocate wherever they send you.
good,"The actually job could be demanding, and as a courtesy clerk, management was reluctant to give more advancement opportunities. Management was always in rotation."
good,I not qualified to give a review on a company that I only have a minor involvement in then overall scheme of things. this survey is silly and I don't like being asked to do it
good,"The job itself was fine, I did not enjoy the environment and the coworkers that I worked with. They constantly put me down. It was a tough place to work towards the end, but in the beginning it was fine."
good,a typical day at bakers was very entertaining. I always seen people i knew because of the prime location plus who doesn't need groceries? As a high school student this was the perfect job for me.
good,management lacks in times of need and incompetent people are often hired since it is not a desirable place to work. Wouldn't really recommend working here unless it is a last resort.
good,Always busy and management was never on the same page with how things should be ran. coworkers were very nice and so were the customers. I learned a lot about customer service.
good,"I had no problem with working at Kroger's i was there for 10 years,I just had an opportunity through a friend to go elsewhere and make more money. i know a lot of people that still work there and enjoy it."
good,You have to be willing to deal with people you also fill prescriptions and give them out to customers have to have great attitude it is a really good job
good,Pay is really bad. Cannot live off of the “part time “ salary. I would actually like working at this company better if the pay was better. This is the only reason I don’t look forward to coming to work everyday.
good,Kroger has been a good starter job for me . For the work that is done I do not believe that the pay is enough. Kroger does have good benefits if you work for the company more than 3 years with a full time position.
good,Work starts at 8 am in the morning. We follow strict guideline and responsible for to finish work on time.. But overall it is a good company to gain corporate knowledge from.
good,"The culture at the office was not very pleasant.  It felt like a ""job"" and not a place where you really enjoyed spending most of your time.  It was all about work."
good,"Its good temp job. The starting is all previous experience based. You only get a .25 raise every 6 months. The direct deposit weekly is nice. It gets old fast. "
good,Breaks were very short and on most occasion you don't get enough tie to eat properly and therefore result in health issues.
good,"It was a nice place to work at, the other employees were all kind and accepting. Would definitely recommend and would go back. They taught me a lot about the business and how it works"
good,"The management was poor, and they didn't let you get any overtime,  if you did you were written up. You barely got any hours, and they kept you on the same schedule. Kroger is a great place to shop, a terrible place to work. I wouldn't recommend this job to anybody."
good,"Kroger was a great experience. I really enjoyed the customers. Management were not very respectful to the children employees. There was alot of workplace favorites, which usually hours were given to them."
good,"filled and processed prescriptions, managed pharmacy technicians and interns, mtm/outcome and mirixa focused, vaccine administration required, highly focused on metrics."
good,a day at work at this job would look like me bagging food and running groceries back when asked to. there wasn't much to do for my position. a lot of smiling and greeting customers.
good,"Fun co-workers and a positive environment, but the place always lacked hours and i worked two departments(bakery and produce) I asked loads of times for more hours or to be put to work with some of the other departments, but no one ever stuck with it. It always came down to me having to ask again. Never did i get to just relax and know that the next week i would have that 40 i needed or at the very least something more then a measly 13 hours for a week. Over all if your looking for fun over money then its a great place, but if your looking for a job and something to pay rent you'll ether need to make sure your getting a full-time position or something that doesn't involve the retail store or hunt down your boss for ever hour you can."
good,"Kroger is a great first job. It introduces you to money and how to save money. It gave me great people skills, and a good worth ethic. I recommend this for a first time job."
good,"Poor management "
good,I enjoyed working there. Management could be understanding at times. hours are very flexible. Fun environment to work in. I would recommend this as a first job.
good,it was ok for a job as I went to school. I don't have anything els to say about this place. A few more words for this review to be posted for others to read.
good,"I enjoyed my role, out of the front of the store, but management likes to micro manage. Not enough paid time off, and you are penalizied for using sick time."
good,good place to work if your in school still i left because of my summer internship i would go back forsure. staff was good people management was alittle on the angry side towards me because i couldnt work mornings because i was in school but not a bad place.
good,Productive and laid back. not working to hard .  management was ok to work for. my co works was ok we got alone for the most part.  it is a nice part time job to have. if i didnot have a job i would try and go back.
good,Nothing special or unusual about this grocery store chain that also has a pharmacy. I remember it being a decent place to work but it was long ago that a lot has changed since then.
good,"I learned how to interact with customers better"
good,"They would schedule you for 3 hour shifts when possible.  This would include a 15 minute break.  The hours varied, but included the weekend.  It was a fast paced job."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Kroger, my issue with Kroger was I wasn’t getting paid what was stated in the union book. Also my last six months management  was very sloppy."
good,"Great Benefits and good pay. Workload is great, but manageable. I recommend working here. Work life balance could stand to be increased. Many growth opportunities in the company."
good,"This is, without a doubt the easiest job I have ever had. It's too easy. I'm currently a cashier. They either give me all the hours I could want, or they cut them down to barely enough. Being paid weekly is nice. However during training I was not compensated fully as I should have been and it was never irrectified. I am currently looking for additional employment because of inconsistent hours and the need to expand."
good,You are always doing something while working at Kroger. There are only a few times you aren't busy. If there isn't anything for you to do there is always someone else that needs help in another department.
good,"I liked the discounts, the only thing about it is you only get discounts on Kroger brand items and it's only 10 percent. So you don't get discount on every item."
good,"If you need a decent job where you're not slinging plates of food, or selling stuff on the phones this is a good job to work your way up to your dream ob with."
good,Built for slight advantage at words management but it dose help get you by on your basic needs to get by if your looking for a simple job but like friendly working spaces
good,This was a stressful position. The hours worked and days off were very inconsistent. It was hard to have family time as I was scheduled most holidays.
good,I worked at Kroger for about six months my senior year of high school up until the day I graduated . Kroger was different but interesting . You never knew what you would get out of workin at Kroger
good,The only reason I left this position was because it was suppose to be a part time position to go along with my current full time position and managers kept scheduling me for full time plus and I did not want to jeopardize my full time employment
good,general you will greet customers and bag groceries. You would also maintain bathroom and carts hourly. Also restock shelves from the things people didn't buy.
good,This was a nice first job for me to have but they do not pay well for the work that they ask. I worked very hard in Produce with little to nothing to show for it
good,"People came in and out, sometimes they were rude and bossy. We were always told to deal with it because ""the customers came first"". That was so agitating because some ""customers"" would degrade us and talk down upon us, which I could not stand."
good,I did this job during school to make a little extra money on the side. I worked produce. Really enjoyed it. Manager was super cool. Learned a lot about produce!
good,"It is a easy job that I recommend to high school kids, like I did but other than that don't really recommend. It was great during school because of the flexible schedule."
good,"If someone is looking for job that has endless opportunity for the employees, Kroger isn't the way to go. This job is mainly for high school/college students."
good,"Started out feeling great, then started feeling to become overwhelming. Not all around positive attitudes. The feelings of others became to start taking effect into my job."
good,Typical day would be for me was to either unload our delivery truck. Then I would break down our loads on to U-boat then take a U-boat to that floor and stock the shelves. I would also help customers find a certain products.
good,If you aren't a member of management your two jobs are customer service and whatever the manager tells you to do. It is your typical grocery store job.
good,"For everyone at the stores, there was little pay and for those that made more money the workload increased greatly. The business did not want to invest money in the employees, but only cared about the  bottom line."
good,"It was a job, a lot different from Wal-mart and they did not have enough hours for a lot of employees. They need to change how they work their part time employees."
good,"They're friendly!"
good,"A typical day includes stocking groceries, ordering, maintaining accurate balances of product and building displays to match sale items. "
good,All this company cares about is money. They have absolutely no regard for the employees that run their company. We are grossly underpaid & over worked and poorly respected.
good,Kroger was a okay place to be at. Friendly people and you were always communicating with other people and customers. You learned to work with a variety of people.
good,This company helps many achieve goals and move forward in the company. The management is very critical on certain circumstances. Overall the job did offer career opportunities you could always move up in the company.
good,"typically id be expected to pick up the slack that nobody else wanted to do. I was expected to perform the same tasks as people getting paid double as I was. I enjoyed the environment and most of my coworkers, but the low pay and high expectations with no benefits really didn't sit well with me."
good,I love learning new things and helping the customers out. Everyday was something new and a different challenge. Solving new problems was great for me and helped with experience.
good,"Quite relaxed and easy to do untill you have 3 carts of spices that need to be done, not to mention the way everyone gossips about everyone, best to listen to your music and stock merch"
good,"Most of my co-workers were personable and helpful, but management is very detached from the reality of the work, doubly so with the customers. They had too much tendency to prioritize corporate policy and theoretical knowledge of the jobs they oversaw rather than the practical experience of the people doing those jobs."
good,"There are a lot of customers with many questions, most of which are irrational. But it's an easy enough job. Yous pend your day bagging groceries and stocking shelves."
good,"Kroger is a decent store to work, but it is not a job I would consider making a career out of. the wages are inconsistent, and the management is not the best to deal with."
good,"Relatively easy job, just do your job and you will be fine. Want to feel appreciated? Then you are better off somewhere else. Inconsistent management performance."
good,I liked working there. Everyone was very nice. It was my first job and I really didn't know what to do or what was expected of me. But I tried and did a pretty good job.
good,"Dedicated employee's but morale was low. Quick paced, but stressful due to low budgeted hours and micro management from corporate office. Literally every moment is micro managed on a screen."
good,Discount on Kroger brand foods mostly their canned goods. Self taught new computer system as training was not provided. My records showed an average of 400 customer a month would pass thru my register.
good,"As a former employee of the Kroger company, I found it to be a very fast-paced, ever-changing environment with a lack in collaboration from management. The rules were always changing due to the amount of high turn over within the company, constantly putting you in difficult positions. After writing to corporate and raising concerns to management and no change happening, the work environment quickly became stressful. But the pay is adequate!"
good,"enjoyed working with the managers and coworkers learning new things, fairly decent place to work, positive work environment, decent lunch time and breaks"
good,Good place to start for a first job or still in high school or college. Not a place you would make a career out of. Work with your schedule and are not too strict.
good,I enjoyed working there with all the customers management needs to be better there's not a whole lot of respect they don't have enough people working their
good,Part time job while I was a student. Not the best paying but they'll hire anyone as long as you pass the drug test I think. I have no special connection to this place.
good,Cashier duties . Ensured all staging areas are organized & clean . Scanning & bagging .  Maintained high standards of customer service . Ressolved issues proffessionaly & as fast as i could .
good,long hours and horrible work life balance.  quick advancement if you are willing to give up your integrity and time. upper management  know the work load is more than the stores can handle.
good,"- Easy job"
good,"I really did enjoy Kroger, It was a good job that had everything you needed or wanted right inside of it, basically it provided all the things you needed or wanted on break (that you had to buy) the management was fun and it felt rewarding, also the regular staff were good people too all focused on their work, the only downside to this job is the pay(terrible for part time), and the union fee which ontop of other fees took out 25%+ from your paychecks so it never really felt that good."
good,"A normal day would be between 5-8 hours, sometimes needed to stay longer. Co-workers have a strong work ethic, but management wasn't the best. Customers are generally pleasant to work around."
good,"Very typical for an hourly job. If part-time, however, management will schedule you for just under full-time hours so you essentially work full-time but with no full-time benefits."
good,Got to meet a lot of new people got to help people when in need.. got to learn how to make different types of coffee and teas worked at the Starbucks.
good,"It's a customer service/retail gig. The union is nice, but like any retail job the demands are high, communication between team members, supervisors, and management is dubious at best, and some customers like to forget that we're people too. It pays the bills, and your coworkers are often fun to work with, but it's nothing special."
good,High work load in pharmacy for low pay. Dealing with a lot of customer issues and complaints. Enjoyed my coworkers and mangers. If pay was better I would have stayed.
good,minimum wage for full-time hours. and management refused to move me up to a better position because i couldn't work sundays. they asked me to help in other departments when others were out sickand afterwards still made their refusals. i left the company afterthe third time.
good,at Kroger  I worked third shift from four pm till twelve thirty am or whenever we get done. learned to load and unload trailers fast and efficiently and how to operate highlifts and other useful equipment.
good,it is a nice job if you are just starting out. I worked there in my senior year of high school. The work is demanding and it is not stable. Some weeks i was lucky to see 30 hours.
good,"Breaking down pallets, and stocking the shelves, "
good,"its ok for temporary, the pay is not that great they are not competitive. The turn over rates are extremely high due to management and pay, they do not have any employee incentives anymore. The dynamic have changed alot."
good,"You make the money you are quoted to make. Insurance benefits after 3 months. Management is poor. I didn't enjoy the job, though it was nessicary at the time."
good,"This was my first real job."
good,Loved the people and the customers but was very dissapointed when they closed our store down and a lot of people lost their jobs they had for years. It was tradegic.
good,"I work to support customers with finding products and purchasing"
good,i was hired in to load shipment trucks and it was supposed to be a position with no lay offs but that changed once they shut down one of the buildings i got laid off only a couple of months. the winter time is a slow time for insulation.
good,"Kroger is a great company to work for, but be prepared to have very little work life balance. Managers are expected to take up any slack at the store and make everything a priority"
good,love the cke part of the job but the company no you have th echance to be fcreative and also tho follow directions open holiday and hard job with scgeduling
good,"Stock shelves using FIFO system to ensure quality of items for purchase, Assist customers, Track inventory and place orders, Assume managerial duties in absence of manager"
good,"Good job for someone in school. Horrible pay. Should not be based on seniority. The baggers are paid the same as nationally certified pharmacy technicians which is not fair. If the pay was better, you'd get better quality employees."
good,The job was a temporary job and liked  the work. I worked with customers to meet their needs.I cut meats and cheeses as needed. Baked cookies for trays and trained new employs.
good,krogers was a good place to work ..I was an deli clerk so I stocked freezer when needed I was the only male when I was employed there so I did most heady duties
good,Working with the employees and being interactive with customer was a great experience to work for this company was not a hard job really enjoyed being there
good,"Within the Kroger workplace, it was a good environment with a good amount of people, however due to management and the poor communication between Supervisor and employee it became heavily stressful."
good,"Really face-paced environment. Must know what you are doing in order to succeed. Do not expect the job to be done for you, if you don't do it yourself."
good,"It's a rather monotonous job. If you can deal with that you should be ok. Store managers are great but the department manager are not very good. I can't speak for all of them ,but from what I've seen most of them are just looking for a way to get someone else to do their work."
good,"It was all going oh so well training at another store. Moved to new location, ended up pregnant and left at 6 months due to tiredness and complications. So they fired me."
good,"As a cashier no matter where you work you'll have to deal with terrible customers regardless, but I feel like i would be willing to deal with it more if i was paid more. At my current rate i definitely feel like i don't get paid enough to deal with every old lady who demands her 40 cent discount as if its life threatening."
good,Worked here when I was in high school . Was only part time was a good after school job. They are no longer in business in Shawano WI. Was under pick n save
good,I had a great Pharmacist to work with.  I learn a lot about pharmacy and medicine.  I enjoyed helping the customer to feel better who came in for their prescriptions.
good,I like the job but dont like the pay. It was laid back work but fast paced. The people were very nice there. But some customers where very rude to me.
good,manager level people dont tell anyone whats going on just moves them around and work become much more stressful. breaks are give late or not at all do to the managers just trying to finish what they have to do.
good,The work place was very productive.  Kroger taught me to have good organizational skills to achieve excellence productivity.  Great environment to work in.
good,Great place to work as a teenager for my first job. Great learning experience and resume builder. Just helped people bag groceries and helped them to their cars.
good,"lots of opportunities to learn different things, usually friendly coworkers and great regular customers. If you put your mind to it you can rise through the ranks,"
good,"I want to work as much as I can, however I am lucky to get 20 hours a week. The pay stinks for a technician. However you get discounts on grocery items."
good,"Employees very helpful,and respectful,hours are very respectful,customers are very concerned, management was a good laugh,cellphones were always being used while helping customers"
good,They dont pay enough money for anyone that works there. It’s not enough to live off of. Overall is poor but I didn’t work there long enough to know if u get more of a raise
good,Recommend for temporary workers i don't agree working long term at this job because of the pay no one gets enough even for the years they have invested in the company.
good,"If you need money, Kroger needs your help.  Not a well managed company but their desperation for workers can serve your needs if you are also desperate for work/money."
good,Kroger is a good job for long term  but the progressive wage advancement is slow. It is a union company so the daily numbers are high and can be difficult to reach at times.
good,Enjoyed being out among the customers.  Being there for 4 years allowed me to experience many areas of the store.  I especially enjoyed working in Click List
good,"A place where you can make strong friendships. You learn to be organized, upbeat, and friendly everyone you meet. The most enjoyable part is working with your coworkers."
good,Low pay but you are not overworked. People that chose to work here long term can get great benefits. For the average temporary job it was alright but the pay wasnt great except for the overnight shifts in which you were slightly more compensated
good,good workplace that provides an opportunity to grow within the company and has good management and training and flexible hours to adhere to any schedule
good,"Miss working here, never should have left. All of the mangers were nice except the HR personnel. Good hours, and probably would have moved up if I continued working there."
good,It was a very layed back job but you didn’t get as many hours and they don’t pay you a reliable salary they have very good discounts but not as many benefits and they feed you on every holiday it was fantastic
good,"I enjoyed my work very much and even though it was competitive the management stressed the meeting of goals VERY MUCH."
good,before leaving this ob we were going through new management an it was tough having to learn everything all over again and it became hard to understand things
good,"i learned how to clean the toilets, how to stack carts and bag the food. i had a very hard time getting along with people there and the managers everyone there were just not the best but it was a decent alright job for a start not the best."
good,"Its a good place to work with the possibility of cross training and advancement. Store discounts available to employees, raises every 6 months. Great management."
good,fun nice customers most of all the sales were really good along with my discount most of all just a place to work and enjoy meeting new people as well as making the customer happy at all cost no matter what the customer is always right n I made sure they were always right and satisfied
good,only scheduled 16 hours if part time pay is poor its an okay place to work management is really likable and friendly. will come up and tell you youre doing a good job
good,Typical grocery store. At the fuel center things can be a little stressful when dealing with customers reward points. You have to clean up small gas spills as they occur.
good,"My job is very enjoyable and I love it but I need some thing close to home while my children attended school, I need a job that would give reasonable pay, and some benifits"
good,Working at Kroger I met some interesting people. it was nice to leave to meet more new people but I knew Kroger was only temporary it wasn't long before I found a different job
good,I worked in the Corporate Brands department. It was fast paced and exciting and I enjoyed the people I worked with. There wasn't much training or guidance provided and my direct manager was clueless.
good,Kroger is a team based job that has you working in all fields of the job description the chance for advancement is low but there are flexible hours constant work and great team building.
good,"Working here in a low-level position is only as good as your current manager, which likely changes frequently. Advancement requires dedication to a grocery store."
good,"My experience with Kroger has been a roller coaster, from the different customers that come in with the people I work with. The thing I learned with working here is that there is a lot of people from around the world that comes in the store and shop and also there are some rude people that come in and some really nice people. The people that work there are different as well. The good thing about working at Kroger is the benefits. They have insurance and also a 10% discount card for employees that purchase Kroger products. My all together review is that I would not work with Kroger."
good,Wonderful employees and the pay was pretty decent for my position. Unfortunately I would go almost 5-6 hours out of an 8 hour shift before I got a break.
good,Good summer job but wouldn't want to make a career of it. Employees were cordial most of the time. Customers about 50% of the time. It's mindless work for a meager paycheck.
good,"This job wasn't  all that great. i guess it was because of my location. The management sucked, they were never on the same page with one another. The management team at my location kind of wanted you to work more and not get paid for it."
good,"My coworkers are what made the job enjoyable. If only the hours were more consistent within my store/role. Favoritism can be a huge factor. The training was pretty basic, management wants you to do everything and then some. Communication wasn't the best within the management team."
good,"great staff the chef was effeminately a hard nut to crack, but thru it all you will succeed and it will definitely make you tougher. be sharp on your toes have a good memory and you will do fine."
good,The job itself was okay and the hours were very flexible. The only negative thing that i would say about the job is that you usually feel undermanned and need more help
good,"interaction with store management to discuss work load and review schedule and work assignments, review product needs for entire store, order product for the store as needed, check personnel needs for the week, train new employees, assist in all areas where needed, complete and review schedule for the next two weeks etc."
good,"A day work starts seeing where i could be helpful in certain areas... Stocking, Customer Service, Maintaining Receiving, Ordering, Safety , inventory."
good,"Only 12 hours a week. Good place to work because it is a union, easier to fight unfair treatment. Pay was not worth the hours. They do treat you fairly"
good,"When I started, it was a great job. Lack of management skill turned a great place into an unbearable workplace. Management also changes constantly, so if you do get a decent manager, they don't last in your store long."
good,"At this time I can't write a review, but what I can say is that when I staryed with the company under diferent leadership the company was a good career work places"
good,"Too busy and big for the manpower provided during peak hours, weekends and holidays.Benefits were main reason to work there.When they expanded they failed to hire adequate help to staff the place and more customers meant more work but less help.They did offer decent benefits and discounts on Kroger products."
good,grocery night clerk. Quiet relaxed working envirnment.  Nice coworkers. Gives employees discounts on store brands. Over all not a bad job to work at night.
good,"When one is looking for their first place of employment, they are often directed to restaurants and/or grocery stores, I was no different."
good,"boring place to be "
good,very good work place for a person who can rotate schedule.  people there are very friendly...the warehouse is kept very clean and busy...the benefits are great....
good,"great starter job"
good,"The hours was a little crazy, the work was not always as heavy as other days, the freight was sometimes small loads, some of the work was easy. over all not really a bad place to work at"
good,"I worked for the company a while ago so I'm not sure how it is now. But when I worked there it wasn't a bad place to work."
good,"no feet all of you shift, low pay the culture of the workplace depended on who was working when you were I like doing the self checkouts on the day that I worked."
good,"I've learn how to better my communication skills, work as a team player, and to respect everyones opinion. "
good,first job at 16yrs old they would let me off work during my sports seasons and let me return after the season. they supported me playing sports and working
good,"Kroger is stressful, there is no structure. Management is not what it should be and we were very short staffed. Job itself was great but too much drama and pay sucks, not paid what you should be."
good,the people you work with are fun people. they will work with your schedule.  they are very understanding when you have to take a day off. its easy to move up
good,Very fast paced environment. Very difficult to move up within the company.  The work day was very much a routine.  Standards were set in place and the standards changed often.  Excellent customer service emphasized.
good,"Great Management at the district and division manager levels for the Lincoln Nebraska market.  Biggest drawbacks to this company at this time is their hiring practices.  They pay their associates lower than other c-store, fast food, an big box locations.  They do background checks and drug tests, that take in some cases over 2 weeks to get back.  Then they have to wait for the next training class, which depending on when the background results are received can be an additional week or two.  This issue is due to decisions made my Kroger, its parent company.  Kwik shop is in the process of being sold, so this area may be fixed in short order when they are bought in the early part of 2018."
good,"The manager was never there and when she was she yelled at all the employees to get to work while she sat on her phone. The upper management was very poor, myself and other co-workers went to the upper management and told them about our manager and they did nothing about it. I shared personal information about myself to my manager and she told other people where i was, so i came back to millions of questions."
good,It used to fun place to work but know it getting where it is not fun. It seem that i cant have a life out side of the job cause when you try to the tell you cant have that time off I want a job where i Can be home with my kids.
good,"Part time second job.  Worked in Deli.  Job could be very stressful at times and fun at others.  "
good,"The work life depends on the department you work in.  Overall, store management is terrible, but individual managers are usually pretty good.  I would not recommend this for long term work."
good,"Rulers has a good team, and fun and relaxed coworkers. So make sure you have strong communication skills and get along well with others. The hours are low and the wage is low and will mostly get handed to the seniors. That's the only con."
good,its an ok place to work out but the hours are long and the management is ok to fair for the most part the only good thing about it would have to be the discounts
good,I worked at a high volume store and at times it was extremely stressful.  I was in the customer service desk and usually I was taking care of a huge line of people by myself.
good,"If you have a decent manager, your shifts can go really well. But, if you have a manager that doesn't offer assistance when needed, your shift doesn't go that well."
good,Kroger has a fairly relaxed atmosphere and decent benefits.  Emphasis is placed on teamwork and collaboration.  There are fewer advancement opportunities in the accounting center than at the store level.
good,It's just work plain ad simple nothing really gratifying about it. Do your job and you might get promoted if someone else does or leaves. There are plenty of areas within the Kroger brand to work.
good,"I gave kroger 3 years of my life. All I asked was that I was treated equally with my peers, and that they showed that. What I got was the worst hours and the lowest pay in my department. I was paid lower than the new recruit fresh outta high school. Not by a little.. 3.00 / hour less. I was getting 7.55 at the end of my time with kroger.. 3 Years. .wasted. Only good thing I got was paid vacation and personal days."
good,"For the most part, customer service jobs don't pay well in the first place. The environment was decent while some of the managers seemed to be on somewhat of a power trip. The actual work was pretty occupying; however, most responses from management positions were normally criticism, typically unrewarding."
good,"The store is overwhelming majority of the time. They need to employ more people because we are stretched so thin. On a more positive note, my co-workers are lovely people to work with."
good,I worked at the warehouse for years.  It was obvious things were not going as planned with the direction it was headed.  Management was spread too thin.
good,Boring and monotonous like any grocery store. Employee turnover is high because of low wages. Not much room for career advancement. Customers can be rude.
good,"Very busy store, needs better management. more help on the front end. employees could be more helpful. more store sweeps would be make a difference. plus more security at night."
good,A lot young teens with not much training. Need a lot of assistance at first instead of getting real training like some. Real competitive in trying to have the best checker time.
good,"clock in ,cut open boxes of inventory, place inventory on shelves where needed. Take remaining inventory to back stockroom. while in stockroom see if there is any items you can use out of back stock on shelves"
good,Work was stressful and was looking for something that was more family friendly. Great experience and coaching but higher management was not very welcoming.
good,"Overall I enjoyed working at Kroger, but could not stay due to the low pay and non-existent raises. They will work you full-time even if you are listed as part time and not pay you rightly for it"
good,"As it has been many years since I worked for Kroger, I am unable to provide a current review. My experience at the time was that of any retail pharmacy job."
good,"While working here it was very laid back. I was still in college so it was a great fit. The hours I worked varied. It was between the hours of 6 am and 12 pm. I easily advanced. I started off as a cashier and quickly advanced to customer service. I was also crossed trained in the floral department, fuel center, as well as a supervisor. The supervisors/ managers were okay. Sometimes the managers would just pick anyone to supervise over the other employees. It was a very immature staff of mostly high school and college students."
good,"overall the job at kroger was a decent job good for people of just about any age. while the shifts were inconsistent and the management was decent, I enjoyed many of the people i worked with."
good,Co-workers were amazing. The head floor manager was unprofessional. The8 hours standing in one place is hard on the feet but working with the customer made up for it.
good,"A typical day with this company is always busy, with friendly colleagues and understanding managers. I really do like the community and the customers that frequent this location."
good,"The stores are a very fast paces and stressful."
good,"Great experience, learned a lot. Just got a little tired of the graveyard shift, but as we all do from time to time figure the grass is greener on the other side. And we leave our security and find ourselves paddling against the flow. Wouldn't mind doing it again."
good,If you would like to learn how to work and become a diligent worker this is your place. This place will keep you busy and focused on working and becoming well at it.
good,Kroger is a very busy store. Collecting carts was hard on the back. The parking lot was laid out poorly and difficult to maneuver around when helping customers.
good,"I worked in the deli but there are many departments in the store. "
good,"Typical day in management would include filling out a lot of paperwork, providing excellent customer service, multitasking, spending a lot time walking the store and ensuring the departments are up to standards. However there's not a lot of time to take a break or sit down and have a snack. Everyone else's needs comes before yours and that could get very discouraging."
good,Kroger is a ok place to work not everyone was a bad seed just some of the management team never wanted to listen to the associates. especially when u had a serious matter
good,"Kroger was high volume and enjoyable, if you had the right attitude. I enjoyed customer service aspect of the job. I was a good front man for meat and seafood. People enjoyed coming in and talking and ordering from me. Always tried to make it a nice experience for them."
good,I was working with Kroger through the summer I decided to quit because the new school year was coming and I could not drive at the time my mother was taking me to work and I thought it would be too much to handle without a car.
good,"Lowing paying job. You are surrounded by lowlifes. They should pay us a lot more and have clean restrooms, too. In a few short years, all these manual labor jobs will be replaced by AI and robotics."
good,"I worked at Kroger General Office I trained and made sure that all our information in our system was correct and complete.  "
good,"stressfull,hard work,yet enjoyable to work with customers and times not enjoyable to work with customers..company had somewhat good policies..still good company to make a career hours and weekend shifts and working holidays take a while to get use to"
good,"Retail chain focusing on clinical side of retail along with usual retail chores. Big focus on vaccinations, mtm, medication adherence, and 90 day supplies."
good,Don't make a career out of this unless you really love it. It's high paced and most of the time you feel like you don't get paid enough for the stuff you have to do.
good,"Kroger was alright. While it didn't pay much of anything, I also didn't need much money at the time. I worked at three different store locations in Georgia."
good,"Krogers is a great place to work at and the employees make it better.  However, the night shift is a difficult task due to the fact that the 3rd shift hours are always understaffed"
good,"theres room to grow which is great, as long as youre the right fit. Kroger can either be your best friend or worst enemy. in general its a great place to meet people, sometimes the work can be really busy especially during holidays depending on what department youre in (eg meat department gets busy around thanksgiving)"
good,"When you hit the time clock to clock in for your shift, its like walking in the doors to your grandmother's house on Thanksgiving day. It is very chaotic yet very warm and welcoming too."
good,Very pleasant job but the pay was unacceptable. You received a 25 cent raise once a year. Manager was pleasant and understood that I was looking for employment with more pay and benefits.
good,I enjoyed working at Krogers for the most part. The only things i disliked was the pay being minimum wage its hardly enough to get by when they put you part time. Also another thing would be wearing wet clothes throughout the shift because i was left to clean the cutting room after butchers were done cutting up the meat needed throughout the day.
good,My typical day at Kroger was to make sure the older produce get put out and saved. I was to clean the produce and make sure it was up to part to be put out.
good,"Once you figure out what you're doing its a pretty simple job, Kroger is a union so that part of it was pretty nice, When i was there it was 4 days on and 3 days off so it was pretty nice. As long as you could pick up 75 pounds at the most and maintain a constant pace you shouldnt have a problem there."
good,Very hard to get full time hours.  Had to go to 3rd shift to get full time.  Co-workers were great.  Some members of management were difficult to work with.
good,"I was a bagger at Kroger when I was 16, It was a good first job. They worked around school and it wasn't hard work. It is very repetitive and boring but overall not bad."
good,Kroger is a good first job. It teaches you what to expect in the work environment. You get paid by your experience and they work around your schedule.
good,I came in was expected to do a three person job in a one person timeframe the co-workers were helpful and made it a great work environment but the management made it impossible to progress
good,"though i do enjoy working at Kroger helping customers and getting along with co-workers, i would not want to have Kroger be my career. great place and training but i feel training should be more heavily upheld and enforced"
good,i had a coworker in the meat department that treated me like dirt. she would cuss me out in front of other customers and act like nit was no big deal.
good,It was a good experience progressing my skills in the work force switching to differnt position learning different type of work opportunitys making it a perfect place to work
good,"Kroger is a good place to work if you want to grow with time. Working nights was tough...and some of the time I did help run night crew in one store. The culture was alright ...but the hardest part of the job was making sure you slept well...considering it was overnight."
good,"Fast paced work environment with good people. On a normal day you can get all your work done, but there are days where it gets stressful and there is a lot to do and not enough time."
good,"My typical work day would consist off. coming in logging in writing down information, checking apparel clothing section. The most enjoyable was being around fellow co-workers"
good,At this time just looking for a more permanent position with career advancement and set schedule. Unfortunately this company does not allow for time to spend with family or to continue my educational goals. It is very hard to enjoy life when you are constantly working at a place that is open pretty much 24/7 and only closed for one holiday which is Christmas.
good,"Over time would be great 40+ hours a week or more than 7.55 a hour management is decent, full time benifits are good, more paid vacation time after working so long would be better."
good,Kroger was an unpredictable place to work. You did not have a set schedule you may work days one week nights the next or nights 2 days and off a days then day schedule the rest of the week.
good,"It is a decent place to work if you can put up with the management, they are truly horrible. The job is easy but there was a lot of favoritism and some people had to work weekends but a lot of people didn't which I found completely unfair."
good,"Keeping the backroom and storage areas clean and as organized as possible. Stocking shelves, packaging meat products, and helping customers with inquiries or seafood orders."
good,"It's a pretty stressful job, always busy so you'll always have something to do. Management could use some help, takes a while to advance in any position."
good,"Working for Kroger was a very good place to work , i meet wonderful people . Did lots of flower arrangement, Fruit baskets, Snack packs."
good,The people you work with in the stores are great people and hard working. It has been a good place to work but now it is time for some new adventure and challenges
good,The company allowed me an opportunity to grow my leadership skills.  I enjoyed working their and meet several good people that I have stayed in contact with still today
good,Every day was different. Some days would be slow and others fast paced and busy. Worked with the customer directly helping them locate the product they need.
good,Kroger company works hard with keep customers satisfied by insuring good products and making sure that checking out runs smoothly and efficiently. Employees are also taken into consideration making sure they are satisfied as well.
good,"I worked at Krogers as a part time job.It was okay, but my hours were not steady.The people I worked with were friendly, the customers were great; no problems with customers."
good,Kroger paid every week that was a plus for me but i didn't really care for the union dues and the lack of getting more than 30 hours a week the don't want to work you more than that so they don't have to give you benefits
good,"days were good but stressfull"
good,"Much of it depends on your particular store and the people there. Biggest issue is when you try to accomplish what your actual role consists of, and then the reality of a grocery store happens. Huge disconnect between store and district/division level. Fast paced and hard work if you do your job. Store manager is great and a fantastic help, but department heads and other co-managers make many things more difficult than they should be. Store culture is dependent on your location, but overall company culture is all about who you know."
good,"Busy environment and always helping customers.  Learn a lot about the food and retail industry.  Took on some leader roles as a floor schedule of cashiers, scheduling and instructing when to take breaks."
good,I learned to stay on my toes to get the job done.  There were constant phone calls and emails that needed to be seen to on top of the normal day-to-day tasks.  It taught me to think fast and have an answer for every question.
good,"It really is all about location. When I worked at a store (hereby Store #1), I was generally happy and looked forward to going to work. In the second store I worked at (hereby store #2), I was sick every day before I went. I made some good friends at both locations. But the management of the store was awful across the board, but mainly at the store #2. It was a figure it out and make it work sort of place, but if you did it wrong you were in trouble. It was, here is a million tasks to do in 2 hours and make sure it's all done, but don't forget about the massive amount of customers. It also had no extra help so taking breaks was a nightmare! and there was no extra hours to add an extra person just to relieve for breaks. Good luck taking one break, let along two. But mostly it was the store manager in store #2. I had some issues with some other employees who were favorited and walked all over everyone in the store because they knew it. If they didn't get their way, then they would cry to the store manager and you didn't get a say in the matter. It was their way or you were wrong or both. And the store manager didn't take your side of the story ever. The most enjoyable part of the job to me was the good customers who genuinely thanked you, or who understood. But mostly the customers at store #2 were not this way. They walked all over you and made rude comments not understanding what you were going through even though you are barely holding it together. I was generally praised for my customer service at store #1 and made some great friends with some customers there. Store #2 made"
good,"During my 15 years at Roundys I did many, many different job functions. It was very fast paced, but the faster you worked the better the incentives were. Fast workers can make a whole lot of money."
good,This company is good to learn the behind the scenes of distribution that can expand your knowledge for future endeavors. You may move up the ladder in your career.
good,"Being a Meat clerk at Marianos I learned how to process meat and handle food properly for customers. It was a tough job cleaning the meat machines, but while I was working, the people working with me were a lot of help."
good,A typical day at work consists of working 11-13 hours a day with no set breaks. During the months of August- November it consists of giving a lot of immunizations.
good,I hate the pay rate. I like the workers but not the customer at all they are sometimes rude and disrespectful to the nice workers and all we do is serve them.
good,"Most days you will get put to be on a schedule for certain times to bring in carts (5 expected a minute), a time to clean the restrooms, and a time to clean the entrance lobby, where the carts are."
good,"Kroger is a great place to work if you do not plan to stay. It is not a very good career option, but it will pay the bills if you are in college or looking for a seasonal job. I would not recommend staying more than two to three years."
good,"There was no set schedule, forced to ring groceries fast, and time requested was never given. If it was given they would try and punish you by taking you off the schedule for a week or more. Whenever you tell management something expect for the whole store to know. Raises were only ten cent every six months. This job is only suitable for kids  or someone seeking a management position."
good,Not the greatest place to work not he best either. When I did work there it was okay going down hill before I left. Managers were ok to work for. Expected a lot out of you depending on what department you were in.
good,"Provided outstanding customer service by providing assistance, recommendations, and listening to the customers’ needs and preferences to ensure satisfaction"
good,"This is a great place to work, the people you work with are great and the company itself is very helpful to help accommodate you in any way that they can."
good,"There are no ping pong tables. A lot of running around from register to register throwing people's stuff into bags. If you're not doing something, someone will notice and give you something to do. Inconsistent hours. I will close one night and then be back the next day at 10 or 11. The people who work there are fine, though. At least we're suffering together. Management is fine, approachable. I enjoy getting carts from the parking lot. That's when I can slow down and not deal with customers."
good,"Kroger was exactly what I thought it was going to be. It was a learning experience, I have no negative emotions of it. It's a well oiled machine pumping through successful business models. I made sure I learned as much about working and business throughout my time spent here."
good,"As a Deli Manager a typical day at Kroger's consist of greeting customers, assisting the deli clerk, cash handling. Assist supervisor with scheduling employees and breaking down the incoming products and stocking them. I've shifted from becoming a assistant and gaining more knowledge to advance into a Deli manager. The work environment was diverse, fun and open door policy. The hardest part of the job I would have to say my opinion would be inventory. The most enjoyable part of the job would be meeting new people."
good,"Worked 6 days a week, 10 hour shifts that fluctuated times. Learned payroll, electronic scheduling, budgeting etc... upper management was out of touch with store level day to day issues. Needed more focus on culture. A lot of hours each week with no compensation change (salary). Got to know a lot of good people."
good,"Had an amazing management staff, very engaged and attuned to workplace culture. Direct supervisor was a servant leader and staff respected manager highly. Retail is a grinding job, but the culture made it fun. Opportunities to grow if you are willing to sacrifice work/life balance."
good,minimum wage job. it's okay as a starter job but there's not really any sense of advancement in this job. a lot of this job is customer service based and being told what to do by higher ups sometimes unnecessarily.
good,"It is a great place to work, but the schedules need to be handled effectively and be organized as well as give the appropriate hours for work when scheduled"
good,"I only worked at Roundys for 3 months because I was taking classes, and it interferred with home life. "
good,"positions created and eliminated based on contract negotiations."
good,Good for a part time job but full time. Must be good at talking to and assisting customers. Different jobs within the store can be better than others.
good,"During time working for this company, I enjoyed working and the people that I worked with. I gain a lot of work experience and learned how to do take pride in the job and task at hand."
good,"Due to the large number of employees at Kroger stores, schedules can be very flexible. I never had any issue changing my availability or requesting time off. The pay and raises for courtesy clerks are very poor, however."
good,"Learn how to work with all types of people, enjoyed work with co-workers, workplace culture interesting and at times challenging, learning not to let customer upset you, and also the most enjoyable was working with the customer."
good,"Many opportunities to advance, even as entry level employee.  Very flexible work hours and very good for students.  Endless possibilities of promotion in different store roles."
good,Many of the employees helped me learn all skills needed to perform my job.  Thank You to them.  Learned many skills that I had not yet had a chance to add to my resume.
good,Do not wish to talk about the company at this time.  I am not allowed to discuss the Kroger Co at this time and do not wish to do so inorder to get a job.
good,This would be a great job if they would offer full time hours to employees who work more than one job. It seems Kroger managers only give hours to employees who have no other major obligations. Could just be me but I was getting more hours at another Kroger's while working another job. They pay is good but the hours are not there.
good,I work on register learning the new system using chip credit card.  Scanning merchandise and food.  As well as bag for customer when the baggers are not there to help bag for the customer.  I stock my area for bags and clean my area.  As well help other cashier bag it I do not have customers.
good,"Pretty relaxing, and can get challenging on the busy days. Management overall are productive and helpful, the most enjoyable time is to help and make customers happy"
good,I liked the small local pharmacy atmosphere. The customers were pleasant to work with- There were different managers while I was at Kroger pharmacy.I wanted more hours than the manager could give me was a hard part of the job.I received a Customer Service award- was an enjoyable part of my employment.
good,Kroger is a laid back environment to work in. I have heard that other pharmacies pay more than kroger but are more demanding and have more pressure on their employees.
good,"Deli is a lot of moving, working, keeping track of temperatures of food and other items while dealing with the occasional busy shifts."
good,"Working at Kroger was a great experience. I've learned how to work at a fast pace, how to deal with customers, and how to stock and order items. The people I worked with made the job a breeze!"
good,"A place that doesn't treat their cow workers the right way"
good,I enjoyed helping my customers over the years and developing lasting friendships with many of them.  I will miss working with many of my co-workers and wish only the best for them.
good,"fast paced, easy to please management, busy hours are the roughest part of it, helped customers find groceries a lot, bringing in carts gets really tiring in TX weather"
good,"If your looking to make a living on this job, this is not the job for you.  If your looking for a job that will supplement your income, this is the place for you."
good,"Workload compared to work/life balance is unrealistic, company is slow to find competent associates quickly enough to react to new business.  Higher starting pay for experienced candidates is needed for hiring and keeping people in the right positions."
good,it was a great experience i learned alot from  the manager. he was a great teacher. this place need better pay. the start very low it was a relaxed atmosphere
good,when i first started working at kroger i was trained as a cashier. because i am a pretty quick learner they then started to put me in other departments of the store. the hardest part of the job was trying to figure out where i was going to be that day and trying to remember stuff about working in that department. the most enjoyable part of it was i loved the customers! i love people! the people i worked with were nice and friendly. although i just wish that they would train people properly instead of just throwing them in different departments and expecting them to know everything.
good,Love my job it is great working with good people. Its steady pace wonderful costumers. I love waking up and going and its always something  new every night
good,"I was hired through the meat cutting school that I attended. Kroger hires people from the school to use as their chicken cutting and cleaning the machinery person at the end of the day. Like clockwork, they will allow you to work there for 19 weeks, then lay you off. Why only 19 weeks? Because, at the time working 20 weeks made you eligible to apply for unemployment insurance. It was a scam!"
good,I would not recommend this job to anyone very poor management.I will never apply to this job ever again they treated me very wrong and didn't even care how they were doing it.
good,Love the customers especially little kids. They always bring a joy to you especially when you give them stickers or anything to brighten up there day. Love the customers overall
good,My co workers made it a better day by going into work. The shifts would go by quick around the holidays because it was so busy all the time. The worst part about this job would be pushing the carts in from the parking lot.
good,"Management doesn't take the employees serious, employee concerns are overlooked even if previously discussed. The more productive you are, the more the work is poured onto you from other employees by management. Good productive employees are taken for granted, not acknowledged, or given proper training to excel."
good,Working with customers everyday with different attitude the only think I didn't like is that you have to be there by yourself at night in you get no breaks
good,"For the most part Kroger is a fun place to work at. The employees are friendly to each other. The management is pretty good, they will work will you at times. The hardest part of the job is trying to get things done throughout the day. The most enjoyable thing about working at Kroger is helping the customers and making them happy."
good,I was responsible for running the whole front end. Closing all drawers out at the end of the night. Counting all money in the store. Taking care of all complaints. I always tried making the customer happy.
good,"Everything is about their ""projections"".  If ""projection"" says down hours are cut. If ""projection"" is wrong hours are not restored.  Much is expected.  Pressure to give flu shots.  Pressure to do MTM.  All on top of an understaffed pharmacy."
good,"Working at Kroger is a challenge it is very stressful plus the management is very demanding on the appearance of your store it is non stop, 24 hours a day"
good,"Kroger treat me fine. They provided oppertunities to advance, and they gave me plenty of flexible hours to work with. They were friendly. Technically i worked for fred meyer jewelers, not kroger, but i worked aside alot of the employees."
good,"Typical day at work was pretty boring and repetitive, doing the same job daily for the entire day with little variation. Talking with customers was the best part of the work day, and co-workers could be fun but rarely got time to socialize with them."
good,For the most part employees are busy but the hours an employee gets are not enough to live off of. High turnover rate. Employee morale is low. Customers are rude.
good,It's hard work but it's a job hope to move up some day you have to prove your self just to get to the next level it's okay one day u will get there......
good,"I worked as a courtesy clerk, pharmacy tech, and cashier at kroger. The first store was more laid back, and management was always nice."
good,"just another krogers location, ive learned to control my temper, customer is always right, right wrong , customers are always right"
good,I didn't have a great experience working at this specific area. There was a lot of inshore politics that added to a toxic work environment. A lot of nice people but also some icy ones as well.
good,A typical day at work consisted of bagging groceries and helping customers find what they needed and making sure they leave with a smile. The hardest part of the job was getting carts especially in the winter.
good,"I worked at a Kroger store (King Soopers) that was a part of a union. This made scheduling difficult and stressful as hours are based on seniority. "
good,Just a job for people who are at the start of their careers. Pretty ok place to work. The only downfall was that they dont give there employees any hours
good,"In the beginning of working at Kroger Marketplace as a Barista in their Starbucks, working there was enjoyable and I loved the customers that I served. However, through time I started to see that the employees had little to no say in what happened in their department. This of course caused a lot of lack of communications between the Managers and the employees. Overall, this is a good temporary job but nonetheless if you are not moving up it is best you find another job."
good,Kroger was a very relaxed place. One place to learn how to use the cash register work with customers learn how to multi task.. Krogers store is a good place to work at far as getting experience in grocery stores and customer service.
good,Kroger was a fast paced work environment with a hectic unpredictable schedule with a management structure that was constantly changing.   The pay was competitive but habe a work and life balance was next to impossible.
good,I was not a huge fan of working as a Courtesy clerk at Kroger. Many of my co workers were lazy and did not do their fair share and the front end managers did not do anything about it.
good,I've been working for kroger for a year now and i want to switch positions but they won't switch me cause my attitude but they dont never see the good in me I'm good at what i do i just want to be fulltime not part time no more so thats why i need to find another job quick i can't pay my rent if I'm part time with only 23 or 25 hours.
good,Need management support..cause complained about customers feeling some type of way about clerk.customers service..is not allways right..they need to listen to the clerk.
good,It was a OK job the money was good but they started me out with good hours then dropped them down. And I was driving back and forth like over 20miles a day.
good,"Little room for real management growth that is worth the money. The responsibilities given are not worth the money being paid typically. They have a lot of what I would call ""grunts"" doing managers jobs. Which is understandable when the manager isn't there but there should be more pay involved when doing such tasks. Such as inventory checks, handling departments returns, loss prevention and others. Not the worst place to work but not the best either."
good,"held back on hours they gave me would not give me my vacation that I asked for, management was mazy and didn't care about the workers, the parking lot did not feel safe and I felt like I was in danger going outside alone."
good,"Being a cashier at Fred Meyer can be fun at times, but is also a very stressful job. When customers are angry they will take it out on you.The managers seemed unorganized and I hated how inconsistent my schedule was plus low pay."
good,I worked for Dillons while attending high school and they were great with scheduling me around school hours and school functions. It's a great job for people that don't have much experience and want to get their foot in the door for customer service.
good,Ever since the Kroger take over things have gotten worse in terms of the typical day at work. We have lost employees so we are short handed already but then they keep cutting hours making things harder and harder to keep up with simple daily tasks. The upgrades to the store and technology are great and all but it doesn't matter when you're stressed out all day and sometimes don't even get a break from it. Plus they frown on any overtime so if you can't finish things it's basically just too bad but then you get in trouble for not finishing things. The paid break(s) are nice if you actually get to take them because then your'e not their past your scheduled time as they are simply part of your paid time there.
good,"Good place to work, each day is different even though you are assigned the same thing to do in  your department. "
good,"Worked for several major food store chains in various positions; cashier, stock and last head meat wrapper.  Enjoyed the Meat Wrapping position the best; early shift, cleaned meat cases on a weekly basis, worked lunch meat, made sure label on meat was correct, the tare weight was correct for weigh items."
good,With all the work you had to do the pay isn't always worth it. It was very disheartening when you've worked there almost 3 years and were only making 20 cents more than someone who was just hired.
good,"The work place was fun but the pay was so bad, the management was lacking respects for cashiers and courtesy clerks. They promise a raise but I've never gotten one out of my 3 years working."
good,If you never had a job before then this is the perfect job for you. Do not take this job full time unless you really like the department you are positioned in.
good,"10 hour days, no set schedule meaning you work mid, first, or an evening shift, which can lead to little to no work-life balance. I learned a lot and gained a lot of valuable experience in areas of merchandising, sales, human resources, and operations. Management can be very chaotic and hectic, retail is a very dynamic industry and change is constant, couple that with high turn over....you get the picture. Got to be a hard worker and stay loyal, it can be a very rewarding experience."
good,"Working at Krogers was benefitial for me, I liked meeting and talking to new people.  An additional perk was that I could work at my own steady pace and help the customers. Overall, I enjoyed my time at Krogers."
good,"Low Pay, little to know advancement training as if people want to stay making that salary.  If your not part of the in group forget about advancement.  Upper management disconnected to the stores.  occasional walkthroughs will never let you know how poorly associates are treated."
good,"A typical day at work for me was fast paced but enjoyable. I gained more self confidence by interacting with customers as well as customer service skills. My managers were very helpful and supportive in assisting me in correcting mistakes on the register and conflict with customers. The majority of my coworkers were friendly and made it easy to work as a team, and feel at home in a professional environment. The hardest part of the job was working overtime with few breaks and getting off late. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers and getting to know regulars."
good,"Kroger, is a great entry level job to build a resume but in this economy it doesn't provide the benefits or pay for someone to live comfortably or without needing financial assistance."
good,did not like working there only place I every quit and would never go back no team work always doing others work and lazy people there and there was faves there
good,"Coworkers are alright, amount of pay for the amount of work they expect done is not enough and underpaid compared to other grocery stores for the same position."
good,"A typical day at work for me in the floral department was either busy or slow, and I would get put in produce if it was slow. I would basically go back and fourth between departments."
good,"Working at Krogers was a great experience and I really enjoyed the time I spent there. The co-workers are what make the job worth going to sometimes, because I know that they will have something to say to lighten my spirit back up. Working there is pretty simple at times on a typical day I come in clock in then I head to my register and commence to check people out,"
good,Her name was tina she was a elderly white woman who didnt like me she would make my days  hard but it is what it is i did my job and tryed to have  a good day
good,"Working at Kroger was a different experience. If you work hard, you get rewarded with more requirements and the same pay. If you do not try, you get to cost and let your work get done by others for you. The stores are too full of old employees that get too comfortable with not going the extra mile, and really new employees who have no idea what they are doing."
good,Every job i have had i strive for excellence. I show up on time every day weather im sick or not. I am very hard working. I have great problem solving skills and i am a very friendly individual
good,"It is a good job for someone looking for part time, they work with your school schedule, and there is room for advancement if that is what you are looking for."
good,"Working at Kroger was the most enjoyable job. I made new friends and they were very friendly. Some days were slow, but i still enjoyed being around people. I've learned a lot the time i was there. The management and i were like friends. He was nice and thorough explaining things to me i couldn't quite understand. The best day was around Christmas i got two poinsettias for a gift. It was amazing."
good,"For me, this position was a good one for in between jobs, or as a second position.  It was a good place to work, friendly staff,who is always there to help if one needs it.  The company strives on excelling in customer service, so be on your toes.  As long as you strive to be the best you can be, make the customer number one in your life there, you will be fine."
good,The managers are nice and helpful. The coworkers are often willing to help you or answer any questions that you may have. And the work itself is pretty easy once you learn how to do it.
good,"This place was my first job and it was alright. The management wasn't the greatest but,definitely great place to work while in school. Not somewhere i would say start a career."
good,It's a fun and relaxed place to work but can be very stressful at times. I would definitely recommend working at krogers for anyone looking for a starter job.
good,"An Okay first job, but I would recommend going somewhere else after a year or two if no promotion has been offered. I was lucky enough to be promoted to a cashier, because being a bagger could mean going outside to retrieve carts for four hours or more in 90 degree heat in Texas."
good,"Kroger is a good first job for anyone willing to work for alittle over minimum wage. Managers are pretty good. Other coworkers are usually teenagers and are lazy and not willing to pull there end of the weight, leaving you to pick up their slack. Pay is okay, not great. Paid 15 minute breaks, 30 minute lunch(unpaid). Overall Kroger is a place where you do not want to work long time, but short term is a decent option."
good,"Cashier/bagger/customer service and job title requires one to get buggy's and help older individuals to there car. And work with disgruntle customers at times."
good,"It was ok for a part-time job. Co-works were fun to be around, my direct manager could be a little difficult to work with but that got better with experience."
good,Pay was low but good job for student in high school there are some advancement opportunities but from experience have to be there for quite a while to move up
good,management will overwork you most of the time. they will make you do more than you should. hardest part of the job is to complete all of the tasks management want you to complete. most enjoyable part of the job was them having free food on some days.
good,"Some days were fast paced and others were slow. Managers were pretty considerate and friendly, they always gave me an opportunity to advance. One thing that annoyed me was the customer service managers, they always call you up to check people out and never try to let you leave and go back to stocking and such. Other than that pretty good job."
good,"It's not a bad place to work. The starting pay for new people is lower than other places but, you get a small hourly wage increase every year,.. very small increase."
good,"Its just an okay place to work. The overall duties are not difficult, but lack of communication and staff make is hard to fulfill your job. Management does a fairly decent job, but could definitely be more productive and helpful."
good,"On an average day at Kroger, it's typically busy and the first thing I would do is go bag for any register that needed bagging. The hardest part of the job was probably the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was interactions with co-workers."
good,"They start you out at very low pay. The only reason to work here is for the health insurance, it was only $6 a week. People are usually fun to be around. The company loves to add more tasks while cutting hours constantly. If you can get promoted like I did you max out in pay immediately. Overtime is nice since anything over 8 hours in one day is automatically overtime. Produce is the best department to work in since it is usually the most relaxed. If you need insurance then go for kroger, but if its money you are after then apply for HEB and make 3-4 dollars more per hour."
good,most of the time you had a good time working there.. never a dull moment. always a different thing to learn each and every day. your always doing something different
good,Good place to work of you want to stay with them you can move up and make well money but the management is horrible they need to be trained better therefore everyone will feel equal
good,"Worked part time through my time at school. Started as a cashier, was promoted to Customer Service Representative after a year.  Made friends while working."
good,"If you work 8 hours , you only get 1 break ! They do not give you a lunch . The manager is not friendly at all . You don't get benefits . No pay sick leave"
good,Stressful environment but they do try to work with you and your schedule. Overall Kroger is filled with a diverse set of people so it's nice to meet different people but sometimes that just isn't enough to keep you .
good,"It's OK to work there and it's fast pace. Enjoyed working with other employees. Some of them are nice and others aren't.  Most managers can be nice or not.  It's depend on them,  mostly they are nice and understanding others too."
good,"Produce, Not bad its a decent place for a 14 year old who lives with his parents, who wants to have some spending money. Good environment. I did not learn much. Employees were very friendly. You will need to be full time in order to make a living, not even sure about that. Most of the workers are going to college. Or are women who are retired. You will need a 2nd Job. But overall one of the better places I have worked. You will help bagging groceries, blowing up ballons"
good,I worked at Kroger at a bag while attending high school. This is a typical first job for a teenager and is a great place to learn a struct-er and get yourself ready for the real word.
good,I love my job . its been one that i could learn more about the food and retail business. I learned how to decorate cakes and bake breads. I love my co-workers.
good,A lot of standing in one place. Bright side about the job was meeting new people. Management was fair and the workplace culture was pretty good. Hardest part of the job was the pay and the most enjoyable part was working with friends.
good,If you worked at a gas station you know what its about. Take care of customers stock shelves. the management was horrible when I worked there. it changed a lot and you never knew what was going on
good,"Kroger is a great place to shop, very clean, with nice workers. The store is always busy and sometimes crowded. Kroger stays open till 1am which is good thing, not many stores do."
good,"in my department we are generally left to fend for ourselves, manager leaves at 3, and doesn't work weekends. usually working with one other person, sometimes by yourself"
good,"I was pregnant when I began to work at Kroger and I was miserable because I was not able to sit. However, I enjoyed the people I worked with and they worked with my school schedule."
good,"I worked in the Deli. My typical day at work was crazy. I opened the chicken room, cooked all the food and helped fill in wherever they needed me. One day I could be in the back all day cooking chicken and one day I might be up front making subs for customers. I learned every station so i would be more valuable to the store."
good,as soon as you start working you need to help customers with checkouts and questions about our products. Always swept the floor every 30mins and go outside to get the karts.
good,"the pay sucks, sometime the mangers suck. as long as you get along with all your coworkers, it's not a bad place. it depends more on the people around you."
good,poor management full timer have poor attitude and very lazy pay is low no motivation to provide good work no training in order for you to reform you job in a proper manner
good,"Kroger intentionally hides opportunities from its workers and does all in its power to avoid providing benefits, as well as, limit the chances of advancement."
good,"Good starting job, people are great to work with which makes the environment great. Managers can be a huge con unless they focus on the whole company."
good,Kroger is a good company with a bright future.  The store teams seem to be strong and willing to go the extra mile in the stores I worked.  Corporate and upper management try to assist as much as possible with the coming events and challenges each store faces on a semi-regular basis.
good,"This was a decent starting summer job for me. Sunday's were always the busiest days, and there was a good group of people I worked with. The biggest issue I have with kroger is that they are horrible with hiring. I applied twice this summer and got turned down. I really don't understand why I mean I have a pretty decent resume for a college student."
good,I worked at king soopers for 3-4 years and the environment was fast  and mt coworkers were good to work with. Management was a little unorganized but over all ok.
good,"Most of the time a typical work day would normally be not that bad and you could have a decent to pretty good day as long as you were not one who would get upset easily. But it would be a great day as long as the managers and the supervisors were in a good mood. That is what could be the hardest part of the job was the way they could treat you at times or maybe the hardest thing would be a problem customer that is never satisfied. But working there I learned a lot on how to rotate products, check dates, operate the fuel station,etc."
good,"While working at Kroger i made minimum wage and my position was courtesy clerk. For the amount of work you have to do and the amount of the pay they award you with, it's not worth the work. Their competitors are paying around $9 for the same type of work, while we get paid minimum wage. They offer good benefits, but its only if you're a full time worker and now a part timer."
good,what I learned being a cashier is the most enjoying job someone can have if you enjoy people. I enjoy helping others so it was nice to find a place to be needed in family's life's making shopping easier then harder for these with children
good,The specific Krogers location I worked was understaffed. I ended up doing and having more duties than in my job description although they were reasonable. The employeers were nice along with my coworkers. I enjoyed the skills I learned aswell as the work experience.
good,I worked as a cashier in high school. I  would recommend a cashier position over bag boy. Courtesy clerks don't get 1.5x sunday pay and generally are paid less. Some customers are also completely rude.
good,"Started out working has a cashier, checking customers out and bagging groceries. After working at the register a position came open in the produce and I was transferred thier"
good,This is a good place to work as a first job. They hire people with no experience and hire often. It is a decent place to work because it has a union for the non manager positions.
good,"I only worked the overnight shift so I really can't speak about the normal daily routines, the over night was a bit stressful work pace was fast and they did try and compensate for  overnight work"
good,Management is very informative.  Overall a good company to work for.  Fast and growing in the market place.  Kroger was a good learning experience.  Great employment oppurtinitys.
good,"Had an issue with another employee treating me badly, went to management, and was first told I'd be moved to another area.  Next day I went in to talk to HR and they told me, I had to stay where I was if I wanted to work there.  I chose to quit because upper mgmt. favoritism of the girl who treated me badly."
good,on a normal day its not to stressful but on the weekends its chaotic and never enough help to cover every shift. Besides all that if you have quality help you can get a lot done but if not you will be constantly on the move.
good,"Retention is a problem due to lack of pay. "
good,"I have worked at King Soopers for the last 15 years. I've held many different positions at this company. Most recently as a Store Supervisor in charge of payroll, recruiting, and store operations."
good,I loved most of the people i worked with and most of the managers but the hours were way too unpredictable and the pay was way too low!! Worked well with peoples schedules!
good,"I have mixed feelings about Kroger. When it comes to advancement, it's who you know. Schedules are never set and seniority comes first so plan to miss A LOT of time from family. But hey, a job's a job so that's why it gets 3 stars."
good,Most of the employees at the stores are wonderful people and make work fun and bearable. It's the management that can make or break a store. I worked with about 4 different store managers and each one made the store unique. The good ones made you feel appreciated and wanting to work and do better. The bad ones made you question whether or not to quit each day.
good,"Working for Kroger when I was in highschool was overall a good experience for me. It was my first job, and it helped me understand and appreciate the value of working in general."
good,"Great place to go if you want to quickly get in and out. Employees are helpful and if you need help finding something, they will walk you to the item."
good,getting the work place ready and presentable when customers come in. I've learned that things never go your was as the employer an you have to get over it. With Management they always pushed the employers to do there best work. The hardest part of the job was the Management yes they pushed you to do your best but they also pushed you to see if you would quit the job. The most enjoyable part of it was the customers and my fellow employers.
good,The work here is stressful and tiring.working here is hard work and you have to be very fast.the job can be quite annoying. you don't get on the schedule until a few weeks. they just tell you when to come in for the first few weeks. this is annoying because people have things to do outside of work and not knowing can be stressful.
good,"The Fuel Station Clerk is responsible for the following ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS: Customer Service – They must greet the customers, respond to their questions and assist them. in a courteous and helpful manner."
good,The company provides ample training and management is understanding of various situations. Be prepared to have more and more responsibility added to your typical work load.
good,"it was a good work place..i enjoyed my job ..i just could not be there for the 3 am shift i was scheduled for. i was working 3 jobs at the time"
good,"What i love was my co workers and the customers was the best part of my job."
good,"difficult pharmacy to manage and lack of technician support"
good,"-Allowed a flexible schedule to accommodate for school "
good,I've worked there for 22 years it has been good for me and has taught me a lot about customer service and controlling shrink and quality orders and manage people
good,"Working at King Soopers is a very fast paced and challenging environment to work in.  What I learned as a manager, if you want to be successful with your team, you must have an inclusive personality,  be a motivator and a strong team player who continuously creates systems for better efficiency."
good,"standard work for a grocery store. Always one close to home. but management was very irate, and very serious about there jobs. Pay was terrible, hours where slow at times"
good,Good starting job....but not good to live on.  Stay busy the whole time I am there.  Always something to do.  Like the weekly paycheck.  Management is decent.
good,Helps with dealing with a fast passed environment and how to handle certain situations. Can create special relationships with people. Helps with dealing with all kinds of people.
good,It was an okay job wouldn't work there again. The managers could careless about your problems. You don't get paid enough for the job you do. The benefits are horrible if your part time which they hire everyone at.
good,"the customers only care about themselves their very rude! the management is horrible, the pay isn't enough is very sad ! i wouldn't recommend this to anyone"
good,"quick and easy pay"
good,"Working at Kroger as a courtesy clerk is a pretty simple job. Bagging groceries and grabbing carts off of the parking lot is far from complicated. However, working while being understaffed is a pain. I had loads shifts where I had to bag groceries for multiple lanes."
good,Kroger I didn't to much like due to the fact they wasn't giving out raises like they was supposed to and the experience was good I like interacting with the customers and providing the best customer service I knew how.
good,working in the kroger deli was a laid back environment. I was cross trained to work in the bakery as well and it was a good learning experience. the mangement tea was so helpful and flexible.
good,It is a good place to work and offers good benefits. They have a kind staff and helpful management. I would recommend anyone to work there. Pharmacy technician is a good part time or full time career.
good,"It depends on which kroger you apply too. My kroger on Cemetery road was great until we got new management and everything became bad. "
good,"Kroger Co. is just like working at other grocery stores.  It isn't a bad place to work, but it isn't the greatest either.  Corporate policies and changes in management create an environment in which it is difficult to accomplish tasks efficiently and properly attend to customer service, but if you can build a team of dependable people with good management it can be a comparatively relaxed job."
good,Very fun place to work with great co-workers who are all very helpful. Customers were always very nice. Very productive place. Was always kept busy and was never let down.
good,"Currently still employed. supervising Cashiers, making sure the lines are not long and being polite. Covering other cashiers breaks and help train them."
good,The best thing about working for Kroger has got to be the people you work with. I made a lot of lasting friendships there. Aside from that I genuinely hated working there.
good,"It was fine the first month, then it kind of just went down hill. Management for the most part was great except for a few out of the bunch, the crew or team members weren't very diverse. The hardest part was pushing, and pulling the carts in 100 degree weather."
good,"Although I can say working for Kroger was a more positive experience, the way my particular store was run by management was absolutely ridiculous. They had yelled at employees in front of customers, didn't follow proper procedures, and it was clear that they applied favoritism amongst their peers."
good,"When I first started at Kroger it was great. Management was great and there was obvious room to move up in the company. Now only a few short years later management only looks out for themselves and there is no room for advancement. Unless you have been working for the company for AT LEAST 10+ years you are unable to move up. The coworkers on the other hand though are like a family, We fight like a family and we love like a family. Sadly, because of poor management a lot of the time the family will be split up because there is no other choice."
good,It was a very laid back environment. Not too much pressure. Some days I could've had more help but other than that it was a great place to be apart of.
good,"worked there for a short period of time, the other employees were nice and friendly. Being a bagger/ cart gatherer wasn't the best job to have especially in the summer."
good,The kroger company is good at taking care of its employees. Schedule can be tapered to your needs if you are part time. Benefits for full time employees are good.
good,"The Kroger Pharmacy call center was high volume, fast paced on fairly short calls. Casual dress code was a plus. Calls monitored for quality assurance."
good,had this job over 7 years ago. don't remember much of it but I got to write a review. just like any first job at a super market. scan groceries bag groceries
good,"I didn't particularly mind the work but it was the compensation that was lacking. I worked multiple positions at one point and only made 60 cents more than a cart pusher. That being said I wasn't pushing carts. Air conditioning all the time was a definite bonus and I learned a wide variety of skills and food knowledge. Management was lenient enough but the staff was in shortage so it was very hard to get time off covered. I did enjoy the variety of activities that were on my plate since I worked Produce, Meat, Service Deli, Cashier and Floral departments; it was never dull. I left on amicable terms to try something new but my favorite part of the job was getting to know my customers and developing relationships with them. The hardest part of the job was the holiday season."
good,Easy to advance through Roundy's.  I'm not sure of the Kroger Corporation.  Working environment was employee and customer friendly.  Great pay and benefits too!
good,Kroger was my first job.  I learned a lot about how to work with different personalities and the importance of compromise. Kroger taught me the importance of customer service and the correct use of pleasantries.
good,At my time here I have learned a lot about the retail industry and grocery especially it has really opened my eyes to the day to day operations. Thank you for listening
good,I worked at Kroger for three years.  Always cheerful and on time.  Not many opportunities to expand into the management area.  They did send us to cake decorating class for the bakery.
good,I didn't mind this job aside from some of the meat handling. The people working with me kept things enjoyable and carefree. Sometimes customers would be spiteful for no reason.
good,If you do not have a completely open availability they will only give you 12 hours a week (the minimum.) Especially if you are low seniority. Main managers are awesome and understanding.
good,Good place to work just a lack of hours. I bag orders and assist customers if needed. I collect shopping carts from the parking lot. I also sweep or return items if needed.
good,I enjoy working with the public. I enjoy helping others. I always strive to service the customer with thoughtful attention. Listening while working as a customer service agent is paramount to the high level of service the customer deserves.
good,Do I have to do this for every job? This is just annying stupid annoying stuff? It won't even let me repeat anythingI just want to finish posting my resume.
good,"Kroger was my first job, I was a hardworking employee and I did everything they asked (and more) and my hours got cut. I was working Mon-Fri and 2 months in I only worked one or two days a week."
good,"the work was somewhat easy the counting the cigarettes was a killer "
good,"The time I spent at kroger was good, but manager at my time of employment didn't listen to what I had to stay about a situation and fired me... It was very upsetting, really liked my job.."
good,Most of the jobs here give you a small amount of training on a computer at the start of employment. After that you must figure it out on your own. It is a very high stress environment.
good,"As is the case with most working environments, The Kroger company provides an atmosphere to pursue and meet a variety of one's goals and needs in a given set of circumstances. A typical day of work at a Kroger store can provide one with the satisfaction of achieving concrete objectives; the stability of following a routine; the health of friendly social interchanges based on assistance and support; and physical movement that is gentle yet pleasant and invigorating .The hardest part of the job is accepting the minimum wage. The most enjoyable part of the job is the constant work flow and the healthy movement that it provides."
good,"Poor management but good employee benefits. Ran Deli, alot of work duties for the pay they pay you. Overwhelmed when employee turnover rate is high for the department."
good,"I had no problem with my position there except the fact that our breaks were only 15 minutes and I had to fill in for different departments plus push shopping carts in cold weather for only $10.65 an hour, I felt taken advantage of."
good,I loved showing up to work for Kroger. Every day when I show up I see my coworkers and I know I'm going to have a good day of work. I liked who I worked with and the overall environment. I just wish the pay was higher and the managers were more organized.
good,"Great job for a high school or college student, as well as the semi retired.  If you don't mind working weekends, it's a nice PT gig.  Wages low, but benefits are great, even for PT.  Inexpensive health insurance and all of the other benefits of a FT job."
good,"It was a great company to work for, but lately I believe they have lost their way and are having a difficult time find their way. They have made selling groceries difficult"
good,The store is clean and sometimes the management team suck they barely help you and they're lazy then some of the always have attitudes it's just they Don't like to work
good,"I didn't love this job. The scheduling was not great, and I was often scheduled for days I specifically said I couldn't. Lots of last minute frantic switches with coworkers ensued."
good,Pay was too low and hours were scarce. management was fine everyone was reasonable and laid back. were always ready to commend you for a job well done.
good,its a great first job for anyone.  but the strain will take a tole on you after a while.  i suggest that people really take time to look at what type of work you will be doing before you apply.
good,"It is Kroger, not a place to have a career, unless you are going to be a pharmacist, maybe even a manager. It was horrible, very good with working around schedules, just low pay."
good,They are grate with people good with getting the costomers happy and alway get there work done and they help everyone that need help over thats it just grate
good,"This job was like any corporate position; employees lost in the shuffle trying to follow procedure, statistics, and dress codes.  Not enough freedom of expression, coordination, or ideas.  Employees who are over-qualified eventually move on to greener pastures."
good,"It really seems like Kroger would be an ideal place to work part time as a student but it does you a major disservice. Kroger's way of reimbursing their workers hinges heavily on the substantial benefits package you gain once you reach full time employment for a long enough period of time, but if you do not work full time then you will be paid significantly less than you could at other grocery stores. "
good,Kroger is great. They treat employees well and offer enrichment activities. The employee discount is well worth the pay. I wish I could have transferred closer to home though.
good,"Kroger is all about what you make it, your advancement within the company is solely on the individuals work ethic. if you are a hard worker, a person would do will/"
good,"They people are okay. Sometimes workers can be just as rude. That's just no way to treat people. It was great but now I'm not too sure. "
good,"At the location I worked at, the supervisory team wasn't the most supportive. Very stressful environment and fast paced. Sometimes it can be rewarding."
good,very much like high school. Stood for 10 your days. Mean customers. Do not miss it. Only closed 3 days a year. Like my coworkers. Just time to move on to something else. Liked that after work you could pick up groceries if you needed
good,"There are a lot of good things to be said about working with QFC. Having only ever worked at a single location, I cannot say that the issues I've had extend to other QFC locations or Kroger branches. Schedules are very flexible, although this does depend on your department and position. Healthcare benefits are nice to have as well. The issues I've personally experienced come from poor management, which in turn fosters a toxic work environment for the rest of the team. Negative attitudes run rampant when employees feel their needs are not being met or their leadership is incompetent. However, when the management running a store is good, QFC can be a great place to work. Putting aside the standard frustrations of working in retail (rude customers, busy midday rushes), your average day will be fine if your management knows what they are doing."
good,"It was a very nice experience, but time for me to move forward in my career. I learned a ton about customer service, handling situations. Workplace culture was great and will miss the people there."
good,"Kroger was an average grocery store in a city. It was always busy and work was always plentiful. Kroger was a great starter job, but offered little room for advancement"
good,kroger is a very nice store its always clean and the customers ate great they make the job fun.  Me and most of my co workers got along the workplace environment is really chill.
good,This job was very good.  There a lot to learn on the job.  A typical day at work is interacting with customers.  There are a lot of discounts and rebates.
good,"At Kroger, I found myself frustrated with balancing work and home life. I also found difficulty with opportunities to develop and advance because of the union. People with seniority trump those who work hard every day regardless of if the work is even or not."
good,Kwik Shops all closed in Ames. I enjoyed working there. Like any other gas station job. It was a cashier job. What else can I say?  I liked working alone or with one other person.
good,"Learn how to interact with people on a daily basis. They take great pride in customer service and will train you excessively. Learn a great deal if you are willing and speak up for yourself.  There are good and bad managers everywhere you go. Hardest part is having to be on your game and handle every type of person with a smile. You get benefits and discounts. Some count for part time employees, but it has terms.  The most enjoyable part is some of the individuals you get to work with and the pay. The pay is fair, but they require odd hours and sometimes an inconsistent schedule. So be prepared for split days off and working mornings and then evenings all within the same week."
good,"Great company for many years.   New environment has been a challenge for many.  Company making a lot of changes getting ready for new competition.  "
good,"Mostly I really enjoyed working with of course happy coworkers and when every one knew what was expected of them everything ran nice and smooth. I loved when I had the chance to stop take time to talk with customers. or just  make the time to help them find what ever they needed. but my most and favorite time spent working in the Floral Department, I was able to really produce some very beautiful arrangements ,that made my customers very pleased and happy! I found out with the experience working with flowers!                My most difficult  time was working in the deli taking out the trash at the end of the day, there were these huge metal racks with rollers that we took the trash out with,just pushing those things were a pain! filled with trash up to the top. but I guess that's part of the job! Again at the end of the day when I had the chance to really help someone out, that's all that matters!."
good,"A typical day at work was making shore the pumps were clean and your cash register was never short, I learned how to have good customer service. The hardest part of the job was there was no hard part it was easy to learn and to handle."
good,"I worked in electronics and I liked it. I got to stay on top of the cool products and video games. I felt like we were special and no like grocery, home, or apparel"
good,Managers were reasonable with my flexible schedule and customers friendly and very nice. Co-workers were mainly teenagers and acted very unprofessionally.
good,Will keep you busy. High turnover rate but that also means there's available hours. Busy retail store so time goes by fast. Not too organized but multiple windows to step up and be a leader.
good,The best part of working at Kroger is that they are very flexible about working around your school schedule. My only negative is that there is very little opportunity for advancement.
good,"I have worked for Kroger for 2 years and I love the work and the people.I went from a cashier to a supervisor, so their is room for advancement. Kroger is great!!"
good,The job is easy as easy can be. I didn't have to think about what I was doing at the time or what I would need to do next. Though I did have numerous scheduling issues. Working on weekdays after school would become a major issue because they scheduled me to work till midnight often.
good,"I work on the front end of one of the busiest stores in our district, and I'm stretched about as thin as it gets. I'm well versed in practically every facet of the front end yet have no chance of moving up whatsoever."
good,"I starting working here when I was only 15, so at the time, this was good job for me to get into the working world. Looking back at it all I can say is, it was a good honest job for honest workers. A good place to start for any young man or woman."
good,I loved working with the Pharmacy but there were times I wished that  pharmacy was unionized because every chance they got they messed us up with hours and pay.
good,"Fast paced, high stress environment at times.  Hourly associates are Union, while management is not.  Most difficult aspect is trying to get the 2 shifts to work together.  Most enjoyable aspect were the employees."
good,Fast paced environment and highly motivated employees are what you will find working for Kroger. Flexible scheduling and passionate management are a plus.
good,"As long as your physically fit, you can do most of the things that they require you to do. If you're older, they really help you be placed back into where you need to be."
good,It was a job. Did not expect a career. The company was well run and really not bad to work for. I left because I thought I was getting a better opportunity.
good,Nice environment to go into if your still in high school. They're flexible with hours so that your education is not effected. The managers are nice and friendly to talk to and understanding if you need days off.
good,"- Typical day involved helping customers, organizing shelves, and stocking them."
good,You have to work smart and not hard doing these type jobs because you will over work yourself. I found food 4 less being a great job for me because I was greeting and stocking things back on the shelf.
good,The culture and atmosphere was great. Interacting with customers and being able to complete my tasks in a timely manner and providing excellent customer service was a great experience.
good,Depends on who's your managers and coworkers. A decent company to start out with. Down side is that they do base your pay on experience and it can vary from one location to another.
good,"I was able to work with some of the hardest working people I've ever met. On that note, we were all overworked, the pay was low to begin with, but raises and benefits are some of the best. Hardest part of the job is dealing with customers ( as you may know Food 4 Less locations tend to be in the harshest part of towns)."
good,"Hundreds of pounds of food thrown away every day. Expect to stay late if you work in the kitchen, and expect to work in the kitchen if you work as a general. I try my best not to complain about the work I am given, and it honestly feels like my managers took advantage of that."
good,"Good union benefits, always educating, Management changes, high turnover, It really depends on who you know at how far you grow, management can cover up others mistakes"
good,"My only problem with Kroger was they played favorites waay to much, and I always thought that wasn't fair. If they were more fair with promotions they would be great."
good,"They provide a nice environment to work in. All of the coworkers are very nice and professional. All of the customers are very nice and considerate, especially of new employees."
good,Kroger was a good place to work.  the associates care about one another but it is different than the managers.  A lot of them just consider them as another associate.
good,Company has good stronghold on consumers. Lots of management. But it must work cause they're not going out business anytime soon. If you are highly motivated there is good opportunity for advancement.
good,Kroger is a typical busy store. It definitely gives you the opportunity to grow within the company. It's good for people that are still in school and trying to make money.
good,This job was a good job for me in high school. The hours worked with me during school. and just an overall for job for someone in high school and wants some money.
good,"A typical work day includes checking out customers as soon as possible, stocking, helping customers find items, and helping managers when needed. Other duties include cleaning"
good,"As a cashier I spent the majority of my time standing around waiting for customers, I was lucky if I got 15 to 20 customers in an 8 hour shift. My manager was very sweet and the other cashiers were nice for the most part, but sometimes could be a little to absorbed in talking to one another and didn't pay attention when a customer was trying to talk to them. The hardest part of the job was having nothing to do for most of the day, if there were no customers all we were allowed to do was stand at the register and wait for a customer to show up."
good,"Great first job for just about anyone.  It has a lot of job security since there is a union.  Although, it can be very difficult for a lot of people to obtain full time status.  Full timers average a little over 30k a year before taxes which isn't bad.  Co managers make a little more but store managers are where the good money is made.  It can be very stressful time to time, there are often times where people call in and make it tough on the people working that day.  I could go on and on but that's a brief summary"
good,"I personally did not like the job, the work environment was terrible. the store was ran properly, but the management was bad, they would treat employees differently based on how much they liked them."
good,"I bagged groceries, took items to customers' cars and did a lot of cleaning. The job itself wasn't terrible and is pretty average for a beginner job. Most of the employees are really nice. Their scheduling is very flexible and it is easy to get the hours you need during the school year. Hours will almost completely disappear during the summer, would not recommend for a summer job. The other employees did not want to take or trade shifts you couldn't work. You get payed every week, they have an option for direct deposit. You will most likely start at minimum wage."
good,"my co-workers were okay, the manager was really never around but if she was then she was always complaining about how something wasn't done or how things weren't right."
good,I really didn't enjoy working for Kroger the pay was way to little to be doing all the things I was being asked to do! I asked that my schedule be switched to better fit my school and they did not change it!
good,"with little opportunity for advancement and the only incentives being discounts you would have already got with a Kroger card, its not the best place to work, however as a bagger there was interchanging shifts outside collecting carts, an hour at a time, those shifts were often put more than one hour on one person."
good,Fun atmosphere.  Good group of people to work for Recomended for a first job with decent benefits and slightly above average pay good training and management
good,"This job was always a fast pace work environment. They didn't always do great with the scheduling and either scheduled on the wrong days or not enough hours. However, when the scheduling was correct, the job was a great place to work."
good,"The other employees are very friendly but dealing with customers can be a hassle. Most problems may be coupons which they haven't read thoroughly or expired store sales signs that haven't been changed by the employees. With a high turnover rate, it isn't enough cashiers to check out the forever growing lines. Without baggers, it takes twice as long get get finished with one customer. No lunch breaks, just 15  minute break which sometimes gets cut short when a customer stops you."
good,Must have good customer service skills be able to follow instructions to the letter and be able to assist in other areas of the business. Seasonal cha
good,"I was employed to the produce section, This job is one that you kind of get what you expect: decent pay, okay flexibility, fun co-workers.  My only gripe with this job was how political it became. Managers seem to pick sides based on favoritism. They were also not very professional for managers."
good,Bagging groceries and collecting carts was not a fun job to be honest. You will work a lot and then get very short breaks. Management was nice for the most part.
good,The job itself was very enjoyable and fast paced. However management was horrible and coworkers were worse. I would not recommend that location to anyone.
good,worked overnight as a stocker making sure shelves were stocked and full. work wasn't hard but didn't pay as well as should. would recommend for a first time job.
good,"My experience at Kroger was pretty decent. The job was relatively easy and I got along with a lot of the staff. If you're looking for full time work, it is a good start."
good,I haven't worked there long enough to give a proper evaluation of the store.  The most hours I've worked is 16 hours a week  The front of the store is very hot and has no fans or circulation.  I bring an hand held fan to cool myself off.  All the cahiers complain about the heat but management doesn't do anything about it.
good,"Boring job, I was very overqualified for the position. Staff were nice and it was a decent place to work for.  Moved on for something that fit my experience."
good,"Other than that it's really hard work for little pay, store managers we're constantly bickering among each other, and one thought gas lighting was a valid form of management."
good,"Being a fuel clerk at Kroger is a drag. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the customers' attitude. The most enjoyable part of the job must be fact that you can sit down and past time. Management has to be called when things get out of hand, and you better hope they get there before ten minutes past."
good,"I love working here, every day was a different day, with different customers, different objectives each day, it is definitely a great job to work at when you are still in high school or going to college"
good,"The hours were flexible, the people were nice, and they always served snacks in the breakroom. It was a good first job; however, it's time for me to move on."
good,This was my first job. Great place to learn what it is like being in the workforce. Learned a lot of new skills while working here. Learned a lot about customer service.
good,Things can be hectic but also fun I enjoy a fast pace environment while working because it makes the day and time go by so much faster... I have enjoyed providing customer service to the people of my store
good,"Was just a grocery store, stock shelves, tell people where the velveeta cheese is. Was only paid minimum wage ($7.40 at the time) and could only get a raise of $0.25 after working 1 year. Went down the street to work at Applebee's for $10"
good,Management was highly misplaced but the work environment was okay. The people needed more training and people skills. They had favorites and was hard on new employees
good,Enjoyed the experienced gained from working here. Things are different compared to 13 yrs ago.  Provides hands-on experience with customers and their needs. Good job while going to college.
good,Kroger Pharmacy is a great place to work while pursing a college degree. They always worked well around my school schedule and were very understanding.
good,"Working at Kroger was fine for earning minimum wage. At Kroger I was a  bagger for the entirety of my work there. Being a bagger consisted of a lot of different tasks such as bagging, bottle room maintenance, and pushing carts, also, work included training other employees."
good,"Kroger is a good place to work. I enjoy the customers and the work environment. The hours are good and they work around my class schedule. However, the pay wage is low."
good,A typical day of work included dealing with customers and insurance companies. Phone calls and counting and distributing medication and Taking inventory
good,"It is an ok company and i really don't care to reveiw it "
good,"every day consisted of managers caring only about numbers. Kroger has lost its interest in its employees. CUSTOMERS COME FIRST #1 RULE IN RETAIL, but employees shouldn't come last. Meeting tons of new people is fun, but the management just don't care about you or what would make you happier. Working for the union means *mostly* guaranteed breaks and pay raises. It takes years to make it worth it though, and it definitely isn't until then."
good,work here during school or the summer its a great way to keep some extra cash in your pocket i want to say you get paid every week whuch is a bonus so get it
good,"I am a great person to work with I'm a great worker I take pride in whatever work I do and I'm very optimistic when handling difficult situations, I'm a great problem solver as well. To summarize I'm calm and collected"
good,"A very smooth and easy going job, and at times depending on the holidays will get busy and a bit overwhelming. Very nice co workers and nice customers who will occasionally throw a few tips"
good,"I was hired in and very excited about this career opportunity. My family and I were counting on the income, and chance to improve and progress in company. Later found out that because of my background check, which I was completely transparent about during the interview process, I was to be let go because of a paraphanelia charge 6 years prior. It was a great job while it lasted with regular customers and co-workers who became like family. Wish I could have stayed."
good,a typical workday. what you learned. management. workplace culture. the hardest part of the job. the most enjoyable part of the job. your company review and job title will be show publicly.
good,"This job has definitely been a learning experience and I am thankful to have the amazing coworkers I have now. However, the management has no communication skills and often forget to give you breaks. Also, I am not a huge fan of the uniform"
good,"This job has it's days, but the pressure put on the managers get's taken out the associates all the time. Work life balance is rare in most stores, you work 6 days a bit and never get it paid back like the company states in documents."
good,"I really don't have to much bad things, or even good things to say about Kroger. They do know how to do there job, only downside was working with me and my schedule being that I was a high school student at the time."
good,"a typical day at work really depended on the day and what kind of mood everyone was in. i always had a smile on my face because that the kind of person i am, and i love people. The managers could be a pain but it is something you get used to."
good,It's a great place to work although management isn't always the best. They have pretty decent benefits and they give back to their employees sometimes. I wish the pay was higher here.
good,The kroger company it's self is not to blame for my leaving. the location and management I was positioned at with kwik shop is. The managers had no drive for success and did not care they were there for a pay check .
good,"I worked here for a few months and my experience was the worst, I was a courtesy clerk(bagger) and one night as I was collecting carts, I crushed my finger pretty badly, I went home and the next day the manager was upset as to why I hurt myself I'm such an impossible way. If you've ever collected carts you know that there is a possibility to get a finger stuck in between, she ended up giving me a write up for it, for which I soon quit because of the increasing hostile enviorment."
good,Love working there Stacy in the meat department is a great manger. People you meet there will be friend for life. But the top store manager are there just stab you in back don't trust them
good,Good place for students to work if in high school. Little tougher for college students unless you are a night owl. Pushes for good work ethics and teachers you good customer service skills
good,"Typical day is fast paced and busy."
good,It was an alright place to work I guess. The customers were friendly and refreshing. The breaks are about 30 min. The worse thing I would have to say was the compensation. Not enough pay.
good,"Drove a fork runner and picked assigned orders at specific rates, stacked boxes on pallets. Unloaded and loaded semi trailors with Kroger merchandise."
good,"Many people there have their moments, gets busy at alot of times. Many managers are very hard to please, but it keeps you on your toes and running around so you're not bored."
good,I enjoyed bein a cashier at Kroger   Got to meet new ppl and get to really know the regs  that came in   Managers we actually good at location where I was
good,Tracking the various kinds of contruction within a functionin grocery store was challenging at times but very rewarding. Manager had a tendancy to micro manage and not lead by ezample.
good,Employees are almost always struggling to keep up with the customers.  The store is often shorthanded and you are always in a hurry during peak business hours.  The store will resist giving you enough hours to make you full time.
good,A typical day was pretty hectic with a lot of work to start off with but things can get pretty slow so I could find myself walking around with not much to do much of the time when its not busy.
good,"Seniority is gold at this institution. This job is for Students, Moms looking for part time work or people who just want to make the bare minimum. Benefits are reasonable but the politics and fight for hours will drive you mad!"
good,"The management and coworkers at Kroger are great people and always willing to help you in your duties or to succeed. They run it fairly and make sure to let you know what you're doing wrong, how you can improve, or applaud you on good work. They were very willing to change departments as well. Unfortunately, working on one's feet for eight hours was exhausting and wasn't exactly enthralling, but it's a good place for work experience and to have a steady job where coworkers are friendly and customers are, too."
good,"Super great place, nice boss.  Lots of help provided from management and staff.  Recommended field, great place to grow and find your passion.  Lots of attention to employees."
good,very active and all the time busy. interacted  with my co-workers& managers. i wish that i could have given more time of service. due to a mistake on my part  i was terminated from my position.
good,"At this company, you have several skills but not be considered for a raise being that they only go by how long you've been with the company. This company has potential but not until they offer better pay rates."
good,This was a good place to work. I worked in the bakery. I would recommend this place as a first job for students. It was a pretty nice place to work. Yes
good,It was a good place to work.Has good work life balance.Flexable for time off to be with your family and friends The pay was ok for about that time Liked the hours I worked
good,"I've been here a long time , there has been less and less focus on making employees happy . A seemly no care attitude towards personal issues. The company has!a really good benefit program and decent insurance."
good,"It was hard for me to work with the customers, but I got paid decently. Still, perhaps I could have appreciated it a little more. I just wish it wasn't so boring,"
good,"Kroger was a fast past intense job where you deal with lots of unpleasant customers. The management always did there best job, but I feel like something was always missing."
good,"typical day at work I enjoyed working there most days other days it was not so good drama will be at any place you work, but I had an overall good experience working there."
good,I had a splendid experience during my time with Kroger. Managers were approachable concerning issues or new ideas. Only complaint would be that we were spread way too thin in terms of staff.
good,"Not the best job, but not the worst.  They have no day grocery, so they expect everything to be done at night.  They also don't approve of overtime so it makes getting a 2000 piece truck more difficult"
good,"I liked the job at the beginning. I love to clean, so cleaning cars seemed like a fun job for me. The customers were cool people with livings who I found my self fond to speak to. In the worst case; I found out I would not be receiving a pay check, so the money would be a little under the table."
good,"It's a great place for both High School and College students alike.  However if you need a steady salary to support yourself, it's not the place to be.  You will automatically work part-time with a minimum wage and you will not advance any further in pay.  It's also hard to advance in your skill in the working environment as well.  But despite the con on salary and lack of experience you will receive, the employers are family friendly and easy going.  Again it's a great place for students who need a part time job or just trying to start out, but if you are looking for a place for a steady income and provide better experience, it's not the place for you."
good,It was a nice place to work.  I was surprised at the benefits offered due to it being a grocery store.  I didn't expect as many benefits as Kroger offered.
good,I stared working here to help out with organizing and getting the store clean again. I really enjoyed my customers and some of the coworkers but it was a stressful job.
good,"Typical day involved slicing meat."
good,I liked working here but the management wasn't the greatest. They pretty much talked me into quitting because my disability was not something they could work with.
good,"Very Busy Fast paced job , customer expectation is very high not realistic . Too much responsibility for  minimum wage pay , enjoyable part of job is customers that always look for me , hardest part of job is dealing with negative irate customers"
good,"Normal daily tasks included monetary transactions, product restock, janitorial duties, and overall general upkeep of the store. The workplace was inviting and the overall job was not difficult or brutally physically demanding."
good,"As someone that loves a challenge, once it got busy in the department, I was in heaven! I have no problem with 'difficult' consumers, in my opinion, all they need is love!"
good,"A typical day at pick n save would be me coming in and pulling our loads onto the open floor. We are then assigned loads to work on depending on if there was a small load or a big load. We would break it down, stock them up and move onto the next. After we finished out load we would face the store. Once we were done with facing depending on how much time we had we would bring out extra things to do from the back until our shift was over. i learned how to close a pick n save store. I also learned how to operate certain machines and learned procedures when it comes to loading docks. The management was good and fair. The hardest part of the job was speed. Everything was based on timing. the most enjoyable part of the job was talking to my coworkers and being able to listen to music while working"
good,"My co workers were great. Management was very weak and useless."
good,"All companies are not 5-star perfect, so there were some flaws within the company that needed to be fixed but overall a great experience for me in the customer service field."
good,Not much room for advancement unless you know somebody. Management is usually a hit or miss within this company. Very flexible with hours. Almost like pulling teeth to get hours though.
good,I learned the values of great customer service. And interacting with customers on a daily basis. The store I would at was a bit bland and basic.  Management is inconsistent on a daily basis.
good,Was in high school when I started here. They were extremely fair when I had to take days off for various school activities. But they tend to hire the wrong people for management
good,"Have to be on your toes, high intensity, high volume. High focus on customer satisfaction along with low starting pay for pt associates can be challenging."
good,Kroger has some nice people at there wearhoues and they make sure that they have fun and be safe on a job. They make sure they take care of they wroks at Kroger...
good,"at this job I was able to learn many different positions and also work different shifts . I worked as an cashier , worked behind service desk . I was able to learn how to cash checks and also do lottery and also money orders ."
good,"run the deli from day to day, with a few employees. Was ok at first but really was not for me at all just did not like being stuck in one place all day"
good,"Kroger is a good place to start a career with plenty of management opportunities across the country. That said, the company puts work first which produces a negative work/life balance for employees. The company is also not progressive in culture compared to Facebook, Amazon, Google etc."
good,Has great benefits once you get established in your place there.  It will take about 5 years to reach top pay once you reach full time.  Management leadership is poor at store level.
good,"Working at kroger is actually an ok job, the pay is decent and the hours are great.. also they have alot of benefits and great insurance..pretty much you just smile"
good,They give you the time off you need and are easy to work with when it comes to after school activities. The management is approachable and everyone works as a team.
good,A good place for a person in high school to work at. Also good for a first time job but no good for someone wanting to make a career out of it due to the unreliable amount of hours.
good,"Quick days, always bagging groceries or bringing in carts or helping a customer find something in the store. Never really down time, so you are always engaged."
good,"A typical workday is supposed to be 10 hours but that often turns longer because of everything that has to be done."
good,"Nice job if you are looking for sit down relaxed environment with high call volume. Loved the management at the call center, got to be around really nice and relaxed people all day. Get to talk to a lot of good people over the phone."
good,Just looking for something better. Wanting something that I can better my life with and have better opportunities. Kroger is good with working with community but just isn't a line of work that I'm interested in.
good,I enjoy the people I work with. It can be a little difficult at times because it can get so busy. It is a place of none stop working and overall experience of being there is okay.
good,Worked in produce and it could be pretty physically demanding at times. But if you don't mind getting a workout in while getting paid then this is the place for you.
good,This job is mostly just stocking and helping customers. You will be on your feet for long hours and the work can be monotonous. There is very little reward for the job and it teaches basic skills.
good,Have to be able to work all hours and any day. Layed back easy going. Willing to work with you on your schedule. Management very nice. Willing to work well with others.
good,Kroger is a fun and friendly work envierment. They are an equle emploryer and are fair to everyone of there associates. i would recomend Kroger to anyone.
good,"Working as a cashier for Dillons was nice, because I was able to meet a lot of good people and socialize with others who I knew from school and work."
good,Kroger was my first job in 2009. My experience was bad at my first couple of years. When management changed in 2014 and my experience became horrible also
good,"Kroger was a normal grocery chain, very typical for the field. They were more structured then some other places I have work at, and were very ""by the book"", which is great, due to the amount of people that work there who can't function properly with out a very structured set -up."
good,"You are required to work whatever hours they dictate.  Towards the end I was working 80 hours a week.  Staying until 2am some days and back in at 6am.  The higher ups don't care if you are staffed or not they only care about results, and if you fail it is all your fault."
good,The company is great but the pay is not. The job position should've paid much more based upon the duties and responsibilities. Very disappointed in the pay.
good,"As a Kroger employee, there is this culture of ""lay down and DIE for the customer."" If you work in the back, and you aren't seen on the floor too terribly often, you don't really have that. But if you're on the floor, managers are breathing down your neck to make sure that you're bending over backwards for Ms.What's-her-face and her five kids. If you get the right bosses, the day can be enjoyable, even with overbearing managers. If not... then expect your work day to suck."
good,"In the almost 3 years I've worked at Pick n Save I've learned to work 9 departments. The most difficult thing is having a schedule that is only week to week so planning your life is a little difficult. Also with it being week to week they can have you working 10-12 days back to back. (I've done quite a few of these stretches myself). "
good,"Work was very productive and efficient.  Employees were always professional, friendly and fun no matter the location.   Benefits through the Union were satisfactory."
good,Costumer service in the meat department. I loved meeting new people. It is an easy job even when there is pressure. I had customers who would come back just to chat!
good,its a ok job the management is terrible my lil niece can run it better then them.the company is trying to cut and save money so job are getting cut. its going down i would say make it your last choice.
good,"While in High School, this was a great job. Flexible hours, managers that listened to you, and a good number of employees. However, the wages are terrible. I started at 7.45/hr, which is better than minimum wage. However, while climbing the ladder, eventually to CSR (essentially a shift manager), my wages barely increased, even though the responsibility and work load went up exponentially."
good,I enjoyed working at Kroger for the most part. Had a manger that really cared for her employees. She was very willing to teach you what you needed to learn. The hardest part of my job was trying to make people stay focus on their job.
good,"Expect a ton of hours for minimal pay. You will be worked like a dog and have nothing to show for it at the end of the day. With salary starting at 7.25, its hard to make ends meet even if you are working 30+ hours a week."
good,Typical day consists of working production from backroom to the sales floor and assisting customers to product location in friendly manner. learned to rotate and stock inventory. Management has a fair handle on day to day basis. work place is friendly environment with very conversational staff.
good,"normal day for me was to clear the outside lot and after that was finished was to come inside and assist with bagging customers groceries at a steady pace, managers were always back and forth providing feedback on how to do the job better the employees ere nice and a clean work environment,hardest part was sometimes bagging the groceries fast to get customers in and out a certain time but I enjoyed interacting with customers and working on the register"
good,"It was an okay job, but i will have to do many things out of my schedule such as go in the sun for an hour to pull carts with out any break."
good,Great job security. Some advancement depending on goals. Union job. Offers insurance at a low rate. Helps with some tuition depending on area of study.
good,Cleaning and customer service while the face of the company. It was ok at the time and better as a cashier as opposed to a bagger. steady work at an ok pace.
good,"at the time i worked for this company we were only making 6.00 an hour, we were all kids and the management wasn't the best...however i gained experience and skills that helped further my success."
good,They worked well with your needs. It was an alright environment. Kinda dirty. I enjoyed working there for the most part. I didn't like the dirtiness of the place.
good,"I take care of customers needs, making sure that they are satisfied and that they have a desire to visit again. There is nothing special about working here, and it is difficult to move up in the company. It is fun to work with the people around me, and I hope that I am able to encourage them and help them have a better day."
good,The day is fast paced as a Kroger cashier. Must be quick on your toes and handle all kinds of personalities. Can be very rewarding and can show interest and learn from  all kinds of departments.
good,A lot of the management was cool and nice. For the most part it was slow paced aside from weekends an big holidays or sports events. The management tried to make it fun for everyone. They would throw parties if we hit or passed the numbers we needed to get to.
good,"It Was Ok Job , Just Didn't Like How Much They Was Paying For The Cashiers .  But Everything Else Was Good The People That Was There Even The Management Team ."
good,Staff can be super nice and for the most part the costumers that come in have a great and friendly attitude. The hardest thing about the job is standing on your feet for too long and the occasional snotty customer but other than that I have not had any issues at my time working at marianos.
good,"Kroger was fun, the pharmacy family was literally like a family. Grant it we didn't get paid very good at all for all the abuse we took from the customers but it was a fun job while it lasted."
good,a day in the life at kroger is a fun place to work you get to know your customers and the people you come in contact with every day they are very supportive people
good,"Busy environment with plenty of tasks to perform ( cleaning, ordering, stocking, scanning out of bad product) Learned proper FIFO procedures and proper stocking and ordering of product. Management is easy to deal with and willing to lend a hand when you need it. Multiple people in and out on a daily always working with customers ensuring they have everything they need."
good,work is primarly independent except during dinner hours. work included stocking shelves cleaning cashier work and keeping proper track of the money in your drawer.
good,"take rx and enter them in, count pills, check out meds, review post filled rxs help customers near the pharmacy, do inventory, rotate stations and get discount"
good,Disliked: The employees we're not great to work with. Liked; I learned a lot from the managers and supervisors how to efficiently handle the register.
good,for the time i worked at this store i enjoyed it but i enjoyed the customers they were nice an friendly. the hardest part about the job was not cutting your self
good,"fun work place"
good,This job is ok to work at but its not a long term job. Its a good way to get custom service training and socializing skills together.
good,"Very fast paced"
good,This was my first ever job and I have to say it was not for me. The people I worked with were great and I suppose being a cashier here for anyone who is trying to be one would be great. Just not for me.
good,"Cleaning the store, rounding up buggies, bagging groceries and cleaning any spills is a typical day at Kroger.  I learned how to talk to people of various backgrounds.  i learned how to disagree without being disagreeable."
good,Kroger is a fair company to be apart of. I love to be uplifting to customers that  comes in and out the store. A typical day at work was the same as the day before. I wanted to learn new things but my request to do so was repeatedly denied. Management was never helpful about anything and all the new cashier had to ask other coworker for the information.
good,"typical work was very smooth. I learned that a smile gives a customer a pleasant experience, management in my department was great, hardest part of the job was opening duties. most enjoyable part was team meetings daily."
good,"Some days were busy some weren't.  Managers were generally nice people, but it was a typical grocery store job.  Location stinks because it was in the suburbs."
good,can meet new people and learn so many new thing also a great place to start if just getting in to the work filed cool uniforms and great pay
good,I had a great time working at krogers but I felt like I wanted to interact with people more. I only worked part-time and I felt like I needed to work more hours. The people are great and the staff is hard-working.
good,Long work hours and young children made my choice to move to banking..I needed to spend more time with family but I enjoyed the daily interactions with customers
good,"A typical day at Kroger consists of checking out customer's groceries. Since working at Kroger I have learned how to communicate better with people."
good,Like to work with customers and maintain a clean store. It was fun to work there. It was a lot to learn but at times it felt unsafe.  Other than that I would work there again
good,This job is good for if you plan to stay forever. Or if you're looking for a first time job. The pay isn't all that great. Compared to most big time company's.
good,very friendly great people very clean and neat punctual management was very friendly the hardest part about the job was learning how to multi task during the busiest hours of the store
good,"During the summer of 2016, I was given the opportunity of working at Kroger in Savannah, Georgia. I did enjoy working at Kroger due to the great management team. Through the job, I was able to meet new people. I typical day at Kroger is smooth. I usually started my day a 7 a.m. and ended it a 1 p.m. The hardest part of my job was pushing carts into the store from outside."
good,Working here was okay until during the week I came I when I had no hours I got cheated out of pay for being trained on registered because I wasn't in the log and I didn't get many hours afterward
good,Kroger is a nice and friendly company to work for. I enjoy all of coworkers and also enjoy being able to help out customers as much as I can. Great place for someone seeking their first job!
good,It's honestly not a bad place to work it's just that the pay is kind of below average. I look at most of the other grocery stores and the rate they are being paid is far more average than what Kroger pays.
good,What I like about working at Kroger was the environment I was in. I worked in the fuel center and my job was really something. I was very outgoing and good with the customers and my coworkers. I loved my position as a fuel center clerk for Kroger.
good,working at Kroger has wonderful benefits and provides job security. Coworkers are mostly friendly and operate like a family structure. The pay is not very impressive and customers are very friendly respectful and dependent upon you
good,"I would unload trucks, stock coolers and shelves, run the cash register, maintain a clean parking lot/gas pumps, help keep the car wash working properly, and I also worked in the kitchen making pizzas, sandwiches etc."
good,most of the people work with was so nice the bad was didn't get enough hours to par for the gas that I had to use to get their .mangent was ok could use little bit of work one who they favor
good,Working in a grocery store is exactly what it sounds like.  I worked there for a summer in between semesters of college while I was back home taking summer classes.  Its easy and a way of making money.
good,it was usally a good day at work except when one of the head cashiers felt like she had to pick on me and nobody else. didnt really learn anything was there for 3 months and still havent taught me everything. managment wasnt the greatest either
good,good place to work for as a pharmacy technician .friendly co-workers and helpful management. the hardest part of the job is it is physically hard for being busy
good,"very first job started off as bagger helping front store "
good,"Working for Kroger was a fun and interesting experience. I gained a lot of knowledge as well as experience. I worked as the cashier. Handling money, cleaning my area and making sure transactions went through properly. My managers were great, my co workers where always respectful. Some customers made the job a little hard. As for the company Kroger is definitely a good working environment for your first job"
good,Coach workers were very fun had a good time with has them made friends there breaks were alright not enough pay for the work you did supervisors were not cool
good,"As of today 1/13/17, pay start at $8.50 per hour. .50 cents increase every 6 months. I'm not sure what the pay cap is. Overtime pay is after 40 hours not 8 hour day. "
good,"Starting salary is minimum wage and you get a 10 cent increase every 6 months, but only if you aren't a courtesy clerk. Management is not good at all."
good,"Management does not spend a lot of time on the human capital, such as provision of training, promotion whenever needed, inclusion in day-to-day business operations, and encouragement of free-flow of ideas that can be an important part of improvement in operations."
good,Kroger was a good place to work. They had good hours and rotating weekends. Vacation time off was very fair from day one. They seem to lack in employee discipline when there is a workplace issue.
good,"The job is not so bad if you know what you're doing, but unfortunately, there are some petty people and gossiping happens. Glad this company has a union because sometimes after being degraded,people have to defend themselves."
good,"Kroger was a very productive place to be working. The staff was very helpful and kind. The thing I didn't like about Kroger was that they didn't value the younger staff. They were seen as replaceable, or as If they were not meant to be there."
good,I really enjoyed teaching myself to decorate cakes. I generally enjoyed making the products that we sold and helping the customers with their bakery needs.
good,The company was always about whats best for the customers they never really cared about the workers thats why alot of them started leaving after some point
good,Working at Mariano's was a nice place to work at. Customers always come first that's what brings business☺. When working in a retail store it can be busy but its worth it.
good,"It depends on the day but it can be a long day or it can be a fairly easy day.  Since I work in the Deli, you are always multitasking with everything that you are doing.  So you are helping customers, frying chicken, flipping hot case, prepping salads, making fresh salads, checking on soups to see if we need more, making sandwiches.  Those are just part of the many tasks you have to handle.  You just have to be fast on your feet."
good,"Retrieve carts, clean bathrooms, bag groceries, clean spills, and restock items. Other duties may come up as needed."
good,Its a nice place to have a start at its very professional and provide great customer service and its fun you laugh and be very friendly you greet nice customers
good,Great place to get your feet in the door in the retail industry and provide some opportunity for advancement. Hardest part was keeping managers happy
good,Kroger is a friendly neighborhood grocery store. I was a cashier and all customers weren't happy customers. The slightest thing can make a customer upset. So you have to be careful what you say at all times.
good,"Honestly, they treat their employees like slaves. Don't really care to work  here anymore or ever in the future. Pay is not enough and you don't get long enough breaks."
good,The position at Kroger was a decnt position. Treated fairly among other associates. Decent hours while in school and very flexible with schedule. Nice place to work
good,"A typical day a Kroger was great. However, there were some employees and management that were so lazy, they'd inquire about you working their job duties when they're not busy. Overall, management was great and knowledgeable. I didn't find anything hard about my job. The most enjoyable part about the job was helping people with what they needed gaining appreciation from the customer."
good,"Working for Kroger for 3 years has been an overall great experience. Kroger has taught me wonderful social and communication skills throughout my time there. Kroger is a great job opportunity for young individuals wanting to learn responsibility, work ethic and communication with different types of people."
good,Very busy and fast paced workplace. Never not any work to do. Always remained on your feet with something to do. Co workers nice and generous. I learned hoe to stay on my feet and complete the task.
good,"The job is easy on a normal day, but there are times when the people make it hard. May it be the customers, management, corporate, or your coworkers, there is usually an issue. They reduce hours all the time, so don't expect job security when you get in."
good,The store inventory and quality is good. Some of employees little short on their application to responsibilities. location is good management are considerate of employees.
good,a typical day of work is really fast and confusing day because of the management manly. they usually make me cover for other people but i dont mind for the over time and work i get. that is probably the only thing  hard about my day. the co workers make my day there always funny and nice people and i always enjoy talking to them.
good,"Fantastic set of core values, fun work environment. "
good,Working at Kroger was a good place to start off in the job world. i was able to interact with the public and i learned a lot of customer service skills during my time there.
good,"Being a cashier is a job that requires patience, with the customers, the coworkers, and the higher-ups. I was barely trained and was lacking because of it. Though some managers and coworkers were helpful, others seemed annoyed at having to answer questions."
good,A typical day at work consists of running the cash register and interacting with customers on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part of this job was being in your own space and not having someone over your should all of the time.
good,It was an enjoyable place to work and you work with a lot of different people and your customers are nice people to but you do have some that you have to put a smile on your face  and do your job.
good,The union is not always a benefit. It mostly benefits those who mess up and can keep doing less than needed to keep their job. They take your money but do not help those who are hard working.
good,"Employment at kroger was disappointing, minimum wage and no chances to get over time , it was a struggle to get more work. any times that you would get close to, or god forbid , achieve overtime you were given a verbal warning."
good,General cashier job with high volume customer base. Not a bad work environment with the right management. Advancement opportunities available.
good,"i love to work and i am always on time everyday have been a manager at most of my jobs"
good,"Greet customers with a smile "
good,I am deaf but Bilingual and English and American Sign Language because to try write can to read me and i understand to write and read to work the teamwork and stocker but personally to good or attention.
good,"Worked the customer service desk, administered ticket master tickets, assisted with lottery sales, helped with refunds and returns, helped customers to send money Western Union."
good,I loved the people I worked with but the job itself was miserable. For some reason people that shop at Kroger think they're better than everyone else simply because they shop there. Bagging groceries is horrible yet somehow collecting carts was worse. For some reason we weren't allowed to listen to music while we were out there and were rarely allowed to get out of the heat.
good,"The best of it was how much customer interaction a employee got."
good,I felt it was an opportunity to learn new ability's and work with people but the hours were retail so every day was a new experience and I have learned how to use the overhead speaker system
good,Kroger is a friendly environment with many opportunities to grow if you can get your foot in the door. Although management can be difficult to deal with at times most are very easy to work with.
good,The first manager was just perfect but she relocated to a different store. Ever since then I really didn't like how the mangers treated me and fellow employees
good,They throw you out to the wolves. Zero training very understaffed . Wouldn't tell anyone to work there unless your desperate.
good,I have known several employees who wanted to advance in the company but when someone higher up does not like you it effects where you can go. I have known several employees who did advance by making someone of higher status like them. If you are a high school or college kid this is a great job to get you through school.
good,"I was a meat clerk at kroger meaning i handled all things meat wise , cutting , weighing , preparing, anything you could think of involving meat. I also handled alot of modern machinery there ,"
good,Kroger is a good place to start work. Most of the staff are nice and helpful. The customer's make your day go by fast. You get paid every week. It's an overall okay job.
good,"Great company to work for, however, they need to get into the 21st century. They don't believe in paying job seekers for their experience. The pay could be a lot better."
good,"coming in just to work for the job, learned new things like manners. management was okay. like a boss instead of a leader. great lead me to new things. working on busy days is the hardest but fun thing to do. nothing is enjoyable then getting ready to go home."
good,The job itself is easy but the management is bad. They will try to work you in the ground. The union benefits are the best thing about the job. They will try to have you do everything.
good,Appreciated the opportunity to reach out to customers and provide an above average retail experience; enjoyed the interactions with local shoppers
good,Kroger was a place that was very relaxed. You do the same thing every day and you end up seeing the same people throughout the week.
good,A good place to work while going to school. This is a fast paced environment with a diverse community. The people I worked with where very open and easy to work with.
good,I worked part time and got full time hours but never gave me full time benefits so I didn't feel appreciated by krogers I felt used and didn't pay well.
good,Maybe my experience would have been better if there was better management !!! the other cashiers were awesome. supervisors and upper management was terrible
good,I think it was a great first job to start out for me. It helped create a foundation for customer service. It helped get me out of my old antisocial ways and really branch out.
good,"Kroger has no trouble giving you as many hours as possible, but has much trouble adjusting to your scheduling needs. The company will also move you around often and it is hard to get use to different positions."
good,Was able to come in do my job but management was not very appreciatte of what I accomplish from day to day due just either lack of freight to stock or would be reassigned to another duty and required to still perform my primary duty as well making it very diffucult to achieved throughout the day
good,"It's a nonstop service busy all the time.i learned that you have to have the patients always smiling engage with your customers get to know them bond with them.The management is great my co-workers are a team we work as one the hardest part about the job is when you have a unhappy,unsatisfied customer that isn't happy with something or someone services and the enjoyable part about the job is when your customers leave happy and with a smile."
good,"We are paid very poorly compared to other grocery stores. There are no raises for being a bagger, even if someone deserves one, which I think I do. I have worked there for 4 months and put in so much more effort than anyone else that works there, yet I still get paid the same as all of them."
good,i worked 3:30pm to 11pm an i learned how to run a cashier register. The management was okay an i enjoy being around my co-workers an the hardest part was dealing with the rude people that came threw my line
good,"Nice place for leaning skills. Challenge in working during critical activities but after successful completion of the activity, work satisfaction is good."
good,"I have made friends and good memories at krogers. The hours wanted are not given. They cut hours without letting you know ahead of time. Raises are complicated and sometimes not given properly. They flexible with schedule, but scold you if you are late because of class, or traffic even if you let them know ahead of time."
good,You already asked me to review Kroger. I have already answered this. Why are you making me type it again? It's fine. It sucks to be a contractor. You are not treated as part of the team.
good,Nice place help people learn.Life balance manage kindness.Learn how people work as one. Work as a group. Advance is possible.
good,"Difficult work environment, very little positive feedback, always staffing issues and the turnover rate is incredibly high because of low wages to part time and most full time staff with the exception of Department Heads and salaried store management"
good,"Running register and waiting on customers."
good,Overall working for Marionos has been a pleasure. I have learned alot about customer service and work skills. I enjoy working for this company and would recommend this job to others.
good,"Working for Kroger was a good job, I liked the people i worked with, just would have liked to have set hours for when i had to be at work, the manager was a really nice lady."
good,"Good place to learn and advance. Once you advance, no work life balance. No support from the district or division. "
good,Basic job that anyone can do. Management in different departments do not communicate effectively causing organization issues.
good,You have to be oriented to handle day to day interaction with customers and fellow associates.  It can be a life long career if one choose it to be.
good,"While at this job, I as responsible for multiple tasks that included bagging, stocking overnight, cashier work, pulling in carts and running the dairy department. The customers and co-workers alike were all polite. I Would recommend Krogers to any individual looking for a job to help them get on their feet"
good,"I had my ups and downs at this job, but overall I had a nice time working for the company. I made life long friends. I learned a lot of customer service lessons."
good,"My co workers were good people, I enjoyed working there I they have great benefits that come with the job, the only thing is trying to work your way up"
good,There are a lot of long hours to work in every department as a manager and your responsible for every mistake an employee makes. It seems there is no respect for lower level employees from upper management
good,"A great place to work for a people person, the customers were great people, and some had some very interesting stories to share.  The people I worked with were also great people, very friendly and suppotive."
good,It was not the best place to work. The management was bad. I had no idea what I was supposed to be doing most of the time. They always scheduled me with bad hours.
good,"You make your own hours. Start out at part time.  Be friendly with customers and know how to count money. You can do other things besides the cashier, there's self checkout, deli, night stock, pics switches, management positions."
good,I ran the register and closed the store. I learned a lot about customer service and how to handle difficult customers. The funnest part of my job was my day to day interactions with my customers.
good,"This is a great place yo work if you are in school. if you are someone looking for a serious job don't come here. They don't pay enough for a person to make a living, unless you have work there for years!"
good,"A normal day at kroger for me consisted of myself clocking into work and heading over to produce to start work. The job is alright itself, the people are what make the job enjoyable."
good,"Typically five ten hour days, with a wide variety of tasks and challenges, including managing 100 employees of all different skills and experience. Training and coaching a necessity to develop employee skills to assist in store success and customer satisfaction."
good,"Family friendly, but wages need to increase. This stores needs to realize that we are in 2016 and no family man can support his/her family."
good,The work changes by the day in the deli. You need an good understanding of meal preparation and frying and willing to clean at the end of each day and take out the trash.
good,This company was very nice to work for as I have made lots of friends that have become life long friends. Even though the company left this area I still love to shop at their stores when I go to an area that has Kroger stores.
good,The managements could have been better. There was no hands on training. The department I worked in lacked organization. No communication from management to employee. Lack of professionalism.
good,"With a job like Kroger you get to learn teamwork, the ability to grow and learn. Also the ability to drive and work harder for what you want. They had excellent managemt!"
good,"A nice place to work while in school or maintaining other time-consuming commitments because of flexible scheduling. "
good,"Work at Kroger went pretty well/smoothly on a daily basis.  I was a Customer Service Rep, which was nice because I was able to constantly work with many different individuals, both employees and also mostly customers."
good,Was able to engage with customers. Learned register skills and time management skills. Co-workers made the work day go by faster.
good,Kroger life can be good an bad on the same day. Time management is what I learned at Kroger. The management at Kroger was horrible hardly no one would show up for work. Co-workers were rude if you were a new hire. Showing up to work is one of the hardest things but knowing you have a family to feed makes it a lot easier to go. Lunch/break an have time to yourself .
good,Descent company to work for you just have to be there along time until you're able to move up. Seniority is a big issue there.
good,Good employees to work with. Solid working environment. Don't do a good job handling scheduling for all employees. Learned how to do deal with a lot of real life working situations. Co-workers were overall very pleasant. My job wasn't overly difficult and the most enjoyable part was interacting with customers.
good,kroger is a good place to work. only flaw is that their ismt enough hours and no ability to become full time. management is easy to work with. flexible scheduling if you let them know ahead of time.
good,"For what you got paid it was an okay environment to work for. you got to learn about customer relations, but when you had people that did not work very hard you had to pick up after their slack"
good,"A lot of this job involved almost always hurriedly pacing from one side of the deli to the other. Helping customers on Mondays and Sundays, proved to be the most chaotic. Seldom would I get a break when I desired one because of how consistently I was working."
good,Great place to advane your career in average pay based on the job duties performed on the job.including making sure customers are checked out in a fast paced
good,"If you've ever worked in retail then you already know, and if you haven't, you'll find out."
good,"I had to be fast at stocking, or the food would be bad, and melt. You also have to stay neat and organized. And have time to help a customer if needed be."
good,"overall pretty good job. easy advancement, flexible scheduling, pretty cool coworkers. management/scheduling could use a little work."
good,Working at Kroger was a decent experience. I enjoyed most of my coworkers and I had many opportunities to move up. Starting as a minor I was only paid $7.25 an hour for almost 2 years! While the company has a union I think it mostly sucked. The managers were constantly letting go old employees who sucked at their jobs but they would always come back in a few days because of the union. The managers were fine but most of the supervisors played favorites and let the power go to their heads. Getting time off was easy but it was impossible to become full time. The managers had an alert that came from corporate when you got close to becoming full time and they would then cut your hours.
good,"i worked here part time, this was a fun opportunity for me. if you love serving the public kroger is a great place, fun fast paced place to work"
good,Its high pressure BUT HIGH rewards environment. chance to impact companys results every day. operations field so your contributions are visible and measurable.
good,Time would go pretty fast. I learned there to be patient with customers even when they are being disrespectful. My management were really good with working around my class schedule. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to work on my homework when I wasn't busy.
good,"This job was wonderful when I started in high school. Now that I have a family, the varied schedule does not work well with my home life anymore. Management is ok, but is moved to different stores frequently. The hardest part of my job is finding a work/life balance, and the unrealistic goals set by corporate. The most enjoyable part is the interaction with customers on a daily basis."
good,Kroger's is a great place to work. you have the ability to clime the ladder here. you can start out as a grocery bagger and clime to the top to become store manager. managers push for you to be the best you.
good,This was my first job ever and I met people that I will definitely never forget. I have friends eleven years later that I met doing this job. Its a great place to work especially if you are young.
good,"I enjoyed this job very much, nto very flexible interms of work life balance, but the job was decent and good starting point."
good,"Typical day is decorating 2 -3 cakes a day for special occasions and also slicing meats and cheeses from our deli"
good,This job will take over your life and they barely pay enough staring out. The managers don't care about their employees and most of them are a**holes.
good,They're a great co. Pay is great and the lunch is always catered by a company like Donatos or someone popular in the area that will come in and see us lunch at a discounted rate.
good,"Kroger was my first job, and a good first job, but thats about it. Many members of management were clearly not management material, and the pay was well below what it should have been. Although people were friendly, i probably would not suggest working for kroger."
good,I would recommend this as a starting job. Easy job and they will help you enjoy working their. I just didn't like being treated like a kid even after working their for a year.
good,Great place to start out in the workforce..You learn to work with others and learn many trades..Steady pay check.Mostly part-time work.
good,Typical day depended on what management was asking. I learned to keep busy and find work to do if my job was finished early. Management was good with hours and to bring me back every summer after school but denied full time jobs.
good,Enjoyed working with  a great pharmacy staff. The non-pharmacy management didn't really help or hinder our department. I really enjoyed my patient interactions with the customers. I felt as if they were family.
good,"My experience working for Kroger was great. The people there were awesome, everybody was friendly own down from my co-workers to my managers . The hardest part was when holidays came around, everybody needed to come to the grocery store at the same time. You meet some really great custermers that comes in all the time it just made it a great place to work for."
good,I worked there as my first job when I moved away from home. There was plenty of older people and they received benefits. It was an okay job. Management couldve been better.
good,The job its self was easy and fast paced.  My only problem were the people I worked with. The managers were all easy to talk to and usually did their best to get the job done.
good,"I learned that you can not let one negative person get you down, because there is a lot of negative people in this world. The hardest part about my job is dealing with the rude people that make it there job to make your job hard for something you cant handle. The most enjoyable part of my day is the people that come in all the time and just make your day."
good,"Kroger was a great place to work, they provided me with knowledgeable skills needed to successfully pursue my career path."
good,"There isn't anything that makes Kroger stand out. Scheduling sucks (I had a manager who purposefully kept me at 37 hours so they wouldn't have to pay me for full time even though I wanted full time), work/life balance is hard because the schedule is always shifting, benefits are pretty standard benefits, your job maybe secure but advancing is extremely difficult, like any retail management can be good to great to down right awful, the job culture isn't too bad but it isn't anything to write home about."
good,I enjoyed working at Kroger because of the people I worked with but as time grew I realized that I was being taken advantage of for being a hard worker in my department and was only getting paid minimum wage.
good,"a typical night of file mainenance would be me going thru the store Putting up shelf tags, beginning with “A” tags, closely watching effective dates as well as Specifically follow the “Batch Application Procedure” to avoid discrepancies , Complete price changes by mid-morning Sunday ,  Put up replacement tags ,  Put up “Compare and Save” tags and check prices of items , Perform scan audit over a duration of 4+ hours making corrections where needed"
good,"Working for The Kroger Company has been alright. Kroger does a fairly good job a working with employees hours. You mostly work with your immediate supervisor in making the schedule and letting them know the hours that you can take on and what days would be best for you to work. Benefits with the company are not too bad. It's pretty nice to work part-time and have insurance for eye-care and dental. Job security isn't really a problem with Kroger as long as you are doing your job, working with other associates, and are well mannered towards your customers. The Management at Kroger varies with managers. In the four years I have spent at my store we are working with our third store manager and an entirely new team of co-managers. I am not sure why the company continues to shift around co-mangers after 2 years at a store however, our old manager was moved to a different store for various reason. The new management team we have is outstanding is hands on around the store making sure the employees and customers are taken care of. Job culture at our store is decent most days, but most of the department heads are unfavorable with one another. A typical day for me at my store is to come in for the morning shift, and breakdown the pallets of product we received for the day. Throughout the day I take the product to the floor and rotate any older product forward on the self and place anything new towards the back. I make sure to greet customers and offer assistance to anyone who needs help. I also help to order product for the self and any extra for items that go in the display case that"
good,While working for the Kroger company I learned a lot of different skills. I learned customer service along with what it takes to.keep a retail or grocery store operational.
good,They put way to much on you for the Pay. If you have no retail experience the Pay is 7.25 I would not recommend working there.
good,this wasn't bad for a first job. i was just a cashier so i would just be at the register for the shift. you get 15-30 minute breaks depending on how long your shift was. management wasn't always around.
good,"Kroger is a fun and productive  workplace, but lacks in advancement opportunities, due to this fact I am seeking further employment"
good,This job has good benefits and great pay but what they want out of you makes it hard to enjoy life as well as working at a good supporting job.
good,"honestly I really enjoyed working for this company. I had a really good boss, and everyone we worked with was also very nice and helpful"
good,Enjoyed working for the company also had fun talking with the clients I was in contact with daily had a good time
good,"My day consisted of restocking shelves, working the counter, and cleaning whenever a chance to do so came about. Management was very friendly and helpful. Company executives however made things frustrating for both employees and customers alike with constant changes in policy."
good,"It is a good place to quickly advance if you are young and cannot pursue a higher education.  It is demanding because it is a 7-day a week business and the quality of help is limited.  The company micromanages most aspects of the business from its corporate office and they do not willingly accept excuses nor accept any responsibility when goals are not met.  It puts the store management teams in a tough predicament because they understand the challenges the employees face with daily responsibilities and limited budgeted hours to work with.  The corporate office believes they have put the ""perfect"" plan in place where no store should fail."
good,It is about what you would expect. So long as you enjoy customer service this job is an alright place to work. The pay is minimal but can get you by.
good,Not changing and very rude coworkers was the hardest part. Most enjoyable was interacting with customers. Overall an Ok job
good,"Krogers was a fun work place, but it had a lot of days of constant drama and no one wanting to work. People constantly called off, or just didn't show."
good,show more concern for workers as needed   employers need to communicate more with the employees  i like working here just cant live with the pay
good,"I needed off work for some weekends to get my children from their dad's house, but my manager refused to let me have some weekends off for them and I spent 2 months without being able to get my children due to that situation."
good,Had a good time working here making customers smile and laugh while I ring up there items for sale. Easy job to handle. I would recommend this job to anybody.
good,"Working for kroger was fun at tie and yet stressful, customers were pleasant most of the time, management wasn't always quick to respond to employee problems but still got them solved most of the time.They are  good company to work for if you want a part time job while in school."
good,As the description says. They will also work around your schedule. Sometimes you may get called in. That's expected. Managers are pretty laid back.
good,"I enjoyed most of my time while working at Krogers. The only thing I would say is that not all the managers are respectful and friendly, the other associates are disrespectful to the customers and never got disciplined for it, and the customers had the right to be disrespectful with no questions asked, so I left my position as Bakery Clerk. I was unhappy."
good,"Bad management, fun environment and fun staff, enjoyable customers. Always a great environment, Customers were always delightful and respectful. No drama"
good,i was able to work with clients face to face and give them an excellent service. And i learned how to organize perfectly shelf.
good,"Very good first job, you learn a lot like customer service, communications, and multitasking. I once worked 13 hours at the Starbucks in the store by myself. Not knowing I could've closed early. Didnt really have good direction. The man who hired me gave me $7.90 an hour, after working there for over a year i was making 8.25. New people started coming in making more then i did with no experience. The new guy made 11.50 an hour and he had no experience. Very unclear work environment."
good,"1. Always busy "
good,"Everyone there is really nice. However, it is not very well managed and it becomes chaotic. Managers take themselves too seriously and don't care about the hourly workers. They refuse to hire enough people or allow overtime, so many things go undone. My coworkers were some of the nicest people I've ever met. We put up with many ridiculous demands from management."
good,I would love to work in a place that appreciates it's employees and treat everyone with an equal amount of respect. i would like to be in a nice place where the atmosphere to be positive and motivating
good,"With having such high energy as I do, working in the fuel center wasn't for me. I didn't enjoy being in a tiny box for hours and hours on end. My coworkers were enjoyable. I had fun while at work with them there. Being alone in the box and having to wait for someone to come relieve me to use the restroom was one of the worst parts. Not a bad company to work for all in all."
good,My typical day at work is almost always busy at work and always busy doing something. There is always things that need done around there so if I'm not busy I always try to find something else for me to do cause I hate just standing around not doing anything when I know there are other things that need done around the store.
good,"very busy and not enough resources to get the duties done efficiently or properly."
good,A job is a job. Worked minimum wage there during my college years. Cowokers were friendly.Management was mediocre at best. Customers always seemed angry and not very patient
good,"really busy store, I feel that you should be getting paid a little more for the job your doing, but overall its a good store to work at to build character and talk to different people."
good,Like any place you work at it has it's problems that need fixing.  Some managers act like your faking when ur really sick.  Co-works can be rude and nasty but not all just a few.
good,"I liked working at Walmart, except my health caused issues with the management. I ended up being fired. I shortly there after applied and started receiving disability benefits."
good,I learned about customer services and how to use problem solving skills to give the customers satisfaction. Most enjoyable part was working with coworkers
good,Kroger was a great place to work. My Co-workers where great especially if you were willing to learn and asked questions. The mangers also loved if you showed and proved interest in other departments to get trained in
good,You need to accomplish many things before the day is over and sometimes you won't get to all of it and honestly that doesn't feel very good sometimes.
good,"that was a good team to work with, everybody used his strong silk to pitch in to make the department move efficiently.The boss is wonderful."
good,"I was hired as part-time, second shift employee.  I am currently looking for a better job opportunity that is mutually beneficial."
good,"At Kroger, the customers are so dedicated to shopping there it is unbelievable. Kroger is a great company and has some of the best produce in the world."
good,"I really enjoyed my job, I had a great manager and co-workers.  It could be stressful waiting on customers, sometimes we had very rude customers."
good,it is a cool place to work for students and people who need the job not what I want to do long term being paid weekly is a plus. it is a decent job to have for the time being while working towards my ultimate goals in life.
good,"A typical day at work was like any other day, taking merchandise off the pallet and stocking, assisting customers, and making sure the store was cleaned. co-works are great, not really a hard job."
good,"I enjoy working with Kroger.  I enjoy the customers that come in on a daily basis.  I enjoy assisting with there needs, and in the customer service role, I enjoy that as well.  I think now there have been many changes in Management.  And they don't care about their Employers the way they should."
good,"Normally a typical day as a nutrition manager involves stocking and ordering all organic products within the natural foods department. I'm the only associate that is currently employed within this department which has its advantages and disadvantages."
good,"Checking out people for hours on end tends to be rather boring. My co-workers are nice and caring. Management is rather approachable, but the hardest part of the job is having to watch what you say."
good,"a typical day working at Pick n Save consist of greeting customers, checking them out, and bagging their items. Once there is no customers we at to stand at the end of the register. I enjoyed working with my co-workers. the hardest part of the jobs in having to stand at the end of the register and just stand there until another customer was ready, i perfer to be active as in cleaning the register straighting up the store, putting go back away."
good,I went in knowing nothing left with tons of knowledge. willing to train the right candidate long as you're eager to work and learn new things
good,Everyday Kroger is filled with customers and the workplace atmosphere is always busy. The Employees are awesome and I enjoy being apart of the team.
good,Typically staying productive by stocking shelves and helping customers everyday.  Myself have learned how to do inventory and order for sale levels when I was lead of Frozen and Dairy departments.  Myself in in particular get along with all my fellow associates.  Hardest part of the job is keeping the customer happy when you run out of a certain product and try to replace it with another one.  Enjoy going to the job with people I work with make it that much more enjoyable.
good,Military logistics was fast pased and more focused on labor rather than administration. It required lots of energy for the non-stop environment.
good,its a good place to me but most of the times the workers are rude or the don't do their jobs. I lie the stocking part because I could have my alone time to think to myself.
good,"Got me through school.  Work days were long and boring.  It paid the bills.  If you don't mind standing for long periods of time, this is the job for you."
good,"Easy work, the schedule is flexible, decent management, pay is horrible. It is primarily used as a good first job to learn responsibilities, or the retired to have something to do during the day. Not meant for the long term or anyone attempting to pay rent on the wages provided here. Although higher pay can be achieved if you stay long enough."
good,"My job in the fuel center was laid back overall, but it was the only position at Kroger to have a low level of stress. Management was somewhat unpredictable. I enjoyed working with my co-workers. The company as a whole seems to care more about the appearance of the store than the employees compensation and benefits."
good,kroger is a good company treating the customers and employees excellent. reason for leaving was for a better job opportunity.
good,"Kroger is a good company to work for. They have good benefits like 401k, health insurance, and the opportunity to invest in shares. However, if you are fuel clerk you do not get insurance but unions dues are still deducted from your pay."
good,"Overall good company. Friendly helpful coworkers, including front end employees. Strict yet reasonable  and reliable management. Flexible schedules with some overtime available."
good,Greeting customer's and helping them with their needs in a fast and friendly manner.  Keeping work area clean and helping any way I can.
good,"fun to work with coworkers they're nice people, management is well taking care of, they always are willing to help you. the hardest part was not having the right items in stock"
good,Walmart is a great place to work. i loved working here. i love working in a fast pace environment and meeting new people. the hardest part of this job is dealing customers who are upset.
good,I work grocery here and love it. They have a great chance to advance in the company and are will to help. The engagement really listens to their employees and customers.
good,"Kroger's is a fast is a fast paced work environment with a friendly atmosphere. I enjoyed overnight work with the company, but only worked with the company for a brief moment, due to the demand of my second job."
good,"Helped customers find items in the Home and Garden department."
good,"When I come in I would have to report to the person on the produce floor and check with them in order to see what needs restocking or cleaning that way there would be no need to check which waste a little time towards the end of the shift I would have to clean up and stock pallets."
good,Was not the greatest place to work. Work for them for about a year. Order selector pulling order to the dock to be ship off to the store the next day.
good,Very good company to work for and make accomplishments. A company that keeps you busy and motivated. Company possess great customer service and promotes when needed.
good,"I worked here for two years, unfortunately I worked with bosses who brought me down instead of developing me as an employee"
good,"This was a pretty nice job to have. I worked about 6-8 hours a day usually 4-5 days a week, hours ranging from afternoon to evening. My management team was very supportive and so were my co-workers, though the scheduling hours were sometimes very unpredictable. I worked in the apparel department and my daily duties consisted of folding clothes/maintaining department, stocking the general merchandise, helping customers find things all over the store, taking phone calls, bagging up front for the cashiers and loading/unloading new shipments. The hardest part of the job was the constant running around the store while the most rewarding and enjoyable part was being able to help customers successfully."
good,"Help customer with types of meats and cheese they want cut, or write on a cake or help them find something Then clean work space before you leave. "
good,"bagged groceries, helped customers to the best of my ability. re stoke un used items, and pushed in buggies into the work place after customers were done using them."
good,Its very fast pace and very nice place to work. the worst thing is coupons and people who have no patience for anything but their on time.
good,"I love  working at Kroger, the store has everything you could think of.       The  employees  are great and friendly the customer are fun to serve.  I appreciate Kroger for bringing me into the team. I start by making sure my work station is clean and supplies ready to work thru the schedule.  I have a smile and customers smile back, it is great.  I am amazed at all the products that consumers find to fill their grocery list."
good,"An average day at Kroger usually starts with coming to work and clocking-in on time. You make your way to your designated places in the building which could be produce, deli, front-end.etc One thing I learned that truly aided me in my daily challenges was pro-activity. If you take care of a problem before anyone in management or your immediate supervisor tells you then that opens up an opportunity to tackle more tasks instead of having to be explained what to do next. However, all workers did not think this way. The best of part of this job is usually the people you meet along the way. I say this because the simple joy of networking can instantly open a new door of opportunity as well. The hardest part of the job is definitely when the place becomes backed up, customers become irritated, and some of your co-workers are nowhere to be found. But overall, this place is great for part-time work."
good,"They were not to clean of a place for being a food manufacture.Did not like the fact of all the cover ups they had for hygiene reasons. I loved the people there, but there were to many rude people there to keep working there and be happy."
good,"Kroger is very customer service orientated, with a lot of importance on the customer. If you have a good work ethic you will be promoted very quickly but the compensation isn't very high"
good,This was an okay job. Nothing special about it. I did not like that they only paid minimum wage plus they would not give me hours like they were everyone else.
good,I checked customers out as a cashier and handled customer complaints. I learned how to handle stressful situations better. Management was understanding and friendly. The hardest part of the job was getting off work so late. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people daily.
good,"This was my first job during high school.  Great starting job, hours worked around my school schedule. Supervisors were ok, in my opinion there were too many supervisors over my entry level position."
good,This job was fairly a good job. Friendly people constantly greet you and lots of help from everywhere. There will be days where people are not friendly which i did not enjoy
good,"As a high school student, I learned how to work with adults that were twice my age. This was my first legitimate job, so I paid close attention to the customer service and retail side of the job. I was constantly helping out a customer and was able to work in several different departments before I had to move away from college. The most difficult part about my job was ""go-backs""!"
good,"I worked at Kroger for about a month. The pay is so low, one has to have a second job just to make ends meet. A typical day consists of stocking shelves, straightening them (this is known as conditioning) and doing returns. The one thing I hated about my job was that there was often no clearly marked place on the shelf for most of the stocked item and they over-ordered for one product while being in short supply of other products. Because of this, stocking the shelves and doing returns was a huge pain."
good,It is not a bad job if you're interested in working part time as the company and management are flexible with working with you on hours.
good,"Kroger is an alright experience, however they are bad at communicating and management is all about themselves. I learned how to operate the store per every department. My co-workers were awesome, but management was very unorganized therefore most people quit. They are short staffed and use people for what they need, but don't want to raise pay. The pay rate between part time and full time is not a significant difference."
good,"Great entry level place to start, but you can advance with this company and the training is great. The people are great with this company and very helpful. I enjoyed working with for Kroger."
good,"The pharmacy is usually very busy, so I'm always alert, on my feet and up to the task. My co-workers are friendly and very helpful and I'm still learning how to work the operating system"
good,"Cashiered and maintained balanced cash registers.  Provided excellent customer service in frequently, fast-paced and sometimes hostile work environments."
good,Its been a long time since i have worked there but most of the time a fast paced work environment. I learned alot also trained on a variety of forklifts. management back then was great and so were my co workers. Hardest part was all the overtime in the busy season but they alaways took care of us especially during the holidays and rewarded us for safety.
good,A typical day at work consists of greeting and assisting customers. Checking out their orders and making sure they found whatever they needed.
good,"Decent job for young people trying to make some money.  Typical day would be helping customers checkout and purchase groceries.  I learned how to be friendly and vocal towards customers and how to make a customer feel welcome.  Management is goal oriented and are friendly towards their employees.  Co-workers are young and energetic.  Hardest part of the job would be standing in one spot for 6+ hours.  Most enjoyable part of the job would be joking around with the co-workers, making the job a little enjoyable."
good,"not a bad place to work, great people and great co workers, very flexible hours, management listens to both the costumers and the employees."
good,"I learned valuable skills, such as customer service, patience and cash handling.  The turnover was fairly high so that impacted productivity.  The requirement for us to join a union seemed odd since I was just a part-time employee who was in high school."
good,"Greet customers, scan their items take their money, bag their items and thank them. I love my customers and I love to make them happy, smile and feel good when they leave my store. If you treat people with respect you will get it back. I always look up to management no matter what age they are. Co-workers are great as long as they work hard as well and stay off their phones and mind their own business. The hardest part of my job now a days is the lifting. The most enjoyable is Seeing my customers leave with a smile."
good,A typical day at work when im bagging groceries and taking people's groceries to their cars push the buggies back in and do it all over again !
good,A typical day starts and they usually ask me to stay longer. Sometimes I would and sometimes I wouldn't. It depended on who was running the front end of the store that day. I don't hate anyone but some can do it better than others. The ones who can't make a real mess of the breaks and lunches because they control that.
good,kroger is a good place to work it has busy days but nothing you cannot take care of it also has great growing opportunities to grow into the company
good,"Its not my favorite job, but i get decent hours just don't get enough pay for the kind of job that i do and the amount of work i put into the job. I have had some issues with being treated poorly over small issues."
good,"I have learned a great deal while working for this company and would love to learn more including on how to get a raise."
good,"Working at Kroger was kind of difficult because I had 3 different managers and a lead, they all would ask to have things done differently hard to please all of the superiors at once."
good,Interesting people from all walks of life. You always see knew faces come into the store. Co workers are easily enough to get along with and the job wasn't that hard honestly.
good,"I learned that within Kroger the only way to be noticed is to have responsibility, and it takes time to gain responsibility. A typical day starts with making sure the entire sales floor is stocked and ends with making sure that there is room to fit new product in the storage areas."
good,This was my first job so it was hard for me.  I learned quickly that customers were easily upset and you had to learn to balance the checking out with polite conversation.  I really enjoyed the sweet repeat customers because they were very uplifting.
good,"Fry's is a great place for entry management.  It has a lot of opportunities for department managers.  While it offers a lot of opportunity, it's over burdened with too many procedures/in-house regulations."
good,"I did not expect what I was expecting when I applied for the job. After I got the job I found out that they don't make anything there. It is all pre bought and stored until needed. "
good,"I learned a lot from Kroger it helped me know more about food and the importance of what temperature foods need to be in order to kill certain bacteria and it taught me to adapt to the different personalities in the workplace, I have a really good team and they don't mind helping me with things. The hardest part of my job is not being able to please everyone when you've done all you can to do so and also they're not so family friendly because they don't recognize that you have a family life as well as a job but the easiest and most enjoyable thing about my job is when my customers are pleased with everything and left with a huge smile."
good,I liked working for them but they didnt want to give anybody rasies. they treat people bad. they didnt want to give anybody more than 30 hours. I just lefy like they didnt want anybody to get better in life.
good,I would recomend this job for teens only not very steady on hours and very poor pay system. I have learned alot and have gained great custumer service. Kroger management doesent really comunicate very well with each other.
good,Good for young people looking to broaden their resume and get some real world work experience with a decent pay along the way.
good,"enjoyed this place to work at, its was also very hard to try and move up because i was constantly working in different location in the same store i was unable to receive a higher pay do to the fact that i started as a sales associate. I also worked as a cashier, but was not paid as a ""cashier"" would normally be paid because my title was ""sales associate."
good,"Kroger is a good company to work for, and offers a variety of positions, with locations almost anywhere. They have opportunity to grow, and advance your career."
good,It was a good job. The company is good to work for and I would work for the company again again if i needed to. My only complaint is that I was noty able to get the hours I needed.
good,Typical grocery store work. Most people get along well and management wasn't bad. Personally had to work overnight once a week which I didn't like but the work wasn't hard. Closed on Christmas only open 24/7 the rest of the year.
good,While working at Kroger several issues were ran into such as the availability i had put was scrapped and disrespected in many ways such as the times and dates were completely ignored as i was placed at availability anytime which is very difficult fro a high school student to do. Any time requested off was ignored and quite frankly almost made me unavailable to go to my high school graduation and on top of that the time off request is done online and made entirely impossible to complete due to the nature of the system. Kroger is therefore the last place i would consider working and i would NEVER work there again.
good,"i got the job and was really excited about it. but when i got there to train, they didnt train me very well. other than that the job was great i love it!"
good,Good team players all passionate about their jobs. Great to have experience with Vendors and negotiating promotional deals.
good,Overall all working at Kroger is a good working experience. Task that are given to you are not to difficult and are pretty straight forward.
good,"Prices are always top of the line competitive, customers were for the most part pretty friendly. Management always encouraged workers to strive for the best."
good,I enjoyed interacting with customers on a day to day basis. Pushing baskets and bagging groceries also is very enjoyable.
good,A typical day at work had me cutting fruits an veggies for their salad bar. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and learned with their guidance how to perform my duties. It was a good learning experience and very satisfying to see a good product on the line.
good,Kroger is unionized so getting a  bigger paycheck is a real struggle.  Very positive atmosphere with great employees. Nice to have breaks in the middle of your shift.
good,"Great place to pick up on customer service skills, you can use and improve your communication skills as well as working with people of all ages."
good,"Kroger offers benefits to all employees, no matter what's their employment status, i would strongly recommend anyone to come apply."
good,"Kroger is a good company to work for, they have great benefits and if you have an interest in retail has a career, This is a good company to move up with."
good,"The days mostly were really busy or really slow. For the most part night times were always really busy, and normally I worked from 2-10 so I was always closing. But before 5pm on weekdays it was slow giving you time to relax, but after that it got extremely busy. The front end was always understaffed and abused my knowledge of every department to help them to the point that it interfered with my own job, and would punish me if I did not go to help them, but also punish me if I did not finish my own job leaving me in a bind."
good,I never felt comfortable working for Kroger. I had so many years in at Publix I felt like a trader!  and it didn't go to well with my husband either since we have stock in Publix. Overall Kroger stores are very dirty stores.
good,"I enjoyed learning skills that I wouldn't usually have the chance to learn. Accounting and filing are clerical skill sets that I found to like, and didn't expect to find or learn. The safety and regulations allowed for an organized, safe and pleasant working experience."
good,A typical day at work would be me delegating actions and working with out supervision and keeping a clean and catering to customers needs.
good,"Working at Kroger benefits you with good hours, but minimal flexibility. Kroger hires employees that are easy and fun to work with."
good,"this was a part time job that required little knowledge or training . "
good,not sure what else to say about the company.  I think I have answered this questions a couple of times already.  Not sure how to make it pass this point.
good,"Fast paced and think on your feet kind of job"
good,It was very unfair in the treatment of the employees. My co-workers were amazing. Management were very rude and disrepectful. Hardest part of the job was taking on the responsibility of another co-worker.
good,a typical work day paving with good management and good co-workers for a job well don. in hot weather conditions some day long some days short.
good,I enjoyed working with fellow employees there were some lacks of communication with management and the store supervisors. I always worked hard to get the job done.
good,fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. decent amount of hours for someone that is looking for a part time job
good,Great for a first job. They work with student's schedules but not really a place for long term employment and advancement.
good,I appreciate the discounts they give us and the special items that are available at a reduced price. I like the fact that they work with my schedule.
good,"Fun work place w/ supportive management. Not all about the number but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected at a bug company."
good,At Kroger you have to make customers your number one priority.  As  an employee you will have your main responsibilities but also helping out on the front end to get customers in and out of the store as quick as possible.
good,"a typical work day at krogers is really fast and upbeat."
good,"An average place to work, but with employees and managers being afraid of upper level management. Priorities from home office were more important than taking care of customers. A nice place to shop for price and variety, but I would not want to work there again. When I tried to make suggestions, I was told I wasn't paid to think."
good,"Its a ok job, I come to work and do my job without being told, I provide excellent customer service. I make sure that the customer found everything ok because we KROGER will make it right."
good,typical day customer service. i learned how a union works. management was off/on good.  coworkers were a good mix of old and young.  hardest part was trying to make a living off of thier wages i got maybe a dollar more than min wage after working there for 4 years.  most enjoyable was learning things and fiinding a way to make it better and quicker.
good,Always feel pushed to do things evn when it is not necessary! It was the worst work environment I have been in. I am very glad I left
good,Doesn't pay a living wage nor does it give enough hours. I've noticed the company does not live up to a lot of promises that are made.
good,Help customers find things they are looking for. Greet them make sure they have a wonderful shopping experience Customer Service Rep
good,I have learned how to handle customers with specific needs and situations. I have also learned how to be a better manager in regards to employee relations and as well as performance in my department.
good,Checked out the customers and made sure they had what they needed to feed their families. To make sure they were happy when they left.
good,"Good place depending on what department u worked in"
good,I worked the graveyard shift answering emails in the call center and it was as boring and unimaginative as you would think. There isn't much room for talking with others and they expect a lot of work for low compensation.
good,"The job itself I very intense. Lifting heavy pallets, loading and unloading trucks, carrying heavy crates of merchandise; however, I enjoyed working with my customers and pointing them in the right direction of the things they may need. I worked with mostly men so there was not much gossip within the work place with made for a smoother working experience. The hardest part of my job was accomplishing all the task within the time they allotted. The most enjoyable part of my job was my customers."
good,"My typical day was slice the deli meat, cheese, wait on customer. Stock the boat on the sales floor. If I was doing the chicken side. I would go to the cooler to get the chicken. Put whole chicken in the rotisserie, set the timer. The take the 8 piece chicken put it in the flour and put in the fryer basket. Let the chicken cook for 10 minutes "
good,"All in all, not a completely horrible place to work. "
good,Very under-staffed at one point but i got alot of hours i did three different jobs while working there. they need to learn how to speak to their staff and customers more kindly
good,"As with most places there are areas that need attention and it has its up and downs but other than that a pretty good place to work, and  can be fun as well."
good,"its a place to gain an income, there is not much to it the work was easy and the growth was zero. but it isnt a bad place to start out."
good,"my first job so at the time it was great. A lot less professional than what I would want to be involved with today. Always had cool co workers. End of the day its just a job. No bonus, no real motivation"
good,The employees are great! Its like you and your co-workers are family. You have no work life balance. The company want you to work for every holiday and anything important to you. They hire very few people so you are stuck on your own doing everything. The customers will get everything before they even give you a free meal. Most of the employees feel unappreciated and it's sad. The pay is only good if you are a department head. If you are a cashier and you move to a supervisor you get no pay increase but more responsibilities.
good,Good company to work for. Plenty of opportunities to learn new skills. Work life balance can be difficult to manage at times.
good,typical day coming in to work going to the fuel kiosk and making sure everything was up to date and helping customers with their gas. Maintaining a clean work place and area around the pumps and kiosk. Very friendly management and coworkers. What I learned from working in the gas station is that no matter what kind of situation your hit with always keep calm and put the customers first.
good,It was a job until I was able to find something more steady.  They love to cut hours without warning...Not the best company to work for.
good,"it ok place to work; "
good,I have a great team but the management team above me could use some improvement. Do not respect the work/life balance. I am required to work 10 hours a day but usually work 11 to 15 because management ask for more to be done after my team leaves and I am the only one left.
good,"A typical day at Kroger was pretty much okay for the most part. While working there I learned that you have to deal with different type of people and treat them all the same. For example, if an upset customer comes up to you with an attitude, you should not give them an attitude back. You should remain calm and talk to them politely, that same as if a person with a positive attitude came up to you. The management was okay as well, but sometimes they did not treat people equally and would choose and pick favorites. I got along well with all of my co-workers and till this day i still communicate with them. I did not really have a hard part of my job, but the most enjoyable part of my job was i got to meet new people everyday."
good,I was given tremendous opportunities for growth at Roundy's and learned a great deal from the many different people that I worked with over the years.  I most enjoyed being able to mentor others and watching them advance in their careers.
good,Was providing customer service to all customers and getting them what they want such as lunch meats and other deli items.
good,"Kroger likes to put a good foot forward and talk about our prices are good, our people are great, how work life balance is important. It varies greatly when the rubber meets the road."
good,"As trained to be, Kroger employees are friendly, compassionate and helpful, therefore co-workers are fun to work with. "
good,The co-workers are great and really help to keep you learning and make it feel like a family.  However district and division management make it very stressful to do your job and take care of customers.
good,good team work and great people to work with. more physical work.you have to carry more than your expected to carry and have to be fast in your production level.
good,Nice people to work with.  Management was flexible but not always supportive of employees.  All in all was a nice place to work.
good,"There was always something to be done around the store in various areas. Customers could use some common courtesy, but the size of the store made it impossible to find what you were looking for so it was understandable."
good,"Nobody at Kroger really ""cares"" and nobody actually cares about anything else. Everyone is lazy and not professional!"
good,"Fred Meyer is a decent place to work"
good,A really nice lace to work. There's so many was to move up within the company and its very easy just give a little time just get your foot in the door as well as keep your name in good company.
good,"Good place to work, ok management, and very good benefits. employees don't show up for work as they should, which makes the job hard than it should be. But overall, it's a good place to work for."
good,"HR normally do a poor job at hiring new associates, and management typically promotes the wrong people. My position is not an easy position, but I have learned a lot about being a leader and managing the front end. Overall, it was an okay place to work. Would not make a career, although, some people have and will."
good,great co workers and great job relationship with management.  I have had nothing but the best experience with this store and would go back if needed or asked.
good,"Its a great place to work, and can have great benefits."
good,It's easy work and the coworkers are great. Management is ok. Typical day is stressful. Some customers are not smart. Hardest part of the job is the stress brought on by customers. Mot enjoyable part is it is easy work.
good,"Great place to work, family friendly place. Cleaned for food safety for food. Breaks are fare for the hours you work. Plant has good insurance. I could get along with all the people that work their all the time. Their like a family away from your own family."
good,"Typical day involved stocking shelves and organizing stock room."
good,Great over all work environment but a little too corporately structured.  The middle or little man tends to get pushed aside.
good,"I enjoyed my job, liked working in the back. "
good,I love the customers that I came in-contact with. Everyone that I worked with for the most part was very and very hard working.
good,Nothing extremely special but nothing too bad. Management was kind and courteous with its employees and made you feel welcome right from the get go. The way customers were treated could have been improved on but everything else was pretty good.
good,"Work shifts changed from week to week. My job here consisted of customer assistance such as bagging groceries, taking groceries to the customers car. Janitorial duties; cleaning restrooms,  sweeping floors, collecting grocery carts from the parking lot, and moving them inside. The hardest part of this job was probably having to deal with cranky or disgruntled customers. These were few and far between. In fact, the most enjoyable part of this job was getting to know many of the regular customers."
good,"They have a good work Training when you start but need some help in Advancement.  There are great co workers , And the people you meet is always very fun"
good,"A very decent place to work but at times feels like its more suited to being someone's first job than a place you would want to have a career at. I did learn many life/work lessons that I know would help me at other places.  I enjoy most of my co-workers and would say    they are the best part about my job, that along with the satisfaction I get from helping others.  The hardest part about the job would be the inconsistent hours and trying to plan stuff outside of work."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed the working at Kroger. Most of the time, they were flexible with scheduling, helped you if you really needed it, and tried to work with you on any new projects that came up."
good,Fast paced and busy. Customers sometimes find it difficult using the Kroger plus cards at the gas pumps and beware if the do not receive and loyalty reward fuel points they have acquired.
good,"team work "
good,"Usually competent. very physical. Training budget could be bigger. Free coffee in the breakroom, lunch provided from time to time."
good,"meeting new people working as cashier, helping customers find the items they needed. Enjoyed working in floral making nice arrangements and working more with customers on a one to one basis"
good,Working for kroger has been a good experience. I have nothing bad to say about the company.Kroger seems to employ a lot of interns.
good,"Fun first job, lots of diff. people and regular, very flexible with school schedules. 10% off of store brand products as well!"
good,This company was a good company to work for.  The boss and manager was nice however the employees had their good and bad days
good,A typical day for me is greeting customers with a smile and being attentive to what they would like to order. I've learned how to make customized beverages and how important it is to pay attention to every detail given about a particular drink. It's also important to keep any personal issues away from the work space. The hardest part of my job probably was adjusting to the shift hours. What I've enjoyed most about my job is meeting new people and letting the customers have such a welcoming experience that they return in the future.
good,"As a grocery clerk, I had a number of different job titles and responsibilities where I sought to provide great customer service."
good,Corporate has a good idea of what happens in their store. Loss prevention is way too push y with its employees. I learned how to deal with customers on a daily basis.
good,I would come into work a few hours each day! I learned to deal with different personalities! Some management were nice! My co workers were not nice. The hardest part of the Job is standing long hours.
good,"Great place to as a start coming into the workforce."
good,"Enjoyed interacting with customers. Learned time management. Ran cash registers, kept stock full, took inventory. Good camaraderie between lower level employees."
good,A typical day at work is helping people with what they need and giving them the best customer service possible I love the smile I see on there face especially the elders that shop there.
good,"Working at Kroger was not much different than one would expect working in a grocery store would be, but it was still fun and functional. Management was extremely friendly and the only time I've ever considered myself friends with my superiors. We all got along swimmingly and this made for a safe and easy-going environment from start to finish of any shift. "
good,"Dillons was a good place to work, but did not pay their associates very good.  For the same position at a competitor, the wage was at least one dollar more per hour."
good,I have been with Food4less for over 3yrs now. I started at the bottom and worked my way for Utility Clerk to Cashier onto Department lead. In those three short years I have gained the knowledge to effectively utilize my potential. Management has daily and weekly goals that are required to be meet by company demands.
good,"typical work day was slicing meat, cleaning, recording.  Simple and easy, customers were nice at times.  manager was ok to work with.  seem under staffed at times."
good,If you want a job that is stable and pays a bit above the average pay for your experience then this is the place for you.  The management style is hit or miss but over all it isn't terrible.  They are in the process of revamping their management team and style so I can see great potential here someday.  They love to give back to the community and it is admirable how they are trying to expand and offer more jobs to the local market.
good,"Showed up work on time after school. Bagged groceries, pushed carts in off the lot, help restock shelf, cleaned bathrooms, and break room area."
good,"delegate work assignments, implement bench marks to ensure productivity is met, problem solve, and daily store operations."
good,"If this is your first job, or you just need extra money coming in, you should be fine. But do not make the mistake of staying for too long or thinking there is a bright future here. The company pushes it's hardest workers right out the door by treating them so poorly, and expecting them to pick up all the slack. The pay is not good at all, unless you can work your way up to department head or higher. Even then, you have to ask yourself if it's worth all the added stress."
good,The people you work with are good people.  Hard balancing between work and life outside of work.  Hours can be longer than expected with more stress.  As Store Managers you do get nice bonuses which takes the pain out of the long hours.
good,yes it was fun but the managers would work you to death. worked all the weekends never really had time off. managers was cool and we all had good time.
good,"A team-oriented job with flexible hours, and management that is prepared to teach. Friendly coworkers with eager attitudes."
good,"Prepared and displayed deli-bakery products."
good,"When I moved from CA to TX I applied at Kroger's and was"
good,It is not a good place to work. Very bad customers that always find any and everything to be upset about. Management is not the best and could be improve.
good,"If you want to find a job where you can start out at the bottom but work your way up over a period of time, Kroger is a good option. The raises and benefits are minimal but it is a Union job so it's also protected. I enjoyed working here but was looking for an environment where I could grow more quickly within the company instead of in very small increments."
good,"would usually work a 6-7 hour day by resetting displays throughout the stores"
good,high volume work in a fast paced environment with constant traffic flow customer service as well as reviews and changing of policies and procedures
good,It was hard working and going to school.  but i learn alot from working their. I had real cool  co-workers I'm looking foward to my  graduation and start working on the field that i have been practicing.
good,love the job just want a full time position. The most enjoyable part of my day is helping customers with their order. I learned how the order of the deli department.
good,"would order bread and then stock onto the shelves. I would also work as a cashier, I would help take over the frozen department and Dairy department whenever they leads of those departments would go on vacation."
good,I feel as though Kroger was a stepping stone for me to get started in my working career. I see it was a great place to get you started since they love to cross-train their employees.
good,"Our store opens at 8:00 am.  We show up at 6:00 am and open up the office and finalize the previous day's business.  We then have a crew to ensure that the store is being properly stocked throughout the day.  I will do markdowns to help eliminate shrink and maximize profit.  Throughout the day I am handling all of the managerial, accounting, and HR issues.  Along with those duties, I am also running the freight to the shelves along with my associates.  We only have around 12 employees per store.  Every associate has to be productive, especially the management.  We have multiple trucks come a day, and we have to stock them in a timely manner, complete accurate orders that meet the customer demand, and keep our payroll within our budget at the same time.  It is a demanding and fast paced place to work."
good,Management is really sneaky. Say one thing and may do another. No matter what the customer is ALWAYS right motto is in effect.
good,It was an alright place to work. The only issue is the lack of communication between management and employees.I felt like I was able to do my job at a high proficiency.
good,"Received and disbursed money in establishments other than financial institutions. Used electronic scanners, cash registers, or related equipment. May process credit or debit card transactions and validate checks."
good,"Kroger was a nice, fun to place to work at when I first started right of high school in August 2009. I really enjoyed getting to work with so many different types of people. A typical day at work consisted of bagging groceries, cleaning the bathrooms every two or three hours, getting shopping carts out of the parking lot once every hour, and sweeping the store once every two hours. The management there was decent. Some managers were very nice and polite, while others were not so nice. There was one manager there, which is still there today, that I did not care for at all. He would never give me a pay raise, he would always try to talk me out of requesting a day off that I needed. When I asked about being promoted to cashier, he told me no because my motor skills were not fast enough to keep us the fast pace needed to be a good cashier."
good,"Kroger warehouse was a great way to support my family for many years, I enjoyed my time there. They have  a high turn over rate, and spending 5 years there, I can say it is hard to meet their standards"
good,A fast paced high volume work place where many customers would shop everyday. When it came to customers I learned that there are many ways to dealing with all kinds/types of customers in a workplace setting.
good,"normally pretty easy, its a lot of standing and dealing with people. very fast paced and sometimes difficult. dealing with people is not ideal but manageable. co workers are great and very fun. management is strict."
good,I have nothing negative to say. The company is gaining market share and continues to expand. The company attempts to make customers' happiness the main focus.
good,"Overall, good place to work and make new friends. This company strives to make things work and make things better. They provide good customer service and look to improve it every day of the week"
good,"Working at Kroger was fun for the most part. The managers put together lunches and things for us every few months which was nice, but the pay was not that great. Because I was a minor at the time of my employment, I could not get a raise and I could not advance to any other position until I was 18. During a typical day I would bag groceries, have cart duty a couple of times, have to clean the store, and have to stop to assist several customers. I learned how to work well with others especially under pressure. I enjoyed most of my coworkers and got along with the majority of them."
good,"I decorated cakes to order for 2 plus years,  I loved it !  I would unload pallets, I did take training courses to know how to work and run the pallet jacks."
good,"Decent Place, good benefits, ok hours, Wrong executives.  Too many initiatives from top level executives. Makes running a store nearly impossible."
good,"Re-stocking and pricing produce food and cleaning the work area. I've learned how to give great customer service and complete tasks in a timely fashion. The management wasn't that very good, I didn't work with any of the supervisors that often and treated the employees poorly whenever I did"
good,I learned responsibility from this particular work place because it was my first real job. The management was kind of rude and careless but a few did want to make sure everything was in order. The hardest part of this job was dealing with everyone's attitude.
good,"I was responsible for daily maintenance and repair issues of the store ; sweeping and mopping floors, prompt clean up of spills and other general housekeeping duties I liked what I did but I had really low hours every week"
good,"I enjoy working at Kroger, The customers are great most of them come in daily. I received a certificate from the home office for having highly satisfied customers. I have learned how the public can be a refreshing part of your day and there are times you have to just grit your teeth and smile. As for the management it needs a little help when you go through managers every 6 weeks. It goes back to the old saying too many chiefs and not enough Indians. I got along with everyone there it's some great personalities in one building with the exception on one or two in management. The most enjoyable part of that job was the customers."
good,"•	Perform prescribed, routine maintenance procedures on supermarket refrigeration systems and self-contained temperature controlled merchandisers"
good,Kroger's is a wonderful company to work for to expand and gain tons of knowledge as far as general customer service goes.
good,"Takes awhile before a management position can come up, so this is a great steeping stone for a better career. You must work hard and strive to seek out a steeping ladder to achieve a better position in the company"
good,I've learn to be efficient with data entry and billing rejections.  I love my co- workers we were all team players.  What I love most about this job is the customers.
good,"For a first job, Kroger was a great experience for me. It encouraged me to work hard and helped to transition me into the work force; however, while coworkers were extremely present to be around, there did not seem to be much motivation among my superiors, minus the managers. The managers seemed very determined to create a great work environment and often went out of their way to cooperate with their employees, but would transfer to different stores so often that it was difficult to maintain a healthy relationship with them. It is also extremely difficult to reach full time at this job. Most employees come and go, while employees who have worked there for almost 10 years are still struggling to reach full time. You also do not progress much from minimum wage."
good,"Learned how to place orders and manage a department. Management was softer on people who didn't want to be there."
good,"I loved working here, I enjoyed all the customers, I loved the employees. I did not like the system for the front end called que vision. I felt it added a lot of stress to all the cashiers and supervisors. I learned a variety of managment skills than what I had previous. The hardest part of the job would be our service one goal and trying to acheive it daily and weekly. Trying to get customers to take surveys. My favorite part was meeting all the new people and working with our customers to provide excellent service."
good,"Pan up product for the next work day to be baked off.  Fill in any gaps out on the floor with product.  Make cupcakes, cake squares, jimmy squares, peanut bars etc.  Enjoy my co-workers.  Hardest part of the job would be the lack of working hours.  The most enjoyable part of the job would be the people that I work with.  Looking for full time work."
good,"supervisors always seemed to be in a bad mood, never felt like i could ask them for help or anyhting. Customer service workers seems alwyas cheerful and helpful to the customers."
good,"Typical days we were understaffed but co-workers were awesome and job wasn't too difficult.  All I was responsible for was filling produce shelves and making sure damage product was thrown away.  Also, provided customer service for those in need."
good,"I Liked the most of the people I worked with my supervisor was fair and a really good guy and they pay well. Cycle counts daily, weekly, monthly, unloaded trucks"
good,Working as a Pharmacy technician is busy and productive with lots of customer interaction. I have learned over the years pleasing the customer is always first. The management and co-workers are always very pleasing to be around and we always made a good team. The hardest part of the job is definitely just maintaining the work environment. Making sure everything gets done in a timely manner (around the busiest times of the month). The most enjoyable part of the job is learning a new field of work with medications and the relationship building with the customers and co-workers.
good,I actually enjoyed working here. I made a lot of friends and I learned a lot about marketing and customer service. Over the years I performed many functions and I gained a broad knowledege of retail and the grocery industry.
good,It was a great experience meeting new faces and getting along well with my associates. The hardest part of the job was to be tangible and being able to adjust quickly.
good,The people are great and the company has decent benefits but my pay is not to par with my needs. The union is fine and the pay in is reasonable. I am unable to meet my needs with low pay and a 6 month period until my first raise of $.10/ hour.
good,This management team provided an acceptable working environment with sufficient on the job training. I enjoyed this job. I left this job to explore different job opportunities.
good,"When I worked at Kroger Personal Finace, it was a young company with lots of potential. Management was very support of initiatives."
good,"We only 15 min. for our lunch. We have 15 min .for our break.  Our lunch break is 3 hrs .after we start to work, but it my go anywhere from 3 hrs. to 4 or 5 hrs.  We get 15 min. for our break, but we usually don't get our break.  There is no where to get a drink of water, The people we work with are good natured.  Each one of us have to have a good sense of humor.  You learn how to work with management.  It's hard then it is coming close to tome to go home and you still have customers and slicers and cleaning has to be done.  They do not allow you to work over time.  You have to  figure out how to get it done.  Our time slots can be hard to work with.  It is good when we have slow business."
good,The thing I liked most was greeting customers and being able to pick up groceries if needed after my shift was over. Customers complained about groceries being outdated.
good,"Fry's was a great place to meet the people of Sierra Vista. Very fast paced and you are on your feet for the day."
good,"There were too many lazy workers and my employers relied on me too much, but wouldn't promote me to another department. I disliked working in the front end because I was to go to guy and everyone relied on me to help."
good,Not enough hours that they was trying to give.  It was and interesting place to work. It was not in my field of education for me to contiune to stay working for them.
good,"Refill prescriptions and edit customers insurance information"
good,good for a high school job. friendly employees. okay pay. gives you a good chance to work with the public. hardest part was hateful customers.
good,"I had never worked before this job, and it was a good first work experience. I learned how to deal with people better, and also how to do things you don't want to do with a smile."
good,"I sacked groceries, cleaned store, stored buggys, and unloaded the trucks that came in to deliver groceries. I was part time at the time, but I enjoyed the work and the people and bosses I worked with and for."
good,"no words to describe it. yes its a great place to work but one week you might have 40 hours and the next you're laid off. advancement is only something you haft to promote yourself, cause management is never gonna ask you, you haft to tell them that you're interested over and over till you get it. cause there not gonna hand it to ya."
good,It is a very fast paced job and there is not much time for rest but the days go by fast. We are frequently understaffed which makes us seem busier than we are but the people are wonderful and the customers make it worth it.
good,"A normal day of work consisted of pushing carts primarily, restocking shelves and custodian work as far as hourly sweeps and check-ups on the bathroom. I've really learned to manage my energy and adapt to performing the 3 task any time on day. my schedule was also rocky. my management did a great job rotating me and fellow associates from the same department in and out. but the hardest part about the job overall was having to close with a lack of tranportation work wasnt officially over till all items are restocked which can take up to 3 hours after."
good,"My duties at Kroger started off as pushing carts in from the lot and bagging groceries. Fortunately I was able to be trained for the cashier position in just a couple of weeks. I spent some time in the bakery and floral department as well. Occasionally, I would stock the shelves. The hardest part of this job was the physical labor. I enjoyed interacting with other people and my co-workers as well. The management was stern, yet usually available when a customer had an issue which is ultimately the most important thing."
good,"Go to work start putting meat in trays and wrapping meat for any customer or cut some meats."
good,Thankful for Kroger because they hired be at 15 years old. There is a lot of room for growth and advancement if you stick with it.
good,"The work environment was good. The employees and the management were friendly overall, I genuinely enjoyed my time working there."
good,loved working there had to leave do to housing lost ad moved away average day stock shelves and manual labor arrive at night clean and stock area assigned
good,Always willing to help with family issues. They were always willing to help me while my grandmother was sick and if I had to have time off for my kids.
good,"9 to 12 hour shifts. being fast seemed more important than customer service. Had to be very good at multitasking. call insurers, fax requests, answered telephone calls, attended customers was all in a days work."
good,Team friendly environment.  Completion of multiple tasks and interaction with clients to produce contracts and sales marketing strategy.
good,A typical work day includes filling all meds and customer interaction. I also handle multi phone lines and multi computer systems
good,"Management here when I was working wasn't the type of personnel to be there. None of them led by example, and if you didn't do you job to cover them; it was kind of like an instant punishment. If you like working for a weekly paycheck,not really getting the raises to better support your life and not allowed overtime to make up for the low paying paychecks; by all means this is the job for you."
good,a typical day at work involves stocking the produce and cleaning the department and working with varies fruits and vegetables and culling the bad fruit out and reducing
good,"I worked the registers and would sometimes run a break for an employee or run the self-checkout lanes. "
good,"Too many politics in store functions, very little regard for customer service, very little adherence to cleanliness or maintenance in most but not every department."
good,its an easy job. depending on what department you work in the job gets a little dirty but other than that its a good job to have while you're in high school or in college working part-time/full time.
good,"-Typical loading/ unloading pallets of Grocery"
good,A typical day at work goes pretty smooth with the exception of a couple angry or rude customers. The Kroger I work with tends to hire a lot of other employees my age so its pretty fun working with them and makes it easier to get along with the majority of them. the supervisors are sometimes a pain to deal with and sometimes unfair to certain people.
good,Kroger allowed me to learn the beginning of my customer service relations. It also allowed me to learn responsibility and develop a strong work ethic that I carried into adulthood.
good,"Developing people through customized training solutions that enable sellers and sales managers to engage in compelling customer dialogues and execute the right sales activities. Driving business through change, accountability, and business outcomes through sustained improvement of sales force performance and productivity."
good,"Over night stocker. Worked with great people. I unloaded trucks, downloaded pallets, sorted items to appropriate sections to be placed, and shelved items.  Maintained clean and safe work area.  Also pulled damaged and out-of-date items off of shelves.  Most enjoyable part was working at night with the Kroger staff."
good,the flexible schedule really helped with the different stages of my life and parenthood. Wonderfully job flexibility.
good,"My regular customers come in and give me acknowledgement of my accomplishments. I learned to be patient with the customers young or old. Despite the negativity people bring me, I still smile. Management gives me praise when I do something outstanding. My co-workers works with me in a professional manner. The hardest part of the job is making every customer happy, but I still do my best. The most enjoyable is socializing with all the customers."
good,"I worked here during college for extra money.  I liked my co-workers, but the job itself was boring to me and I wouldn't have good chances to advance."
good,I worked third shift and most of the work was fairly physical. I delivered skids to the correct aisle then put product to the proper station and display. I got along with everybody there but found the job rather repetitive and wanted something different.
good,"A typical day at work consisted training on procedures and monitoring the productivity of my crew. I learned how to problem solve during emergent situations and effectively supervise.  Management was reasonable in their expectations of both supervisor and crew members, approachable and friendly.  The hardest part of the job was supervising an inconsistent variety of people on a daily basis.  The most enjoyable part of the job was customer satisfaction."
good,I worked at Kroger while I was going to college and a while after that. They were flexible on the hours that I could work while I was going to school.
good,the company has nice benefits and a nice building to work in. The staff is friendly and willing to work with you. The bonus plan is nice as well
good,Nice work environment. Great customer service.Pay is alright
good,"I will never work at the Kroger in Athens, Ohio. It was the worst."
good,"As you can see my customer service and team player skills cover a large area as a grocery clerk. I have enjoyed a reputation as an efficient grocery clerk and have a knack for immediately establishing good relationships with customers and staff."
good,This is a good company to work for but the hours were not enough and the minimum wages made it hard to not look for other employment.
good,"Its a great places for a first job. I learned alot being here at Kroger. I've worked in the meat and seafood department, Cashier, overnight stocking. Working here at Kroger my co workers are very friendly and management is awesome. The hardest part of my job is nothing I Enjoy coming to work everyday. Just need better pay."
good,It is the only job that I have not been able to be proud of when I went to work.
good,"A typical day at work would be some what busy."
good,"Kroger is quite a productive job, yet the hourly pay does not match labor being conducted. Many skills have been learned during the time period of employment which include patience, communication skills, and how to work with a team. Co-workers are fun to be around which provides for a easier working day. Although there is no true hardest part of this particular work day, the most enjoyable would have to be working with fellow co-workers."
good,"It is a friendly place, but they just don't pay enough. Did love my managers, but they cut hours and pay was only 7.40 and I can live off of that."
good,Pick N Save is a fast pace job. You were hardly task-less. My co-workers were nice and I didn't have any problems with them.
good,"I enjoy my job, but many of my coworkers don't enjoy theirs.  Management lacks standards when it comes to store cleanliness and being involved.  Pay is below average."
good,"Kroger was one of my first jobs, here I got the chance to start off as a cashier working the registers and using my great customer service skills. I soon after was up trained to work the customer service desk where i handed out cash drawers to employees, maintained the front end, and processed money orders and helped keep front end inventory."
good,It was a job while i was in college and for a college kid it is not bad place to be.
good,"When I started working at Kroger in 2010, I was a courtesy clerk, so my typical day consisted of: bagging groceries, bring shopping carts in off of the parking lot, making sure the bathrooms were clean, and taking the trash out at the end of the night. In 2011, I transferred to the produce department and I have been working there since. Originally when I transferred they moved me around to other departments as they needed me. I have some experience working in most of the departments. A typical day working in produce is to make sure the product is conditioned and full, do the daily markdowns of close dated products, and take out the trash at the end of the night. The hardest part of the job, I would have to say, is whenever you are trying to work in another department and the front-end gets busy they call you up to help them. It makes it very difficult to get your work done. I would say that the most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers."
good,I love working with the public and my coworkers. This company is a great place to work for.
good,"I'd go to work at 4AM to 12:30 with a half hr lunch, 2 15 min breaks.  I worked 38 hrs a week (part time).  I'd put up my order, check sales tags in my area, order products where needed in my area.  Hardest part of the job was the heavy tots with your product inside.  Wear and tear on shoulders and back.  The most enjoyable part were the friends I worked with."
good,my day here at kroger is one of the fast workplace I ever worked. Meaning a typical night for me is be able to be on time and ready to begin work at my stations. Involves in working on grocery pallets of 2 to 6 every night. To be able to finish the pallets must be able to work fast and precise which involves making the right decision.
good,I like the customers and my co-workers at the Fuel Center.  The Fuel Center Lead Person is very good at her job but the Store Management is poor.  The Customer Service Personnel like the High School Drama and are not very friendly.  The Customer Service Personnel has poor experience and are lazy.
good,"I set up the department, prepared the produce, unloaded trucks and ordered produce."
good,Lots of shopping discounts and customer oriented. Always going out of their way to meet customer's needs.

good,Good place for high school and college students and so-so benefit.
good,"I really felt like family working for this company, we had a really nice time although we were working. I just wish they were able to give more hours."
good,It was the busiest store I have ever worked for. My co-workers were all really nice. The hardest part of the job was keeping up the speed. We were tested on our ringing speed. They were very busy all the time. I learned they are the #1 store in Michigan!
good,"worked for almost all departments in the company at several locations, union job, the pharmacy is different union so its like night and day.... love my co workers"
good,"On an average day, I come to work, start cleaning, and don't stop until the cooks are done dirtying stuff up."
good,Management team struggled to motivate employees.  Employees not paid enough for work demanded.  It started out amazing and in the past year has dramatically declined.
good,"It has almost been a decade since I worked for Kroger. During my time with Kroger I worked mostly evenings/nights and would be there from 1-2pm until 11pm-midnight. The senior managers hardly worked nights so that left the other managers to do so. Doing this 5-6 days a week for 60+ hours was the reason I thought the work/life balance was one of the worst I've experienced since I've been working. There seemed to be solid job security and with the right attitude, hard work and breaks ample opportunity for advancement to upper management. Culture in Kroger stores were a bit depressing, there seemed to be a lot of negative attitudes amongst the older non management staff and careless attitude amongst the younger workers. Kroger corporate are not forward thinkers, they did not see the old grocery store model was failing and did not fair well when new stores were opening such as Whole Foods, Trader joes for the higher end customers and getting beat by Wal-Mart for the cost conscience customers. On top of all that the unions make it difficult to get anything constructive done and non management tend to take advantage of the purpose of the union."
good,"Performed basic pharmacy tech work such as data input, insurance application, monetary transactions Most enjoyable part of the job was learning all the medications and applications for them."

good,"*I would start my day by scanning prices and correcting signage. "
good,"A typical day included greeting each one of my coworkers and going straight to work. A fast paced retail environment which was challenging and rewarding. I learned how to increase my productivity and provide overall customer satisfaction to the best of my ability. The hardest part of my job, was being released during my probationary period, and not having the opportunity to advance my skills. My coworkers were professional and polite. The most enjoyable part of my job, was being indoors, working in a professional environment, and transactions! I loved the productivity challenge."
good,"Provide exceptional customer service in a safe and clean environment to ensure the customer's return visit. We accomplish this in many ways including, butnot limited to; treating our customers/employees in a fair and ethical manner, promoting an inclusive work environment, being a responsible member of thecommunity, providing the right products at the right time with fair and accurate pricing.

good,"Cashier, responsible for u-scan. Direct contact with customers, and responsible for returining items to designated area."
good,Staff was friendly but I felt self pressured to be fast at my work.  I learned nothing really except customer service.
good,"I have come across problems with Kroger. It was great in the beginning, then people began to get fired for simple mistakes. It's like they care more about their well beings than their employee's in general."
good,"nice people but very hectic and unorganized alot, you have some people that want to tell others what to do but not do what needs to be done."
good,I help customer find things in the store. The co workers were fun to work with.
good,"When I started, it was great. We had a great manager that cared about her employees. A couple of months later, she stepped down, and the replacement was probably the worst in the company. Turnover skyrocketed, those that didn't quit were fired for bs reasons."
good,"Cash handling was very easy because I had prior experience. Learning all the codes to the fruits and vegetables, learning about coupons, and just other things were the hardest part about being a cashier. I loved meeting all the people and just being able to excel in my job. I loved fast and after a while it became very simple for me."
good,Expect way too much and don't compensate in the pay for what you do. I was a manager and only making 8.95
good,"Would rather not right a review for this company"
good,Friendly customer and co workers most times. I have learned to understand customers expectations.with the public. Management involvement informative. Hardest part not able to assist customers immediately. Enjoy seeing a  customer smile and able to relate to me.
good,Help customers get checked out in a timely fashion. Help any customers who need help throughout the store. Make sure my register always have the correct amount.
good,I was a pleasant experience working with the company. I learned a lot working with them.
good,"depends on my working hours, early morning is the most important thing to open and set up services case for the customers and fill the shelves with products during my entire working time. Then I should make a order to order products which are missing or which has a bit of a sell out quickly. During my work experience I learned a lot working with customers and solve problems. Senior managers are correct and are helping in the shop. My work colleagues are very entertaining and good workers because we all work as a well-coordinated team. The most difficult part of the job is to work in the freezer or go to the freezer to pick up  products what  missing in the department. the most enjoyable part is work with customers."
good,"At Pick N Save I learned a lot of life skills in the workplace to be the most productive employee and use my skills to the best of my abilities. The management always pushed me to be the best i could and treat customers with the utmost respect. It was an enjoyable job for the most part just not with the most opportunities to improve my career. I had moved my way up in the company starting out as a utility clerk to a cashier and then eventually making my way to a stocker/dairy clerk. A typical day at work consisted of maintaining a clean and organized workplace to making sure all products were put out, faced, displays were made and all products inventoried. Also customer service was our main priority. Always got along with my co-workers and they were all great people with different personalities."
good,customer service. Nice people. Had intentions tobe csr but didnt get the oppurtunity
good,Greeting customer with a warm smile taking time to listen to there needs and how there day was going so far.
good,This job was an experience. They need to hire new managers for this particular store. They have the tendency to give false information to employees which in the end causes issues for the store.
good,"Fast paced environment, I have learned customer service skills with my coworkers who are great. The hardest part is standing on your feet for the day. What I enjoyed most is the customers that come in every day that have become a great part of the day when they come & joke or talk or just smile"
good,enjoyed working with people and customers on the sales floor.didn't like having to follow up behind supervisor and not being acknowledged.
good,"help customers, work on cash register, stock goods such as food. learned how to stock, buff floors etc"

good,A typical day at work would be to walk into the store and say goodmorning to everyone I came across and go to my station and start working
good,Always something going on to upset someone.  I enjoy most of my co-workers and customers.  I have learned that patience is very important.  I enjoy leaving at the end of the day.
good,"Days at work were good. Sometimes they were hard having to  deal with pushing carts for the kroger company. The management was great everyone was on the same page to serve the customer. some co-workers and I were really close I still communicate with them. I learned alot from being with this company,such as great customer service, and being orderly and on time."
good,"Kroger's is a nice grocery store to shop, but when working in the deli there is so much drama. Everyone gossips and customers can be difficult. Some of the managers were really good and worked really hard, but some just kind of stood around and talked or disappeared in the back when it became busy. Some people acted like managers when they weren't and that became very confusing. I was on closing shift a lot and if day shift people didn't clean their stations before they left, I would have to stay much later to clean up after them. This happened often, and often, I would be closing the bakery and deli by myself due to scheduling errors. I was only working part time, but even that was too much to handle with my overloaded class schedule. One time, I was reprimanded and made to scrub walls under the sink(something no one had done for a very long time) when I was doing some homework during down time; I would understand more if there weren't five other co-workers just standing in the back gossiping the whole time and didn't have one word said to them. Some of the people were really nice and helpful though, and everyone seemed to like. Even the big department manager came and shook my hand when I quit, complimenting the work I had done while I was there, something my supervisor who had been there for 10 years said she had never seen him do. So I was at least recognized for all the hard work I put in, which felt good."
good,"I worked at Fred Meyer for a short period of time. I didn't learn a lot in that brief period, except what it was like to have a paying job."
good,"stock shelves, bag groceries, do back stock, deal with customer questions, deliver groceries"
good,"• Responsible for keeping a record of how much money is in the register when the store open"
good,"Fast paced work, great customers and great first job. I enjoy the work that I performed there."
good,"Pharmacy environment is very busy and you must be able to multi-task,  I learned many things but the most important was how we could help the geriatric community be better educated on their medications.  My co-workers were pleasant.  Management was great until it changed and the new managers had several personality conflicts.  Made the environment uncomfortable and sometimes hostile.  Hardest part was when a customer passed away but the best part was seeing the customers walk away with a smile."
good,"Being around people and customers is great if you are a people person, nothing to strenous, you do whatever job duties is designated to you based upon what department you work in."
good,"happy and clean place to work"
good,"I punch in and it's go time! start with checking department greeting employees, do my orders, face department and start setting up for the day.Each store has a unique clientele which you need to cater toward.I have a great Store Director who is all hands in, has no problem helping and gives a lot of positive feedback.You always have strong employees and the employees that you need to spend extra time with to fine tune.My department is my ""baby"" I wish there was more hours in a day to give it the proper attention it deserves.I enjoy interacting with the customers and my crew."
good,"Understaffing by company of employees"
good,they are great with working around your schedule. people are always very friendly.
good,"Working at Kroger's was okay starting off. You would meet the people that you would working with mostly and some of the staff members was cool, but it's always that one employee that thinks that they know any and everything there is and who would demand more out of other people. I was lucky enough to have that exact person working in my department and since I was the new guy working there he focused his attention on me. That really made my time at work difficult to understand. I can't say that he was the only reason why I didn't like it there because I kinda did just could have been better than what it was, but that's any other job."
good,"A typical work day for me at Kroger's would involve me making a list of all the items that needed to be restocked and then stocking those items.  I would also make sure that all the items were clean and presentable, and if not I would clean them and make them presentable.  I learned many things at Kroger, mainly I learned how to focus on the most important and urgent tasks that need to be done instead of trying to do everything at once.  The hardest thing would be making sure that everything stayed stocked, at the Kroger I worked at it was a much busier and fast pace store than most so keeping up with stock could be very difficult at times.  The most enjoyable part was my co-workers.  I met a lot of really good people there and I had a lot of fun with them."
good,Great job for college students. A typical day at Kroger is to stock the shelves and help the customers.
good,"Receive all incoming non food items from vendors, process all returnable goods for credit, process all damaged and non salable items for destruction, keep back room in a clean and workable condition, load and unload incoming non food trucks by forklift and/or pallet jack as well as confirming the manifestos for said product.  While non of the above duties are bad in any way the implementation of said duties is sometimes at odds with how your store manager wants things done vs how your section manager and the rest of the crew implement things leading to untenable results in some cases.  I would also note that the ceiling for said position is quite low considering how much monetary responsibility is involved and how much you could lose for the company if not diligent."
good,The overall salary didn't fit well with the other Starbucks employees at the main stores.
good,Came in did my job and went home. This job really allowed to be to yourself  nothing more nothing further
good,"Great customer service, but very poor management. Very little care for the employees, low standard of quality."
good,"work the cash register. or work the bakery."
good,I did not like working holidays and weekends. I met a lot of people and learned many different jobs.
good,Enjoy working with my co-workers. Hardest part of the job is being on my feet all day and being under staffed.
good,"During my 8 hour shifts, I was either on the cash register or in the deli. In the deli, I learned how to make different kinds of sandwiches as well as chicken salad. On the register, I provided quick customer service while being social with the customers. The most enjoyable part of my work day was having shifts with fun people."
good,"Great place to go to work when you're young and in high school. A lot of the employees were around 16-18. Typical day would be bagging groceries while talking and laughing, and when the store was empty, running around and having fun."
good,"Its ok overall, management is great. Learned a lot in a short amount of time."
good,"I have only worked here at Kroger for almost a year. I love coming into work and being able to help the customers. Customer service is the first thing any new employee learns. I've worked in a couple other places that customer service was the first thing that was important. Make the customer happy, and they will tell everyone. Our store score, is based on how well we did our job for the customer. If they had a bad experience, then they tell us in a customer survey, then we get a score. I have a lot of friends as co-works. We all do our best to help each other and the customers. What I love about my job, is that it keeps me from my mom who sometimes takes me with her. She works for a general contractor, and that is some hard work."
good,Able to get job done in provided time and have fun while doing it.
good,"Good company, union based. Not much room for advancement. Vewry friendly."
good,"people I work with where nice, if you where behind and someone already got there stuff done then they would help you out, it was a really nice place."
good,"Good job that teaches customer service and money management.  There is room for advancement or the opportunity to work in various departments such as; produce department, dairy, deli, or general merchandising.  A typical day could begin by working on a cash register, helping a customer check out the items that they have selected for purchase.  The hardest part of the job maybe encountering difficult customers or standing on you feet for 8 hours or more.  The most enjoyable part of the job is assisting customers in finding the things that they need or solving a problem that they may have."
good,"Daily focus was on positive customer interactions. Ensuring each customer felt appreciated, garnering repeat business. Designed colorful and fresh fruit, vegetable, and deli trays."
good,work very hard in the deli.  really enjoy working with my co-workers  get along with everyone .
good,Different managers almost every six months. Slow coworkers.
good,"Workers DEFINITELY DESERVE pay beyond minimum wage.  Enjoyed seeing clients on daily basis, fast-paced environment"
good,"The more challenging part of working in Ralphs was having to learn and do a myriad of tasks within a brief time span. As my first part-time job, it was frustrating but I pushed through with no complaining. Being a rookie, my bosses understood how overwhelming it was and cut some slack for a time. It wasn't doing the work that was a problem but juggling to perform and complete the tasks in a short time and not make mistakes was a nuisance. But, from this I learned to be more active than anticipated."
good,"Order products for stores and managed the off loads of stock and to fill store shelf's with a 12 man crew."
good,Productive and fast paced work place. Good customer service. Great team dynamic with staff.
good,"Would get food ready for my shift, I learned how to make bread and how to prep the veggies that went on the sandwiches. The management would help with what they could and the co-workers were easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was getting off at like four in the morning."
good,A typical day at work involved working the truck to the shelf. I learned how to work with many different types of people. The management was more focused on themselves than the customers and employees. My co-workers were some of the best people I have met. The hardest part of the job was the inconsistent work hours.
good,I liked working there when I was in high school. I enjoyed getting paid every week.
good,made new friends and developed great relationships i learned how to stock liquor and securely place liquor caps on all merchandise.
good,"do not plan on growth. once you are in, you are in but can not go anywhere. district management only cares about their careers, not yours."
good,Decent job while in high school did basic stuff and did what the managers asked and managed well.
good,I enjoyed most of the people that I worked with. Most everyone in the deli to cashiering were very nice & helpful.
good,I am thankful for opportunity to work for the company.Provided me with opportunity to meet and interact with a large cross section of the community.
good,"For my job in particular, I worked nights stocking the store. It was very physical labor that often led to many nights of overtime as we tended to be short-handed. Management at my store was not good at communicating with our crew, and often failed to understand why we pulled overtime, despite adding more responsibilities for our crew. My coworkers were an eclectic group, mostly people trying to get by and make a living. It also seems the only way to advance was to be a suck up to management, hard workers that were more capable did not get jobs over those that were manager's pets."
good,people is stuck up the hours are not good other empoyees dont do their job so your job is even harder
good,Constant weekly hour change.  never know how many hours a week you will work could be from 12 to 40 never over 40 they do not like overtime.
good,At Kroger employees are put through numerous hours of training no matter the position.
good,Fun place to work. Would be great if management showed more concern about associates and not store goals.
good,I fill milk work grocery backstock work dairy backstock.i have learned produce i have also work in the meat department
good,"I needed gas money and this helped pay it. I loved helping customers and associating with people. This job did not pay much and it was a lot of work, but it helped me really appreciate the opportunities I've had and the job I have today."
good,Not a bad company to work for. Depends on what department you work in
good,productive with customers and their needs. tries to meet needs of other but very low pay
good,Computer training is extensive and boring. Co-workers are generally nice.
good,"A typical day at work would include running cash registers and self checkout robots, bagging groceries, helping customers and cleaning registers. I learned much about customer service and grocery stores, management was very helpful and professional. My co-workers were friendly and courteous. The hardest part of the job was staying in one place for long amounts of time, though this wasn't unbearable it was somewhat boring. The most enjoyable part was the people, my co-workers."
good,I just needed a job to start off life and Kroger was fine. Pay isnt perfect but it gets you by.
good,"cut meat to order,make food for lunch plates. Bake alot of different breads."
good,"Being at Kroger was a great experience. Everyday was something new and different, from the people who came through your line. Some faces began to stick and became friendly regulars. I enjoyed seeing them all the time. Management was composed of several people with very different personalities, but it worked. I never had any ill thoughts or was displeased with any of them. They did their job to the best of their abilities and they should be awarded for it. My coworkers were all different, you could always talk to someone and their would be laughs and it was even better when a customer joined in. The hardest thing was having to say goodbye to Kroger."
good,Reviewed cash reports and analyzed sales inventory. Ongoing quality improvement analysis with emphasis on cashier error and customer service. Enjoyed the atmosphere the most as this was a family business.  This was the first business where I managed and learned the foundation of all primary elements of successful business.
good,A typical day at my job is busy and motivational. My supervisors ensures that we are doing the very best that we can. We have a strong team and pull together to get things done the best we can.
good,"Everything is mostly machinery, we make sure to restock all medications and make sure the right drugs are placed in the right bags, we would then file them to the appropriate store to deliver to."
good,I enjoyed working with a team of people that helped each other and encouraged each other to do the best possible.
good,Cool side job not too much room for advancement. The best part is its a one stop shop so you got everything you need on break
good,Overall this was a great place to work inspite of the low pay. I gained alot of skill there and alot of knowledge. I learned how to work with different kind of people as well and multi task. I also gained a great amont of customer service skill there as well
good,Love the work and the co-workers. Fry;s is a union based company and if you're a new hire plan on starting from the bottom and working your way up.
good,"well it was a clean store. Kroger had amazing customer service, I always loved the fact that our duty was to always help the customer no matter where we were in the store. Team work was a big deal, it showed associates that we should never focus on one department but All departments. working there I learned that respect gets you places, it makes the customers want to keep coming back. management there was ok, there was 3 managers there allot of times those three wouldn't communicate so things would go wrong, but overall they were hard working individuals. I loved my co workers!  each one worked hard and made working for the company a loving environment. The hardest part of this job, I worked in a floral department with only me and another lady. working floral requires urgent car, and sometimes when the schedules weren't made to meet the department needs, some things couldn't get done, but no matter what I made it work. The most enjoyable part about this job was the customers, they were like family to me and always relied on me, I loved working with beautiful flowers, and my associates were like my best friends."
good,"I work hard so I have been successful at Kroger. It is hard missing so much working weekends and holidays, but such is retail. There are a lot of opportunities for advancement."

good,"A bunch of lifting and bending, it was a hard job but the best job I ever had. I loved the co-workers they were the nicest people in the world."
good,"A typical day at work focuses around preparing baked goods like bread, muffins, and more. I've learned many store functions including the Front End - working as a cashier, Produce - Stocking fruit and vegetables and assisting customers find goods they needed, And Maintenance - Cleaning of the cafeteria, tables and floors, and filling utensils. Management at Mariano's is competent and reasonable. The Workers of Mariano's are friendly and always willing to help when they can. Hours are short and hard to make a living. I enjoy working with the people that surround me in my environment and make me feel comfortable."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job was assisting with customer service. Maintaining the safety and security of the employees and merchandise.
good,"Everything could be better."
good,"I liked burger king it was a good place to work , I learned how to cook on different types of grills."
good,managers moved  around a lot some of them are bullies and others are afraid to say anything

good,I learned so much working there. It is a great place to work. I loved my co-workers and management.
good,"The coworkers are fair, along with management. I provide excellent customer service to cheese lovers who surround the shop and give taste test for potential buyers.The hardest part of my job was not being there to assist customers and my most enjoyable is selling cheese of course. Ive learned all different types of cheeses and what they contain."
good,I learned a lot about the medical field at this job.  Met a lot of interesting people co workers and customers. Customers can be very rude when it comes to their meds but overall it was a good job but not enough pay.
good,Ok job for young in high school or job to work while in college.
good,I enjoyed working in the bakery and learning how to decorate the cakes and the cupcakes. I enjoyed getting to taste the cookies after we baked them. The deli was fun too. It was hard work but the people I worked with made it fun.
good,"In a typical day of work we would talk with employees of Kroger stores and work with them to get the information we need to find their missing merchandise or help them get credit for their missing product, and as such we would talk to interesting people and help them learn along the way. The hardest part of my job was around the holiday when it became kind of stressful and there was always a lot going on at any one time but it made the job just a bit more interesting. My co-workers were delightful; the very best part of the job."
good,Assisting customers with jewelry sales or repairs. Receiving stock and setting up displays. Hosting parties for sales events. Making displays attractive and presentable. Having theme events and decorating for various events.
good,"Bagged Merchandise "
good,"stacked carts, bagged grocries, swept floors, restocked returns"
good,kind of young witch I like but with a constant looming despair
good,Not as many chances to move up in the company like others. Only a good job for high school students.
good,"I feel that they could have done better managing schedules. I mean, its great if your past the inital set up. but before that. they dont even try to get it right"
good,"It's a good place to work if you're just looking for something on the side or during the summer. When management is organized then it can be smooth. However, if they are not-and many times they aren't-then be prepared to have a long and boring shift."
good,"Always busy which I like. You have to have patience working in retail. The mangers will listen to the situation, and will do what is fair. I like working with my co-workers they can make your day do by much smoother. The hardest part is dealing with rude customers. When a customers compliments you for service."
good,"When arriving for shift, I had to set up displays, prepare the department for daily customers, report to managers and assist them with any duties they may have. At my time at Kroger I learned how to use RF Gun to order any product for the store, becoming the best at customer service in helping them find what they needed and make their experience enjoyable, become more of a leader in my department and help educate new employees with any problems. My co-workers were always willing to help out and assist me when needed. The hardest part of my job, at Kroger, was assisting multiple mangers in different departments and learn how to manage my time and duties to get done in a timely manner. I enjoyed my job at Kroger because I got to interact with customers and my co-workers were very respectful of others."
good,A day at work was pushing carts help cashiers clear the line of groceries an bagging carefully. i learned that you have to adapt an gain as much knowdlge as possible. managment was a bit much but its in their job discription.coworkers were co-workers we worked an went home.the hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers an employees but i learned you have to be mature an adult when the oppers are doing the oppisite. the most enjoyable part of the job was being young working for a place everyone love to shop.
good,"No respect for employees, does not give breaks on time or at all, has very limited labor budgets, broken equipment and unsafe work environment."
good,"It was a very fun and a very creative position,  enjoy the customer base, and the work that I do. However they have a policy to become full time, you must work 32 or more hours for 16 weeks consecutively, I have been there for two years. and I have been dismissed of FT status by one week, after being told they would allow the 16 weeks to go through. Unless you were hired prior to the latest Union contract, they don't really care much for you on compensation or benefit level, there are very little promotions, and growth room. Overall though Kroger isn't a bad company just don't expect high pay. They have employee discounts to many places including zoos, water parks, etc. and are very caring towards families."
good,Organizing inventory.  Ordering merchandise.  Dealing with negative co-workers was the hardest part of the job.  Most enjoyable part of the job was interaction with customers.
good,Kroger's will give most people a chance. Fair work hours and fair Boss's.
good,"A typical work day for me consist of generally a mild open with a fast pick in afternoon, and always a busy Friday. I learn to keep cool under pressure and to ensure that the customer standing before is satisfied with service. I feel that there isn't a most enjoyable part of my job all is enjoyable."
good,Poor managmenet skills. Management did not seem to care about their empolyees concerns. Did not make the work place helpful.
good,"A typical day at work involves stocking shelves, managing deliveries, helping customers, and tending to odd jobs around the store. I've learned how to work efficiently and manage my time correctly to accomplish what I need to in a given shift. I've also learned how to work well with others and communicate with people in an open and helpful manner.  Management tends to be a little sloppy due to lack of communication among the different managers, but the store still runs competently and most things are accomplished without any significant drawbacks.  My co-workers are a mix of people my age and older individuals, which gives me a great chance to work with people from many different backgrounds and generations.  The hardest part of my job is keeping up with stocking shelves on a busy day when product is moving fast, especially when we are understaffed or the delivery truck is late.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the freedom and flexibility I am given to accomplish everything I need to in whatever way I see fit, with only a reasonable amount of oversight from management."
good,While working at Kroger I've learned the importance of teamwork and the use of effective communication to complete the task at hand.
good,handled shopping carts and hand baskets for this employer.
good,Good for students looking for a temporary job. I just worked there to earn some money while going to school
good,A great job as a bagger allow me to first lean my people and hand skills. There was great management co-worker overall nice place to work.
good,"- unable to take breaks"
good,alot of people would have bad attitude and did not care about their jobs. alot of teenagers worked their so they alway had something to say and nothing to do.
good,"I run 3 departments including a Bistro (where my chefs create breakfast, lunch and dinner), a Cooking school, and a Catering Dept.  I oversee proper sanitation of food handling and ensure customers are being provided exceptional customer service."
good,love the job cause I was young and making my own money and it was close to my house loved the customers my co-workers and management
good,Do as im told happily this is a fast pace job. Work fast keep the cutomers happy keep it fun and always wear a smile.
good,This job was while I was pregnant. They were very helpful and understanding. The people you work with are great
good,sadly some people actually don't want to move up from such a lowly job and when someone does want to move up they shut you down. They are so concerned with efficiency and unions that a person who is too over weight to actually do the job properly can actually get in your way of making overtime. the unions are now working against people that actually want to work and make honest money but dishonest people keep messing the system up. As long as Kroger is OK with this already dysfunctional system then it will never be an actual job choice.
good,"While Kroger offers outstanding wages and benefits, their medical insurance is amazing, the work environment is about what you would expect from a large corporation. Employees not in management are usually viewed as expendable. Employees can attend a wide variety of functions where attendance is optional but most do not (only 20 out of 155 employees attend these functions)."
good,"A typical day at work was long and never ending being that i never had a cashier job."
good,As a cashier the days can get long and monotonous; therefore this job was only a temporary situation for me.
good,We rook proactive steps to maintain a safe and secure environment for customers and employees.Stopping shoplifters and prosecuting them in accordance with Kroger policy. We further reduced employee theft and prosecuting those guilty parties in accordance with Kroger policy. We ended each day by reviewing any video involved in a case in preparation for court.
good,"Stocking shelves, creating positive engagements.  Hard to deal with people in this industry as there are many levels of experience.  Once you gain more responsibility things do get better, unless the management in your store is cut throat."
good,I enjoyed being part of the team. The people were fun to work with.
good,Typical grocery store employees and management. Was my first job and a big learning experience.
good,I did not really like working there everyone seemes like no i alls and i did not see room for movng up in the store as anything
good,Worked for FredMeyer as a Meat cutter for several years. Employees that you work with are great. Some managers there have no business being managers. High turnover because manpower is lacking (hours) are not enough for the job they ask you to do. The longer you stay at this place the more work they pile on you. So basically I quit because of burnout.
good,Typical non education job. Need patience. Must have good customer service.
good,"Nice company to work for if it is a first job. Trains employees very basic skills including cash handling, register procedures, how to sell different products, etc."
good,the most enjoyable is the freedom of working by myself doing contract work for a large company
good,"A typical day at work would be getting to talk to new people and meet new people and see the every day shoppers and get to know them. I learned a great amount of respect for customers no matter if they're angry or upset. Always respect anyone no matter what. The management was good. I worked with people I didn't know there, but I got to know them and they were great employees. The hardest part of the job was going outside in the freezing cold and rain to retrieve the carts. The best part was getting to meet new people."
good,The pharmacy is busy. I learned a lot about medications and what they do. The hardest part of the job is probably being able to keep up with the work load in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of the job I would say is the people you get the chance to meet.
good,"Busy days"
good,"at kroger it was always fast paced and customer service was always a key point. my co-workers were very helpful. the hardest part was insurance. calling companies to get patients stuff in order and so on. however, the most enjoyable thing ive experienced is people. i loved working with people and helping to make them happy and feel better. ive learned so much from here."
good,"Fred Meyer Jewelers is owned by Kroger Co.  New jewelry store concept in Kroger Marketplace locations only.  This is a new territory to the jewelry division, and the company has very aggressive sales driven goals.  With little marketing support, the manager is responsible to driving sales with little support.  The job is demanding because of rigorous manager schedules during holidays and special events, and the demand to become involved with Kroger sponsored events.  If sales do not produce from efforts, manager is held liable and can face termination for lack of store sales."
good,customers are friendly but management wise not so much didn't have anything in control.
good,It was an okay place to work. management was always kind and courteous whenever there was a problem.
good,loved the deli associates didnt like the politics of the store
good,I was enjoying to work with Kroger for a year and learned some new experiences in different dept.
good,"I decorate cakes, take orders, work the deli, and stock shelves. I've learned a lot about cake decorating and customer service. The managers are friendly and willing to help. My co-workers are typical non-high school graduates working a minimum wage hourly job for their entire lives. The hardest part is getting everything done while still stocking and waiting on customers. The best part is that I enjoy working with the people I work with and I enjoy decorating the cakes."
good,"All Krogers are the same... it's high stress and most days aren't that fun. However, every store has a family and when you work in the pharmacy, you're separated from the store so family is important. Put on your running shoes... every day and remember, your shift is over eventually."
good,Brutal..Brutal...Co-workers and perks of shopping for food wit the discounts is the best..Management lacks..un-professional at best...Atmosphere is mixed..
good,it was nice working their i became attached to alot of my frequint customers that came through my line and the enviroment was gud their too
good,"There are many positives to working for Kroger:"
good,Not enough cooking and Dining for me. The atmosphere is great and the people are wonderful. I love my customers but the more involved I get the further away from food I become. i am a Chef at heart
good,"Kroger is a great company to work for, the only problem is the union rules tend to dictate too much. Who can work what hours, when, where, who gets advances, and who is paid how much is all based solely on union rules that reward seniority over ability."
good,"Place is fun & easy but as far as the pay and hours, not so great. Been working for Kroger for a little over 2 years and I'm not even making 8 dollars an hour."
good,The employees were great but when it came to management some were ok but others were horrible. -The pay was horrible for the work that you have to do.
good,"always doing other employees jobs, and managers that dont do anything till either a coordinator is coming"
good,I liked it there but there was not set schedule.  Most of the employees were nice you just had some who had been there way to long and did not like there jobs.
good,i dont remember much because it was so long a go but i remember i was always running from here to there doing everything
good,"I started out as an check out cashier and later promoted to supervisor. In the retail market it was challenging to deal with the customers, who were demanding. Learned a lot to deal with people management and communication skills."
good,"enjoyed working with customer and meeting people, also learned leadership as shift lead."
good,"I liked it overall, it was just way too much DRAMA!!! Hardest part of the job was pushing carts by MYSELF during the busiest times! My co-workers were friendly. Management is very horrible!"
good,I was a cashier and a grocery stocker. A good place to work at right out of high school in transition to the military.
good,"not a bad job, sometime can be dramatic."
good,"Everyone is always friendly, including supervisors and management."
good,got to interact with people. picked up great people skills. respect.
good,"Worked with many people from around the world, learned new aspects of the company. Hardest part was working around my family,  where my family had to work around my job."
good,"I learned how to deal with the public everyday. Also, I learned to be good with pressure when it comes to dealing with the public. My managers were really nice. The hardest part about Kroger was being a bagger. The baggers do a lot in the front end, bag, clean, and bring in the carts that are in the parking lot. I really enjoy working with the public."
good,"I've learn how to provide great customer service to all customers , also to improve kroger sales of merchandise."
good,"Bad Management, Good Co-workers, Hardest part-being in the freezer for extended period of time, most enjoyed part of work-clients."
good,This was very helpful in making me realize I need a college education because this is not a fun job at all
good,"I receive payment by cash, check, credit cards and vouchers. issue receipts , refunds, and change due to customers. Maintain and clean check out areas."
good,I had great experience to learn customer service techniques. Also being able to learn how to lead other cashiers. Big Store and marketing made it a big opportunity to work as a team among others. Really tested my skills. An opportunity I would never regret.
good,"a typical day at Fred Meyer, working with customers, I answer the phone to do item checks or just answering a customers question. I put out new freight. I am the section head of the ladies clothing which means is my job to make sure that the prices are correct on each item, make sure the sale prices are correct and that the department looks neat and clean. "
good,"I started out a cashier when I was 17 worked my way into the Drug GM Department and then worked on my own as the Nutrition Lead, overall i loved the people I worked with I learned so much everyday and looked forward to going to work. I enjoyed talking with the customers whom I got to know very well over the past 7 years and the team I worked with. Once I got in the routine and figured out what my duties were everyday the was always improvement."
good,I just bagged groceries and brought carts in from outside. Not much else to say.
good,"Cash out customer. Work in customer service, cash check. made money order, made out bank deposits, count drawer down. Got along with management and co-worker. the hardest paet was angry customers. Meeting customer,"
good,"A typical day was going in to work after school or during the weekend.  You either bagged groceries, did cashier, or stocked shelves.  Since I was working part time while I was in high school I learned responsibility and about taxes being taken out.  The management was ok but if you had a customer upset with they went with "" the customer is always right.""  I liked working with my co-workers.  The hardest part was working while my friends was out having fun.  The most enjoyable is I got a paycheck."
good,Worked hard. They had a union which benefited the employees greatly.
good,"no stress to take home at the end of the day, management treated us more as children than adults, co-workers were pleasant"
good,"It was a nice experience, but business was not at a fast pace like i was used to."
good,"Usually when I went into work, i wouldn't expect much. just an average day at work. but over the course of about a year at frys, ive become very unsatisfied with the company. My department refuses to hire anybody so i cannot climb the ladder and gain seniority. so even though ive been there for almost a year, i stilll get the left over hours nobody wants. They only may me 7.90 to do my hard work in the meat department. not nearly enough for how poorly im treated back there. cashiers make 8.00 and hour. My co-workers can either be great, or indifferent, it usually depends on what mood theyre in. management like to make me think they work with me even though im just basically used as the frys door mat. i do try to enjoy the little things though. like how the guys will make funny jokes and such."
good,"Open kiosk at 8am stock all items that have sold past closing of 8pm, check schedule for staff daily, supervise team of 7 personal, daily audit or material, provide great customer service, prepare beverage of choice, the most enjoyable part of my job was working with a great staff and assisting customers."
good,"Good hours , easy money. coworkers were horrible , managers were rude. customers were okay."
good,"This position was extremely time-consuming and unstable with regards to exactly how much time it required from one day or week to the next. There were days where a shift may last only eight hours due to business being slow and the store not requiring as much from its management staff, whereas others required a high level of supervision from leadership and one could find themselves mired in as much as a 16-hour shift. This was also considered a ""trap"" position, as there were no real, quantifiable metrics or goals one could strive for to constitute being promoted. Store performance generally was the determining factor in whether or not one was allowed to transition to another role, and there was both an ethnic & gender-centric trend in terms of what types of people were in certain roles."
good,Entry position for younger age group. Great first job for teenagers still in high school.
good,needs to be updated when this company once was the primary source for consumers needs
good,I was a Sales Associate at Fred Meyers.  I had some great PIC's that worked with me.
good,"My immediate supervisor was willing to work with my school schedule. The store is busy, with very little down time. It almost takes an act of god to get your break."
good,"A typical day at Kroger consists of cooking, cleaning and assisting customers.  The people who work for Kroger are all nice people and a pleasure to work with."
good,Easy to work and get along with customers and other employees. Was a supervisor so was able to supervise employees with ease. I learned how to do accounting and manage employees.
good,"Rang up grocery items, responsible for my money drawer. Maintained front-of-store cleanliness.  Assisted in other departments as needed such as bakery, meat, floral and dairy."
good,"I liked working there for the structure, but I would work long days and rarely get off on time. the typical day was long and stressful."
good,"Duties: Cashier, Customer service, inventory, Grocery"
good,"A typical day at work consist of handling customer returns/ refunds/exchanges, as well as, sending of Western Union Money Transfers, selling of Western Union Money Orders, selling/ redeeming of N.C. Lottery tickets, check cashing of Government/Payroll checks and Utility Payments"
good,"I applied for a job at Kroger when i say a sign on the door. It was for a very specific job which I have had 20 some years of expereince (on job sites and side jobs from home). It was very different environment because I was used to being just in a floral shop not in a grocery store. Sometimes the company would over send or under send product and that was a bit frustrating. My boss had been working there prolly as long as my experience and was well aware of how the probable sales would be, however corporate looked at it a little diffferently. After about 2 years, in such time they had already stared pulling people up front to the registers because they always needed help, I got moved to a casher after a surgery I had. I was actually awarded the cashier with the highest elms score in July of 2012. We were graded on our job performance by how fast, friendly, and proficent we were. I had to resign in 2013 based on Dr. limitaions at that time. The hardest part of eaither position was the weight load at times."
good,I learned that the customer should always be your main focus.
good,"I worked with customers. I worked as a team. I worked at the cash register, so I learned to work with money."
good,"I started working at Kroger when I was a junior in high school. What appealed to me most was how they worked around my schedule."
good,real good place it can be boring sometimes when no customers but when is busy your day will really go by fast.
good,I loved working there but did not care for the manager due to the fact that she was racist.
good,Pharmacy manager did not like any of her techs. There was opportunity for advancement and great training. You learn alot there. They don't pay very well.
good,Good place to work.  Hardest part of the job is the lack of systems.
good,"Typical day would be clocking in and deal with transactions, and customer service throughout day. Learned how to deal with even the most difficult customers. Management is good for the most part at trying to help run the shopping experience smoothly for the customers and employees. Co-workers are a good group to work with. Hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers at times. Most enjoyable part would be meeting and seeing new faces as well as having customers become regular customers in your line just to make small talk throughout the day."
good,I learned a great deal about real estate while working for Kroger. Overall Kroger management has changed a  great deal and it is not for the better.
good,This place sucks. It was terrible. I didn't really like the people that worked there. They thought they were better than everyone.
good,"first job ever and learned all about customer service. short hours, started trianing other incoming employees and friendly staff and managers."
good,"I work as a clerk, the daily routine is pretty much the same daily. Stocking, maintaining weekly ad, customer service through out the store in all departments."
good,"The management there is very unprofessional, they cannot seem to answer the customer's questions and help them to get the items that they need. The store manager just walks around with his nose up in the air and doesn't talk to any of his employees unless he is yelling at them or telling them what they have done wrong. The people who work there are always on their cell phones texting rather than trying to help customers. "
good,"good time with co workers, learned customer service, interact with various types of people, learned how to deal with different situations"
good,"I will first ask my boss if there is anything i can do for him, If not the I would bag and cashier. I learned how to work a register and great customer service skills. There are many great people working there and I am friends with them all. The hardest part about my job was moving up they say I'm necessary there but took forever to give me a promotion. my favorite part is interacting with my fellow employees an customers."
good,I loved this job! Fun work experience although the store manager is not a very friendly person!
good,A good starting job. They taught me how to be a cashier but the job also reminds you that this a not a job you want to do for the rest of your life. Your job was not secure and it easy to screwed over since your a cashier. But luckily I didn't have that problem and I'm sure it not very common where it will happen. But the first day of work they told me I was short 500 and some dollars short. Yet the register next to me was 700 and some dollars over.
good,The hardest part about my job is the variety of things you have to do at one time.
good,"good for high school workers, its only 4 hr shifts but at the same time it gives you responsibilities."
good,"This was my first job, so I learned a lot about what I could do. Got to meet and work with a great group of people. Though I complained about it sometimes, it actually was a great job."
good,"Good job, with a union and opportunity for advancement. I would recommend. "
good,I was a cashier for 2 years but I enjoyed it quite a bit. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the customers. I had customers come and look for me to get them at the register so that made me feel good. Shopping can be stressful so knowing that I could make it alittle more tolerable meant a lot to me. My co-workers were very lively and funny to work around including my managers. They always had smile waiting for you. The hardest part of the job was when I was pregnant and I would get sick off certain smells of product whether it was specific foods or cleaning supplies. It made being a cashier very challenging. Sadly my pregnancy was not going the way it needed to and it caused too many problems that I was had to be let go. I understood and still have very good memories of working there.
good,My experience at Kroger is very interesting as I have learned a lot about how businesses especially larger business are operated. My co-workers are helpful as management do try their best to run the store's operations smoothly. I learned how to talk to customers and how to develop my social skills in a work environment as I contact the customers as I bag their groceries. 
good,"Began as a cashier greeting the customer.  As a supervisor ensure front floor was not overcrowded by customers by keeping all registers evenly. Worked on a breaks chart for employees to ensure enough personal was available on the floor. Create a daily report on employee’s daily work and inspection on dress code for all employees. Worked with the maintenance crowd to keep store impeccable. In customer service assist all refunds, lottery, money orders, and western union. Also as a customer service representative for Kroger ensured all customers were being treated with quality service for their needs."
good,"Pretty normal first job, not really the greatest but not the worst"
good,"The company as a whole is not bad, but the communication within management and towards the employees needs a lot of work. "
good,"With any job dealing with the general public, especially when insurance is involved, it can get very stressful.  Often, the customers were rude.  The shifts seemed to be either long (9 hours) or very short (4 hours) and rarely hit in the regular time frame of a work shift.  It was also difficult because the particular Kroger I worked in employed a lot of college students as pharmacy technicians who seemed to have little interest in actually doing work while there."
good,This job was great but it was hard working with my managers they had a problem with my skin color.
good,Can help grow your customer abilities. Work all around the store talking to a lot of different managers and  people. Good place to grow. 
good,"work from 8:30am to 5:30pm"
good,"i would get to work clock in, greet customers and employees review books what needed to be done. i learned that when working with others no matter how much they set u off always maintain a good postive remark, i learned to work the cashier and their codes. my job wasnt hard i really enjoyed it especially when it came to helping others "
good,"A typical day at work was bagging groceries and interacting with customers. I learned that patience and kindness is the key to having good customer service, based off of my learning experiences with customers. My management was okay, however I believe they expected too much when our pay was not decent. My co-workers were all friendly, I actually ended up building relationships with some employees. The hardest part of the job was to deal with rude customers with obnoxious attitudes. The most enjoyable part was having a conversation with frequent customers."
good,Kroger has to improve on backing up their employees when the employees up hold the rules in a positive way. The company have a lot of drama  that shouldn't be. 
good,The people here are very friendly and willing to help you out when you have a problem. the hardest part of the job is the overtime shipping hours that you have to put in at the end of the night. the mos t enjoyable part of job is that they always have get togethers and we always have cake and food. The people who work here are very diverse and you get to learn about different parts of the world all while serving a purpose of getting prescriptions out to our customers
good,"I only worked 4hrs a day. The evening shift was fine, management was fine. The working conditions were good, but again, in todays enconomy there were those who thought that everyone was out to get their job. So they were not so pleasant to work with. People who dont feel secure in themselves, project that to others. Cleanin and dissasembling is always a pain, but that is why they call it work not play. I enjoyed serving the public and satisfying customers. Just wish it could have lasted longer."
good,"cut meat using knifes and saw blade on daily basis, stocked product on shelfs"
good,Great people to work with;great customers;bad management;terrible hours
good,"I helped check out customers, and keep my station clean. I also helped guests out to there car with there groceries."
good,They give regular raises and try to work with your schedule. You will mostly be working nights though. Its more of a job for a teenager then adult. Advancing far in company is unlikely.
good,"fill prescriptions, unable to count meds, clean working areas, ran register"
good,"I would go in around 9 p.m. and punched out at 6 a.m. Co-workers were great, we would race to see who could stock aisle the fastest, of which I had always known work could be fun. Night shift supervisor was a nice enough guy pretty easy going. My co-workers were a good crew helpful, to the extent we would car pool and such. The hardest part would have been the dog food aisle, due to after lugging 50lbs per bag of dog food there came the task of stocking small individual packs of cat food. The most enjoyable part would have been between joking around with the crew (there were some pranksters) and seeing what we had accomplished by morning."
good,"It was a good job. All I did was bag groceries, clean and help customers. I got tips for taking out custumers groceries as well."
good,"bagging food, pushing carts, stocking food, cleaning work place"
good,"bagging grocery's, pushing carts, cleaning bathrooms, and restocking shelves. "
good,"Get your walking shoes on if you work in a store. You'll be on your feet all day. I work in the produce department, and I'm on my feet for the full shift except for breaks/lunch. 15 minute breaks for every 4 hours worked, and a 30 minute non-paid lunch. Started out at minimum wage, and got a nickel raise after just 30 days. You have to keep busy for the full shift, but fortunately, the management isn't ""too"" demanding of minimum wage employees. Going to school (if you can afford it) is possible for part time employees (again, if you can afford it). However, I was informed by the department manager that ""if you're full time, the job comes first"". Scheduling around outside life isn't too difficult, as long as it's not too restrictive on the company."
good,Friendly work place but like most retail places random working hours.
good,Did not receive proper training. I was reprimanded for not knowing how to do tasks that i was never taught.  
good,Even with me working in the summer I still was never to get at least 30 hours
good,"good employees to work with, fairly easy job to do and show up for, management was inconsistent"
good,"I assist customers everyday, by ringing up there groceries."
good,"Open learning was the best thing about working at kroger pharmacy. Pharmacist were always willing to teach. Learned about different meds, how to apply insurance if the patient didn't have their card. A typical day at the pharmacy was very busy."
good,Good work place and great opportunity for career advancement if you have the motivation and drive.
good,A typical day for me working at pick n save is handling cutomers issues that store related. Servicing customers in a positive manner and sometimes dealing with aggressive atitudes whether it's coming fom the customer or my co workers. I've learned that regardless of a difficult situation you can't let your attitude get the best of you no matter what. The hardest part of my job was dealing with favortism that goes on there. The most enjoyable part is the customers and leraning new things about the job.
good,"learned alot about fruit and vegetables, tempature climates"
good,Nice place to work. The people at Kroger are good to there employees. 
good,"I have a higher sense of what people want and my people skills have increased exceptionally. Ive learned to deal with things with more comfortability for myself, my employees and our customers. I learned that above all buy good shoes."
good,I have gained some experience working there. I love my co-workers who i used to work with. but the hardest part about this job was trying to satisfy every customer.
good,"very well organized , very professional and employee orientated "
good,"A typical day I come in run the register, ringing customers orders up, compose a pleasant atmosphere for customers in any needs they have. "
good,Great company with community involvement but compensation leaves something to be desired at times.
good,"My typical days at work are always extraordinary. What I have learned is that I was taught how to manage other courtesy clerks how to get the job done in time. My co-workers are very down-to-earth and professional, does their duty to get things correct. The hardest part of the job is having to stop what I am doing and assist checkers (bagging groceries, etc), and not having enough time to finish performing my duties. The enjoyable part is doing the most that could either the manager or customer happy and satisfied."
good,This was a descent job for high school students. The people weren't as friendly and pleasant to work with. 
good,A great place to start out in if you are looking to get into pharmacy!
good,Roundys is an up and coming company that recently had its first IPO. 
good,This store was good to work at. My supervisor for my department was amazing. However store management lacked the ability to take time to listen to an employee on issues within the store. I had an instance where I was un happy in my department and asked to be moved. It took them three months to get back to me. Then another two months and an incident with the department manager to finally move me to another department.
good,"A typical day at K.D.C. is a lot of order picking and everyone in a hurry. I've learned a lot in the short time that I've been there. Before I was employed there I never knew anything about ""order picking"". The management team seems firm but fair. They want you to come there and do a job and if you can not do it, why are you there!? My co-workers for the most part are okay, I have no complaints. The hardest part of the job is the production part. You have to meet a certain number each and every day but you get use to it. The first couple of weeks were kind of hard. The most enjoyable part about my job is that it is fast pace and you don't have time to get bored."
good,"A typical day at work involves providing the needed services for the customer. Being employed at Kroger's for over seven years, has helped me to acquire excellent customer service skills. Additionally, due to the high quantity of customers we encounter, I have learned how to work efficiently under pressure. Being employed at Kroger's has also helped me to learn to work with a team and as a strong team member, for over the years I have had to work with several different co-workers with various personalities. The hardest part of my job is having to deal with dishonest co-workers. I am an honest person, therefore it is difficult for me to trust and work with someone who practices dishonesty. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping people. People have so many problems in their lives, so it brings me great pleasure to be able to do something that brings a smile upon a customers face. I enjoy making people happy, even if only for a moment."
good,It is good place to work with the right management behind you.
good,1. Very busy as it is a leading grocery store.
good,"A typical day at the station consisted of 8 hr shifts. You were Placed In a small cement cube with a speaker to the outside world and a box for cash. You were to take inventory before you started and at the end of your shift. You were required to assist customers that could not work the pump. There was not a bathroom in the station so if you had to go to the bathroom you had to wait until the store could send someone down. As a Fuel Clerk You had to sit in the block and wait till someone wanted to pay with cash or until we were needed. We kept the station clean, the pumps clean, took fuel deliveries, and changed prices. However I also worked as a cashier, I worked in produce, and I helped stock shelves when staff was short. I had made arrangements with the store managers that when they needed someone to pick up extra hours to contact me because I needed the extra hours."
good,-Assist customers with bagging items and providing carry-out
good,"The work is hard, but meeting new people is definately a bonus."
good,"Between bagging groceries, running a register and cleaning choirs, time really flies. Like most retail stores, its busy with few down time. I gained good customer service experience and supervisor skills while working for Kroger. Co-workers are supportive of each other. The hardest part at times was keeping up with the afternoon rush. most enjoyable part of the job was family like atmosphere of the store."
good,"This is where I received by first stages of training as a pharmacy technician. I had an amazig staff of pharmacists, one intern and 3 technicians that helped be achieve and learn the pharmacy profession and in only a few a months I took the test and became a Nationally certified pharmacy technician."
good,A great first job. Nothing about it was hard at all. The pay is about as low as it gets however
good,"Kroger has a comfortable work atmosphere for the most part. The majority of my co workers and managers are caring and fun to be around. Management is always shifting, and can be uncoordinated and lazy at times. The amount of work load can be stressful as well. My department manger does well with balancing my work life with social and school life. The coworkers in my department can be lazy at times. Hardest part of my job is completing the amount of work given for one day. Most enjoyable part of my job is having the opportunity to experience most departments. I have learned that customer service is a 24.7 requirement and you must be hard working, and dedicated for the position I am in."
good,I enjoyed helping patients understand their meds. I loved being able to use my medical skills on the job.
good,"The truck must be processed daliy, and seperated by different deptaments. Then the products must be put on the shelves, and the shelves are to be conditioned. The customers are to be greeted and assitsed if needed. Somethimes management will have extra tasked to be do by the end of the shift. The mahority of co-workers are willing to give a hand to make sure everyone gets done. But sometimes the is too much work that cant get done form the number of people scheduled that shift. The best part of the job is the paid vacations."
good,"Management is great, fun and works well with the employees. Other employees are generally good natured."
good,Things job was very interested because I dealt with many of different on different situations.
good,"A excellent place to work part-time if you have children or are in school. I provided great customer service and manage the funds also work in other departments around the store meat department, deli, floral."
good,Great training classes
good,Kroger does not pay as much and is for focused on quantity rather than quality.
good,Busy and to understaffed to meet customer demand. No time for breaks.
good,"Basic grocery store system, clear the parking lot of carts, help bag groceries, put away items of food, assist customers"
good,As an order puller at Kroger is a simple day in a real big freezer. We start by checking our electric pallet jack riders by checking off a check list then we get our paper work and start pulling types of meat that is on our order for King Sooper stores in Colorado to be shipped out and must be able to pull at least 140 cases of meat an hour. Learned to have a great memory of all locations of meat to be more productive. The hardest thing to do at the job is to be fast but at the same time be safe.
good,This Was Not Quite What I Had Imagined.
good,its calm and make you feel like family its somewhat lenient but over all productive because everyone is in a good mood.
good,I've learned a lot about providing great customer service & working promptly.
good,Frys was great you meet alot of people while you are working and time just flys by
good,"Typical day involves ordering for deliveries that are made 4 times per week. Stocking, building displays, maintaining shelf and department conditions, scheduling, attending meetings and direct store management contact."
good,"My typical day included customer service, lot management, shop back. I gained experience in retail and experience in talking to customers of different personalities and mood in such a manner to where they leave happy whether or not they arrived in the same mood. Most of my co-workers were very laid back and easy to work with, and though management wasn't as laid back they still was not unpleasant to work around. The hardest part of my job was maybe lot management considering the type of whether it was outside, cold and rainy had to be the absolute worse type. The most enjoyable part of the my job was meeting new people. I find it enjoyable to learn about new people of different cultural backgrounds and personalities and the stories they offer to tell."
good,Fast paced environment with excellent pay with good incentives
good,nice break room did best to make sure you had a break. couldnt keep there word when they said they do something
good,Check prices
good,"The workplace varied from day to day. there was no day exactly the same. The co-workers was nice and the management was alright, even though they didn't give the workers many hours to make it. I learned how to cut meat better and the customers was the best part of the job. The hardest part was working in the freezor for a long period of time due to temperatures of below freezing."
good,"Stocking, assisting customers questions, rotating dairy, receiving, inventory control"
good,A typical day at work is helping with customer needs. Learned alot of multi skills while at Kroger. Management seemed alright. Its a good starter job
good,My job title was the bagger i bagged customers food once they were done shopping and also collect shopping carts from outside and restocked the inside
good,I worked at night from 11pm to 7am
good,"After I clock in, I switch between gathering carts, bagging groceries and cleaning the bathrooms and break room, bagging being top priority. At 9:30: AM I take my first 15 minute break. Then I return to my duties until 12 PM, when I take my 30 minute break. Afterwards, I balance my aforementioned work with gathering trash and spot mopping and dust mopping the sales floor. At 2PM I go on my last 15 minute break. I then go back to work until I clock out. I learned janitorial duties, cart gathering and item location. Management was helpful if we ever had questions. My co-workers varied between hard workers and slackers trying to pawn off their tasks on me. The hardest part of the job is dealing with trash, as yellowjackets would constantly be swarming around the dumpster, making every trip an interesting one. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping people find what they are looking for. A good starting job to fill out one's work history."
good,I would cut fruit in a fast pace environment to get the shelves stock before the cut off time. hardest part was keeping up to speed and staying warm in the cooler cutting fruit.
good,"Didn't work here long. Great training program offered,"
good,"I really loved working here, because I was working within a team and worked on multiple things at once. This job also was challenging for me and made me happy knowing that I was helpfull to customers. I didn't like that while working here for so long that I had been threatened and harrassed by certain managers. Also, I didn't like that I was was offered a position at a new Kroger that was rebuild while being told to that my hours would be increased, but when I transfered my hours had decreased from 25-35 hours down to 10-16 hours a week."
good,"Bagging groceries, stocking shelves, assisting customers. Learned to have a customer service attitude, how to be friendly and helpful in the most professional way. Management was very professional, as were the employee's. Hardest part of the job was the patience needed to make it through the day. Most enjoyable part of my day was seeing the smiles on the customers faces as they were leaving the store."
good,"Kroger is a grocery retail business that deals with a very diverse community. A typical day at work is customer service and being there for the needs and wants of the customer. Smiling and making each and every customer feel welcome comes very easy to me. Ive learned how to communicate well with the public and have the ability to solve any issue with the customer in order for them to return and shop. Management can be both positive and negative, because it has to be a balance depending on the situation. But I have notice that over time, management does not follow its on Kroger values when dealing with his or hers employees. The co-workers can be fun to work with. And there are also others who does not want to follow the rules and procedures put in place to help the customers shopping experience turn out to be great. There isn't anything in Kroger that is hard besides who you work with. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting different individuals of all walks of life, and uplifting them in any way to make their shopping experience great!"
good,M akin sure tha the labells was on the package right.Putin the spaciest on a pallet
good,"Didn't like not being able to work, as a union company, the management was not allowed to do work that could be completed by another union employee. Most stores operated within their own rules, company rules were overlook and this didn't settle well with me. I handled all community fundraisers at the store level, handled inventory, scheduling, hiring, all departments at different times throughout my career."
good,"Bad management, very low wages, no room for advancement. They don't enough hours, and they're not willing to negotiate."
good,This was my first time working at a grocery store and it allowed me to see the stress cashiers tend to experience. I was responsible for moving at a fast pace and providing quality customer service at the same time. I gained a lot of respect for cashiers.
good,"Check it. My first job at kroger was an ok job. you bag groceries,keep the place looking nice and help some old folk as well."
good,the store is separated into a bunch of different areas of work my area was called the front end i would assist customers in the purchasing of their items.
good,"I worked as a cashier and although the job was not hard, I didn't enjoy it. I became floor supervisor, which is just like a cashier position with additional responsibilities. I later transferred to the floral department and LOVED IT. My supervisor was awesome and very informative."
good,"A typical day at work involved checking customers out, answering any questions the customers may have had, providing a clean and safe environment, answering telephones, managing my own cash drawer, and working well with the other employees. The hardest part of the job was pleasing everybody. Sometimes a customer would be upset over a price or a certain product and dealing with the issue became frustrating at times. I enjoyed my employees and engaging in small talk with my customers."
good,"The greatest people ive been associated with is the ones i work with on a daily basis. My co-workers have the best attitudes about coming to work, as well as putting in a quality day of work. The hardest part is being away from my friends and family. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping that one person find what they are looking for and hearing those two words"" thank you"" means everything to me. Ive learned that work can be fun when you trully love what you do. Management is always trying to find new ways to motivate and encourage my self and my co-workers to excel at what we do best."
good,When I work it is usually on the self checkout dealing with customers needs and complaints. I have learned to be more patient than i was before and more understanding. Management is good. Most co-workers are team players . Hardest part is when all six registers need help at the same time and they all feel they should be first. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is visiting with my regular customers and helping other find what they need.
good,I was a cashier. Didnt move up like I wanted to. Pay was ok when i was in high school but as i got older i needed more and wasnt given what i needed for the years i stayed with the company.

Greet and engage with regular customers and new cliental. Work with management to improve and ensure customer satisfaction. Work with various and diverse people all the time which introduces new ideas to the work place. Sometimes not having enough help makes the job productivty harder to accomplish.

good,- Typical Day at Work: See resume.
good,"Working at Kroger was very fast paced. The faster you worked the more likely you were to get one of their daily giftcards. It was fun working with new people and meeting new people. Management was strict, but favored certain people even if they weren't the best workers. The hardest part was keeping up on really long days and working so late when I went to highschool. They often forgot I was in highschool and tried to repeatedly schedule me during school hours. That led to me quitting when I got into trouble for not showing up because I was in school."
good,i sleep all day and woke up for my sheft that night and got there at like 11:50 or so and take things off a board and speard it were it should go. Then cleaned up the store befor we opened.
good,"I liked being at the register. I could get orders going and had a good knowlegde of the machine to ring up items.

good,"Fast paced work environment with many tasks to do throughout the day. A typical day includes helping customers with questions about specific items, locating items, pricing items and helping customers with their items. Although it is a face paced environment, co-workers and management all work together to perform successfully. Hardest part of the job may be dealing with upset/unhappy customers. Most enjoyable part is interacting with customers and helping them with what they need."
good,"Every day when you come into work, whatever your job title may be you are always doing your job until the shift ends. I can't remember a time that you ever were asked to leave early due to slow business. I learned that Kroger may be a good job opportunity, especially starting off, but there are many other jobs and careers out there that will be a lot better for you. The co-workers weren't hard to get along with as long as you did your job well. The hardest part of working there was if you got one minor customer complaint the management treated it like you were on the verge of getting fired. I enjoyed the friends I made while working there and quite a few of them are still friends to this day."
good,Stocking shelves in frozen. Not a lot of learning opportunities. Management was great and was very flexible about helping and trying to conform to your needs. Co-workers are all still friends of mine. Was very difficult to keep warm while working. Most enjoyable part of my day was getting to go on break and talking with fellow co-workers.
good,A typical day at the pharmacy is very busy and there is a lot of team work.
good,"I worked at Kroger for 1 year. I started as a courtesy clerk and soon was promoted to cashier, customer service, then soon after, accounting and floor supervisor. It was a fun place to work and an absolutely perfect first job for 15 yr olds. Much better than a fast food first job!"

good,ever day we cook clean help people.and the hardest part is dealing with the mean people that come in ever day.
good,This was my first job and they let me start working at 15 with a work permit. I did not join their union so after ~10 months and turning 16 my hours were still 15 or less a week and there were no opportunities for advancement. The job was easy but unrewarding. Management was friendly and helpful. My coworkers were also amiable. The worst part of the job was there was not any room for advancement not even to cashier or something.

A lot of times a supervisor is not not needed if I can trouble shoot any issues my customer's may have. I enjoy working on a team because we do help each other out when needed. The hardest part of the job is assisting a very upset or irate customer."

good,"I greeted customers as they entered and exited the store. I also directed customers to the items they were looking for. I learned to speak slowly and clearly in order for people to understand what I was saying. The management of the store helped bag groceries, cashier, and gather shopping carts. My co-workers were fun to joke around with. The hard part was trying to keep busy on days with minimal customers. I enjoyed working with people from different countries."

good,A good place to get a start into the real world.
good,"Everyday was pretty much the same thing. For the first thirty minutes after clocking in, you were to go out and gather carts. From then on, everyone would alternate from bagger, cashier and carts until the end of their shift. There was plenty of one-on-one engagement between the employees and employers. They would occassionally come to the floor and start small conversation or throw out a few encouraging words. All of the employees were kind and the environment was very welcoming. I would not consider any of my tasks actually hard, but the one responsibility that I struggled with the most was gathering carts simply because of the heat and the random rush of customers. Being behind the register was the most enjoyable part of my position. I enjoyed the opportunity to interact with the customers on a more personal bases."
good,It is a good place to work when you are in Highschool or College.
good,same routine each day.learned to use various machines.very good management.nice co-workers.
good,"Customer friendly, task oriented. Hardest part of the job working overnight. The people you meet while at work, the positive relationships formed."
good,"If I had stayed with Ralphs perhaps at this time I would be a manager. Working the grocery field can be a bit unstable, because of the unions and workers not being happy with what they get paid, or how they are overworked. But if you able to hold on, they do offer a lot of room for advancement."
good,"I might work their again, if I could. tight shifts, the mangement might work with you if you get another job, but not douring peek season. long hours standing, you learn how to count money well. you see a new face every day"
good,"Kroger allows you to be able to balance out you home life with you work like, however they are not really good at job advancement. You can work for this company for years and not be able to get the promotion that you deserve, yet watch someone else be hired into the company get the title that you had been working toward. The pay is ridiculous which shouldn't be like it is since the company as a whole gross so much."

good,"After working for this company for eight years, I feel like management at the store I'm in is the main reason I'm looking for a new job. I've worked in other stores where the management was great and everyone got along, here it is not the case."

good,Its a very fast paced job with tons of customer interactions and developmental training. A normal day is very busy there's always something to do. You get to work various areas of the store. Everyone functions as a unit. There is a union and the benefits from this job is exceptional. The hardest thing is during busy hours it can be overwhelming and short-staffed.
good,I worked at pick n save just for the experience i started there when i was 16 years old.
good,"union optional but very pressured to join. worked in meat, seafood, deli, general merchandise and pricing."
good,"I enjoyed working at Kroger until towards the end, there was a lack of communication on the management side. I was not told that if I did not work for a certain amount of days that I would be automatically terminated from the system. I was not told that I was even terminated. They said I could just apply again and they would hire me back, but after talking to several of the managers, I got no response and was never hired again. Communication needs to be improved."
good,"Kroger is a good company, easy going environment most of the time. Feels like family working with most co-workers and pharmacists. Most enjoyable part of the job for me is ordering and inventory control. No part of the job is too difficult."
good,"It was good starts, i learned how to meet with new people, the coworkers was nice and helpful, i enjoyed bagging groceries"

good,I love working with the people (customers and my co workers) I just do not like the fact that management has no idea what we go through sometimes they ask a lot of us that is impossible to complete in the time frame that they are asking. I wish the job would pay more for all of the things that we do.
good,long and boring days
good,$7.25 doesn't really work out when you are almost 20 years old.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of myself conditioning the shelves between 4 am until 8 am, then other days I would work from 7 am to 11 am cleaning the restrooms and other areas of the store. I learned how to read the barcodes and make sure that the items match up with them and I also learned how to properly clean a public restroom and how to handle customer service. My co-workers were all very friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was gathering all the carts from the parking lot as fast as possible. The most enjoyable part of the job were the days when I was assigned conditioning because I liked that particular task best of all."
good,"They dont give enough hours, but i love the opportunity to get to meet knew people everyday an being able to interact."
good,It is a fast paced environment. You have to be good with working with people. The hardest part of the job is going outside in the winter to get carts. The most enjoyable part of the job is bagging groceries in late evening when work is a little slower than usual.
good,Fun place to work. Friendly co-workers and manangement. Not much room for advancement.
good,"Was a good learning experience as a manager, but was a little to commercial for what I wanted."
good,"A very good place to gain valuable management experience. I'm learning a lot and this job has allowed me to grow personally, and professionally. I've met and worked with a ton of great people from different nationalities and backgrounds. The hardest part of the job is having to work EVERY holiday and almost every weekend."
good,"Most days are slow but busy at times, working nights isn't fun at least not the midnight to 8am. Now a 10p-6a thats ok. A lot of good people to work with but a few bad apples like anywhere else. Good if you need something right now but not long term."

good,Good hours
good,I generally liked working at Kroger. I learned a lot from working there. Skills that I will have for a long time. When I was there the management was amazing. The hardest part of the job would be when there was nothing to do. But that rarely happened because it was always busy if not steady. The most enjoyable part of the job was making new friends and seeing the smiles on the regular customers.
good,Managment operates at satisfactory level. Became acclimated to running the show on my own do to the fact that many daily tasks that were to be performed prior to my overnight shift were not fulfilled at times. The hardest part of the job was being able to communicate to management my needs as the overnight cashier for more relief do to heavy crowds and not receiving sufficient support. Helping a customer have a pleasurable shopping experience was the most enjoyable part of this job.
good,Several times I was promised a higher posititon and everytime the opportunity came up i was told that i was needed where i was at.
good,First job in high school gained some great experinece i enjoyed very much while i was there bad thing not that much oppertunity for growth
good,"Overall I like working for the Kroger company its just very little room for advancements,"
good,The employes that work there are very friendly and hard workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the regular customers that would come in and I got to know by name and would look for me to ring them out.
good,I learned to keep my mouth closed about certain things that go on at the job because it may cost you yours
good,A very productive clean environment. It is also a place that allows you to interact with people and take on challenges that force you to think outside the box.
good,Always be on your toes and ready to work. There is never a dull or down moment. Other employees are awesome.
good,"didnt have a set schedule, good oppertunity for advancement."
good,Even with my experience in this industry I don't receive any hours because of seniority.
good,"Kroger was an OK place to work, but being a cashier is harder than it looks. Kroger puts a lot of stress on cashiers simply because they and the baggers are the last people the customer sees. Cashiers are supposed to work at a certain speed that can be very challenging simply because customers are people too."
good,"This was a great place to work. The customers were mostly ""usuals"" and most were almost always friendly. It was a great fit with my busy school schedule."
good,I worked for Kroger 7 years. The fast pace and the wonderful co-workers made it an experience I shall never forget.
good,"Kroger Co. is centrally located in downtown Cincinnati. Parking was inconvenient and expensive, but the job had many perks. each floor of the high-rise was dedicated to a department in their stores. I frequently corrected technical problems that saved far more time and money than my paycheck reflected, but I was frequently recognized and received side benefits, like coupons equivalent to free and expensive groceries."
good,"My time there wasn't wasted as I did learn to be more social due to the fact that with this job that is the main objective, to be sociable."
good,Management could use a Lilttle work they are ok but don't seem to want to help you move forward. The store putsbthe customer last now don't care of how hard thing are for the customers
good,"It's a good place for starters, but after a while I started getting tired of being taken advantage of. The breaks were also really short for a 7-hour shift."
good,I like the training although it takes a very long time to up in salary. As far as working at Kroger pharmacy in Frankfort it was okay the job was good. But I worked in the deli and loved the staff. As for management they rock!
good,Clock in on time.  Quantify/ Qualify the tasks needing to be complete. Introduce positive/ constructive/ motivating/ best management practices. Keep lines of communication open. Find a rhythme. On Top and In Stock.
good,"It was a good first job to have and to get experience in the working world and it was great to know how busy it can get when working, but it was also a bad run management team there."
good,The store im at they always try to bring you down even when you did a lot of work for them the hardest part is trying to get everything they want done in 8h then they expect you to work 12-15h to get it all done
good,Kroger is a good company. The management team made it easy to transition into the job. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with local people.
good,"This place isn't really special. Its a typical work environment that asks a lot from you with little in return. You ask management for something, most likely won't happen. Nice workers, but usually are always tired. This place does not care that much about your personal life unless it is absolutely necessary."
good,Fairly enjoyable work.  They care only about the numbers.  Management needs to get to know their employees better.  Work place is very worldly cultured.  Working for a place that's so afraid of offending anyone and maybe losing a sale;. Even if it is morally wrong.I loved most all my customers
good,"Kroger is good place to work, both as a starting point and for possible advancement with the company. Management (at least in my store) were both competent and went out of their way to help and connect with associates. However, many of the stores polices hindered employees' ability to work. Many goals set were simply unrealistic. It could lead to very frustrating situations."
good,Management hands on. A good place to work if customers service is your strength. Limited advancement opportunities. Must be willing to learn in a fast paced retail environment.
good,"it isnt terrible overall, but you're expected to drop everything in your life to be able to work if they need you. I've missed countless birthday parties and family events, but ""its part of retail"""
good,I don't think Kroger is any different from other grocery stores in terms of the categories above. They are very average and exactly what you'd expect.
good,"we were often very busy and management would not hire anyone or give our store more hours to help us catch up, often being overwhelmed. the people i worked with were often the saving grace as they helped improve the quality of the time there"
good,"Working for Kroger is good in that they leave techs alone to allow for repairs, yet do not give aid to techs that struggle. "
good,Was a great first job. Teaches you how to work at a comfortable pace and independently. Teaches you responsibilities of the register and to communicate better with customers.
good,They will only apologize. Your opportunity to continue working with the company is too late at that point. You either accept separation or a termination without benefits and fight it.
good,"The job itself was a very welcoming and fun atmosphere, however the management was a bit unstable for my profession. The manager no longer works there, but still a good place to worj"
good,"I was hired as an Ecommerce Selector, but worked as a cashier until they finished the remodel. Being a cashier is a super easy job! Anyone can do it. My coworkers were amazing!"
good,Not a bad place to work. Very fast-paced and there will always be something to keep you busy. Managers are very understanding and good to work with as long as you're honest and do your best at work.
good,"i was not able to take any day off to spend with my family , they only cared about work not about their employess"
good,"Organization downsized."
good,"Kroger, is an amazing starter job for anyone looking for a child, it's been so long since I worked their but it was a great starter job but it actually could've been better"
good,There’s not enough hours in my department. Sometimes you don’t receive all breaks and lunches. I didn’t get the health benefits I wanted. I have diabetes and other health issues and I am concerned about working alone. Otherwise the management is supportive and I did like getting a week paid time off for part time work.  Also I was able to do homework for school and get paid from Kroger.
good,A typical  day at work would include helping out customers with whatever they needed at a fast pace. It would also include making sure the work area is clean for safety reason.
good,"Kroger is a fun atmosphere to work.  I have become friends with many of my coworkers.  While I do enjoy the flexibility of the job, there does not seem to be much of a long term potential growth for me at the company.  Third shift also makes it difficult to have a social life.  I would like to work for a company thats has potential for growth."
good,Most managers would give you the shirt off their back but never felt like I was accomplishing anything worth accomplishing. Never felt like I wanted to move up in their company or what they had to offer.
good,"I've worked with Kroger for three years. Started out as a part-timer then worked my up to a Produce Department Lead. The farther up I climbed, the more management unappreciated me and any progress I made within my department went unrecognized. If you enjoy being under high pressure, talked to like you're an idiot by your store leader, and being treated like nothing you do will ever be pgood enough, then being a department head is the job for you!"
good,Good for advancement. Towards the end of my time there it became that they wanted a single person to do too much and didn't give any help. Hours were cut and no help. It became stressful to a point.
good,They messed up my schedule multiple times and terminated me for no reason. Had to take a week off and went back to working for them just for them to make me work everyday 10-6 and they already knew I couldn’t work that on certain days but before that it was an alright job with great employees.
good,"I got about 75 percent of customers extremely mad because I did not know or understand their language. Every day the customers tryd to break  and humiliate me, but i had a family there( my co-workers) break, back to work."
good,"Working in this company has taught me a lot of great characteristics to work for myself and/or other workplaces.Although my time at Kroger has been a great lesson learning job for me, my time unfortunately has come to an end."
good,"I learned quite a bit with Kroger. How to properly stock shelves and direct customers and up sell. The culture was awesome, my coworkers made the job more enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was being a parcel and having to handle the bottle return outside. Management was not my favorite."
good,"As a bagger, it was very unexciting, pushing carts in the rain and snow is awful, so is cleaning public bathrooms. But its a great job to get when you are 14 years old, it will teach you a lot."
good,I enjoyed the three years ive been working there. Received a lot of knowledge to better my career for future advancement with another company. Over all lroger is a good company to gain knowledge in your field. But do not see it as a career
good,I would not recommend this company at all.Dissatisfied with the way the business is ran.Just really no words cant say to much I did it and dont now time to move on.
good,I just want to be at job that I know I'm working hard and getting paid good for it and if I want to move up they will look into because I put the work in
good,"There is always a lot to do if you like to be kept busy.   Great for self starters, not much training provided.  Many different depts. to chose for employment."
good,"I was paid 10.50 a hour as a cashier, I received  about 8 hours a shift. For the first two checks I had to get paper checks before direct deposit. You also can earn 12 dollars an hour for late nights instead of the 10.50. There was also weekly pay."
good,"My time at Kroger has given me very mixed emotions about the company, it definitely is a good company to work for but they’re high tax rate, poor management, and less than deserving (part-time) pay makes it very easy to walk away from the company."
good,Really good to work but. Very little teamwork has some of the proper training skills and teaches how to act with people. But would still suggest people who are willing to work
good,"Coworkers and managers at my location have always been great, but unfortunately, this company is behind the times.  We are not paid remotely competitive wages for our area, and there is no real human resources department, leading to constant staffing issues and a very stressful environment where everyone is overworked.  Compounding this is a corporate entity that seems to come up with a new big idea for a regulation, checklist, or arbitrary task every other week. You can't keep up with the boundless workload and all the rules changes coming down from on high, so instead you just have to go with the flow and do what you can.  At this company you have to learn corporate double-speak - say ""yes, of course we can do that"" even when its impossible. Consistent communication between levels of management is sparse.  I would only recommend this as a temporary job - most people at my store don't last more than a couple weeks anyway."
good,"Working at the fuel center can be very stressful at times, but it can also be slow paced. It just depends on the day and time. If you work at a store that has a lot of issues with the gas pumps, your job will be more stressful because customers will come to you to fix the problem."
good,"As a grocery clerk, I stocked heavy amounts of food and home items. My co-workers were mostly tired and lazy, and I got all the duties they didn't feel like doing. Nevertheless, I enjoyed stocking the shelves, as it was very therapeutic. Management was very relaxed, but I did see them often. I also occasionally dealt with an angry customer when we were out of a specific brand. That was tough. All-in-all, if someone's looking for some summer cash and has at least average body strength, this job will suffice."
good,"While stocking, checking dates to ensure fresh, quality product, and marking down prices to move product; I also often broke down shipments and worked to maintain strict sanitation guidelines"
good,"Dont work here they do not appreciate you and you are replaceable. Management avoids the deli at all cost. We are the outcast of the whole store, but the hardest department."
good,I don’t recommend working here unless you can’t find another job. They chose your schedule and it’s different every week. It’s great for College students.
good,Working  at Kroger's  was a good job. they had good benefits.  I got paid every  week had enough  hours a week. you have to move at a fast pace. An greet people  as they are approaching your register.
good,At first working at Kroger was great.department was fully staffed. Once Kroger started cutting hours around the holidays people got kids somewhere else. Understaffed department has trouble maintaining product on the sales floor and no help being hired in the future. Just need a change where I don't work every weekend.
good,"The job was great 2 years ago, but as of the last year the new employees receive a higher pay than the employees that have been there for years and the guarantee of hours is almost non existent for non-full time employees since its generated via an unknown algorithm and is different every week."
good,"I wouldn’t recommend the job. When I was working for Kroger’s I quit, because they didn’t want to give me any work hours. I was working about 7 hours a week. Some times I would only work for 3 hours one day then wait a week for more hours."
good,"My store is constantly getting a new store manager every 6-12 months. I feel as if the company has lost sight on taking care of their employees. Hours are always being cut, they want to run departments on the bare minimum and never have enough help if an emergency happens. There's a union but Goodluck getting ahold of them if a situation arises. The rep never calls back and 9 times of 10 your issue goes unresolved."
good,It wasn't the worst management role but there definitely were some areas that needed to be improved. How the position was trained was not efficient and in some cases effective.
good,Went into Krogers with a great interview experience..  Mangers were very informative and nice.  Workforce was a little different.  Many disliked their jobs and not very friendly.  My training was hit and miss.  Trainers were very inexperienced at training fellow employees.
good,"I wouldn't recommend being a cart pusher bc they make you get them In rain, snow, heat and cold but they do give you a Pancho. Fairly nice place to work."
good,The job itself has been fine. I moved up fairly quickly and took on more responsibility. After 2 1/2 years I moved up to management type position and run a Starbucks kiosk. Downfall is the pay.
good,"Kroger is a great beginning job for new workers or people look for a secure place to work. A typical workday for a grocery clear consists of stocking sale items and quick selling products throughout the day, unloading pallets of product, assisting customers with questions and working extra product from previous days. The management however is very lackluster, they are quite lacking in their communication skills and seem to dismiss the thought of thanking their hard working employees. The moral of the stores is certainly a point of improvement."
good,"A typical day at Kroger would be working for a couple of hours with no rest, which is fine. Most days I’d have to work in the heat for an hour at a time to bring back in carts. Most of the day would be repetitive."
good,"As a Clicklist/Pickup associate, the job is very engaging and you are on your feet, walking each shift. This is great because you aren't stuck in the same place your entire shift. Employees in the Clicklist department are amazing and are always helping each other out. Management can be great then sometimes not so great. Busiest days are Fridays-Mondays, be prepared to get asked to stay. My advice to future associates is to keep moving and also don't be afraid to ask questions to your fellow employees in your department and the other departments, this job uses lots of common sense."
good,"It’s not all too bad but as a courtesy clerk/bagger, you do a lot of different things. However, the store I work at has amazing coworkers and the customers are almost always nice. I’m not paid a lot but it adds up. Paycheck is weekly. I don’t intend to stay, but I’ve learned a little for the several months that I’ve stayed"
good,I loved my job at first but then it ended up being crazy. Communication is not very well there between departments but I haven't been there in four years and still shop there. Quality has always been very good there and they do try and yake care of their employees.
good,"Be mindful of management. Benefits are good. Pay rate can use work. Good for temporary, or just starting out. Do not do anything they could use against you."
good,I worked here while in college and they worked around my school schedule. I rarely left when my shift was scheduled to end. Breaks were sometimes over an hour late. I worked weekends and holidays and was constantly called in.
good,"Kroger was an OK place to work, but some of the management was a joke. They had their picks and  they didn't care if anyone else knew it. Weekly pay!!"
good,"Employees, bosses had excellent people skills. Managers worked as much or more than most employees. Busy location in Bartonville. Union negotiates raises. Products are good quality. Bosses want to see workers learn tech gadgets. Apparel, home asked to unload boxes occasionally, close department at evening, resolve customer inquiries."
good,The old store manager wasn’t the greatest person by any means. The union is borderline useless and because of lack of enforcement by the manager the front desk associates would abuse their power and authority over the baggers.
good,It was a great job for when I was a teenager but as I noticed when I needed more time off to start my online school to brother my career they were not accommodating towards work life balance. It's common to work more than 8 hours shifts. Management is constantly changing and it is coming for them not to hire people based on merit but for external factors very on what will make the store look a little more inclusive
good,Hard job to have if you can only be part-time as a student. Hours were all over the place from 13 hours one week to 30 the next. Pay was okay but capped out very quickly
good,Kroger is a good place to get involved with the job world however there is a lack of job advancement you cant get very far. The people were nice and the job was not too stressful
good,The job is nice for young people in the area that need a job. Also might be good if you can manage but on average its too little. They turn over lots of people because they hire many high school kids.
good,"Keep the customers/managers happy, mixed culture some days supportive some super demanding, hard-work ethic, stability, management/team members come and go."
good,The days are rather monotonous and can be really tiring. It never felt like their was enough staff on hand and so everything tended to feel frantic and chaotic.
good,"It's the job I needed to get me through school. I enjoy working with my coworkers."
good,It was ok I wouldn’t recommend it  or would I join the union the job was fun and it made me have skills that I didn’t already have . This was a fun job
good,"After kroger took over the employees are miserable and the company doesnt care about the employees. Havent heard a single good thing out of an employees mouth about the company, inconsistent hours, broken promises and unwanted total of 12 self checkouts. customers have also picked up on our misery with the new company owner and even left reviews about it and customers would constantly complain how downhill its been with the changes kroger has made."
good,"While working with Kroger, I felt that management didn't have my back, they seemed focus on the customer's side of the story, which in most case was degrading,  Management didn't know how to talk to us, employees.  They consitively embarrassed  us in front of customers, which made our job very stressful. I felt at times that they didn't care about me, when a customer disrespected me, they it seems like it was my fault."
good,"Highly stressed environment. Corporate is too far removed from the workplace. 10 hr work days mandatory, little time for breaks/lunches. Overtime for Managers is expected. Age was a factor in my Position, and a reason to be dismissed. Fellow Managers had a similar problem."
good,"Great environment. My store is such a big family. We all help each other when we can. BUT the pressure on us to complete our tasks and keep the departments 5S. The hours corporate expects everything to be done, is not possible. They want lists of everything that is supposed to be done & done right, which is fine and dandy, but they don't realize that we are a very large store, that only has small store hours to work with. Just because you pull associates from other department to help front end, grocery, dairy whatever, does not make everything okay. If you have to keep borrowing people, borrowing hours, then just give us more hours, we need them. Love everybody I work with though. The suits just need to come down from the penthouse and really try and understand their business that ""they"" are running."
good,Fun place to work nice customers management not very goodeasy dress code staff was always very talkative a lot of pot lucks and the manager debrah would always check up on you
good,"Love Kroger and my position. Except that most of the time management don’t know how to appreciate hard work employees, they put a lot of work on employees for no good salary !"
good,"Personal experience of working there would be lack of common sense and teamwork among management. Everyone for themselves.They recognize if you are a hard worker, but will abuse that knowledge often. Large difference in age of employees. Ages can vary from 16-70 years old. Most enjoyable part of the job is being a part of making customer's shopping experience enjoyable. You will create relationships with frequent grocery shoppers that rely on the store for anything that you put on the shelves. Kroger store is located in the heart of my hometown and childhood so I see people and friends I talk to or know on a daily basis. I learned mostly how to talk to people and word certain things when engaging in conversation whether it be professional or casual."
good,"I work 5 days a week 6 to 7 hours a day. I made sure that the entire floor was spotless every night, and try to make the floor as shiny as I can get it with the tools they gave me"
good,"Low hours, managements a joke, work with a bunch of kids who don’t actually work, no discipline, I used to love my job but after 8 years it’s just been a waste of my time."
good,"overall, its a very good company but i was there for too long and got to see that their hiring patterns are not very fair because they dont look for good merit rather they look for external factors relating to affirmative action."
good,Working there wasn't bad it had its days. Overall good enviroment. The hours weren't bad. Management is decent. I would definitly work there again. Kroger is an overall good place.
good,"The culture and familial like environment is the most enjoyable part of the job. There is a lot of hard work that goes into it, however there's a lot of fun and connection that's made with co workers"
good,"This could have just been the location where I worked. They never had enough baggers, did not make sure everyone went on break (there were times where I had to just leave). One of the supervisors was upset about me talking to a coworker, but would lallygag all day with the team members she was fond of. It was a terrible experience."
good,"I enjoyed working at Kroger. The people I worked with were easy to get along and easy to talk to if I ever had any issues. Managers were easy to talk to, especially when I needed something accommodated."
good,"It was fast paced, and it was very repetitive which I like. The hardest part of the job was working every weekend all weekend long, Im searching for a job that will not require me to work all weekend long i have 2 small children... the most enjoyable part was job security and associate appreciation days/ perks."
good,Good local management but district staff was far too demanding. Crazy hours along with holiday and weekends tied up. Good group to work with in the local stores though!
good,pay isnt the best and overall experience of working there could be better l l l l;  ;; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;; ; ;;  ;; ; ; ;; ;; ;; ; ; ;; ;;  ;; ; ; ; ;
good,"Build relationships with those around you at your job. If you have something going on in your life, talk to the mangers they are very understanding. A great high school job"
good,"Coworkers were nice and helpful, tasks are monotonous and repetitive but not hard nor challenging. There was little downtime making the day pass by fast, good for beginner jobs."
good,Good place to start but not enough pay/hours to live off of for an associate like me. Would recommend for someone looking for a first time job and costumer service experience.
good,"While your hours in your department will make you feel stressed, what has kept me around for almost 11 years are the amazing people you get to see day in and day out. You will get to know your customers, and some will even shop there because of you."
good,"Fry's was honestly a very good place to work but when I went to the hospital, they didn't notify my family and by after they had called the first time, there was too many no call no shows. So if I was working at a different job or recommending someone else to work at Fry's, I would have to require more communication so I don't have to leave my job."
good,Unload truck and put stock on the vehicles. Learned how to stock and zone aisles. Management was okay. Was not a great workplace culture. Finishing truck and a lack of help. Was stocking a store.
good,"My time at Kroger hasn't been entirely terrible, it was just some days are better then others. The associates are what made the job bearable most of the time. A typical day at work is just conditioning the outer perimeter to make the store look neater, and stocking the shelves with food. Management is good for the most part, but not perfect. The culture was okay, I'd say."
good,"The flexibility of Kroger makes it possible to work while being enrolled in college. The work was not difficult or extremely fast paced, but the low pay compared to other similar companies can be problematic."
good,My review is it’s ok place to work managers are decent. I worked there as a cart pusher so I didn’t have to deal with a lot of the stuff inside the store
good,"Kroger was a nice place to start out in the workforce. If you werebfresh from High School or looking for something simple. It got busy around breakfast, lunch and dinner as it is a grocery store. Though customers can be a pain sometimes it was always important to keep your cool. As is the nature of customer service."
good,They push you to better you career by timing you check out speeds. Fast paced learning you have to really pay attention the first time cause they dont want to have to keep teaching you over and over. The pay was a bit higher then other places and the work hrs are constant.
good,"good benefits, competitive pay.  Is retail distribution, hence you work just about every holiday.  Management aspect of it difficult as work life balance goes away the further you try to move up the chain."
good,Great company to start out with when learning a new position or starting your first job. Work life balance can be hard to maintain during the course of the month.
good,I learned to be patient and multitask. I learned how to prioritize projects. I have learned to work quickly and efficiently while still maintaining friendliness with customers.
good,"A typical day at work is on your feet, standing for about 8 hours, while enduring a stressful environment. I learned that standing in place for multiple hours while bagging groceries was extremely difficult, my feet were sore after every shift and I went home exhausted. Management here was either really nice and helpful, or really bad and rude. The fellow employees were really nice and helped a shift go by easier. I think the hardest part of the job would be the stressful rushes and the combination of being tired from standing on your feet for multiple hours."
good,work was interesting and interacting with people was enjoyable. My biggest complaint is the inconsistent hours. Some weeks I would work 15 hours and some weeks I would work 30.
good,Kroger has rotating managers which makes working for them hard at times. Just when you get comfortable with your manager they leave and a new one comes in .
good,"The crew and management really went above and beyond to work together to meet customers needs. "
good,"Working as a team is key, but some don't and won't. Lot of lazy supervisors but some who work hard daily. They will hire almost anybody just to fill a position."
good,never had a problem coming in everyday everyone left me alone  never had anything to complain about fun people to work with respectful co workers store manager was always nice
good,"When I worked at Kroger, there was no teamwork. I worked as a courtesy clerk and I felt like I was one of the very few working up front with the customers."
good,"Working at Kroger has its ups and downs. For a few days, management is upscale and respectful, the others, it's like ..... wtf and why. The pay is somewhat good for cashiers, and you get paid weekly so that's also the good part."
good,"If I had the opening shift I would arrive and break down the truck in receiving. I would grab the items that belonged to my department, sometimes I had to dig through lots and lots of boxes just to get one small box at the bottom of the pallet. I would stock, pick up the aisles, markdown items if damaged, scan out stolen items, learned the basics of ordering. You get cross-trained, they make you be a cashier if it gets busy. Some of the leads were immature, they acted like they were in high school/ gossiped and had clear favorites with the clerks/associates. The hardest part of the job is the ""extreme couponers"" they make a mess, have their children running around, get mad when you are sold out of items. Also, if the leads see that you are good they make you do the most work, for one week I had to do the entire trucks for 3 departments while the rest were ""helping"" in floral so I personally didn't think I was getting paid enough for everything I did for them. The most enjoyable part of the job was that my coworkers were nice and I always kept myself busy."
good,Kroger wears you down over time. When I started I enjoyed it but the repetitive tasks combined with the nonexistent downtime meant that there was very little time to build a very strong connection with other employees. As I worked there longer and longer the tight work environment start to become draining especially when combined with the lackluster pay.
good,I was considered part time so I did not get benefits but they always worked me more than 40 hrs. a week. I loved my job but the hours were sometime ridiculous.
good,i liked working here but i did not enjoy the amount of work i was expected to do to makeup for other persons part when they wanted to be lazy and got no credit or even a solid thank you. Not even that its expected but its as if if i dont pick up the slack of select persons then it will not be taken care of and customers will be neglected.
good,It's a good job for someone in college that needs flexible hours while taking classes.  I never intended to stay there longer than me receiving my degree.
good,All Ralphs have different operating hours. The Ralphs I worked at is open at 5 am and close at 1 am. So you can work any of those or whatever is easy for you.
good,I mainly work here because I liked how well it fit with my college hours. And so I could pick up social and customer service skills. Ive enjoyed interacting with so many different kinds of people and meeting them. Kroger has introduced me to all different kinds of aspects and points of views that I never thought possible.
good,these days people that apply to work for fry's do not intend to stay there. the gap between top pay and minimum wage is way too small. there also seems to be an issue with making people work to the standards set
good,"A lot of the people where I worked had a high level of daily tension, and in some cases it affected their work; but it didn't stop me from doing my job"
good,"If your looking for a job that is fast pace but not too crazy, Kroger’s has many job opportunities available, while they may all depend on what you enjoy to do Kroger’s should be able to find you the type of work that suites your interest."
good,"While the floor managers were fantastic people, their efforts to make the job tolerable were constantly thwarted by their own inability to pick up the slack, and the restrictions thrown on top by the upper-management on a week-to-week basis."
good,"I had fantastic coworkers that I worked with on the front end. The only issue I had was with the new store manager and one assistant manager. I have a son with duel disabilities and child care is hard to find, and he did not seem to grasp that. I had to dig every week to get just 36 hours a week, but thankfully the union rep I had was awesome and she did a fantastic job of helping me get my hours"
good,There were rules that made sense and others that did not. i was tired of the speed rule especially at the store i was at where there were barely any customers who were in a rush.
good,Depending on the day and weather and events going on... working at Kroger can be very stressful but at times at relaxed and everyone is having fun while working. There are a lot of people working for Kroger that become friends and are amazing.
good,work load was extreme at times due to a lot of callouts had to double the work load lot of tasks to be completed working as a closer had a numerous tasks as well as cleaning the department all equipment floor waiting on customers enjoyed my fellow employees
good,"I only worked here until I could get another job after moving across the country. I wouldn't recommend working here for long since the pay is low and the management wasn't the most understanding. They were really strict about being on time and taking breaks, which meant they wouldn't listen even if you had a valid excuse or if you wanted to delay your break to help another worker. However, the workers are nice and the discount on grocery helped me get on my feet.  Overall, this is a good high school job."
good,"Our store is always under staffed for the work they require you finish in your shift, when concerns are addressed to management, the standard reply is we don't have the hours to get you more help. Others concerns are heard but not addressed by management which leads to the same problems day after day."
good,"Typical day would be come in . Count safe and registers. Check email for potential stop sale on items and possible price changes. Approve payroll then start on given takes for that day. What I learned is that is hard for a start up beginning company to really have they best of the best in the retail field. Culture was cool. Hardest part of the job was doing orders just because it was very time consuming . Most enjoyable part of the job was the employees, customers , and getting paid weekly."
good,From a customer stand point I love the products they offer. From an employee stand point their management sucks! I was a store chef with no room to move! Management wanted me to work when they wanted and would adjust my schedule with out consulting me or asking what I had going on. Not cool. Management is rude and nasty to store chefs. If you’re a REAL CHEF that is NOT the career move for you. It did pay nice but not worth it if your heart is in your career.
good,"First off if you're not self independent or have a lotta common sense to further better yourself and learn more broadly without the so call ""teaching"" and ""training"" meaning theres barely any. Then the job isn't for you. I started off in e-commerce and only 3months later I forced myself to move up and take any stocking opportunities they had because the pay isnt enough, not even working 2 years and I've gotten 3 raises only because I didnt bow down to staying ""in my lane"". Main advice, dont be sheep and own your job and know the rules. Management begins to lie to you about the rules and makes lines very blurry with the benefit of the doubt that you'll forget and become their mere pawn. You get offered the law protection over kroger's Deception with people called union, take it. It saves you multiple times and you cant really ever be fired unless you dont call in or steal something. If you're barely starting off and you have a good foundation at home and just wanna save knowing you're not gonna spend it , the job is perfect for you, show up do your job , enjoy life once you're out. Simple enough. For people trying to survive and make a living, if you dont have prior experience, the pay wont cut it. I'm only leaving because the managment has gone way down the drain and because the responsibilities I have coming are way too costly to only be making nine bucks a hour. Leaders are few and far between and it's pretty much a place that's for high school kids and old people."
good,"Poor overnight management "
good,"Just there for high school job, best friend hospitalized so I left to help and be there for him. Management was good, they were all nice and good policies that were cooperative."
good,"When I first started, I received a fair amount of hours and reaped the benefits of getting paid weekly. As of recent, the hours are lessening each week even with my availability open and, in turn, my checks are a reflection of 20 hours or less work week. "
good,"Kroger is an okay business to work for, the management can be a little harsh and seemingly gets more 'strict' as time goes by at my local Kroger. But honestly, the customers and business associated make it all worth the while. Kroger was my second family when I was employed there!"
good,"The job has good benefits, a positive work environment, and the employees are courteous. However, the minimum wage has to be increased and outside work has to be more balanced."
good,"While I overall enjoy the people I work with, the role and focus is constantly changing. Kroger seems to jump on all bandwagons, without much thought to how to actually execute the goals established."
good,"Some days it is busy in the bakery, and we need to get things baked and all. We bake cookie about everyday. Slice and package bread, and do other things."
good,I just started with this company in November and so far it's okay I can't complain at the very moment but there are some friendly employees and managers that are there
good,Management sucks. They don't really communicate with the front end. All the other departments have weekly meetings except for front end. Things tend to be left uncommunicated. Communication is a big issue.
good,"Management,  not consistent.  Was not given a the tools to be successful.  Loved the coworkers I worked with.  Kroger benefits were great. I enjoyed the fast paced environment."
good,"I was able to advance in the company, and was paid decent for my job title. I've worked in a few different stores and it really depends on who the manager is. The manager can make or break your team, but over the years I feel like the company is caring less and less about their employees, so I'm glad I'm out. The union takes a ton out of your paycheck and you don't really see them do anything. If you're low on the seniority chain, don't expect to have any say in your schedule, unless you have nice coworkers."
good,Good 1st time job. If you're management is good it is stress free easy to learn and a fun job.  Raises are not great and it is not enough  To live on can be a great environment.
good,"Fast paced, competitive social environment, the most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with people: the customers and coworkers. The workplace  culture was fun an energy charged, I enjoyed my job."
good,"Kroger could look into all the managers that are actively working for Food4Less, good feel and understanding for each of them. I learned a lot while being there and it definitely will come into my future jobs with me. There is always something happening at Food4Less whether it be fighting between customers, stealing, threats and or the homelessness problem right outside the door. Very dog eat dog type of setting. Customers are not always right."
good,I would only recommend this job for a seasonal time period. The pay is good but could be better especially for all the work you have to do. Manager isn’t a people person and is only using the job title as a stepping stone.
good,It was easy and simple. Very quick and easy to get tis. All i did was bag groceries and assist customers. I liked getting paid every  week. Discounts on kroger brands
good,"one of my first jobs out of high school. it's what you would expect. minimum wage, part time job. Nothing terrible to say really. It was simply another job."
good,"Did my job. No problems. Went home."
good,It was a fast pace job. Others mainly stood around on their phones leaving me to do all the cleaning. I went above and beyond and hardly ever got recognized for it.
good,"Workplace is very stressful. Associates don't do their job. Managers family works there and they get away with everything. For example, showing up late and not abiding by the dress code. Most of us would get written up if we were late or sent home if we weren't following dresscode, but managers family never gets wrote up or in trouble for anything they do wrong. This place is a joke. I am trained in 6 different departments, (drug/gm, grocery, floral, file, Starbucks, front end), and I still only make $8.40 an hour after being there for 2 years. I have had people come in and have no work experience and start out making $9/ hour or more. It's ridiculous."
good,We were told over and over that the company wasn't shutting down.Jun 9 employees were told that Kroger indeed was shuting down all of there stores in NC.August 14 they closed down all operations.Emplyees were given separation pay$750 if they stayed until closing date.I gave Kroger all most 14 years of my life.( nite shift 12am until 8:30 but most of the time it was until we finished.
good,I only worked there from the opening (12/2014) until March of 2016 and we underwent several different managers and the hours inconsistent. And lack of co workers during shift so lots of responsibility put on those on shift.
good,Working for marianos was my first job its really nice plus I got paid weekly but to me I feel that this job is for someone who's in high school or just need something extra on the side
good,"Great company, but you need to be in a larger metro area to have promotional opportunities. Most store managers have been in role over 20 years causing a log jam for store manager openings"
good,The workplace itself isn't bad. The main problem I had was with the irritants in the air as there is very little filtration. If you suffer from migraines I don't suggest this place. Its all about production and your moved around a lot.
good,At my store we had a fun work environment. Had a clean fast friendly store. We know most customers by name and what they needed when they came in. We always strived to do better. Had great inventories.
good,"Management was not well organized, stressful environment. Departments did not communicate very well so there was a lot of confusion between departments."
good,I started this job at a time when I needed it most.  It was a good opportunity that offered some advancement. I enjoyed the people I worked with and I enjoyed learning about retail management.
good,Working at Kroger was extremely stressful. Pay was low for the first month I was there. The job environment was stressful and some members of management weren't very helpful in alleviating that stress.
good,"People were fun to work with"
good,"If you're looking for flexibility as a regular stocker, Kroger is the place for you. If you want to have a more important leadership role, Kroger can get pretty stressful. The pay isn't that great unless you are a store manager or a department manager, but they do provide health insurance and vacation time after one year of service."
good,"the job never paid enough"
good,"I normally worked Fridays and weekends at Kroger, which meant my workdays happened to be on the busier days of the week. It was difficult at first, but I eventually grew accustomed to the fast-paced work environment. The meat department's supervisor was a great, understanding guy. The store managers were generally okay; they were about what you expect from a boss. I feel like the workplace culture of the store revolved around teamwork between and within each department. The most enjoyable part of the job were the friends I made at the store."
good,The workplace was fun and exciting the benefits and compansation are not worth it you are required to do multiple tasks for low pay and hours the job is great for high school student but not for people trying to make a living
good,"What more can I say?  This job just isn't for me.  If you like the brisk pace, being surrounded by people all day, and the constant workout however, you'd probably love this job.  Just don't be too surprised if next week's schedule isn't posted up on the Saturday before though."
good,"my typical day when I worked there was just sitting there and doing nothing at cashier, or if they had stuck me in bakery, I used to just make tortillas and throw things into the oven to bake and package things, put the price tag and put them on the shelves."
good,I worked hard and was loyal.  I was always available if they called me and stayed if they needed me.  Expectations were not realistic with the customers and situations.
good,"Courtesty Clerk is the hardest job I ever experience, I learned how to do bagging groceries depend on how much weight, bring shopping carts from the parking lot and do the chore around Ralphs."
good,Schedules and hours change weekly. The company only needed to give you 10 hours between shifts. Very hard to have a personal life. Expected to work all holidays.
good,Its not a bad starting job. The pay is better now(9hr starting i believe). The work is not all that hard and the people you work with tend to be good people. Some managers can make the job harder than it needs to be. Over all a good place to work.
good,"I would come in stock products, unpack deliveries for the dairy department, clean up dept. area, and do it all over again the next work day. Yet, it was kind of enjoyable to work there as well."
good,It was great working the day or night shift.. mostly good employee's to work with.  Can be stressful trying to make sure the store manager and department managers are happy but every job has something.
good,It’s is hard on the body. Schedules are erratic and always published last minute. Lateness is constant. There is no opportunity for upward mobility without favoritism.
good,I enjoyed it at first but it became a bit competitive and bias. I made acquaintances that I will never forget and adapted skills that will stay with me.
good,I loved this job but I became the supervisor and had to pick up the hours for THREE other people and yet I still was paid the same as a cashier. My hours were very inconstant. Some weeks i worked 40+ hours then the next week I would get  12-15. They have the annual union raises of a few cents but other than that a raise or promotion here is unheard of.
good,"Very steady job and income for a number of years at the Kroger helpdesk.   Not perfect, but not bad either.   Management was much better when I left than it had been for several years prior."
good,"You will have to work hard at this job. If you're not on break then you will be helping customers or doing something else around the store. There is always work to be done. The management wasn't too bad, even though there were a few supervisors who could only see what you're doing wrong and never praise you for what you did right. This is a good job if you like talking to customers and helping people out."
good,It is very busy. When you need some type of help it takes forever for someone like a supervisor to come help you out. Making the customers angry. When you call for price checks it takes for ever making the customer angry at you again
good,It was my first job I mainly used my income for food and for gas car insurance ect. I still lived with my parents so it was fine. I loved the crew I worked with
good,"Most morning shifts or day shifts during the week are occupied by older coworkers that have been there for years, not leaving a lot of options for days to work or opportunity to work more. Very tight group of coworkers that are local making the workplace somewhat cliquey and political."
good,"Pretty much sums it up. Management wasn't great at my store, but that's pretty common. The work was simple, customers were typically agreeable, but being unionized made it difficult to be rewarded for effort"
good,"Pick N Save is a great place to work, however fulltime opportunities are not given to the people they should go to. I only want something new because they did not give me promised fulltime for over a year."
good,I love the people that I work with but i think the pay is not the greatest. Im not the happiest when it comes to the pay because how are you suppose to make a living off of that.
good,There is very little to no communication within the store. Employees feel as though they are not thought of or not getting noticed for the good things that they do.
good,Left to be at home with my daughter . The pay was great if you put in your years but in the beginning the pay isn’t worth the stress of the job. There is also a lot of favoritism
good,Kroger sent us to Indy for 6 of a 12 week training period.  We went to their processing plants and stores and worked in every department in the store during that period.  Attention to detail was stressed and testing was done at the end of each week.  Test had to be passed to proceed further in the program  Manager candidates that I trained with were some of the best.
good,As a deli clerk you slice meat and cheese all day. Great for arm muscles. Management listens after awhile. make a name for yourself if you are wanting promotions.
good,I always loved my job but I wasn’t a fan of the environment. I generally get along very well with my coworkers however the management was subpar. I believe the current manager should not have been promoted to her current position because she doesn’t not handle stress well and takes it out on her employees.
good,It helps you get out into the real world. Shows you how to deal with difficult customers and hard to work with co workers. The managment team could use a lot of work.
good,"I barely have time to take a break, especially during the weekend, I was always forced to stay longer or called in on my days off because they were understaffed, or it got too busy and not enough people were scheduled. I stayed for longer than I should without taking a lunch break and I usually go without any breaks at all. I was also forced to go train for another department that I never intended to actually go work in."
good,kroger struggles to retain employees leaving other employees to pick up the slack and leaving 3 people to do 6 peoples jobs. the company claims pay raises of .25 every 6 months  possibly more but after talking to employees that had worked there for 2 years they are only making about $9 an hour.
good,Kroger is like a big family and we all look out for one another and I love that about my job. The management just plays favorites and I feel like I'm being singled out and its an unfair.
good,"I learned how to do a truck order, inventory.how to do a employee schedule. how to properly use a box cutter and how to cut meat.i learned how to clean the meat and cheese slicer at the end of my shift.i also learned how to talk to the deaf and blind.over all Kroger is a great place to work."
good,you hae to be very open minded and calm to work at kroger you have to have patince to be able to deal with the ups and downs of customers attitudes. Its not always bad.
good,"It is enjoyable some days. Very low pay. childish employees, will hire anyone off the streets. The stress is not worth the pay. but great management in some stores."
good,"Had such a low per hour salary I couldn't survive on. Has nice management and can be really fun, the work was ok it wasn't to difficult, just wish I had more hours."
good,"At the very least there were a few managers here that would listen to and understand their workers. As far as grocery store jobs go, that's one of the biggest things you can ask for."
good,"worked in several areas with Kroger. Clerk, Photo Manager to Drug GM assistant to Associate Relations Manager until they did away with position. If you were not union the company i felt did not value you and a person only a body to fill a void. What they offered in return after 14 yrs i felt was an insult. "
good,My experience there has shown me a lack of care from managers and higher ups. There is absolutely no work life balance. They consider you to be on there knee that life out side of there doesn't exist or matter.
good,The days were busy.  The management was awful.  Managers had attitudes all the time.  The coworkers were lazy.  The best part of the job was the customers who kept you encouraged.
good,"The hours that are provided to each department are lacking because of the higher ups giving each one a set amount of non-flexible hours which causes some departments to be either over staffed or understaffed as each week is not the same, so at times it can be stressful, and then at others it can be slow."
good,Its an okay job. I was very young and really forgot every detail about this job. I wouldn't mind going back and work for Kroger. I had a real good manager and great co-workers. The people are amazing.
good,This was a great job for when i worked here. I worked with Kroger over a year and i liked until we received a new manager whom always doubted i could perform my job properly. which i was one of the cashiers with the highest numbers on fast checkout and customer service.
good,The store will be understaffed sometimes and overstaffed rarely. Managers have different methods of running the store which makes the work environment unpredictable.
good,Customer friendly based stores very family oriented. knowing customers by name and face is a plus in my field of work that I do. customers always giving nice reviews and compliments. Management very helpful with all problems when given and dealt with immediately.
good,"fast pace job, good work environment, management is good and helps out when departments are short staffed. easy to work and learn the different departments."
good,I found that you had to adapt and work attentively while in a fast paced environment. I learned over the year I worked there how to deal with bad situations with customers and how to talk with some of the regulars. The hardest part about work was the hours standing for 5-7 hours without a break. I think the company I had made it more bearable and enjoyable as well.
good,"A decent company to work for, it is difficult to surmise my entire work time there in just a few words, but I would say that the work is so repetitive and can be quite demanding for very little extra compensation. The Union that I worked with was one of the best parts of working there to be honest."
good,The deli department prepared food for customers to purchase.  We would meet and greet customers with great courtesy while fulfilling their request.  All the employees had great working relationships as well as effective communication between us.
good,Lack of hours when scheduled. In order to get more hours you have to call in to the store every day to see if you can come in. There also were never enough baggers on shift and usually only three cashiers on the register.
good,It's a good first job for someone who is just getting into the world of working. Most people who work there are kind and ready to help you at any time.
good,I mainly had issues from school that conflicted with the job in which I had more stress on the job than I should have. This made it much harder to keep my grades up at school.
good,The uppers are not always on you back but you are expected to do you job. It can be rather busy and the lack of personnel makes that even harder to deal with
good,"Kroger Company is not a bad place to work, but it depends on the department you are working in.   The Deli is the most difficult and hectic place and very labor intensive but the staff is good and the manager at my store is excellent."
good,"understaffed and over worked, they care more about money than associates, terrible work/life balance, too many chiefs not enough Indians, no clear direction on how to work in new positions"
good,"Only problem was pay and not able to work full time hours, was being paid 8.25 and only able to work up to 30 hours a week or less due to too many people in the department"
good,Kroger is a family oriented company. Benefits are better than similar companies. Have worked for this company for nearly 10 years. Kroger prefers to promote from within.
good,It's a lot of work and the pay just isn't there. The only pro I've gathered from my experience is the flexibility in the schedule. You can set your own availability. That might not work with some managers though. I might have lucked out. I was there for a few years and still haven't been granted full time status. This is a major issue. My family needs good insurance.
good,"A work day at King Soopers was fairly stressful, as it was always busy with customers throughout the day. I learned that it is fairly easy to make the pay regardless of your effort put into work, so there was no incentive to necessarily 'work hard.' Management was fairly lackluster at some times but also exceeded expectations at others. The workplace culture was fairly inviting and friendly. The hardest part about the job was keeping up with the customers and dealing with the stressful points throughout the day. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to be myself and joke around throughout the day, due to the company being recognized as less corporate."
good,"I liked the custmers that shopped at the store . one of my dislikes with the company , is when being moved to a different store notice was like 1 day notice , plus did not give information on the location of the new location you were being sent to ."
good,"the days were long busy, stressful hours, the management could use some fixing, I learned to be independent cause the management was slack, the co-workers were friendly, hardest part of the job was trying to take restrooms breaks or get something to drink, management didn't like the idea of breaks, if you were new, people whos been there for then a year could do whatever and whenever they wanted. most enjoyable was the little breaks every 4-8 hours since there was hardly anytime off."
good,I learned a lot from management training program it was about 16 weeks when i went thru program. Upper management is more interested in feeling of hour staff and not concerned about store managers.
good,"coworkers were very helpful whenever needed help learning something new or understanding. pharmacist were very nice but had hard time loosen up, hardest part was customer service"
good,"Pretty easy job, didn't do much except stock shelves and clean counters. Work here if you need money, but I wouldn't recommend it for a life long career."
good,"In an overall view of any grocery company competition, low margins and markups necessitate a low operating ratio(wages as a percentage of revenue.  This means wages must be kept low.  Entry level and unskilled labor are a high percentage of your employees.  This poses a challenge to store management.  They can motivate and train this labor pool: or fail at both.  Directives and guidelines from District and Corporate Management can also hurt or hinder at the individual store.  What works for many or most stores will not likely benefit all.  Kroger as a Corporation, and the individual stores I worked at as a clerk for 16 yrs., and in Management for 4 years were fair, considerate and respectful.   Compensation was equal or better than most of the competition.  I started working for Kroger in 1981; quit in 2001.  Given the rapid change in Grocery retailing,  I feel a more recent evaluation would be of far better service to anyone considering employment at Kroger."
good,"I worked as a manager in the deli department. There was always a mountain of work to be done and not enough hours allowed to properly staff the department. I would have to open the department with only 2 people to not only prepare an entire days worth of food but somehow serve customers. Whenever a ""Higher up"" would come in the store management would scramble to call people in to help out.  This indicated to me that the management fully knew of the labor issues and only cared when someone was watching."
good,"Great starter job, pulled in carts and helped customers out to their car.My main job duties were to organize groceries in the bags most efficiently and quickly as possible."
good,One of the best parts of my job is blowing up free Kroger balloons and giving them to younger customers. Many of the customers tell me it makes their child's day.
good,Assisting customers was very enlightening. I learned to have patientce and tolerance with people. The management is fair. It is a friendly workplace. Multitasking was the hardest part of the job. Talking to customers was most enjoyable.
good,"Interacting with the customers. and cleaning the Fuel Center."
good,I worked at Kroger for over 10 years. It is a good company that seems to care about it's employees. They offer many benefits and room for advancement.
good,Kroger stores is a part time job for the benefits. It is very difficult to obtain full time status. staring out with Kroger start out with very low hours per week
good,The job I held at krogers was fun yet extremely fast passed at times. The biggest issue I had was scheduling seems like no matter how soon i let them know about changes they would always ignore my opinion.
good,"Kroger is an okay place to work. The benefits make the job appealing, since pay is sub par. The other employees make the job pleasant .  Since I was thrown on night shift, ( 2-10) I rarely saw the other leads or manager, as they all worked the early shifts , so I really didn't get the training I believe I should have. Most communications/ questions were addressed through notes."
good,"The work itself was usually fine. Not too hard to bag groceries and all the stuff that comes with being a bagger. Most of the people there were nice and friendly. The pay started off below minimum wage but got better the longer I worked there. "
good,"Kroger was my first job, so I earned how to wok under pressure and how to deal with customers. The customer service reps were eager to teach me how to perform there duties so that I could advance in the work place."
good,Was a great place to work until they started putting Co Managers with no exp in the job. They were not very mature and lacked the basic people skills need for the job.
good,for the most part i don't have anything really negative to say about Kroger the only thing with Kroger is they truly do not pay they're employees what they are worth
good,"I advanced as far as I could go, until I ran into management who would not work with me, regarding time management.  My takeaway from Kroger is to always double check everything. Management, and the union for that matter, will do what they can to pay you the least amount as possible.  All in all, Kroger is a great place to start or to supplement an income, but not a great place for a career."
good,"Worked during summer time when business was booming. Very fast paced, worked with many rude customers for little breaks and pay. Overall, good learning experience and many hours."
good,"I only worked in the mornings at the it felt as though we were really busy all the time, but it was really because there was only ever one other parcel and it was such a struggle to get through the day with only one other person for such a large store with so many responsibilities and things that had to be done before your shift ended, often times i had to stay 30-40 minutes past my shift and usually it was because my PIC told me that I was not allowed to clock out. Sometimes I'd stay to help out if things really were so busy."
good,"Courtesy clerk"" is a fancy name for ""grocery bagger,"" but it also came with other responsibilities, such as retrieving the shopping carts from the parking lots, returning grocery items customers changed their minds about and cleaning up various messes around the store."
good,"There's a fine line between Work/Life/Balance, sure the hours are on point when it comes to work life and how some employees are determined and nice to work with. Life, if you're part time it just depends at which store you're at and how busy they are you'll either be working 20-26 hours a week or you'll be up to 35 hours if you're at a busier store. Full time will be worked up to 40 hours a week and then some."
good,"loved the job and customers, not so much the management, easiest part was cashing customers out, hardest was the busy days and being under staffed or having to work doubles"
good,"I enjoyed the work environment, and my coworkers. It is a more relaxed atmosphere majority of the time. I mainly learned customer service skills and organizational skills within my positions at Kroger. Working part-time does not bring many benefits however."
good,It's okay some days and some days you can be great you can have great customer experience but during the holidays it gets a little stressful but all in all it was a good work experience
good,Fast paced customer service booth. Management was great especially Ms.Jospeh! Every day there was a new experience with customers. The most enjoyable part of this job was the customer care booth.
good,"The pay was minimum wage fro part timers but could be physically stressful with constant moving and being on your feet nonstop for 6 hours. The company penalized you if you wanted to unionize, which is always a negative."
good,"some heavy lifting, fast paced, holidays get busy as expected, steady through the year, ability to move through multiple departments, overall great place to work."
good,"The Kroger in my location wasn't all that bad to work for, although management had their favorites, they still see the potential in their workers. I was able to go from cashier to supervisor and was working on a assistant front end position before leaving. The only issue is, it took half a year for a pay raise when I was a supervisor, and there was no talk of another raise during my training to be assistant front end manager. I actually felt tricked. I didn't need training because I was already doing the job, just had a lack of pay. It was very unfair. Upon speaking on the matter, my hours were reduced to just two overnight days and one supervisor day a week."
good,"Current starting cashier rate is $10/hour and caps out at $15.35. Benefits for full-time employees are very nice, part time benefits are not as nice but still decent. Supervisors are usually friendly, and is an overall okay place to work, considering pay and benefits."
good,"I was employed at Northern Floral Center many years."
good,The environment is usually fairly slow paced but during certain times such as the evenings it can be more hectic. The benefits are good as well if you stay with the company for long enough. The major downside is the low wages but the benefits make up for them.
good,"Typical day at work would consist of preparing sales floor including stocking, discounting dated products, other duties entailed by typical grocery stores. Kroger does provide flexible scheduling."
good,It has its moments of being really stressful and it makes you go insane but the co workers were very helpful and were there. They were very understandable if family problems were going on but they did still have a store to run.
good,I learned a lot here and I've grown to love where I work and who i work with. I enjoyed some aspects of the job but the pay was not meeting what I did for every work day.
good,"An interesting company to work for, not sure it's currently going in the right direction that it needs to go, in order to maintain long term longevity."
good,"Effectively run the store to help increase profit, Learned a lot of management skills and how to manage everyone differently. Culture is about being overwork but is inclusive. The hardest part of the job is the long hours and not enough compensation."
good,Good job in small community. Company's priorities and pay are out of line. Good benefits. Great co workers. A lot of pressure on store management from the top.
good,It’s an ok job but the pay is pretty bad. It’s chill at times but can get hictic. The benefits are good and make up for being underpaid. Seniority sucks
good,"A typical day at work would involve me scanning, bagging, assisting customers with returns, purchases, and complaints. "
good,my first experience of working a paid job basically it and I don't regret it. Just trying to balance out work and school when I first got the job which was 16 years old.
good,Really enjoyed the company and the benefits but there was no work/life balance and that was difficult as a single mother of two children. I tried my best to make it work but it was just not in the cards for me!
good,"Working at Kroger is a good experience for the most part. It's very quick paced and collaborative. The management can be unorganized at times when it comes to giving workers break. In my experience, there have been a few rude managers. The customers are the best experience at kroger."
good,"At Kroger, I would unload inventory and then stock my department (Natural Foods). I was responsible for maintaining the natural foods department and assisting customers there. I also cashiered whenever the store was busy. All the employees at Kroger really had to work together and help each other out. I learned how to effectively work with others and I learned customer service skills. The hardest part of the job was putting up all the inventory that came in during the time that I had. I liked that the management trusted me and allowed me to direct others, work independently if i had to, and do whatever it takes to make customers happy."
good,Fred meyers produce was a terrible place too work. They lacked decent pay for over experienced employees. Did not give many hours. 9 years exp and I got 15-30 hours per week max. The management was some of the worst I've seen out of 6 different retail chains. They set extremely unrealistic expectations and goals inducing a very stressful work environment. Qfc produce was fantastic aside from low wages and poor book keeping. The overall management was the best I've seen. I never had less than 40 hours per week and they provided a friendly and mostly stress free working environment that put the customers and quality of work as top prioritys. Working for Kroger is a mixed bag experience.
good,At Krogers its really nice place to work put sometimes its not busy and sometimes its really busy. What I. learned from krogers is that it can be quick paced sometimes so that's what i learned from there. The managers were not that .nice to me I'm mean I very.am a very sweet and lovable person I had major respect for my managers but I didn't get that respect. I was hard worker there I always had a smile on my face i just did what i was told.The culture of krogers is that the company cares about there employees but managers are different story. The hardest part of the job was working with the floor scrubber machine.I had problems with it but cleaned floors real good.What I enjoyed krogers was my coworkers I really liked them.
good,"Very flexible hours, easy job, low pay. Can get stressful when their is only two cashiers during the busy hours. Only thing to do was memorize the fruit and vegetable numbers to have speedy checkouts."
good,"•	Offer product samples to help customers discover new items or products."
good,Being able to work well with others. Everyone understanding each and being able to work well with one another. Manager did a well job understading and trying to help there employees
good,"Exactly what you think, and what you would expect from a modern day grocery job, staff is friendly, work is constant and whatever department you are in there is always someone who will need some assistance. That being said, their moral compass on what is good customer care is always spot on!"
good,Communication was lacking because after 4pm all management left and we had to hustle not to incur any overtime and we were short staffed even though our department was the very life blood of the company
good,"kroger is a fine place to work, the people are really nice. they are willing to work with you on hours and can accommodate your schedule to your lifestyle"
good,the job is okay a normal day isnt to bad but when its busy day its crazy man they do over work you to be honest the management is okay they do give you your days off and stuff
good,I transferred to the Raleigh N.C. area store and I was disappointed that my pay went down 3.00/hr..and I was subjected to less scheduled hours and days due to the stores sales performance and location competition
good,I had no issues with the job itself other than management seemed to have no clue how to run the backstock and ordering so we were either out of stuff or had way too much
good,"Working in the pharmacy for Kroger is not worth the stress for what you get paid.  Instead of paying their experienced techs a better wage to stay, most people will work for a year retail and then leave to to go work at a hospital where the starting pay is a lot higher than working here."
good,"I work at the busiest kroger in the state. So, it's an environment that you either sink or swim. I flourish in these types of environments but not everyone does"
good,"It would be an okay fast pace day, we got all task done. We always made sure everyone was in ad out in nice timing and not having to wait in long long lines after they have been walking around shopping."
good,Working for Kroger is exhausting. The only position I was qualified for was Grocery Sacker and Cart Retriever. Summer is excrutiatingly hot and winter is cold and wet. Not an ideal part time job.
good,The best part of working here was the people. The company values customer service which is nice but have high expectations for follow through of new ideas without giving stores the tools to achieve it.
good,"Working at kroger is a decent first time job. My main issues included: the pay, the fixed hours, and the lack of communication between management and staff."
good,I learned that Kroger is highly positive place to come shop for your groceries. The associates and customers are friendly. The easiest part of my job was packing the groceries in the customers' cars.
good,"The job was great, great customers but the management could have been better. The job itself is great for very social people and can provide an environment for teen looking for work,"
good,"Until the store gets better management, it is not a very good place to work. The employees are great, but the pay is so low and with the management being so bad most people leave."
good,"i learn a lot in deli  was great but the management team was great, but when it came time for department supervisor it wasn't and hours was all over  the place as well as shift, never had enough hours there was no hard part of this job the employees was great and my training was nice just i didn't that they did not work with you for your work schedule and not enough hours"
good,The company started as TLCRx pharmacy continuing to grow and develop with the strong patient care and service until they merged with Kroger corporation.
good,"For a kid in high school who needs a bit of money for gas, it's not so bad. Management were kind enough, but they are still business minded. Overall it's not so bad."
good,It was my first actualpaid job as a teenager. I was a bagger at first and than promoted to a cashier. I truly enjoyed working with the public and being a cashier. It was a fun place to work but it was busy on the weekends and holidays. We were only closed for Christmas Day is all.
good,"I appreciated that they gave me a chance and the small advancement in like a month, but the pay was minimal. Managers were lazy and lacking knowledge of how to perform tasks in there own departments and rude. I was scheduled to work alone at times with no help and wrote up when I was unable to complete all the tasks that normally took at least 3 people."
good,"I worked in the bakery department as a summer job before attending culinary school, so this just gave me a chance to put my skills to the test in a professional environment. Only problem is they made me close up by myself when I was still new, and that work was definitely enough for at least two people."
good,Typical retail chain.  Management and policies change frequently.  People are nice but you are a number in the overall scheme.  Salary is comparable to other chains.
good,i started working here my junior year of high school and at the beginning of my senior year it was difficult for them to work with the schedule i was given and for that reason i chose school over having a job but i enjoyed my time there.
good,Enjoyable working hours with nice managers who are accommodating. Hard work which pays off in the end because great skills are are acquired through the work which is taught.
good,"Kroger is a ""fine"" place to work. Nothing is too difficult, and help is always a question away. The customer base is mostly friendly, and a joy to work for. The only issue I ever had was the pay, which seems like a small complaint but it isn't. Vacations take nearly forever to accumulate, raises are rare, and benefits are only offered to full time employees. It's very much a ""stepping stone"" job, but you could do much worse."
good,"Everyone was nice at Kroger Pharmacy, but it was hard for me to get started as a Pharmacy Technician in Training, because there were already so many others working there who had been doing the job for years. I also started at age 55 or 56, which is difficult to do when almost everyone around you is younger. In reality, it was totally my problem, so I left when I had to have surgery, so that my co-workers would be able to continue working with and training a younger person."
good,"There was a set pace, but things changed depending on who you worked with that day. I enjoyed working with some people, however when a couple people left I did not enjoy the atmosphere as much."
good,"its a Retail environment and the hours can be extreme, Holidays are the busiest time during the year. If you like to work in a fast paced environment than this is for you."
good,"A great beginner job, however very under appreciated. Learn many skills but never given the chance to move up. Co-workers are nice, everyone is always willing to learn."
good,Hardest job I've ever had. great management team and employees but very long work days and week(75+hrs). great management pay and benefits. only struggle is maintaning staff due to fast pace environment
good,"A typical day at this place is very busy. Most customers are ok. A few are obnoxious and snobby. Some are just abusive. This company really cares about customer service. They bend over backwards for customers, even when they really shouldn't. The hardest part of this job is dealing with idiots and spineless coworkers."
good,"The people in the department I work in are adults, clearly, but they act as if they're in high school. Workplace is great, people are crabby. And customers are first"
good,"There were pros and cons of working for Kroger, the hours and managers were terrible, the job stability was steady and promising though. There was lack of communication between everyone."
good,"Treaty fairly as an employee and pay scale was OK. The employment help me with see the real world and people by assisting customers of the store with locating inventory, the pharmacy, produce area, meat counter and specialty items."
good,My manager was great.  Pay is way too low. Many positions available in the store.  Cross training is available.  You have options to learn many things.
good,"Yea, The Job Was Wonderful Experience To Grow, Learn From As We Need As In Any Groceries Stores Around The Country We The Customers, Employees Everyone We Have To Eat! Lol"
good,This company was very competitive.  You had to compete with the other stores in the area.  You were judged on how your store performed versus other stores in sales and store conditions.
good,"I worked part-time there for almost 5 months. They give employees discounts on shopping sometimes for perfect attendance. Friendly staff, fast-paced environment, It gets pretty intense on weekends."
good,"I started off in the deli and there was a severe lack of training and active management. I ended up going around to more seasoned coworker and asking how things were done, writing up a list of procedures as I went (management said nothing about it, but started to use my papers for new hires because it worked and they could simply hand them a paper versus do their job). The ""training"" is basically sink or swim, follow by example and learn by your mistakes while trying not to upset the customers. And very fast paced, so watch your step on that slippery floor. That was the deli."
good,This job is -very- fast paced and can get very stressful.  It's a lot of work for the amount that they pay ($9/hr).  No benefits until 8 months into the position.  I easily walk a minimum of 15000 steps or more on each day I work.  My coworkers have made the job easier to take; if it weren't for them I would have quit long ago.  That said I'm still looking for other employment.  If you are ok with a very active/high pressure environment and just need some extra cash then this could be a decent position for you.
good,"Very structured routines daily."
good,"ClickList is highly demanding work. You are doing assembly-line type work and are under time constraints. The job is not all that bad as long as the workload isn't too much for the crew to handle. However, once behind, it is next to impossible to catch up and corporate does not seem to get it. Unlike the environment in the rest of the store, we have to be ahead of the demand or we will get behind in all aspects of the work. Late picking, leads to late delivery, which also leads to late picking with the next time-slot, and so on. In store dynamics may get busy for a time, but that does not cause a snowball effect, like ClickList does. Our OSATs are directly tied to how well we were able to manage the workload. Low OSATs used to translate to less allowable orders per hour, which allowed us to improve our work, which increased our OSATs, which, in turn, caused us to get unlimited allowable orders per hour. And, so the cycle would begin again. There is no sense of an understanding of the concept of a point of diminishing returns."
good,"I liked working as a cashier for Kroger, although I do wish I was given more than part-time hours. I would definitely recommend Kroger to anyone also enrolled in college looking for extra money."
good,The only good thing about Kroger was that the hours are flexible and they worked around my school schedule. The place is meant for high schoolers to work there honestly.
good,"It's a good place to work if you've had experience in retail before. If not it will be overwhelming, and a little frustrating. But good team members and management will make it better."
good,"This is a job that I do not recommend only if you want to make a decent amount of money. It is a hard job, but I do not get paid enough to do the things that I do."
good,The calls are very unpredictable but you must be on the phone 24/7. I would not recommend this job if you do not want to be at a desk all day. You must be able to handle stressful situations and be able to do a lot of internal research.
good,"Ok Job for students that want to earn extra money. Not many advancements in pharmacy, but in other areas. Don't promote advancement to all departments and areas."
good,The store has friendly workers and managers are fair. If you do your work and do not call out you will be praised. The hardest part of the job is keeping down theft.
good,"Co-workers are nice to work with.  Not a terrible job atmosphere.  Management is the worst, jump down your throat, lie to get you to work harder or faster, and don't know very much about how the store works."
good,"I work the days package meat is delivered, which includes weekends and I would prefer to work a job that does not require working weekend or work a rotating shift schedule. There is a lot of pressure to avoid working any overtime which is very hard to avoid in a retail environment.  there is not monetary reward working this job pay rates are locked in and only store managers receive bonuses. And because I’m very good at ordering and stocking product there is not much chance of moving to different departments unless I request working at different Kroger location."
good,A typical day involved standing on your feet at the register. The management is approachable and friendly. The culture is very relaxed. I would highly recommend.
good,Management only cares about themselves. Everytime I have went to them about an issue they brushed it off like it wasnt important. I even almost lost my job because I went to them about how the deli wasn't keeping up with health standards.
good,"I took this job in Highschool just for some extra money. It was a lot of fun since I worked down in the Fuel Station and basically studied on the job since there was absolutely nothing else to do. They moved me up to the store since I was only 16 and couldn't legally sell loto tickets yet but they still put me down there haha. At the store I absolutely hated it. Shifts seemed to never end, organization is a foreign term, and unless you suck up to the upper-level management, they don't even know who you are even if you are considered their best cashier."
good,They need some changes in the store. It’s an okay job if you are trying to get money. But sometimes they don’t give you the hours you need. I only got 12 hours a week and I needed abt like 20.
good,Good place to work if u like what your doing but they can force u to do something else that u really dont want to do getung carts off of lot all year round
good,"Fast paced and only stressful for management. Have to be willing to work with difficult employees, is the hardest part of the job. For non management positions it can be a fairly easy job but low pay, most people have more than one job because moving up to a higher position is stressful. The company does have good benefits which are worth staying for but not the pay.."
good,"I imagine if you work as a cashier or someone who stocks, you get better hours or pay. As a Florist it was only $7/ hour and I sometimes got maybe 7 hours of work each week. Yeah, not my kind of job. The job itself was very easy. Water flowers, blow up balloons, occasionally make bouquets."
good,"Not only will you be given your goals to achieve, but you will be ground down by the companies needs to be a multi billion dollar company, something I feel in the role of tech support you should not have to be oppressed with. Constant reminders of the financial goals of the CEO's."
good,Kroger has always been good to me. But the lack of competitive pay in my field and the inconsistent policy changes have driven me away. Most stores you work at have really great managment. Others are not so great. It feels like the only way to move up is about who you know.
good,Kroger is ok for those who want part-time jobs. They seem to be flexible but later down the road you either work what they want you to or you get no hours. The Union rules limit new employees from advancing and seniority rules not experience or work ethic. Management positions are very demanding and no family life.
good,"good company to work for, not a career , but not a bad place to start either. Good pay and flexibility. It is definitely a company you can grow with as well."
good,I would develop film and cleaned equipment and helped customers develop film at a kiosk. I learned How to shade photos and develop film and communicate with customers. My coworkers and management were friendly and engaging. The hardest part of my job was cleaning the machines. The most enjoyable part of working at Kroger were learning different shading techniques to add to photos.
good,I've been working for Kroger(ralphs) for over a year I started off as a bagger but got promoted 2 months later to replenishment. after 4 months of that they moved me up to a meat clerk and there I got more hours of course but they started to move the schedules to where I'm working 9 days straight and it'd be still legal because the pay stub report restarts on Mondays. I would have one day off a week and work straight through from a Tuesday to a Saturday the next week. At $11.10 from where I started at $10.10 isn't much of a difference especially since it is only a 10 cent raise per so many hours you put in.
good,"A typical day at work involves me sitting through meetings about sales and events promoted by the company. I stock items to the shelf, and about halfway through the day i run around scanning items to keep track of the items ordered and the items we need to reorder for the next delivery and the upcoming days. Overall, it does not feel challenging, and if i work alone it becomes a mind-numbing grind. However, my co-workers, as well as the customers, are normally pleasant and understanding when things don't go their way, making the day a little bit better."
good,Kroger is a great first job with opportunity for advancement. I currently work here and have no issues. The schedules kill you. There is no set schedule and it's hard to get used to.
good,"The job was fun and all and I worked with a lot of my friends. I worked my second semester of college (I took it off to work) and it was fun. The pay was what was bad. A 15 year old making 8.10 an hour on a 15 hour a week shift is fine, but a 19 year old trying to pay real bills, go to class, and have a social life while away at college is a whole different story. Only work here if you're offered a manager position (they make $15 plus) or if you're legally unable to do anything else. I suggest people between ages 14-16 who wanna do minimal brain numbing jobs and would be cool with making $100 a week."
good,You are expected to reach a production rate of satisfactory. But that poses a problem which pins employees against each other. Which makes employees to sabotage each other.
good,"I wouldn't suggest working here, even though it is not terrible, there are other places an employee could invest their time into. The management doesn't support their workers very well, and if you ever bring an issue to them or HR it will NOT get resolved."
good,"My work days were very fast paced on certain days."
good,"I enjoyed working here most times, the management is a bit hectic. The shifts I worked were with those of my age range so it made it a bit more comfortable."
good,Not the best management around. Corporate (and therefore store level) management expect a great deal alot of their stores (understandable) but at the store level there is always a shortage of workers (and therefore a lack of morale).
good,Enjoyed working here as a first job out of college.  Leanred much about how to run a business as each store operates as an independent unit.  Long work hours for little pay.
good,"Busy retail clinic, rapidly expanding scope of service. Management in constant transition.  Need to be able to adapt to frequent changes in process. Very similar to home town doctor since patients stop in to just say hi ."
good,"Kroger, in my opinion, is probably my least favorite job I have had. While it's not hard by any stretch of the means as it usually involves just stocking product, it holds no real beneficial future for me. Management there is fair, but also very picky (almost like they trust you to do your job correctly). Also, the place is unprofessional in the sense that no one seems to want to learn stuff and rely on managers or others for help or answers. And the scheduling is very loose, in both that they are flexible to you, which is awesome, but never seem to be fair on hour, which isn't awesome. The hardest part about Kroger is just learning the store, which will take about 4 days of just being there. Overall, its super chill and not hard at all. Within a couple of days you are able to just slide through the shift without any real problems."
good,"Great pay and benefits.  Long hours and mandatory overtime.  No work/life balance, worked every weekend and several ""clopens""(close then open next day).  Since I was salary I did not get regular breaks/lunches."
good,It is just a job. I thought the atmosphere was fun. It may be the perfect place for teenagers or college students working their way through school. I would not recommend this long-term. Advancement is slow here. It is also non-existent for those without a college degree.
good,"Kroger has good benefits, working retail sometimes can be difficult. "
good,Not a great place but it was a great first job. Got a lot of useful tips on what not to do in a job and good benefits. Very lenient and a great introduction into the real world.
good,Kroger is a good place for a summer job you also get to meet all different kinds of people. Over all i have been working there for 9 years and like most jobs u have good days and bad days.
good,There are certain things that make this place not a great place to work but then there are other aspects that make it an awesome place to work.  Just depends on which store you are at and the management
good,"Kroger is a great place to work if it was strictly dependent on your coworkers and management. However as an overall company I would have to say no unless you are a young teenager still living at home and mom and dad pay your bills. For single moms trying to be the sole bread winner its a definite no."
good,I worked as a barista for a very limited time. What I did see at the time was that it was confusion on who was in charge of the kiosk due to lack of consistent management.
good,Kroger was my first job as a teenager and it was a decent experience. A typical day at work was customer service and making sure the work area was in a representable order.
good,"This job was excellent with working with school schedules, vacation time and benefits. The last couple of years, the management at this location became very unprofessional with little regards to associates schedule's and short staffed in every department. The store in my opinion went from 4.5 stars to 2 stars within a year. The company was great but managers were not as qualified as the ones before."
good,Kroger is a good place to work. You get to meet lots of people and can gain a lot of experience if you show interest in doing so. The managers I work with are very friendly and are willing to do what they can to help you move up if you express a desire to grow with the company. We also offer scholarships to workers who are interested in furthering their education.
good,"This place was decent for a part-time job, sadly their advancement system to earn higher pay was awful. Employees were constantly forced to be put in situations without appropriate compensation. This wouldn't have been an issue if it didn't reoccur on a daily basis."
good,"Opportunities for growth and development. I enjoyed working in the meat, wine, bread and receiving departments. The company provided continuing education and Certification."
good,Kroger was a great place to work to pay my way through college. I think the pay could've been better but it was enough for me to pay bills and rent while I was in college. They do offer great benefits once you are a full time employee
good,Work in an Accounting Center.  I work with Retail Stores with Different Departments.  Also process payroll for the entire company.  I enjoy the flex scheduling that allows me to work more hours one day to work less another day if needed.  The Company is going through an adjustment period as they offered early retirement for associates on the administrative side.
good,"Being able to decorate cakes and help with deli was quite fun, employees and managers were understanding and helpful. Would recommend for anyone crafty."
good,"This was not the worst job you could have but it was not the best job either. Management was not great, they didn't care about their employees. In store transfers were impossible."
good,"Being at Fred Meyers for 3 years plus really has change. I am going to say what is happening now with the company. It is alright. It is not what used to be and management has gotten bad. If you can survive dealing with bad managers, but you're a great worker go for it. Most of the customers and coworkers are nice and friendly. Any job there comes with great benefits which can be apply at the Union. In all serious, just apply and do your best."
good,"I have been worked there many years.. I would like to working with them again. I have been doing cashier, maintenance, courtesy clerk of many  years. 😊"
good,depending on what's going on it can be a good day laid back but just a lot of walking and lifting. the people that comes in is enjoyable. just making sure everyone is on the same page.
good,it is an okay job I do not work for any of Kroger's actual stores but a tourist attraction that is under Kroger management. they do a really good job of being flexible but I do not think that the pay for my department reflects the pay of other departments in the company
good,"Always picking up the slack of others, over worked and under paid, the daily morning huddles were nice breaks and good if I had yet to eat that morning, seven min grace saved me plenty of times, willing to work with schedules"
good,It was okay but nothing to write home about. The front end was terrible but working in a department was somewhat enjoyable in my opinion. Id only recommend this job to someone younger getting at first job.
good,"I was only with the Kroger Company for a few short months, but I mostly enjoyed my time there. The job was not too stressful, and apart from having to stand for long hours without being allowed, to sit, it was not so bad. The management was polite and willing to listen to your complaints and help you talk through and problems you may have had."
good,"This is a good start job but you do not advance very far, seniority means nothing when you are trying to move up. I was there 3 1/2 years and i did not move up from where I was even though i was one of their best employees."
good,"Everything from writing schedules, stocking, writing grocery orders, planning, and overall well being of the store."
good,"A typical day at work for me was just working as a team to quickly and accurately unload trucks and stock products on shelves and condition shelves before customers entered store. I learned more about impulsive sales while working with this company, and I also learned how to use a power-jack, high-loader, and RF unit. Management at my store seemed to be lacking in authority and work ethic."
good,Me personally I would not work there again. It was too much for me After I left there were new people already there and some of my old coworkers I did not see again.
good,"Typical days were spent in front of a computer like a robot, I learned that Kroger has a lot of stores, employees are ok, the hardest part of my job is dealing with dysfunctional computer systems and the most  enjoyable thing about my job is that I got paid for it."
good,Kroger is a fast pace company that expects 110% from their employees.. They are a company that  wants thier employees to advance in environment of thier own training this a big part of kroger. They also want thier employees to accept changes.
good,The benefits are good as far as incurance. The opportunity for advancement is minimum. The pay is not competitive for the position compared to the competition.
good,It was a good place to work at this location.  It was a job.  My supervisor and store manager were good to work for. I don't feel I need to say more.  I hope this helps.
good,"This was my first job as a high school student, and it was good for the experience. I gained several skills and I learned about workplace goings-on. However, I encountered dilemmas. Many of my coworkers were pleasant, but it was clear they did not want to be there. Employees sometimes did minimal tasks or tried to appear busy whilst avoiding work. As a high school student, I was only supposed to work a certain number hours each week. This increased during the summer break, but didn't return to normal after classes started again. The scheduling manager did nothing to help the situation and I kept getting scheduled more and more hours after I brought it up."
good,This job is good with it's benefits for the most part but they almost never hire anyone for full time. It's a good job for someone who has flexible hour and is okay working only part time with no advancement.
good,Kroger Technology is very focused on culture and improving it.  Kroger Technology is a wonderful place to work... Unsure about the other side of the business.
good,"alot of kroger stores are the same, so most likely its the company.  managers get stressed because of their bosses and takes it out on employees.  also the stores never have enough workers in certain departments and employees are worked harder than what they are getting paid. alot of employees go without taking lunches to cover up the missing hours,"
good,"The management at Kroger was horrible, they left me at the cash register my first day of training and expected me to know what to do after only 30 minutes, and got upset when i would ask for help."
good,Kroger isn't the worst place to work and a lot has probably changed since I worked there years ago. Needless to say its an okay entry level position. Not much more to say about it.
good,Work is easy but boring and not much room for growth. Recommend for High school students but not college students or people that want a career. Pushing carts in the rain is the worst.
good,I liked the company. It is part of a union so therefore it is a little harder to move up. There is job security because of the union. The union makes it hard to move up or terminated. This company is perfect for first time employees.
good,"Long hours and always short staffed, not a very good ""teamwork"" environment. Achieving full time benefits was a difficult task. The pay was good. Not very structured and clean."
good,i would be busy most of the day. there was always something to do. i worked the garden center a couple of summers and learned about plants. also worked bakery and became a cake decorator. being able to get everything done . decorating cake.
good,"On feet all day, tend to come home smelling musty, work alone at points for up to 5 hours depending on schedules. Fast-paced during the winter season/holidays, very slow on other days during the summer/off-season."
good,"I like working at Kroger. It gives me the chance to meet new people and learn new attitudes. I am able to practice about learning the way money works. For example, people can always learn how to count because often we do miss count."
good,I learned a lot about stress and working at a team with King Soopers and the workplace culture seemed to be a friendly one as not only would both baggers and cashiers communicate about what they do outside of work with both customers and themselves but everyone seemed willing to help others out and do whatever task was needed at the time be it providing propane or assisting a register so a bagger can help an older couple bring their bags out. The environment seemed friendly and cooperative.
good,Good company to work for other than horrible pay wages. Offers benefits even for part time workers. Management can be good at times.  Claims of having competitive earnings proves to be false.
good,"This is a job good for 16 year olds looking for their first job to get customer service experience, but does not have expensive bills to pay. There are lots of chances to move around and pay rate increases at non-union stores."
good,"typically see 15-40 patients.  work every other weekend and holidays. Great health benefits but overworked.  Expanded scope of practice, work autonomously."
good,"Kroger does not offer competitive pay. They do  not give managers enough hours to schedule for the needs of the business, which causes stress on the employees to try to get the day jobs done in half the time"
good,In my opinion this job really depends on who your management is bad managers= the job being ten times more difficult than it actually is also the location of the store.
good,"This job was both simple and easy, however the physical strain and extreme weather in Spokane made the job difficult at times. This job also had an constantly changing dynamic of business. During the day and on weekends business was high, but working nights was generally not busy."
good,"its an ok job, fast paced and almost jumbled with duties. it a good starter job for someone still in high school. the management can leave something to be desired but that may have changed since i worked there"
good,"Would be much better if they paid employees more. The work place culture is great. The hardest part of the job, is dealing with impatient customers. Customers become very angry when they have to wait in lines."
good,Being able to help people enjoy their shopping experience. Main part of the job is keeping product on the shelves for the customers and assisting them to find what their looking for.
good,"Working on the front end guarantees you less hours. We hire tons of cashiers and schedule them for 4 hours shift twice a week, and wonder why our customers complain how slow our lanes are. I love the company and I have several regulars I consider myself friends with, but they're not too good with scheduling enough people for shifts. The hardest part of the job is when I have to do two peoples jobs at once (cashier and courtesy clerk)"
good,Paperwork daily visits unannounced pointing of finger fill fill fill does not approve on real world vision shopped. Division office expects  grand opening standards daily.
good,this was my last job before i went to school at universal technical institute. i worked the morning shift an never had any problems with the staff or management. a typical work day would be cleaning the produce area restocking vegetables an prepping. the most enjoyable part was the customers.
good,"The coworkers are very friendly and they help you out if you need it. Get paid weekly, easy jobs. You get good hours as long as you prove that you are going to go to work and not miss many days."
good,"can change based on anything. Grocery retail can be brutal, but it can also be rewarding. Getting to know associates/customers is the best part of the job. The most difficult part of the job is finding the balance between work and life, especially in management."
good,"Kroger was a nice place to work at, but however some of the Kroger employees can be hateful. I learned hoe to greet customers at Kroger. The management was somewhat decent, but it can be improved."
good,Me personally I would not work there again. It was too much for me After I left there were new people already there and some of my old coworkers I did not see again.
good,The store has taken care of me since I started and look forward to moving up the ladder.I have a detailed job list that needs to be done weekly which helps keep you organized.
good,Kroger has some good employees and managers but some managers didn't know how to address employees properly. They also weren't very good with the schedules. My schedule change quite often which i didn't mind too much but when i requested one day off with a 2 week notice they said it was fine but then they scheduled me still.
good,"More of a place for growing friendships, not getting down to business. There is a lot of goofing off from both the employees and the managers. Fun, if that's what you're looking for, but not productive."
good,"I absolutely love my Kroger store at #391 but I am looking for more advancement and pay.  Everything is great, only two poor things are pay and lack of communication between corporate and stores."
good,"I spent nearly 2 years working with Kroger off and on. As a 20 year old I was hired, it was my first job so I didn't expect much, but, quickly I was moved from a courtesy clerk into doing important tasks for the grocery department and, every department, actually. My pay was not increased at all, though my job was very important. $7.25 an hour, 30hrs a week. That is not livable. Even a small promotion did not give me a livable income. It's virtually impossible to work for this company and SURVIVE without assistance or seeking out much higher promotions."
good,Slow paced and low volume. Lots of time to counsel patients on over the counter products. Store environment is great. Pharmacy management and leadership could use some fine tuning.
good,high turnover employees getting fired for no reason i used to work there and they fire me due to a bad customer i wish they would work with me insteed of against me
good,My position was a time restrictive job. Deadlines had to be met on a daily basis. It was both challenging and rewarding.  I truly enjoyed my job. The management was always helpful in all aspects of the daily operations of the company.
good,"The management was okay, but the schedules were poorly maintained. I learned how to bag correctly and scan items at a faster speed. I felt the hardest part of the job was working with minors. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I talked to all the friendly customers."
good,"Kroger is your typical, run-of-the-mill grocery store.  It's a great place to work, but, like any company, has some drawbacks.  The payscale isn't competitive when compared to similar companies (i.e. publix, walmart, target).  Management, in my experience, is  supportive of employees, especially if you display great work ethic. Lots of opportunities for advancement as well.  Overall, a decent company.  I feel like the major thing keeping their turnover rate high is the payscale."
good,"No comment....good opportunity. Good work environment. Incentives, Good benefits Management is fairly knowledgeable and training and learning resources are available."
good,"The management was good and I learned how to work with others very well on communication. The usual work day would consist of getting them a few minutes early, preparing your cash register for customers, ringing up customers and making sure they have everything they needed. The hardest part about the job was the customers who would have a bad day and take it out of the workers like it was there fault but it was also the most enjoyable part when you could make them smile on such a bad day."
good,"I have no complaints on the pay & benefits, but this was not the environment for me. If you care about what you do and are observant you will not like what you see. Too many in leadership roles with attitude and frankly don't belong in those roles."
good,"Shifts were usually not difficult, but holidays were stressful. I learned good techniques for stocking, customer service, and backroom organization. Department managers were friendly and easy to get along with, and were willing to work with you. Upper management was a nightmare however. Co-managers were usually alright if you talked to them and were respectful. Store manager on the other hand was more often than not rude and difficult to interact with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with upper management. The most enjoyable part was working with a great group of people on my shift that I had synergy with."
good,"Basically, I go into work, clock in. From there I may be asked to bag or cashier or ""go on lot"" which is our way of saying cart collecting. The atmosphere of the place is very boring. Slow most of the time but nonetheless tolerable. I've been there for eight months and have had my supervisors ignore me promotion wise. The whole company is said to be buoy of seniority but that's lies. HEB is better."
good,"It really depends on the location to form an overall opinion, but in my main area, I had a very enjoyable experience! I loved almost ALL my co-workers and loved my manager and district adviser! Usually jobs always present and hold an impersonal environment, but Kwik Shop did not. Even though snotty customers were an absolute pain, it's worth having great people to share that with."
good,"While working for Kroger I was really mistreated. I had to go out on medical terms and the managers got mad about my health issue because my doctor took me out of work. Due to this issue, I was not allowed to work because of doctors orders. When deciding to return back to work, they acted as if they didn't want me to return. After this, I resigned."
good,I worked in the floral department doing large shipments 2 to 3 times a week along with large out door shipments. I made arrangements both floral and balloons. Keep work area clean at all times. Cleaned all buckets 2 to 3 times a week and kept them stocked with fresh product. ( flowers ) I assisted customers with orders and when they paid for arrangements. Worked in produce department when needed to cut and package fresh fruit. Also customer service as needed ( bagging groceries )
good,I am a people person I love working with the public. I was able to pick my hours and we had paid vacations 4 weeks . And 5 personal days . But standing on my feet for 8 hours a day was getting tough . We were not aloud to sit . So I had to retire it was getting tough standing that long. I hated to leave . I loved my job and my customers.
good,"A typical day at work was very organized and easy to handle. I learned a lot about customer service at this job, I was able to interact with people from all different walks of life including my coworkers and the guests. The management was great, they were very personable and made scheduling very easy and work fun. The hardest part of the job was lifting heavy boxes of product. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to interact with customers and make conversation."
good,Mariano's is a diverse place and has a good team. I work as a cashier for 1 year. The hardest part of my job is that they don't motivated us to continue working.
good,"Typical day would be to clean pumps and aprons, stock merchandise, assist customers with pumping fuel.  Management was very seldom present, so there really was no problem.  Workplace culture was finding a better job; since I was retired, another job was not on my mind.  Hardest part of the job was hearing others conplain..  Enjoyed being complimented by customer."
good,"Good company but greatly silo'ed  As hard as they try the departments do not work hand in hand to accomplish the same goals.  "
good,I worked at Kroger while I was in school so I was just part time. The pay was low but it made up in flexible hours and a fun and friendly work atmosphere.
good,"Mostly fun group of associates to work with, ability to learn things to gain more hours to become full time employee is great. Being able to make things right for a customer is nice.  ability to transfer location process takes to long and distance   issues are not right. Is a union store making it hard to fire anyone but pay is low for required work"
good,"The average day of work as a Meat Clerk at Kroger involves a sometimes stressful juggling game of putting product onto the shelves and assisting customers at the meat/seafood customer service desk. Sometimes putting product onto the shelves involves processing items beforehand. Certain meats have to be cut before displaying, and some pre packaged products must be weighed up and tagged before displaying."
good,"He was good at first, then he became to be very rude."
good,I enjoyed working for Kroger. When they closed down Kroger west I decided to look for different work. I had no idea where they were going to place me. I needed to make more money then what I was making as a single mother and the raises were/are only a nickel a year. You got vacation time after one year but no more than one week or 4 days
good,"I work in the produce department and it's pretty labor work, but it's not hard. Hours can be what you want as long as you discuss them with your manager. Management isn't great. They are more worried about barking orders at you than actually helping. Break room is nice and has a tv. Customers are generally pretty decent."
good,"Went through the management training program, but do not think it was as thorough as it should have been. It is a learn by day process and people within the company says it takes about a year to feel comfortable in your position."
good,It is a good place to stay if you intend on being at the same place 40 years without any kind of degree. The benefits are good and the pay isnt the worst ever. and if you find a group of people you like to work with then it can be fun. AVOID GROCERY
good,when i started it was a good place to work but declined overtime.. i stock a heavy amount of freight. but sometime the time they want it to be done can be a little stressful. i enjoy working with some co-workers and some i dont. i learned alot working in larger market stores and got the feel of it in a timely but subtle fashion
good,"They expect a lot from their store managers. There is very little support at store level. They use a conference system, to counsel employees. It is constantly held above employees heads that they will be termed instead of coached. I received little coaching, it was more like a threat. Staffing never really improves, so managers are left working a lot of hours. Although I had several weeks of vacation every year, I was not able to take them. We are not reimbursed for lost vacation, and the turnover never really allowed you take it. "
good,Management is poor. Have to ask for more hours all the time and still don't get them. Not enough time to get all the things done that need to get done and it really shows.
good,"Most of the employees are nice, most others do not really pull their own weight. I worked in multiple departments which helped the days go by pretty quick and gave me knowledge about the store. a typical day was basically stocking the departments and doing what the manager or department head has asked of you to do. what i had difficulty with was trying to get all of my work done while short-staffed without using overtime. I liked that they were very understanding and they were very lenient with breaks."
good,"great team members"
good,It's an okay place to work but you're expected to do the work of 3 for just minimum wage. You're in a union that doesn't do anything for you.
good,When I worked at Kroger I was a Courtesy Clerk. I pushed carts and bagged groceries. The management was pretty sneaky and the co-workers really didn't associate at all. We pushed carts no matter what the weather was and the management did not care. I'd rather have been a stocker or at the register. Courtesy clerks aren't worked well at all.
good,"Its an alright place to work, the main reason I am leaving is because I can't work standing up all day (back problems). You don't make a lot of money, but it's better than nothing. Most of my coworkers and managers are really nice and they all say hi to me when they see me. The guy who runs the store is a really nice dude. The customers are nice and friendly, and the atmosphere is good."
good,good management fun job nice co- workers easy job very family like good vibe hard working people customer friendly paid every week on time just a very laid back place
good,Works well with personal life. Contributes to progressing through their advanced positions quite well. Managing life and career can be decent here.
good,"Working with Pick N' Save has taught me how to work in a fast paced environment. It also taught me how to be independent, solve problems on my own, and create good relationships with my co-workers. The hardest part about my job, was the job itself. Any shift on any day was hard work. But the most enjoyable part is going home early when you've completed all of your work."
good,Another reason why i quit was that they did not know how to respect customers which was the #1 priority.The service was horrible to the point where most of the works quit rather then staying there.
good,Typical day at rulers is being able to work at a fast and steady pace to get what you need to get done and to also satisfy customers.
good,Decent place to work and the work is far from being tough. It was great getting along with all the customers and being a help to them . Managers are extremely good people and made you want to come everyday
good,"Great company to work for, lots of good quality people. No day was ever the same and learned so many aspects of the company, inside and out. Management were a joy to work for and was happy to assist them in any way possible. Thoroughly enjoyed my co-workers and relish the friendships I have made. In my department, I frequently saw only the bad, which does make it difficult at times. Once again, the camaraderie and life long friendships."
good,Good company with excellent benefits. Take advantage of ALL opportunities..Advancement opportunities for Managers are usually far and few. There is always movement of people. Seems none of The Co. Managers like their job...very unhappy group..
good,If one is willing to learn and work hard one will enjoy the job. Not much free time as so short staffed. Management are fair. Training is mostly done on computer. on the job learning.
good,I enjoyed my job with Kroger very much. I worked many different departments in the store and cross trained myself to the fullest. Being able to help with customer's issues and problems and training and supervising many coworkers was the highlight of my job.
good,Kroger employees were like another family to me. Friendly but the actual company pays very little especially to what Kroger employees have to  give. High quality but poor pay
good,"I started as a cashier, and then worked in the produce department from there I worked as a grocery clerk. I worked at the same store all those years."
good,"Management constantly shifted"
good,"Kroger is a small grocery store on the corner of Bluegrass and Mission and despite its non-threatening appearance, this place will consume you. Management is bearable, there are three store managers. The youngest, you will undoubtedly love. The oldest male will annoy you and the middle-aged female will drive you insane. However, the co-workers can make it all worthwhile. There are some exceptional individuals employed at Kroger and you should consider yourself lucky if you are offered the opportunity to meet them."
good,"I learned a lot of valuable product knowledge from this company, as well as the ins and outs of ordering on a grand scale...and not much else."
good,"Good job. Pay could be alot better "
good,"I did not enjoy my experience at Kroger. It was not the company, it was the tasks that I had to perform, in combination with management. I was the deli clerk/store conditioner. I was responsible for cleaning the deli/bakery area, which includes cleaning the oven, pots and pans with raw chicken remnants, and the deep fryer. Not only did I not enjoy these tasks at all, my manager was not too fond of me since the first day I got there. She would tell me to do one task, then when I would do it she would say I was performing it incorrectly then go to the store manager, instead of teaching me the proper way to perform the task. The store managers caught on to her eventually, and I was properly trained soon after."
good,"Kroger offers several opportunities for advancement, especially for dedicated employees.  I have been able to be promoted 3 times in the 5 years that I have worked there.  If you don't mind long hours and working evening and weekends, it is a great, inclusive company to work for."
good,Kroger was the typical workplace. The work expected was achievable and the environment was a normal work place. Overall it's a safe career choice.
good,"A typical day at work includes:"
good,Kroger is a great store. it is hard to move up. In addition they do not pay enough I work at the front service desk and I'm only getting paid 7.80. In addition they dont give you a raise when you move up to supervisor in the front end.
good,low level management is constantly moving and dealing with numerous aspects of job. fun people to work with and competitive pay and benefits.
good,working at Kroger was my first actual job. what my job consisted of was communicating with others and pushing carts also cleaning. a typical day at krogers for me would driving there clocking in and getting down to work. i would sometimes start on carts. then go to register
good,"Simple once a week cleaning job. Wipe down surfaces, dust, vacuum, mop. Clean bathrooms, empty trash. Learned the importance of keeping a workplace clean and organized."
good,The job was okay. some of the worker are lazy and complained a lot. It was hard to get a manager to come to the fuel center when there are customer requesting a manager and don't want to drive up to the store.
good,"I can honestly say it is the best job I had thus far even though there are difficulty sometimes. I can say that daily tasks are not that difficult. There should be more focus on training though. It can also be hard to move up the ladder such as becoming a full-time employee. The most enjoyable part about working at Kroger are the nice regular customers. Different conversations with them really make my day. Employees can be fine to talk to, but its sometimes best to keep personal information to yourself since people sometimes gossip."
good,"Great environment to work in, especially for those looking to get their first job. Training is hands on with someone who holds the same position as you the day officially start the job. Allows you to learn how to work with others, whether coworkers or customers, because of the high volume of traffic no matter what location you are at. Overall a good job that anyone can do."
good,The job was fairly easy and the co-workers were very friendly. My job task was to stock the shelves when they were emptied. Management was very friendly.
good,i spent alot of time working or them. those years helped me through my classes. they worked with my school schedule. i was able to work multiple positions.
good,"hard to give customer one on one attention with such a hard and heavy workload."
good,"Working here was an interesting choice for me. Customer Service was easy for me but to some of my other coworkers, they could've done better. In the front end, a lot of the cashiers are high school students, so their level of maturity isn't up to par in customer service standards. Being in a union is a positive trait I liked because it did seem that I had a voice for change. Management was ok but I wish things could be better. Pay wages and rate of raises could be way better, but the benefits are ok. Overall it was an ok experience for me."
good,"Working as a pharmacy technician is a challenge. I moved to the pharmacy in January 2015 and had to learn our computer systems, insurance policies, and more very quickly.  I have learned to become patient and understanding when it comes to customers and their situations. I would consider myself excellent at customer service. The hardest part of my job would be having to work 12 hours straight on my feet. I enjoy helping customers save money by finding coupon cards for their medication when time allows and also listing to the ones who don't get to get out often and just need someone to talk to."
good,This is a great part-time job. Flexible and easy to maintain as long as you do your job. Heavy in customer service and quite fast paced at times.
good,Working with Kroger is a great work experience. I have become better with understanding the needs of the customers and communication with customers.
good,This is a good place to work for someone in high school. Every store is different though. Some managers are great and the store runs good and others not so much. It is a very low paying job unless you can get on full-time and that takes years before you are able to get on there and it still isn't the best money but that's what's least expected for a grocery store.
good,"Kroger has wonderful benefits, but was not a place where i want to stay and make a career out of. I want to move on, I want to do something different. Earn a living."
good,"This job is very difficult to maintain a work and life balance due to inept management, as well as questionable workplace sanitation procedures."
good,"For those working in the lower brackets (eg. cashiers, general clerks etc.) work days are relatively easy going, although, depending on the attitude of the management on duty at the time, can be long and unnecessarily difficult. This of course is entirely dependent on the stress of the situation concerning the 'rush' of customers during certain hours of the day, and the individual moods of the managers present. "
good,What can I say? Its a retail position. The days can be easy or hard. Depends on the time of year. Holidays get busy and demanding of your time. Not a great work/life balance for management in my opinion
good,"Kroger was an overall good place to work. The management was very understanding cooperative and, respectful with employees."
good,Work started off good at first . But i feel like there was people who was stealing money from the store . The managers did not care . I learned a lot there as in working in customer service and also running U scan. My co workers was hard workers and did they job . The only thing that i didnt like was the managers .
good,"If you like to bake bread, decorate cakes and work with customers, then this is the place for you. The hardest part of this job is meeting deadlines while working short handed."
good,"Was a good company to work for. It was a high intensity environment that was physically and mentally demanding. Personnel was union and management was not, which created some challenging obstacles to overcome."
good,"A typical day at work included being responsible for the other employees taking their breaks and keeping up with store maintenance, providing customer service, answering phones and making sure the customer gets a fast, honest answer, processing returns and issuing refunds, count down the tills for the day, report if there is an overage or shortage of money and making sure to keep a friendly working environment. From my work experience I have learned to deal with customer complaints in a friendly, professional manner and doing my best to resolve the situation for them. My co-workers were always very nice and the management was always willing to listen to problems that surfaced and did their best to work with you to fix it. The hardest part of my job would have been the few angry customers but you always have to have a smile on your face and do the best job you can. The best part of my job was also the customers because one friendly person can make up for a whole day of negative ones."
good,"You will not learned anything. Its easy money but. The more you work is the less you get, vice versa. Great coworkers but no real friends you can make there."
good,"My typical day at work was decorating cakes for orders, making cupcakes, cookies, pies and bread. "
good,Typical day at work is fast paced. Ruler works on an extremely tight budget for employees to keep prices low. I enjoyed getting to know different types of people.
good,"fast paced, interactions with many different types of people, patience, basic math skills, friendly coworkers, knowledgeable staff, reward staff for hard work"
good,"My experience of working at Fred Meyers is; it is a place to learn and grow with the company if that is what one chooses to do. Other than that, Fred Meyers is a great place to work depending on job title. I did work the during the day, but working at night. It was boring, and lonely. No one talked with you, and especially since I was the Lot Attendant, and the In-store security guard, however I was not taught the role of a loss prevention specialist."
good,"A typical day for me was typically the same, stocking product, having to move some product around. Helping customers as needed, even having to go around the store to get what needs done."
good,"Work is a little monotonous if you let it be but that is the gist of any retail job. My days consist of bagging with a smile and small errands when asked. The rest of my responsibilities were gathering and or organizing carts, minor cleaning/housekeeping, and sorting and returning misplaced items. The hours are alright and the pay is non-competitive so expect the minimum. They work on a seniority system, so if you want to move from the starting point of bagging and you don't have history doing any other jobs in the store you have to wait a few months. The most difficult part of the job is dealing with ornery customers and standing for long periods. The best part of the job is probably your fellow workers and the mostly easy going work environment."
good,"A good beginning job while I was finishing up my degree at ITT in Barboursville WV."
good,"poorly managers, great benefits, work balance is great if you are full time, mostly work all holidays, need better help with part timers, too much turnover with part time employees, then it all falls on full time techs who are already overworked"
good,"It is a grocery store, so it is always busy. I made a lot of friends that I still talk to today. Management changes all the time, so some are laid back while other aren't. The hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers."
good,I enjoyed working with the different people who come in. Pay was not all that great to start out at $7.75. Union dues come out as soon as you start but your not in it until 3 months have past.
good,"very good benefits,flexible hours,very high paced environment,great customer base,limited advancement,only if they like you,not job performance,"
good,easy work with minimal labor involved. Its minimum wage but you'll have some pocket money for the week. best for people looking for part time work.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the customers. I love helping them if they need help finding something. I've learned how to be more customer friendly.
good,"This was my very first job and I enjoyed working there until, the assistant manager started harassing me in a bad way, And when I reported him; the manager transferred me to another store, I was humiliated, After being transferred; the store laid me off and closed,"
good,"I have been with the company for quite some time and unfortunatly, I  did not enjoy my time there. The working environment was not the best and I did not feel like apart of the team, more like a number."
good,I meet different people a day and i am able to show my customer service skills each day i am scheduled to work. I enjoy working afternoon hours because i meet more people then.
good,Coming together to create great results anytime in the work place. Management demonstrates great customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job had to be the smiles on the customers face knowing they were satisfied.
good,Good place to work.Fast growing industry and benefits are great. I do not wish to disclose any more information on the Kroger Company.
good,"Great team to be apart of. The company knows what they are doing, but could use improvement in the management positions. Teamwork is required to get our projects done."
good,its fun but the people who work with you are rude and try to use their age or seniority to boss you around. But the pay is good.
good,"Resolved customer issues and complaints. I've learned how to handle agitated customers, and defuse situations. Management worked well with your personal schedule."
good,Work is fun. The management is alright. But the supervisors often have terrible attitudes and that is the reason there is such a turnover for employees.
good,"Currently, i manage numerous departments in IT, I have developed the Information Security Team from nothing to a team with strong vulnerability management program, outsource SOC, plan full execution, including the establishment of an Information Security Steering Committee, which includes the CIO, VP of Infrastructure, and the Manager of Network Services. Additionally, we have consistently been PCI Compliant as a level 1 merchandiser and SOX compliant. Additionally, I am the enterprise architect and manage numerous departments (UNIX Systems, mainframe systems programmers, DBAs, open systems storage, disaster recovery. I also established the companies SDLC, and change management processes."
good,"The job tended to be fairly easy, however my co-workers in the department never cooperated more work depending on where your shift ended."
good,"The days are quick because you're constantly working."
good,The most thing I like about my job is my regular customers and the employees that I work with. Also my benefits like my health insurance and overtime on the weekends.
good,"I had a wonderful time at my store, but some of the co-workers need to style up! Calling off 10 minutes before clocking in is hysterical!"
good,it was fun for a while but when u do the same thing and your work experience is alot higher then what there letting you do gets old fast. i was pushing carts to running cash registers. To unloading trucks and loading trucks. they taught me a lot of knowledge for sure.
good,"Great job for high school, for part time. Also had flexible work hours, work was really simple for the most part. I would definitely recommend to someone who wants about 20-30 hours per week."
good,"They start you out at base pay of $8.10 an hour with very little room to get better pay."
good,"My typical day at work. When I first started working at Kroger, I didn't know anything about working at a grocery store. I was first trained as a bagger, then moved on to being trained working as a custodian. So, I multi-task doing both these jobs most of my work day."
good,"my second week of working I got comfortable. I had to get work done first then play later as I ran out of things to do I meet a few friends. had a few conversations. so the manager ask me to go bag,i never complained its always work first.i enjoyed my job because of the good environment.the hardest part was picking like I had to unload truck to put in back.put the things in the right place."
good,"Jump feet first into the work day whether you open, are the mid shift, or close, there is never any doubt that there is work to do.  Talking and educating the customers, and my team, on our products was my favorite part of the day.  I love cheese, so this was a dream job of sorts.  When I first started working in the cheese shop it was wonderful!  Creativity, passion for food, curiosity and experimentation was welcome!  As the years went on however, the big Grocery Store Inc. mentality started to encroach upon my island of misfit foods.  More and more, the hard sell, unique to our shop items were being discontinued.  Instead of having freedom to order what our customers, and we wanted, ridged rule were put in place that began silencing the creativity and halting the learning.  My beloved island of misfit food was turning into just another department in the big Grocery machine.  Sure it's still impressive to walk in and see it there in the deli department, but what had once been the crown jewel of any store lucky enough to have one, was now just a channel set chip, still shiny, still valuable, but now off-set and made to be less impressive."
good,"Kroger has been doing all the right things in regards to staying on top  of the game.  They offer a very good benefit package and is a union shop.  "
good,"I worked here shortly after high school. I learned a lot. Although it was hard work, I generally enjoyed my experience here."
good,"You start the day by bagging groceries and also have to spend an hour in the parking lot getting carts back in the store. Co workers are what made work fun, otherwise having to bring so many carts inside was insane."
good,"I've enjoyed my time at Kroger, and have found it to be a great team environment. The wage is difficult to live on, however, and as such it is a challenge to keep hourly employment here as a sole source of income."
good,"My manager was very down to earth but still kept us busy at all times from replenishing, unloading the merchandise and stocking and also facing as well."
good,the most enjoyable part of the job is learning new things and meeting different people but the hardest part of the job is when you are trying to get things done and your supervisor  or higher heads is behind every second everyone is assigned to do different things but there's some time that co workers and supervisors team up with you to get the job done as quickly as possible so you can move on to the other task
good,"was not a terrible workplace, got along with everyone. Little room for advancement but decent paychecks. very clean work place"
good,Involves alot of interactiong with people. Gathering valueable experience on how to deal with alot of different niches and behaviors. Coworkers and bosses are warm and make the job more like home. I feel the pay is too low
good,There are several different areas in the pharmacy which can cause a stressful work environment. Is not an easy job to learn how to do.
good,Loved working for Kroger.  I've learned so much from the associate's and the customer's of Kroger.  Management needs some improving but otherwise fair.  My co-worker's and I were like family and everyday was a different adventure.  Hardest part of the job was making sure that customer satisfaction rating was scored at a 95 percentile.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the positive interaction with the customers and seeing them return week after week.
good,Management was always willing to help you out with any problem.  I loved working around food every day and learning about new cake decorating techniques.
good,Very productive place of work. I was constantly doing things and multi-tasking throughout my work shift. I learned very important people skills and ways to keep the customer happy.
good,"4 day work week that consists of a typical 10-12 hour day, during holidays lots of mandatory overtime, co-workers are extremely friendly, most management is friendly far as immediate supervisors go, i give the pay scale 4 out of 5 rating"
good,"Kroger is a grocery store chain. I worked here doing various odd jobs that needed to be done. My main jobs were to bag groceries, push shopping carts back inside, and clean bathrooms. The management staff was nice, but they were not on the front lines often. The turnover rate was high for my job and we had to stand the whole time we worked."
good,Extremely difficult job to be successful at cold calling. Company is scaling back their commission scale so hard to maintain decent employees.
good,This job was a great atmosphere to work in. Coworkers were very friendly and helpful. Definitely helped with coming to work everyday.
good,"Kroger had always been a busy environment to work in. There are things that you had to keep up with,and things that had to be set for memory. And that was the hardest part for me when I worked there. There are over 200 produce and PCU numbers to remember also the WIC customers that had to be processed. Co-workers were happy to help all the time,they were very friendly. I had learned very quickly that you have to be patient. Patience is a very important part in working with customer service related jobs. The thing I most enjoyed is cashiering. Yea it wasnt easy but I wanted to learn."
good,"Kroger hires great people, but the company makes it very hard for young people to move around within the company. After more than 4 years of working with the company, I was denied a job change to something other than Front End, because I was ""too good at my job."" Not being given the opportunity to advance within the company kills employee morale. Finally, after a move to a different store, I was given the opportunity to do something different. I learned valuable people skills and how a grocery store operates."
good,I learned about responsibility. I was friends with all of my coworkers and made a good team with them all. The hardest part of my jobs was dealing with rude customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping people.
good,"10 hour work days, 5 times a week "
good,Currently understaffed and required to work under extreme pressure to meet expectations of upper management. Current working conditions are very stressful due to the unreliability of many new employees.
good,"Management is crazy, doesn't care for their employees. Union dues are not worth a penny. Job can be difficult, with stubborn and rude customers. Otherwise job itself is fairly smooth once you've had the hang of it so long."
good,"Flexible schedule good, but never know from week to week what days or hours you will have. Great benefits. Management changes a lot. Overall not a bad place to work but pay is bad."
good,"Challenging, all about taking care of our Customers, Store Conditions, Sales, Shrink, Fresh and Friendly, and performing other Duties as assigned by Senior Management."
good,This company was great to start my career as a pharmacy technician but they need to get better compensation for employees
good,"Great place for a first job. At the time I was there, a great training program for meat cutters and some great people to teach you. mostly part time work with very little chance of advancement-union rules prevent any advancement on merits. Compensation is therefore very limited."
good,Days were generally lack luster. Management not the best. Every day was almost exactly the same. The hardest part was unloading the delivery trucks in the morning. I learned how to use RF Units
good,"Inventory control, customer relations, food preparation, production, retail management, and marketing were all part of my day at Kroger. I really enjoyed connecting with the customers in order to bring them the best possible service available."
good,"some days you go in and their is so much to do and then your told no hours so no help, but they do work well with schedules and to help as much as possible."
good,"An interesting place everyday, not a dull moment with the constant flow of customers. I enjoyed seeing and interacting with co-workers. I enjoyed my job on the whole. I was young and looked young , so didn't get the respect as a manager at age 23. Most of the employees were old enough to be my parents. I understood that, and learned to be flexible. It was a good learning experience."
good,I liked working at Kroger because the management was really n ice and helpful when i needed something.
good,"Kroger was actually a pretty decent first job. Being with this company ive learned so much about it.. It is definitely a great job if youre wanting to be promoted, or need extra money. Other than that, it is not much of a positive work place."
good,"the work is hard b ut the pay off is great if u can  handle the lack of good leaders, bad schedules,and rude co workers.the benefits are great but the people are just rude"
good,"I would do general cleanup, place stock on shelves. I would help customers find product."
good,It's an ok job to start off with.Working a cash register is extremely simple. My coworkers are pretty nice. To me the job is simple. I really just enjoy talking to the customers.
good,"was cleaning parts of big mixing bowls that were use to mix for bread,cookies, pies,muffins etc. being sanitary is a desirable thing in the food industry. attention to detail is strictly important. Awesome group of guys to work with that taught me a lot about the job aspect and as well about life in general. Having the opportunity to figure out how things were to be taken apart and put back together."
good,Good place to work in high school and college but best to move on with better opportunities
good,Kroger was a good place to work. Some managers made things harder than what it needed to be. I enjoyed the co workers and customers. My day consisted of putting up stock and helping customers.
good,"Bagged groceries"
good,"Solid job, a little low paying, but give good hours. Worked with good people, decent management."
good,A typical day would be bagging groceries and pushing carts.
good,Great environment with great people to work with everybody is friendly and easy going.
good,I've worked for Kroger for almost 5 years and I hate it. They pay you pretty much nothing and the hours they give you makes it hard to have a family life.
good,"Every morning I come in clock in. Go to the office get a handheld, go to my department go over what needs to be done with my manger. I work in 3 different department in one day sometimes. I work floral, produce, and nutrition. As I go threw my day working on the sales floor I help customers and make sure I'm maintaining my work area and greeting customers with a smile helping them with every need. I enjoy  working on the sales floor and helping the customers."
good,A typical work day was very busy. We did a large volume and had limited technician help. Lost two full time employees that were not replaced quickly. The pharmacy management was very lacking in people skills and slow to hire new people. The co-workers are what kept me going.
good,It Was Ok I was not getting paid enough though. I enojoyed the work just wasnt for me.
good,"you always kept busy as being a cashier, if not then you cleaned off the cash register. learned that you can always have customers very rude, "
good,My co-workers were the best to work with. I didn't like management except for a couple. My job was fairly easy.
good,It’s a nice place to work with a mostly good staff. There have been problems with cars being broken into or damaged. The store is always full of customers to assist and at the same time build social skills. The most enjoyable part is interacting with customers. The managers are responsible and help teach you the ins and outs of the business.
good,A retail job with all the pros and cons that come with it.  A lot of the people working there have good hearts and minds.
good,"if your not cutting meat your wrapping and labeling, or your filling the bunker with chickens, filling the case up with beef or pork products, working frozen, traying up frozen product to be weighed, weighing up hams, and more, then at the end of the day the closer takes apart saws soaks dishes cutting table and tenderizer, use a water hose to clean the floor and continue t assist guest and put out needed product"
good,"good benefits"
good,"- A typical day would consist of, bagging, rounding up shopping carts from the parking lot, putting items back on the shelf, cleaning up bathrooms and spills, and carrying and placing groceries into customer's cars."
good,"- typical day at work consists of walking the store, overseeing employees and daily duties, making sure all displays/endcaps are to planogram, unloading daily deliveries, managing budget and overtime, writing and approving all schedules for multiple departments, stocking shelves if necessary."
good,I had a time consuming day 5 to 6 days of week that started with a check list. Most things I learned like ordering and date checking and stocking showed me how to get the most out of a sale. My management team seem to be very non understanding but most of my other co-workers where hard workers. The hardest part about this job was the custom displays but the challenge was fun. I enjoyed the early shifts.
good,hanging tags making sure the prices are correct in the system.
good,"I made lots of friends, and learned a few things. It was so easy to get along with pretty much everyone."
good,"I worked at Kroger for 5 years and just wanted something in my career field which is accounting. I love numbers and they did not want me in the office because of my school hours, so the bank was the best place for me. I did everything at Kroger. I was supervisor over the whole front- end."
good,Enjoyable working place with great employees and great discounts if you can survive starting wage til you receive a wage raise good clothes good food and a very large Grocery store 1/3 mile around
good,"The people was great. Although, they do not pay well for advancement."
good,"Same routine almost everyday. Unload truck, organize product, stock the product and review back stock. While constantly interacting with customers. Limited interaction with co workers more of an independent job. If co workers don't get what needs done before you. that work falls on the person who is there after they leave. But it is a social environment with constant people around you."
good,"picking orders  and making sure I met production, I learned how to be more cautions cuz it was a lot of us in one area and to be careful cause it was easy to have a accident if you was not paying attention the most enjoyable part was that we got paid every week & and wat I disliked about it was that we didn't have a scheduled time when we got off work it was based on how much volume we had"
good,"Typical day at works starts off with me doing time and attendance and making sure that every employee's time is correct. Then I make sure that all the paperwork is done for the day, once I finish that up I help out other departments if they are short handed for the day. I have learned so much from working at Kroger, I started off as a cashier and worked my way up to Administrative Assistant. The managers are ok, I wish they attend to their employees needs a little more. My co-workers are great, we have a great time and work and enjoy each others company. The hardest part about my job is trying to make each customer as happy as possible, I know that all customers cant be satisfied but I try to go above and beyond to make sure, that they leave knowing that we've done all that we can. The most enjoyable part of my job, is learning something new everyday. I love to learn new things, and working with different departments and different kinds of people, I find myself coming home learning something new."
good,"Mariano's will train you for a promotion, and never give it to you. You will be forced to learn the job almost entirely on your own. Most managers are insane."
good,It was a pleasant work environment .Satisfing work load. Pleasant Bosses to work with as a team.
good,"Great first job, they are very flexible with your availability."
good,"Four tractor trailers of groceries would show up almost everyday we would have to unload them and make sure they went where they belonged.  The management was always on a different level and willing to let you know that.  The employees were hard working and very proud of their work.  The hardest part was trying to move pallets of food through the store without getting in someone's way.  This did not happen to offend.  The most enjoyable part was knowing that we had 40,000 products in their place and that store looked great."
good,"stocking shelves with product"
good,"A typical day would be preforming continuous customer service. As a courtesy clerk, my role was to basically clean everything and make sure it was a healthy environment. The hardest part was the early morning eight hour shift. I enjoyed making people smile and satisfied with their experience at the store."
good,"Somedays we are very busy, others we are very steady. it keeps the time from going very slow. I""ve learn to gain more patience. Not only with our elders but also with other employees we have that have disabilitys.I have worked live and supervised disability adults .back in  1986 to 1992.  my co- workers are good to work with. we have fun ,But we know when to be serious.we have a new manger now still trying to adjust to his changes.The hardest part of my job not really any .just can;t. get more hours a week"
good,Great job for some extra spending money. Very early mornings. Lots of cleaning. Not many hour.
good,"Most of the day consisted of bagging groceries and pushing carts.  Nightly duties included garbage and cleaning bathrooms and backroom.  "
good,"I felt this company could be more successful for themselves and there associates if there wasn't a union involved. I felt to some point, managements hands were tied and they were constantly on guard in order to prevent union involvement."
good,"As a part time worker, I would pull in about 28-34 hours a week. The job was stressful for, other than the ladies who worked behind the service desk, the deli/bakery required the most hands-on interaction with the customers. We took special food orders, cake orders, and all that yummy stuff that comes to mind when thinking of a deli or bakery.  Management was the toughest part of the job, there was a certain way she wanted things done, and if you didn't catch on quick enough, you were outta there!"
good,I mainly stayed on a cash register all day but also stocked shelve and cleaned.
good,"a typical work day at Kroger was clock in at 6am, clock out by 5pm. Making sure inventory and shelves were up to par and in order."
good,The job overall was okay and a good learning experience. The hard part about the job was getting the carts from the parking lot while it was snowing and if you work until 10pm you would have to clear all of the carts from the parking lot before your shift ended.
good,A typical day could be slow or busy with no consistency. A day that over all was slow very likely had periods that felt like we were being slammed .  Customers could be friendly or grumpy or both with no warning.  Coworkers were mostly good and were easy to get along and work with.   Insurances were very difficult to work with and increasingly everything was prior authorization needed or not covered and the reason recieved for the reject was often not correct.  Management mostly tried to be helpful but were limited in what they could do.  I learned that I was never going to have a complete handle on the job as it was constantly in a state of flux.  In spite of that most days and the overall job was enjoyable.  The most enjoyable part of the job was if you could go home that day knowing you had been able to really help or make a difference to someones life.
good,"While employed at Kroger, I noticed, on many occasions, power imbalances. Front end workers would would neglect their duties and make the baggers handle all effort related duties. Not that this was totally unexpected, but they certainly demanded an extreme amount from their baggers."
good,"Kroger is a large company that owns other company's"
good,At this job you will learn great customer service skills and get money handling experience. The managers and employees are friendly. If you are a good worker you move around in the company but the pay is low.
good,"A typical day at work I learn to use slicing machines and friars. How to make deli subs, meats platters, and fruit trays."
good,Company needs to communicate more with updates on whats new.
good,"The Bowling Green Kroger work place has become my second family, they worked well with my school classes and my times I needed off. The management work very closely with the co-workers and want us to enjoy being at work. I have learned responsibility for store products, and communication between customers and myself. I  feel that I have grown in my responsibilities to take on tasks that help out if there is not a list for me to do. I take on the ability to manage my time and my work at Work and at school. The hardest part of my job would be dealing with an unhappy customer and how to go about it. The most enjoyable part of my job hands down my co-workers I know they will do anything for me as I would them and they want to see me go far in life and help me in any way they can eg. offering me recommendations letters for future careers"
good,"A typical work day would be coming into work on time and in a great mood. I would usually go back to my department, get with my department manager and discuss what duties need to be done for the day and how quickly they need to be done. We then would go to the store ""huddle/meeting"" and then discuss store goals, weekly and daily goals and what we could work on that week / day. The co-workers were great, made the best of friends and always had one eachothers backs. The hardest part of the job was management, not department managers but the store managers. The proper communication between store management and employees in the departments was very weak."
good,poor pay. poor management. the most enjoyable part is that you do get paid weekly. i learned nothing. its dry work.
good,"This is your typical grocery store job. Not a lot of pizazz but does have great benefits. Work demand isn't too hard and as long as you stay focused, you keep on track. Most of my co-workers were great, only a few ""bad apples"". After I switched to the photo dept I enjoyed getting to rest. My favorite part of the job would have to be working with April, she is a great friend and always made it a fun day at work."
good,"You would go in to work, And you would hope that your manager will be in a good mood.  If not you just stay away tell she feel's better. I think that was the hardest part. We all worked as a team's, work together help each other. I learned a lot over the year's there, That there are still some good Manager's out there. The enjoyable part is when you do get one you will work hard for that Manager do your best. We had summer BBQ in the back a are parking lot that was fun when we all can get in to it."
good,"It was a fun environment to work, but the management was bad favoritism for a lot of employees and it was the south so i feel it was a little racial tension among the employees"
good,"Only worked there for 9 months, the whole time was an overnight shift. Supervisor would schedule nightly aisles, and each employee was expected to fully complete the stocking, backstock, and 'conditioning' of each aisle they were assigned. Very little interaction with other employees or customers, and managers treated employees very unfairly."
good,"I would bag groceries, collect carts, clean the bathroom sometimes, take out the trash, take care of returns. I didn't really learn anything while working there. Management was friendly, cooperative, and willing to answer questions or help. My co-workers were mostly friendly and kind to others. The hardest part of the job was the sometimes constant demand to keep up with carts or bag for customers. There really wasn't an enjoyable part to the job, but I could tolerate it."
good,Wonderful people with all levels of abilities.  Provided associate lounge with tv and a clean environment.
good,My job is making sure every customer has a highly satisfied shopping experience. Helping customers find items and getting the customers comfortable using self checkout. Management is very helpful and always there to assist us. My co-workers are very friendly and helpful. There is no hard part of the job i'm a quick learner. I enjoy making customers happy and satisfied.
good,"No real room for advancement. I was cross-trained in everything but customer service, deli/bakery, floral, and management, and never recieved any raises besides the annual raises. It was a great job, and I learned to take charge after I was chosen for supervisor, but again-no pay raise for that. Cheap labor!"
good,There are many task to do and not a lot of time to do it. There is a lot teamwork involved and you can work at your own pace. You learn to work with others and to better your customer service skills. Management was difficult to work with. The relationships built with the customers and co-worker.
good,Prolly the easiest job I ever had and worked decently with schedule but depends on what department your in for that.
good,"I can say with honesty I dislike this job to an extent.  "
good,Very good job to gain customer service experience. It wasn't easy to move up in the company and pay was very low.
good,Kroger is a good company to work for. They have good people working for them in both management and peer level employees.
good,"I worked in the fuel center which is way different than working inside the store with the groceries."
good,"-Extremely busy/ fast- paced; I manage cashiers and can also write them up if their not doing their job."
good,I was an order filler for three years at Fred Meyer Distribution center. Advancement and job security was top notch in this position. If you were able to perform your job and do it well then you had great job security. This wasn't in the field of work I wanted to perform as a career so I decided to go back to school and get an education. I really appreciate the management at this location and the job taught me how to work hard.
good,"Productive workplace place with the daily routine such as stocking, unloading the truck, processing backstock products. Learned how to conduct the proper use of the technolgy scan guns provided, and the co-workers are so genrous and helpful to other co-workers as well. The hardest about the job can be when someone in the department callas in or are running late and that can sometimes double the work load for others. Meeting new customers each day, its interesting to meet different people each day"
good,"Went in to work,attended customers.Enjoyed solving problems with customers,hardest part was getting senior citizens to understand."
good,"A typical day at work is sometimes very easy, yet hard. At my job I have learned the customer is always right. You should do everything in your power to make sure the customer is satisfied. Management is sometimes rude, it depends on what manager u work with at the time. I loved working with my co-workers but sometimes they didn't want to do their job assignment and it was an extra load on me and whom ever else was working that day. The hardest part of the job was working with the rude supervisors. I feel like everyone shoud be treated with respect. The most enjoyable part of the job was when we would have completion between cashiers to see who could finish ringing up a customer order the fastest"
good,"I really liked all the people I got to meet working in such a public environment. The lack of help from other employees didn't make my job easy, but I made sure my job got done."
good,"I walk in the job. punch in the time clock, go to the asignment board for what my dutys are for the day and go to the area that im supposed to be log in my Id number and go to my station. What i learn is that ever time i go in to work some things aren't the same as before everyday the store changes products are being moved around to accomadate the store needs for area for the products they sale. The manager help with problems in the store or asist you with items on where they  should be or promoting item in the store. To work with co-worker and get along with everyone rather you like them or not it is a business and it is a workers responsibility to help the company with it's products and your job. The hardest part when you don't workers not doing there share of work and you do there work for them. When you done your work and your proud of doing it and when a supervisor comes to you and says job well done, and thank you. "
good,Typical day was a average day. Friendly customers. I learned how to work in many different areas. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my team. The hardest part was not receiving enough hours nor pay.
good,"Decent work for minimum wage. flexible scheudule, and close to home. Also 10 percent employee discount "
good,"A typical day i would punch in, start on bringing the carts from the corrals. After that i would either do bags or work the cashiers"
good,"Great coworkers. That was the best part of my day, hanging out with them. Management was great and very understanding, if you needed off for any reason the managers would work with you instead of against you. There are enjoyable customers and the ones that just ruin your day but you cant let it get to you. If your just looking for a part-time job to earn some extra money then this is a good job for you. If your trying to pay the bills on the other hand go somewhere else. you start at minimum wage, you get raises every year but its only a nickel or dime. It's extremely hard to get full time or to move up from a cashier. I got a promotion and only made an extra 60 cents for 120 percent more responsibility. It was NOT worth it.It was very stressful because i was in charge and had to make sure everything was done at the end of the night and if it wasnt i was in trouble. You cant stay late either because its overtime and they do not believe in overtime.You also only get 2 fifteen minute breaks for an eight hour shift. Its a great job for a high schooler or if you want some extra spending cash, otherwise stay away"
good,Well organized. Fun co-workers. Easy to learn. Good management 
good,They really take care of their employees. Working for Smiths you become part of a family. I really enjoyed my time there.
good,A typical day at work is never really typical. The situations change from day to day. I learned a lot about how grocery stores are run and what things are done to help make them run more smoothly and more profitable. Most of the co-workers were great to work with but there are always one or two in every bunch that can make your job more difficult than it needs to be. Those people I try to take under my wing and help them to work more efficiently with a more positive attitude.The most enjoyable part is when things flow smoothly and everyone can find something to smile about.
good,The hardest part of the job was the fact that they change managers every other month or less.
good,It was an interesting job. You would be attentive to the customers. I learned how deal with different situations. Management was alright. My co-workers are efficient. The hardest part is when there not enough able bodies to satisfy customer needs. I enjoy making corsages. 
good,"The job overall was good.  But, it was more for a younger person.  Well, younger than myself."
good,"I first started working for Pick n Save in 1998 I was there for 10 years and decided to change careers. They valued their employees and their families, that however has changed. I returned in 2011 for a year and a half to find that they no longer valued their employees and even the employees that were still there (15+ years )were looking for a job they could call home. Its a shame because this company has a lot to offer and we live in a smaller town , that small town grocer feeling has disappeared at this location. "
good,"Work at the Deli is constantly shifting and very busy. You're never bored and you always have something to do. The people are nice, and the customers are generally pleasant, if not cooperative. "
good,"A typical day at work would be hectic , because your all over the place , if your not at the the cashier , you our working the floor somewhere or either stocking foods . Co-workers were easy to get along with . The hardest part was stocking , because you have to make sure everything is in the right place . I love having breaks"
good,"My day was the same I would come to work an hour early and sit in the breakroom. Then when my shift started I clocked in and started. My job was to push carts, sweep the floors, and clean the bathrooms. My job was very easy but it got kind of hard trying to sweep the floors when people were there, but overall it was easy to manage. I loved working with my co-workers everyone was so nice to me when i first started. What I learned is that you got to make sure that you do everything right the first time and when they call you to do something you make sure you do it right away"
good,-Typical day at Kroger is very busy a lot of hands on work.
good,"Love this place for the most part. Working at Customer Service, being a Floor Supervisor is fun, working on Kronos (payroll system) keeps me interested in work! With these job responsibilities, I get variety as well as employee/customer engagement. My co-workers are great and the managers are helpful, caring and a pleasure to work with. The hardest part of working at Kroger is the hours are not set. I could work any day of the week except for Sat. The most enjoyable part is being able to move around. I don't have to stand in one position or sit at a desk all the time."
good,"A typical day at work, I come in. Run & scan backstock. Load & unload the dairy truck. Break it down onto U-Boats. ex. ( cheese & biscuits on one & yogurt on the other). load & unload the milk truck as well. stock the frieght. Mark items down that are close dated. Shoot the dairy order's as well. Which i say would be the hardest part of ther job because you want everything you order to go straight to the shelf, or if their ad items, to go in the dairy bunker. The management is pretty good at times. But they expect alot out of you for little pay. The most enjoyable part of the day is helping customers find the products they want & came too buy."
good,"I like it for the most part, but there are some things that could improve there"
good,This job was very productive but had many broken promises made to there employes.
good,i learned a lot about working with a team my co workers were awesome and sometimes wish i could've spent more time there the freedom and laid back enviroment was perfect for my age and maturity at the time
good,the experience at this company was over all good. There was to many updates and change the they had to do; its fast learning but the customers where not good with change. It was getting difficult to deal with customer following regulation.
good,"I was employed with Kroger Distribution as a Security gaurd. There are many differences between checking in trucks at the gate and the work details inside the actual factory. Many improvements are needed for the security aspect of the job, but it was a rewarding professional enviroment. The hardest part of the job is that you are considered the same as the stores ""loss prevention"" guards and so you receive the same pay rate, although you do not work any store details. The distribution center considers you ASP personnel and other ASP's within the plant are doubling your hourly rate. Overall you meet some very interesting people from the drivers (both local and abroad) and the other employees! It is a good experience for anyone willing to step out of their shell and be social with various people and and EXCELLENCT format for dealing with various types of customer service and the public."
good,Good basic company that seems to have wandered off course....that being a quality grocery store.
good,The store I work at is great. Everyone in the store is fun and friendly and the manager are really flexible with schedule especially the school schedule
good,"I worked at Ralphs as a student, and luckily I got a lot of hours. However after paying Union dues I made less than minimum wage. You can make about 20 dollars an hour if you stay there for 5 or 6 years, but it takes quite a while before someone can get a significant raise. Management was good, though it is a demanding job that requires you to always be productive. After everything I am happy that I worked here, I got several months of cash handling experience and gave me the experience I needed to move my career forward."
good,at the time workers were forced to learn on their own and many customers were upset because of the proper training
good,"I have learned a lot about myself while working at this job opportunity. I have learned that it is easy to be stressed out over little things, but as you grow and learn about the company .. it became fun and I had to learn to be flexible. I have taught myself to be aware of my surroundings and at the same time push myself to my most highest limits. I am the hardest critic to myself .. I expect myself to give 120 percent everyday.. no matter what. The hardest part of the job is to slow down and pace myself.. but you learn to do that real quick.. and through that you become a person that works smarter, not harder. The most enjoyable part of the job was to able to remain flexible and respect others.. even though it was very trying at times. Through this, I have learned to find the silver lining in every situation and have become known for a great sense of humor.. it always makes the job easier and morale is boosted when everyone can have an enjoyable day at work."
good,"A typical day at work is basically all about my work as a cashier or either a clerk. I was always on time, made sure my employees were okay, and also made sure they were on time and clocked in. I learned a lot when I was at Kroger. Like, communicating and asking customers do they need any help finding anything, and do give help if needed. My co-workers were fun, funny, and nice to be around. When I was down they always found a way to put a smile on my face. But the most hardest part of my job was that my hours were showing it on my paycheck, and I didn't like all the long hours if I wasn't getting the right amount of money. I can say this: Kroger was an fun and laughable place to be at, and I liked every moment of it. The employees were fun too!"
good,"begin shift by packaging and putting products out on floor to fill case. then prep rotisserie chickens and load for cooking. cook/fry foods for hot bar. fill log sheets with cook temp's and times. wait on any customers in dept. either servicing hot foods or slicing meats and/or cheeses, or prep to order at sandwich bar. fulfill customer orders via"
good,There was heavy foot traffic. Somewhat well run in a hustling manner.
good,"hectic atmosphere. Hard to get training to do your job. There is not employees to meet the demand of customer, end result lost sales."
good,I enjoyed interacting with people and getting to know everyone who came into the store often. I like to work with others and make people smile. I learned how to handle difficult situations and try to satisfy the customer the best that I could. The hardest part of this job was dealing with the unhappy people that came in but it made me feel better when I made them feel better about that situation.
good,Order Merchandise
good,"Busy reviewing, researching and writing."
good,Great place for a first job. Have enjoyed my time here. Managers and coworkers are great.
good,"The fuel kiosk was an easy job. Hard customers at times, but overall, very easy. You are not face to face."
good,A typical day included working with customers scanning and sacking their groceries and keeping area clean. What i think i learned with this job was how to interact with customers and using customer service. My manager was a nice lady we got along great as well as my coworkers i went to school with most of them. The hardest part was dealing with argumentative customers but with some experience that got easier.The most enjoyable had to be helping people.
good,"A typical day wud be get to work grab my forklift change the battery and check inventory of trailers with cases. Communicate with the supervisor,and go from there co workers r good people resfectful.The harderst part of my job would be wen a coworker is having a bad day and everything just runs wrong, cases r fallin in the trailers ,forklift breaks , people call in.the most enjoyable part wud be wen everything runs smooth day goes by so quick."
good,The only part I didn't enjoy was the arguing that took place between the customers and the employees.
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was to accomplish costumer satisfaction.
good,kept to my self
good,Kroger had i few great leaders who helped develop me into the great produce manager I became.
good,"I greeted customers as they entered and exited the store. I also directed customers to the items they were looking for. I learned to speak slowly and clearly in order for customers to understand me. The management of the store helped out with grocery bagging, cashiering, and cart gathering. My co-workers were fun to work with. The hardest part was keeping busy on days with hardly any customers. I enjoyed joking with co-workers and employers."
good,I greeted customers as they entered and exited the store. I learned to be more of a people person and how to slow down my speech so that customers can understand what I am saying. The employers helped out in different departments and even gathered shopping carts. My co-workers were fun to joke around with. The hardest part is trying to keep busy on days when there weren't that many customers. I enjoyed seeing people I know come into the store.
good,"The coworkers were great, the management was great, but the promotion process wasn't something i was looking forward to. I started off as a bagger but then they ""promoted"" me to janitor, without raising my pay. So i was making minimum wage cleaning up people's waste and i didn't want to be a janitor but a cashier. they said that's how the promotion works so i said time to find a new job."
good,"Kroger was an okay job as you remain busy, but starting out it's hard because pay increases are based on the time you've put in, rather than your skills. If I were to learn to do three different jobs effectively, I wouldn't get any benefit from it except having to do everything. The union is okay, except that it almost protects employees too much, because an employee that shows up on pills and is rude to fellow employees faces no consequences unless caught multiple times by management. If you can put the time in, you can earn a living wage eventually, but that takes years, so unless you've worked there since high school, you're not going to make much. Middle management is great because they work on the ground with you, and are understanding. Upper management is hit or miss, one manager could do our work and was approachable, while another manager clearly didn't know anything except numbers."
good,A typical day at Fred Meyer can be a bit intense. There's always something changing and you never get bored. The managers and other people that work there are all good people but working there and not getting into management makes you no money. If you work too long at Fred Meyer and don't get into management they wont let you .
good,"This job is the easiest, but can get very exhausting at the same time. You work different hours most of the days of the week. Its on schedule so each week you have to check the schedule to see what shift you have. Very easy to work with the people. But customers are another story."
good,I love working for Kroger because I like meeting and helping people. Ive worked here full time hours and after 3 years I'm still making part time pay.
good,"It's a good company to work for with good benefits. If you're looking for part time work and a productive atmosphere, this might be something you should look into."
good,Go into work start your day off by going to get people out for lunch. I learned how have great customer service and be able to be patient. My co- workers were the best part everyone was so nice and on top of things.
good,I loved this job because of the personal relationships i developed with so many people from customers to vendors. The responsibility i had was enough to keep me on my game. Managing large crews became a snap and driving sales became my specialty. Every single person i came into contact with became a friend. Learning how to manage an older crew being so young taught me a good deal about how to speak with respect and get it back as well. I sometimes didn't like to follow the corporate program because it would prove ill-fated in my store but turning it around to something beneficial was always a great accomplishment daily.
good,"Promoted and trained as manager after only six months, but suddenly was getting harassed by management to learn how to drive to manage another store I couldn't reach without a car. I only took the promotion because they promised to promote me within my home store, but then they made it hard to focus on my work. My co-workers were great and I did learn I have a knack for creating custom arrangements, corsages, and marketing. I don't recommend staying with a company that bullies hard-working people when corporate can't come through on their end of the bargain."
good,"I almost made it three years, but i was constantly receiving some kind of abuse from the last two sets of management, co workers and customers. I got blamed for a few incidents that weren't even my fault."
good,"I worked here through my high school and early college student days. I can't say I had too many complaints seeing as I worked good hours and we got good required breaks. One of my biggest problems was the inconsistency of management, some were very laid back and easy going making it easy to work with them but others were very uptight and could be quite mean. I also found in a little unfair that if you showed a little bit of competency and work ethic you were expected to do so much more than the ""slackers"" and were never given ""a pat on the back"" for taking your job serious. Roundy's in general though is for lack of a better term just a weird company to work for."
good,this company was ok to work for not much on family values....
good,A typical day at work consisted of being cashier for about 90% of the time and a bagger for the rest. The work was not too dificult but not easy on your body. The reason for my departure of the company was the constant refusal of my required breaks or lunches.
good,Working at Kroger was a great experience and the best part was interacting with the costumers and coworkers. The management was very helpful in working with my schedule at the time and understood that schedules sometimes change.
good,If you are looking for a job and are a student or working a second job then this is a good place for flexible hours and can be a decent stepping stone for first time workers with no experience. Little to no desirable long term positions
good,"Kroger is an excellent place to work as long as the other employees are nice. In my case, they aren't. Not all stores are like this though, so I would still take your chance. They have awesome benefits and pay wages."
good,In any retail situation there is going to be drama in department.  And different managers have different expectations.  Its a dog eat dog place at times.  You have to know your employee rights.
good,"Decent company to work for, lack work/life balance not worth it at the end of the day. Also feel as is the staff does shady business to benefit themselves, rather the associates doing all the hard work"
good,"Kroger is a decent work environment. Fellow coworkers help pass time on. Management, for the most part, is pretty understanding. You do learn quite a few different skills depending on the department you work for. Stock, for example, is hard work but fairly easy. Hardest part of the job is keeping up with live stock on a daily basis."
good,The work environment is good but unfortunately the pay does not always fit the dedication to the work you do. There is also not a lot of opportunities for you to move up in the work force because they are not willing to pay you what you’re worth.
good,"Loved the job  management could have been better.i learned a lot and enjoyed my coworkers.when I got sick management said I was a no call no show and separated me"
good,"The store itself was ok, a bit run down and not as modern as some. People were generally nice, some employees at my store would slack a bit though. Though the front in manager was very rude and spoke harshly to me personally. That and school was why i left"
good,"A typical day is us just being understaffed and making it work. I've learned a lot. I've learned how to be a good manager no matter the situation. We've change store managers very frequently, so i've experienced some good ones and some bad. The work place can be very enjoyable though. When you're full time and see the same people so often, it almost feels like a family. The hardest part of the job is trying to work around Krogers rules honestly. We are very understaffed, but there have been times where we could use overtime or something, but the company treats overtime as the worst possible option. There are many other examples that are similar situations where we may have the resources to not suffer, but due to Kroger rules, we're stuck and have to just make the best of a bad situation. The most enjoyable part of my job would be the impact i have on everyone. The way i make my customers day or the way i make my employees happy to work with me."
good,The store I worked at was extremely busy.  Loved working with everyone.  It was difficult at times due to the high stress.  Management made it difficult at times.  First manager I had when I first started was very disrespectful and would yell at employees and sometimes even customers.  Second manager was an improvement.  I left because I was accepted to go back to school.
good,I am a hard working person who is always putting my job before other things I never miss a day of work an I am always on time in a good mood an ready to start my day
good,My experience at Kroger was really laid back while still getting the job done. Got along with all my co-workers but the pay was really bad. They Have a good flexible work schedule.
good,Like every other call center environment. Come in and do all your daily tasks and have metrics to meet. Scheduling deliveries for patients or dealing with insurance companies.
good,"Good store but not good management, many people quit in my time being there and the management didn’t pay attention to the needs of some of the workers."
good,"I did stocking and inventory "
good,"Management was pretty good at the store, if our night crew team did a good job, they would always give us some kind of reward like pizza or some subs, etc. The hardest part of the job was during the holidays where you do a lot of overtime or sometimes aren't even able to finish stocking. Also even if you were part time they would schedule you 40 hours a week during holidays/other employee vacations so that was nice."
good,"I am not one to complain, (at least I try not to). "
good,"This was one of two options in my town if you wanted to start working early. Despite having to push carts in the most miserable of conditions, this was an amazing place to introduce yourself into the workforce."
good,Started at 15. Worked through high school and college. Kroger even paid for most of my school. Worked my way up through management over the years. Physical job with high expectations but opportunity for advancement.
good,I worked at Kroger for three months I was working in the meat department I wasn't happy so I moved to bagging but they fired saying I had complaints in the meat department but I was no longer at the meat department I was moved to bag up front
good,Was working at a newly opened store. Which was under staffed.    And  Managed. Especially during the overnight shift.  In which I worked. Not enough teamwork.
good,"Good place to work but stressful you don’t have enough baggers or cashiers, it had good management but they can’t seem to keep them . Also the person scheduling was awful at it ."
good,"Typically a moderate foot traffic from the customers daily, will have the most customers on weekends, due to sport events and after school and church goers. Hardest part at the moment is maintaining my stress while newer employees are promoted before me and can't do their jobs correctly or is missing, while they are on the clock and in a rush."
good,Anual sales ways of impruving  had to work when employees called off supervise up to 9 other employees sometimes working 2 shifts in a row  implament new programs  working split shifts
good,"Not very many full time positions available but of those most of them aren't going anywhere.  Part-time usually available but usually only for transitional employment. This isn't a place to stay.  You can make more $$ at other retail businesses.  This is a good place to work for experience but don't make it a career."
good,"Although there are some admitted perks (low premiums for health insurance, Union, employee discount) it does not make up for low pay, stress, and favoritism. Additionally, because of a miscalculation, we ended up having a $7500 deductible this year instead of the regular $350. It kind of made the health insurance a moot point."
good,"fast paced,diverse work force, on going interaction with customers,  it can be fun and interesting if you choose it to be based on if you consider yourself customer oriented. From the customers you learn various things based on their purchases such as recipes,uses for certain items and some DIY."
good,Carts was the best part of the job you were alone get to talk to customers and you’ll be outside for an hour. Bagging is also easy but management was always standing beside just to see every move you do it’s an ok job but there’s always a catch.
good,"have been at ralphs for over 3 years, been promoted numerous times but still didnt recievce a satisfying raise for all my promotions. Surrounded by alot of lazy people, as soon as your seen as a hardworker your made to do certain aspects of poeples jobs. They do work around your schedule though."
good,"managers are horrible, trash in the isles, no respect, some food isn’t cooked all the way or just down right disgusting. wouldn’t recommend as a full time job. not very good pay."
good,"The Kroger experience depends upon the manager, and how each individual manager gets along with you. It's pretty hard to be fired once you are out of probation, though. So if you make it through your first couple months, it doesn't really matter how much the manager wants to fire you."
good,"I love the people I work with. Its what makes me stay at the job and work hard but between managements overbearing standards and rude customers, it really brings morale down."
good,it was a fun they gave us candy every single day as well as popcicles and bubblegum and It was just such a great and and fun and fun just place to work
good,"The most enjoyable part of working for Kroger is meeting new customers everyday. I also enjoy helping the senior citizens, which consists of assisting them with loading their groceries into their vehicles. The management is decent."
good,"I enjoyed my job as a Starbucks Kroger barista. It was fast paced and sometimes stressful but other times it was slow & chilled out for awhile. Management was super flexible with my school schedule & me taking other days off for events (concerts, fair, etc). The only issue is advancing in this department isn’t really likely"
good,"The HR Manager that hired me is a great manager. Always cared about his employees. The same cannot be said for some of the other managers at that specific store, unfortunately. They did not seem to care about the well-being of their employees."
good,"Worked there all throughout high school, good pay at the time for my age. Bad management, great coworkers & environment if you like fast paced. They don’t offer discounts but they do give you vouchers around the holiday season. The union wasn’t that good either we had got a new union steward because the other one retired and he would never pick up the phone or return calls"
good,Working At Kroger’s was good in the beginning when I started in the 9th grade because it was fun . As everything started to change as I was still working people started to change I had my moments when I didn’t want to come to work . The store manager at the time didn’t know half of the front in employees names and also she was rude and mean for no reason just because she felt like so I just couldn’t stay there no more after ny I quit.senior are year of high school I
good,"The company really wants you to stay busy. The work environment is based on numbers and getting the highest percentages, no matter what the customer thinks. I can not say if you will enjoy the job based on the job itself. It really will depend on your co-workers. I can say, with 100% certainty, that everyone is more stressed out now than before. The big push for self-checkout, scan and go, and store pick up has left the front end to be one miserable place. For now, the job is only good for college students and those who are in between jobs."
good,"This is a good place to work at."
good,"Overall I liked most of the people I work with, but I’m just tired of working there and I want to find other opportunities. Being a courtesy clerk got very repetitive and it is getting boring in my opinion"
good,A day at work would be a few hours of bagging with another couple hours of pushing carts in. Hardest part of the job would be keeping customers happy when it came to long checkout lines.
good,"Management was okay, not the best but they can get the job done, a few can motivate the employees. Employees are great people, probably the best I've ever got the chance to work with."
good,"The people are friendly enough, though you can clearly tell who the slackers are."
good,"When I worked at Kroger I actually worked in the Starbucks kiosk so I never interacted with the cashiers up front, the people in the deli or bakery, or anyone in the pharmacy unless they came to me. The Starbucks kiosk is very closed off since we are supposed to stay there during our entire shift. Because of this I cannot give a full, accurate description of my career in Kroger, other than the fact that management was bad and the Starbucks portion was always understaffed so I had to work crazy hours. In addition to that, the workers in the kiosk never got breaks (paid or not paid) We were expected to stay in the kiosk during the duration of our shift, no matter how long. However, working in the Starbucks kiosk was quite fun on it's own if anyone was interested in doing that!"
good,"Stocked stuff, faced stuff, and helped customers.  Once you get into the rhythm of the job its not too bad.  The problems are simple and so are the answers.  Kinda boring at times but that's the job.  You can mindlessly do things after a while and get paid for it."
good,"All of my coworkers were pretty genuine people, but the management was a little stressful and hard on the workers. The store was pretty small, but we dealt with high-volume times with customers."
good,"I didn't feel like they cared too much about the Home Department, it was always all about the grocery. I worked the graveyard shift in the Home section, so I really meant nothing to grocery management, they wouldn't even acknowledge me. I loved the crew I worked with on graveyards, including the grocery stockers, very relaxed at nights. But, my hours in the Home section was constantly getting cut to give to grocery, who were always on overtime."
good,"This job is good if you are a student who is trying to earn some cash. The job is overall okay. It could have better management, the management is kinda all over the place. They never really have a lot of people staffed so they are extremely understaffed on busy days."
good,Well as far as the jobs leadership it was fair in being righteous and not discriminating. The company's environment was well sanitary and organized. Coworkers were easy to cope with and were very helpful to each other.
good,Hardest part of my job is dealing with co workers that dont speak any english at all very frustating.  Production work . unloadeing pallettscof product in freezers and in coolers every day . m7st be a fast worker . work with a sense of urgency.
good,The Kroger job was fine and in all but they didn’t offer enough pay at the beginning and not enough hours as well and the location was pretty far at the time.
good,"If you're a young high school student, or looking for a summer job, Kroger is the place for you. All the workers are friendly and the work environment feels like one big family, however you are expected to work. Don't go into this looking for somewhere to slack off and get a free check. If you're down to work hard, you'll love this job."
good,"The job can be relaxing and slow, If You work in the mornings, once it gets into the afternoons it gets loaded, You get breaks and a lunch depending on how long Your shift is for the day, If you were to go full time You would get a lot of benefits, Management changed a lot while I was there and it got pretty bad at times but it's a good job,"
good,"Being salary meant working 60 hours a week or more. I was 9 months pregnant and still required to work 6 days a week at about 12 hours shifts per day because the store was not up to par. Working there actually made me go into labor two weeks early because I was constantly lifting, pushing, carrying and unloading pallets even this far along."
good,"12 years at Kroger. Good benefits. Paid time off and vacations. If you put your time in at Kroger you will advance in the company. Store management can improve, will help with store morale"
good,It is not a bad place to work at. Good benefits. Nice people. Customers can be grumpy but some are nice. Wish the pay was better but other than that good enough.
good,I have alot of experience in frozen food departments. I've learned to order & keep it full. I've always worked for great store managers. Great customers
good,"On a typical day at Kroger, you're expected to always have something to do. Most of that time goes to helping customers by packing their groceries, or even by helping to bring their groceries to their cars if they happen to be in need of aid. Other things that workers do are to help clean the store (by performing sweeps around the store or cleaning up the bathrooms), helping to bring recycled items from the recycling center to the back of the store, and bringing carts in from the front of the store. While working, you have the opportunity to meet your fellow employees and superiors."
good,High traffic retail pharmacy. Fast paced and enjoyable. Co workers were easy to get along with and communication open. Management did their best to make employment enjoyable.
good,"Kroger was sometimes stressful and quick paced, leaving very little room for a breather. Nonetheless, the managers were friendly and willing to help. So the experience was somewhat balanced."
good,"i started as a bagger and work my way up to management, so it is possible to work your way up and make a decent amount of money out of it. but the drama field store and the consistent lack of work from store management meant that you were constantly tired"
good,"usually I would get there at 4pm and clock out by 12am. for the majority of the time I would be working at the self checkout area. if other places needed assistance, then I would be called assist them which would not be a problem for me."
good,"It can be stressful at times, but as long as you have good coworkers it can be fun. They should pay some workers more if they are trained in more than one department."
good,"Being a Courtesy Clerk was one of my first jobs as a highschool senior back in 2018, but its not a job I would want to go back to or recommend if you're working as a courtesy clerk."
good,It was a fun experience and I learned a lot from the job. It was also nice because I met new and interesting people when they came through. I was grateful for the experience and thank you.
good,Sometimes it can be stressful the people are okay when not underpressure but overall it's an okay job management sometimes can be rude sometimes Kroger has to meet lots of recommendation and request from there bosses
good,The workers seemed like good people but the management wasn't very good and the supervisor just sat around on his phone all day. It was pretty easy though.
good,"My experience working with this company was about average. I had good relationships with the other employees, although there were a few employees who didn't have the best reputation with others in the store as well."
good,"They stood up for each other and me in ways that I didn't expect. They helped me and were incredibly friendly. They never made me feel stupid when I needed to ask questions about the union and were quick to help me out when I was being scheduled for shifts that I shouldn't have been put on. Says it's good for students, but is very difficult to work with when unexpected things come up. It's a nice place to work, especially if your starting out. It gets you experience dealing with difficult people (coworkers and customers alike) with amazing people to fall back on when you need it. It's very easy to stay busy."
good,".....kroger is a great for high school i really recommend it to every one in school, the give a great benefits . also they you get to meet a great people and you will meat a great management team ."
good,The work wouldn't be too horribly demanding so long as you kept up with it. The managers were fair and they would do what they needed too. Rushes could be a little difficult to handle but other than that it was fine. I liked the people i worked with but the pay was a little low.
good,I'm mostly holding this job to keep my head above water until I find a better paying Full-Time job that will allow me to provide a more stable life for my daughter.
good,"my day start  with check over the department for bad  quality  and see were I need to start priority of the dept. that I great customer service  skills .  the hardest day is when I come in have the break down all the pallets throw trash, crush boxes ect. work by myself .the fun thing is working with others ."
good,"The company has changed over the years, currently understaffed with more responsibilities. Hard to keep associates anymore. Pay needs to be increased to be competitive."
good,"This job was good for being a part time job to pay the bills. With previous work experience (minimum of 3 years) you can make also $12/ hours which is great! It’s definitely the average customer service job. The management is okay, wasn’t a huge fan. Overall, it was good enough to pay the bills but couldn’t imagine staying there for a career."
good,"Working there was alright. I wouldn't say it was bad, or good. I liked being able to do my own thing and walk around the isles fixing things, it was my first job."
good,"I have worked for kroger stores for a year, but they dont get enough hours and no pay days off. no benefit. I just need more hours and better pay. location was good."
good,"A lot of people that get the job don't put the effort in because there isn't much of a reason since the union keeps bad workers on the job. If you do a good job you get to do other people's job for no extra pay. Our Location is a ""focus store"", meaning we aren't that good and we have to be watched, and we get bad managers that they refused to fire. Maybe other locations are better, but it's not that great at ours."
good,This job was really easy the only thing that made it suck was retrieving carts at any time and in any weather. also I would recommend having lots of patience because things can get very complicated with certain shoppers.
good,U have to be able to work fast and safely. It's a good job with great benefits. I have really enjoyed working at Kroger and have made some great friends
good,It was definitely an experience. I worked all over middle Tennessee and met some great people. This company gives you an opportunity to move up and work towards a career.
good,I've worked for Kroger for over 31 yrs now. Vacation time off is pretty good. Upper management is always in the building it seems . Snotty customers and times
good,A typical day at work was fast paced. I learned how to keep up in a fast paced environment. I also learned how to make small talk with people. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with people.
good,The staff and employees are friendly amd willing to help. Management do not however really appreciate the employees. Some are slow in reacting in things that need to be done.
good,This job will not let any college student off on any holidays to go back home to see their family. Do not work as a courtesy clerk there because it is the worst job in the entire store
good,"Through expansions and contract changes, Kroger has become a better place to work at. An associate is able to make enough to pay most bills in a simple life style, along with saving money through employee discounts, and holiday discounts, and fuel point at Kroger fuel pumps."
good,"A typical day is opening up the store running all daily tasks like register readiness, computer checks, till counting, lottery sequences, and checking the scheduled workers for the day. Welcoming customers. Hardest thing to do is being limited staff to assist busy store. Most enjoyable part is seeing the smiles on customer faces when you've made their day."
good,Fast paced and busy workplace with kind and loyal customers  I see the same customers almost on a daily basis and I get the chance to make their day better or worse by the way I hold myself
good,"my coworkers are great"
good,"The typical day is rather stressful, trying to clean everything by myself while helping anyone who asks for something before I'm supposed to clock out. I'm not allowed to really close the deli until I leave. Co-workers are generally friendly. I learned how to be on my toes and to not express my stress through my facial features."
good,Typical work day for me is mostly controlled chaos. Fridays for Clicklist get pretty busy. Enjoy getting exercise in by shopping for multiple hours a day.
good,"Typical day at work is cycling trash cans, sitting at a register, and handling cash that is collected throughout the day. The job itself is easy, the worst part is the customers. The customers are frequently rude and sometimes even provocative/threatening (people are rarely happy about having to buy cigarettes and/or gasoline). If you need a steady job it's an okay place to be."
good,the pharmacy is very fun but often stressful due to lack of hours given by the company.  The hiring system is very flawed and needs some major improvement especially for the pharmacy department.
good,"A typical day at Kroger involved many positions. You could do anything from deli work, front end, stocking, or produce. Just like any retail company it revolves mainly around customer service. At Kroger I definitely learned some awesome customer service skills and how to work with the public in a professional manner. The management at Kroger is typically highly organized and structured to achieving set goals. The most difficult part of working here would be working the lot on extremely rainy days., but other than that Kroger is a great company to learn some good customer service skills."
good,When working you make a lot of really good friends through coworkers and through customers. A lot of the times people get cross train for another department and it’s a bit different but fun as well.
good,Kroger is a good company to work for. I think they can be a little unprofessional at times but for the most part I think if you just go and do your job you will be ok.
good,"In the department I work in ,theres day were it can get pretty crazy  trying to fill all the orders coming and making sure the product is fresh and not out date.There is also calm days .I have made many friends working in the clicklist department and i am glad they gave me the chance to come work for them."
good,I worked at Krogers for about 6 months and they said that they were always flexible with my schedule and that was not the case. They would schedule me on days that I told them I could not work. There were many days in which we were behind on orders because the manager would just let the morning shift screw around leaving a bunch of 16-18 year olds to have to work really hard to get orders ready before the costumer got to the store. There were many angry customers but its hard to run a business when its run by young high school kids in the evening shift.
good,"Great place for high energy workers, but could still perfect customer handling. Weekends are tough to train new hires in that area. Also, understandably communicating to the prep room is not easy when no one is there to maintain organization and check for requested items."
good,"If you need extra change in your pocket or to help with groceries or everyday things this will be the place. On the other hand, if you need bills paid or a car or a house this is not the place. Very low pay. "
good,"I worked evening shift many people come through after work. Kroger was near a university, so there were university students worked there. They were always upbeat."
good,"The management is not serious enough, and play favorites. If your a good employee, they abuse you, because most others slack off, and it's impossible to get fired."
good,"I loved working here. I loved the Customers and the workers. I even loved the atmosphere. The only thing that I had a problem with is, the managers seemed like they didn't care about my health."
good,"My co-workers are fantastic along with my managers and supervisors. It is just a job where you can easily be replaced by anyone, I do not feel appreciated. Baggers do everything plus bag and they have the lowest pay."
good,"Kroger is a great place if you are young and attending high school.  If you stay at Kroger beyond high school, the pay is average but the benefits are great.  The job can be very fast paced and stressful.  "
good,"While it can be like a family,  seems you can be taken for granted alot by management. The pay is not worth it and alot of time advancement isnt worth it either"
good,"its ok place to work their, if you can deal with the workers, bosses, and custumers. I have been thier for almost 20 year and i have learned much and how i learn is by talking to people. The hardest of the job is getting things done with out distaction, i do enjoy my job because of some of the people, so its an ok place to work."
good,Kroger wasn’t a hard job you just had to know your times n what job fit you better and the customers were always enjoyable and my managers n co workers were very sweet and caring of 1 another
good,This Kroger was always understaffed however they could never higher anyone because they were under corporate control so we were all forced to work more and longer
good,"Didn't work for Kroger unless they bought out Roundys after I left years ago. I will provide a review for Roundys. Owners had a history of flipping companies to make a profit; and were just looking to flip Roundy for a profit. The result was in-efficiency, and workers being used as pawns to make financial adjustments work out to their advantage when it came time to sell the company for a profit."
good,"Its not a bad place to work as far as the work goes.  I work in produce and enjoy my co-workers.  "
good,"The grocery store can be a fun place to work,but it also has it's challenges as well being in the smallest kroger in springfield and the oldest there are many things that need to be brought up to date and products that we may not always have,but we do hav high customer service ratings and customers tell us that we are some of the nicest people they have met in a grocery store and that is what i strive for."
good,Decent Job for a college student. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customer service. I learned in this job that self motivation and individual tasks are the key to success
good,"I started in my final year of high school. The management staff is very flexible and understanding, so long as youre reasonable in return (which is fair). The hardest part was the monotony and the most frustrating was the low pay. 8 bucks an hours does not make me a very happy lad."
good,The Kroger store I worked at was small. Everyone knew everyone. Easy to get along with coworkers. Hard part about this job was coming in at 5:00am in the morning.
good,Provided customer service where needed or directed.  Assisted with the packing of groceries for incoming customers.  Maintained the care and handled the movement of shopping carts.
good,I worked at kroger for almost a year. Definitely not a job for someone who needs to provide for themselves as they only pay minimum wage and start out part time. Management at my store was a hit or miss. Quit kroger for a better paying job
good,"No particular negatives about the job other than the compensation. Compensation is 4-5 dollars per hour lower than the regional average for similar work. Also, you will have to be hired as a temporary contractor first, then hired as a permanent employee after an indeterminate amount of time depending on your performance. For me it took around 3-4 months, but I've heard of some people working as contractors at the Portland office for over a year before being hired as a permanent employee."
good,I can be stressful at times. But most of the time it can be fun and an experience for someone who is starting out with a job. I cant say anything bad about it.
good,"I currently hold three different job titles which are Cashier, Self Checkout, and Customer Services Representative. At Customer Service, I assist customers with needed question such as where a product is or questions regarding a price of a product. I also work along side Management to make sure the front end of the store is ran properly."
good,"My job at Kroger decent. The job itself Is manageable and if you do want needs to be done and take initiative, you'll do okay. Moving up is a slow process and if I had started my job at Kroger a few years earlier, I might have more incentive to stay, but I need to be making more money at this point in my life and advancement at Kroger is too slow for a life that keeps moving forward. But Kroger is close to home and I do recommend Kroger as first job for any kid looking to get into the work force."
good,Management was okay not really that bad. Most days were busy due to it being a grocery store. I would recommend this job to young teenagers. It is a good first experience job. For adults with Children I would not recommend due to how much they pay starting off I worked there for two years started at 8.10 and left at 8.50 over a two year span.
good,"It wasnt the worst job ever but I probably wouldn’t go back.i was hired part time but I usually was given full time hours, wasn’t anything special regarding benefits but my coworkers were nice."
good,The pay is fair and there is very good job security since it is a union job. Some managers are great to work for but others are not. Since it’s retail working most weekends is a given.
good,Management and communication was better before Roundy's got bought out by Kroger.  Never knew what was going to happen on a day to day basis. I am glad for the opportunity to work there for 11 years.
good,"Kroger is the best grocery chain in Ohio. That being said they are demanding of their managers and speak of work life balance but rarely back those statements up with action. I was given six weeks of vacation, four personal holidays and four legal national holidays. I NEVER had a year where I was able to take all of my earned time off."
good,I loved my manager and supervisors. Very supportive and happy environment. We have good training methods for new employees. The Quality Assurance department was the best department.
good,Everyday was different nothing was ever the same. The people are very friendly and you never really run into any problems at all honestly. Everyone is very helpful.
good,Needs to improve on part-time time management. Work was constant and the team I worked for was professional. Enjoyed them. Wish the benefits kicked in earlier.
good,"I found this part of the job stressful due to our time frame. But the most exciting time. At Kroger we would flip a Seasonal aisle, really any holiday.  Like putting up decorations for Halloween, spider webs and ghost."
good,"I didn't enjoy the work environment, however I would recommend it to someone that wants a first time job. You gotta be a team worker, and not afraid to meet new people."
good,Working at Kroger would be recommended for anyone that is 18 or younger that is looking for a flexible schedule but trying to learn the worth of a dollar.
good,Kroger offers a flexible schedule and good home life balance.  I like working in a challenging environment where the pace is fast. I am however conerned about the grocery industry and where it's headed in the now generation.
good,Fast paced job where you have to multitask between many different objectives you need to complete that day. It gave me a great experience for work life but does not provide enough opportunity to stay there permanently and be able to live off the job.
good,"I learned several helpful skills while working at Kroger. I learned how to management my time between work and school. I learned good customer service skills, and I learned the importance of being organized in both work and outside life."
good,"The company itself does not really care about the employees, but the fact that that feeling is felt across the board helps everyone feel they are working together. It also depends on what department you worked in."
good,"It was pretty relaxed at first, but then it became very short staffed as Kroger doesn't hire people so people would be thrown around every department doing something they were't hired for. Pay is very minimal for the work that is being done. One good thing it their health care, as it is cheap; and also their schedule flexibility is great."
good,First you greet the customer then you bag they groceries or you're outside getting the carts and bringing thme inside the store. the most enjoyable part of the job was the customers
good,"It paid exactly what you think it would, but it isn't much (nor is it liveable). But if a pharm tech career is for you, then Kroger was a good company to work for."
good,"Co-workers help me get through the day! Along with my customers, who make me feel appreciated! I take pride in my dept, I just wish others would do the same!"
good,"I worked for Kroger for 13 years and 9 months, the reason I left is because the new employees were making more per hour than I was after 13 years. They are a unionized company. It is very hard to get full time hours there because they hire new people instead of giving the existing employees the hours."
good,"Kroger was a fun and energetic place to work for, you got to showcase your skills and move up pretty quick, if you showed the potential, I worked my way from counter person to head cook, than head baker, and I eventually started training others."
good,It shouldn’t have to come to a point where saving money for customer services isn’t called stealing. You’ll probably have to work harder than most once you start brand new but that’s how fast you’ll learn the routine. Safety and sanitation work is very important for you and others in the building. Food will be serve fresh out all the time so you must keep a glimpse of what you see around hot and cold food.
good,Kroger is a faced-paced environment that focuses on customer service and product.  Face to face interaction with customers is a joy of mine.  Customers that are either very friendly or introverted allow for fun challenges.  Kroger is not the highest paying job so you look for other types of fulfillment.
good,"Kroger was my first job after high school and it was a great place for me to learn about the working world. I gained a lot of skills that I am able to use today. The benefits were great considering I was part time, although that was mostly attributed to the union."
good,I like working here but sometimes it’s a bit stressful we have a lot of call ins and some managers won’t help you if needed but overall it’s not a bad place to work just be ready
good,"learned communication skills and being friendy. A typical day at work but has its own fun time as well, I was not happy with the Managment, great diversity of people. nothing difficult about this job."
good,"Employee discount helped a great deal, you get out of the job what you are willing to put in. you can start out part-time bagger and very easily move up and turn it into a full-time career"
good,"I liked working for Kroger, I needed more money and benefits. I’m a single mother of one. But I loved my hours 8:30-5:00 M-F. Co- works where great to work with. If they paid more I would still be there!"
good,Working at fry's was a mediocre experience. The management was sub par. The hours were not good enough to live off.  The breaks didn't help out at all. One ten minute break for every 4 hours.
good,They have a productive work environment coupled with daily challenges that make the day interesting. Upward mobility is accessible to those whom are career oriented.
good,Was fast paced majority of the time. There was always things that had to be done so not a lot of time to stand around. The part I enjoyed most about the job was the interaction with the customers.
good,"Typical Day: Come in,help pick orders, attend customers"
good,"Kroger is a good first job. However, some management requires too much of employees without providing enough time or pay. I learned a lot with my time at Kroger and I am grateful for that. They taught me what having a good work ethic is. I just believe they don't compensate employees enough."
good,"Schedule is rank based. Those who have worked there longer have higher seniority. Expect to be asked to come in early, and stay late. A good first job."
good,Krogers is a great company to work for. You hit the ground running and you have to apply yourself. Fast pace environment but can be fun. It is all what you make it. Training is fast paced but they give you time to grasp it.
good,It wasn't bad. It was just ok. Something's such as equipment wouldn't get fixed which left the job a bit more difficult. Otherwise it was decent......
good,I was only 15 when I worked here it was my first actual job it paid what I needed but I don’t think it’s really something to live off of I believe if you are having trouble this is the place to go to get you on your feet.
good,Its been many years since I worked here so a lot has probably changed. But back then it was a good first job and only doable if you lived with someone who was making enough money to support both of you.
good,Enjoyed working with awesome people who were willing to share their experiences in order to help mold and guide you in your career. The internship gives you practical skills that you can use in your future.
good,It was a fun place to work with motivated and hardworking people. Hours are flexible and the work load wasn't too bad depending on your department and coworkers.
good,it's not a bad to place to work and the supervisor's and managers are nice. you make lots of good friends at Kroger. The people who work at Kroger are nice to work with and if you need any help sometimes they're willing to help.
good,"The coworkers and customers are friendly, but, at the end of the day, friendly doesn't pay the bills. You have to get paid a living wage. They don't pay enough."
good,Management depends on the store you go to; do good and they will promote you.  They always do everything last minute.  Won't tell you where you are going or when to be promoted.
good,"Good place to work at, great pay. The pay does get topped out eventually under $18.00 an hour unless your in upper management. 😀😀😀😀😀😀😀 you do have to be open availability, must work weekends, holidays “thanksgiving” Xmas eve, but off Xmas day. If someone calls in, in your Dept expect a cap from the store for you to work that shift."
good,"Overall I would recommend this as a starting job. Kroger always has great opportunities to move up in the chain. There are times when its really slow and then it gets really busy. Working at a good pace is just something you have to get used to. Get into your own routine. Coworkers are usually friendly but some will try and take advantage of you if they are lazy at their job. Management didn't really bother the fuel center, which can be good and bad. I would say the only reason its bad is cause you don't really feel like you are part of the store."
good,"Kroger was a more dynamic experience and a fast palce environment, and one of the best things about working at kroger is that the environment is really competitive in a healthy way and this pushes you to become better and also whoever has the best numebers overall will get a prize."
good,It is fast paced and loved it but for personal reasons I have to leave ! The management was great most the time! I learned accounting and moved up very quickly due to my willingness to learn and always gave my best !
good,"Kroger is a great place to start but not to stay forever. It would be great for eventually going into management but other than that, there are better places."
good,Overall kroger is a good company work for since clearly I have been employed with for 10yrs and still presently there but the overall pay isn't enough to maintain normal lifestyles and wouldn't recommend it for someone with a family because more than likely you would need two jobs to maintain your financial life.
good,"Good work experience, Customer service, Stock shelves, help any customer that needs assistance, you must have a welcoming attitude because there is so many customers in Grocery work"
good,"They are a Great business to work for don't get me wrong but to further my career is what I am really looking for. I love Learning new things and strive to make peoples day that is the best part of my day working there. I did most of the front end from cashier and bagging to cash office and customer service. Typical day at work was helping customers to the best of my ability, answer phones, and keeping up with the needed documents when closing."
good,"It is a stressful job with a lot of work to accomplish with minimum amount of people. After the day, you have a sense of accomplishment as you help your customers and provide rewarding customer service to have people return to your department. The management personnel are passionate about their jobs and want to get the best out of you. The moral for the current store is very high even with all of the stress that the employees deal with day in and day out."
good,too much work and they are ungrateful. they are unclear of the direction they want and every boss above you has a different plan. very hard to continue to change.
good,Kroger opened up many different doors for me. Not only did it expand my daily thought process it also helped me continue to make a difference in the community.
good,Technology in Kroger is severely lacking . We are still using technology that is outdated and slow. Upper management doesn't care about the lack of technology.
good,"Personally, I love the people there but the hours can change depending on the time of the year. Other than that, I would gladly stay at that job but I don’t make enough to live on my own. And the maximum amount of money to make is 15/ hour. Not enough."
good,"Scan customers groceries"
good,I have been at the store for year. I’m going on 8 years and this is the first time I have worked as hard as I have worked in the last year with Kroger‘s it’s hard when it’s just you close in the deli when I came to the store I was supposed to be in the bakery the other day I did 17 cakes do you think they appreciated that no I am a hard worker.  Management doesn’t communicate with each other and that’s not a good thing
good,Great business with limited opportunities. Obtain a Bachelor's degree but wasn't given the opportunity to excel with the company. Overall it was a great experience.
good,"The pay isnt high, you learn for 1 day and then get start doing it yourself the second day. Management is decent but as a cashier you are stuck there for the whole shift."
good,Work environment was great and employees were great. I enjoyed stocking here especially when I worked produce because I liked my boss and the people I worked with.
good,I worked here for 5 years and enjoyed the environment and the people I worked with. I had a lot of education in many tasks in every part of the deli department. I was able to have flexible hours with my school schedule as well. I loved this place.
good,"As a courtesy clerk you can pick up hours easily and have someone cover for you easily. As a baker clerk, there are barely enough people as it is and if someone is not there with you it becomes extremely stressful and hard to be somewhat happy at work."
good,"When I began working at Kroger's, I felt like I was more than just part of a team.  I felt like I was part of a giant family.  However, just like any other family, it had its flaws and that was mostly due to the managers that worked there.  During my stay, we changed reviews and procedures over 9 times with each one giving us employees the feeling of doing something wrong.  Granted, some of the nicer managers were way more understanding and nicer than their counterparts and actually enhanced the overall job experience.  Finally, we went through over 16 different courtesy clerks by the time I left."
good,"To become full time full time at Fry's one had to work 40 hours a week for 12 weeks straight with no one taking a vacation.  Which i came close to a couple of times but management would on the last week give me 35 hours so i wouldn't become full time. I can't speck for everyone that has worked at fry's but that's low. short changing an employee for the company wouldn't have to pay full benefits. The costumers were great, the fellow employee's were great and the managers were sketchy (minus a few)."
good,"When filling your application out, please be sure to put all of your work be. This determines your pay. And also, be sure to be honest about your availability."
good,"love working, great coworker the work day can be hard but if you keep your head on a swivel you will do good.  the work place environment is great. management is OK, could be better"
good,"Starting wages are typically low, especially for women.  I enjoyed the working environment.  It’s fun, energetic, and very customer service oriented.  The work is mainly autonomous, receiving assistance only as needed.  Good training program with one and six month follow-ups."
good,"Fill, Bake, Cake decorator, put truck away, beakout.,  Everyone thinks the bakery is an easy job, til they start to work there."
good,"Management is not all the best, but their are working on it. All the management has come and go , but their trying to make the store a better place. The story isn't the best store , but it is getting better."
good,I have been at frys for 17 years and it has changed alot some for the better some for worse with the minimum wage increase compensation isnt as good as it used to be
good,"Have learned a lot of desired skills in operating a business and management, but will put in long days. The workplace culture can be fun, but also high stress. I really enjoyed working with the associates and customers in the stores."
good,"Handling DSD Vendors for four districts"
good,"When I was there it wasn't that bad. As long as you did your job and worked hard then you wouldn't be bothered. However, now I hear stores of good workers getting treated horribly because of their department managers not wanting to take the blame for something they did or because they are given too many task to do within a short time span, they aren't able to finish in a timely manner. Must have availability throughout the week, specially during the weekend. They give small raises, only by a couple of cents and 30 minute breaks."
good,Working at Krogers was fun. they offered incentive pay and the employees were very friendly to me as well as the customers. i was able to learn a lot from here.
good,Kroger is good place for teenagers in high school that do not want a lot of hours and responsibilities. The work place can be stressful sometimes and it can be hard to balance a work life with a personal one. The benefits are great but the amount of stress is not.
good,"In Clicklist you walk around the store for hours at a time and then have to stage the, often times, heavy to moderately filled totes. I was paid only $8.25 for walking almost 5-6 miles a day. And managers in other parts of the store don’t undertow appreciate the hard work that goes into Clicklist. Not a bad job at all when you get decent hours."
good,"Probably one of the best temp. jobs I've ever had. Great environment, fun coworkers, free treats at the end of your shift. Lot's of hours with all the overtime you could ask for. Hard to be on your feet this many hours if your older like I am. Great supervisors however go out of their way to help get you through your shift. Unfortunately my body can't handle the hours standing up at work or I would most likely still be working here. I recommend this place to all my younger friends needing employment."
good,"flexible hours but low pay"
good,"I worked as a cashier at the Fairborn, OH Kroger for 7 years, starting when I moved to the Dayton area for college. I was okay when I was in school, but once I was out of school, I was stagnant. At least at the store where I worked, promotions went only to those who were in ""the clique"", which I definitely was not, nor did I want to be. ""The clique"" consisted of brown-nosers, so I made the decision early on that I was not going to lower myself to their level. Since it was a union job, the pay and benefits were decent. However, the way I was treated when I left (or when I was fired, depending on who you ask) I would not wish on my worst enemy."
good,Was given opportunities to advance but had an issue with a manager and when I reported it was brushed off. Reported it to several people and was brushed off by all.
good,"This place was kind of a mess, but if you're not incompetent you can figure it out. There was a severe lack of guidance when I first started, and took a couple weeks to figure everything out, but after awhile it really wasn't too bad."
good,"typical day-  fast pace....the most enjoyable would be-  helping people, it makes me feel good. learned- how to be self-sufficient. the hardest part would be- top shelf stocking. management- over time, checking to make sure things get done. making sure the customer is happy."
good,They make you work like dogs for low pay .you run around like a chicken With head cut off.Like in all customer service the customer do become rude.The co-wokers are great.
good,"Fun first job but it gets stressful at times. Would recommend to not take it too seriously and not make it a long term job as it doesn’t offer much of a move up in postions or pay. Coworkers are usually friendly and fun as for customers, it’s never easy with them."
good,Management is nice and the people are friendly. There is always work to do and so that makes the day go by fast. Customers are friendly and everyone works together.
good,"Working at Kroger isn't really good. The mentality is that they put there customers first, then there employees. They are terrible at scheduling people to come in. Also, when you call out they will give you less hours the following week. They don't have enough people to work in all departments, but they don't hire anyone to fill in those gaps. So, your working long hours, or short hours coming in everyday."
good,In my time working for Kroger's company I am fortunate that they have taught me a lot about cooking and preparing food. They have taught me about the union and how to go about choosing a retirement plan that was right for me.
good,"Very busy, never bored, hard to work with some of the employees but most of the managers try to help where they can and are very understanding for the most part."
good,A typical work day starts out in the backroom where you assess the truck load. At the beginning of your shift it is determined whether you will be stocking or Facing (organizing shelves). We were so understaffed that the tasks giving were almost impossible to finish in an eight hour shift.
good,"Really nice work environment, the manager was nice and professional. I enjoyed my co-workers as well. it's a nice job start off at. It helped build my customer service skills"
good,I did enjoy working at Kroger's. I got along well with my fellow employers and i enjoyed helping the customers to what they needed. Kroger's isn't a bad place to work at.
good,"Fast paced, quickly changing environment meant there was always something new to learn. Ever changing promotions, policies and presented a welcomed challenge. Corporate, Managers and employees all treat each other with respect and work as a team. I enjoyed every aspect about my job except for the hectic atmosphere. Extremely short staffing made for schedules ranging from 2am-11pm with no form of structure. Managers go above and beyond to make up for lack of lower level employees. Filled in for multiple departments with no notice, which resulted in the opportunity to be cross trained. Amazing place to work when it is properly staffed."
good,"The job had Benefits and was Union, but with Union workers become lazy workers. There were some employees who took advantage it being Union. That is one thing I didn't care for. The hours sucked as well."
good,"A work night is basically going to the back of the store and taking the product out onto the sales floor, breaking it down and stocking it to the appropriate shelves. Management was pretty bad, but coworkers did their best to work when in same aisles stocking."
good,Was my first job and was enjoyable. Learned people skills and how to bag groceries. Employees were fun and enjoyable to work with also. Still shop there.
good,"Kroger is a great friendly place to work for. Working in the meat department, I learned how to cut meat, unloaded trucks in the early a.m., which I enjoyed. The atmosphere was friendly, my supervisor was a people person and very kind."
good,Company full of opportunity. Numerous opportunities and chances for are endless. Work/ life balance could be better. Very organized process to ensure best shopping experience for customers.
good,"Management tries to be accommodating, and most employees are friendly and helpful. It is best to apply if you are flexible and a quick-learner, as it can be a stressful environment. There are many rewards for customer satisfaction as well as safety."
good,being watched from the time I started to the time I left no concern for what anyone was going through it just wasn't the environment I was hoping for.
good,"If you are in high school or just starting college and need a little bit of money then this job is okay.  It's mindless and not too difficult.  Once you get your aisles done, you can help out co-workers.  Not all that bad."
good,Managed food production for grab and go. Managed a staff of 8 and produced several different types of cuisines for take home meals. The most enjoyable part was the creativity that was allowed and the hardest part was the lack of work life balance.
good,"Krogers taught me alot about customer service. On a typical day at kroger my work enviorment was always great, i was always happy working with the kroger family"
good,"Kroger is a secure fun work place out of the sun in the A/C as well as the heat in the winter, ten percent employee discount great co-workers little pay not a place to make a career."
good,"Kroger could offer longer breaks , more benefits and more hours but I guess they will in time.  I would work there again but only if they offered more hours."
good,When I first started everyone was so nice. I was their for 2 years and it just got harder and harder to deal with the hours I was given I was not given a lot of hours during the summer when everyone was coming back to work.
good,"Not a bad place to work, But not enough employees. And pay is not enough for the amount of work expected to be done, When other stores are paying 10 to 12.00 to do the same kind of work."
good,For a school student this would be a first good job and for a single person a great job also a good part time job for someone with a full time job already
good,"Very fast paced, sociable, and fine as far as work conditions go. I enjoyed the hands on experience given to me there, and being able to meet and talk to new people when they came through the lines."
good,"Kroger can be a very nice place to work with a lot of potential to grow and continue your education.  It was a political battle trying to obtain a full-time position.  I had to travel to other locations to obtain hours. The other locations were very accommodating, but the cost of gas for commuting made it difficult. Krogers has an overall positive environment.  The employee's for the most part are very friendly and helpful."
good,I love to be at work and if they needed me to stay over I would. there is room to grow in this company and they have really good benefits I hate I had to move back to NC because I think I could've gone far with this company.
good,"A typical day at work for my position was standing for hours and scanning groceries, and pressing buttons, if you were in express lane or didn't have a bagger available you bagged the groceries. The most enjoyable part was the other people, if you got to know them/had any time to talk at all, and the employee appreciation week/days. The store had spirit days and some days you were given a free soft drink or treat. On birthdays you got a free cupcake from the bakery. HR is good, but if your tender time wasn't up, you had to keep getting it up-tender speed is what mattered. You barely got to choose when you got your break, and they schedule you whenever they want to on the days you're available-no consistent 9-5 m-f stuff."
good,"Clean environment, fast pace. Employees willing to help each other out. Keeping shelves stock was easy. It is a easy job once you get the hang on it. Friendly environment."
good,"Greet every customer with a smile"
good,"I learned a lot about retail and customer service at this job. I learned time management, and how to deal with customer issues in a friendly manner as well as how to work fast pace."
good,This specific pharmacy is very busy. The management is very poor in that they are very involved in the backstabbing and drama of the employees. I did really enjoy the vacation pay and paid days off.
good,"I honestly enjoyed my time with the Kroger company, and when I originally intended on switching courses, I wanted to do it within the company. The management team that was at my particular location claimed that I was ""too valuable in my position"" and told me that they weren't going to let me transfer to another department. I was not even considered for another position, except for when I terminated employment."
good,Every store has a different atmosphere but the same expectations as far as respecting Kroger beliefs. I believe Kroger is trying it's best to keep up with the new and upcoming technology but may be having a difficult time keeping the associates to stay long enough to be dedicated. The retail atmosphere is what to be expected when working with the public.
good,"I did advance to another position in store easily, but the down side would be lack of hours and pay rate. Besides that management does there best to keep a safe and productive work environment."
good,great opportunity to progress in management skills and great opportunity to meet different people of all cultures and weekly pay was good for single households.
good,Working at Kroger was a great opportunity to meet and work with great people. I learned how to work by multi tasking and take on different tasks. One of the hardest parts about working at this store is pulling in carts when it's either hot/raining outside.
good,"Ok.experience, just alot of instability with department not ran right, and I want to upgrade to something better and move up! I had a chance to move up with something better I thought"
good,"Upper management is professional but un-realistic with expectation of part-time employees. They expect full time loyalty with no incentive. No ability to advance to full time without taking a store management position. If you are a manager, you can expect to be uprooted and sent to any store at anytime, indefinitely. Little to no notice. As a entry level position (part time) you can count on continuous non-sense and a lack of appreciation. The only true benefit of employment with Ruler Foods is the scheduling. You can basically dictate (to some degree) what hours you will and wont work."
good,night crew management sucks well just one guy that got on a high horse. you have to have your best interest at heart working here. never put someone else ahead of you. remember your there to work not make friends. if you think of other peoples needs ahead of your own in this company you'll just stay at the bottom forever
good,"We worked in the freezer and you stay warm due to how much and fast you work. there is always something to do, and they make sure everyone is being safe and aware."
good,Store director  on king drive wasn't that understanding or opened-minded. Staffing was fun and nice to work with. Customers was the best. Job was easy and fun
good,Very good place to learn how to interact with people. And learn how to manage a team. Management team tries to make events for workers. As far as hard as part of the job is sometimes you cannot satisfy all the customers. But the most enjoyable part of it is when you can help the customer.
good,Working for Kroger's was one of my favorite highlights.  You get to meet many people and form friendships with both coworkers and customers. The work environment always stayed professional and safe.  Most importantly they were always willing to work with you when you needed them to.
good,working at Kroger was a fantastic step in my life. everyday work was fun but challenging. management could use some work. the employees always make you feel like family.
good,"I had worked for this company for almost 5 years. In all that time, I worked in the front end, most of the time as a CSR. It was ok until they started hiring anyone and everyone without really taking the time to decide if they are a good fit for the company. I was happy that I was part of a Union and got benefits, just wished I got both better pay for as long as I was there and got better regular raises."
good,"Kroger is a great job for a college student, but advancing is not likely. Overall, it is really just a job and nothing more, but still, it is a place to learn a few skills and gain experience."
good,Kroger utilizes a recruiter to hire for their stores. The pharmacy manager was quite unprofessional and did not have proper supervisory skills. He has since been fired.
good,Have to bag groceries for customers and arrange items in the cart. have to bring the in the carts from outside to inside. Have to clean bathrooms clean around the stores and take out the trash
good,"Lots and lots of opportunity to socialize. That's practically what the job is, the side job is bagging and cleaning various things. Fun atmosphere and great people to work with."
good,Typical work days at Kroger's were fun. I learned alot from the Kroger's team. Management was fair with the employees. I enjoyed the customers who came.
good,"Ralphs is a great place to work if you are going to school because they are very flexible around your schedule. Although, the management is not very cooperative because they always flip flop your hours and don't communicate well."
good,They are growing and continuing to expand nationwide. It is very difficult to move up and the starting salary isn't all that great around 15/hr. They play favorites but if you can fit into the culture you should be fine.
good,"The location where I'm employed could use  a mangement  overhaul."
good,I am a single mom. working every other weekend and all holidays is difficult on my children.  I would like the company to rotate holiday coverage and  use tele medicine for sunday coverage.
good,"So long as you don't answer a question in a misanthropic manner, you are almost guaranteed to be hired. However, it is EXTREMELY easy to make a few mistakes and anger the (crotchety) older employees as well as any and all customers."
good,"My first full time job. Nothing here was special and you would have to work years to move up to a better position. I enjoyed the people, but not my ideal career."
good,Working for Fred Meyer is definitely a fun job. Easy going and a great way to start your working career. I worked in the electronics department and I quickly brought up sales. the culture is great and I enjoyed working with my peers and employers.
good,As one of my first job i would encourage someone to work there as well.  There's room for growth if desired. There's also a 401K match plan for people looking for long term.
good,"The benefits offered to you are amazing here, though I've yet to take advantage of them because I do not plan to stay much longer. The Click List department is still very new; some locations do not even have it yet. It shows because communication is not there and it's crucial to productivity. They expect way too much of you; You're expected to pick orders at 30 seconds per item, help guests find items by WALKING them to whatever they're trying to find EVERY time, as well as say ""hello"" to every customer you pass. This gets irritating to both employees and customers as we're there to work and they're there to shop. The system is definitely lacking. We're the black sheep of the store because we have to haul these giant trolleys around the store which some managers will tell you to keep it out of the isles and some will tell you to take them with you. Either way, customers will be annoyed by your presence and stand right beside you until you move. Pardon us for trying to do our jobs."
good,"learn how to deep fry chicken and for how long it takes, slice deli meats and cheese which was good, i like the work there. mangament was fine, and the best part of the job was when the customers come in and ask u to help them find something."
good,A day at work shopping for other people . Sometimes there maybe some really difficult customer orders. They may want something we are out of stock on so they may get upset because one of the departments don't are looking for. An that's a typical day as a e-commerce/ clicklist clerk.
good,Working with Kroger is a good and bad expierence I currently work at a marianos which is now owned by Kroger and the job environment (well at least in my department) was a great environment to be in fun and very nice people to work with. The management on the other hand was pretty bad. It's very hard to move on after level 2 really was for me because cross training was becoming very hard to get due to it being so understaffed
good,Kroger pays well and is a union job so you have the security that comes with that.  It is also understaffed and frequently changes ways of doing things to make the store look better but also put more strain on the employees.
good,"- poor training "
good,"A typical day at Kroger, you are busy and VERY busy. "
good,"While my team in the fuel center was highly productive and friendly, there were many issues I had with the job. The first being that the upper management, aside from my immediate manager, were largely unaware of how our department was meant to be run. The pay for the job was also unsatisfactory, considering our responsibilities  and inherit danger of working around motor vehicles and flammable material."
good,"Working as a produce clerk at any Dillions you have the immediate sign of pressure to make sure your product is more than perfect in a place that is just above par. A typical day is clock in and organize things you want them and find everything you need. Next you read some daily reports and usually get a surprise visit by the general manager, at the time, and has made you a list that goes against what the produce manager wants. The lighting on the display floor roast the products and the mangers blame it on the employees. I learned a lot about fruits and vegetables."
good,It depends what store that an associate works will determine their feelings sbout the job. Most management works with people's personal schedules. It is up to the employee to make the most of their job experiences.
good,Kroger's  store was a good place to work at but one thing that they did have was they would favorite each other. They werent fair. We had young managers that would fool around. And Leave the work to just one person. But over all good people and fun to work at.
good,"I had less than 10 minutes of training for a position I did not apply for which caused unwanted stress and a small hatred for the job. Nothing serious. I knew I was going to quit after the first few days because at the time it was a stressful, unhappy experience I didn't want to be a part of. Chances of me enjoying my job given the job I originally applied for would've been greater."
good,"The management team is sketchy at best, the customers are rude, and workers are treated badly. The hours are flexible but as someone in the bakery, I was worked to the bone until midnight constantly when I was supposed to leave at 9. It's fun to meet cool people but overall, stressful and a bad environment."
good,"My job was my life, I invested 7 years into Starbucks, 1 year as the lead, inside the fred Meyers. Great pay, although I was on an older contract, great bennifits, amazing co-workers, family oriented customers, but management was awful!!! There were few here and there, who truly cared about others but other than that, employess were treated like a number."
good,"I enjoy working with this company but iv'e been doing it for 12 years... I'm ready for something new... Also i would really like to find a job/ career where i can have my holidays and weekends off to spend time with family and friends.. I've learned so much from Ralph's. I'm ready to take what iv'e learned and apply it to something else in my life, like a new career."
good,"A normal day is pretty simple but stressful. Before 6 the manager would be at the store, so everyone would be scared and focus in working. He fired many people for the dumbest things ever such as taking a break when there was no carts out in the parking lot or garbage on the parking lot. But after he leaves, everyone having fun, being kind to workers, pretty much everyone getting work done and have fun at the same time. The teams there are like rivals, its like the front end people against the foods people. They're rude to each other and nice, but after I got promoted to foods my new boss was rude to the manager at the front end by calling her the ""Dumb,"" and other words I'm not allowed to say. The hardest part of working I would say was the schedule mess up. I requested off 2 days on the weekend of prom. I got the days off and after prom I get a phone call from my boss Joe, he asked me why didn't I show up to work on saturday and sunday. I told him that I requested off and he wanted to see me. The same week I get the phone call he puts me on 0hrs that week. He gave me a lecture for ditching when I never did. Than I get a phone call the next week saying that I'm fired for not showing up and not calling in. Sonja the manager tried putting me back in the Kroger system since I explained to her about what happened but she couldn't. But I would say the best part about working there has to be the workers, I learned alot from the people there, I helped alot and tried my best to be with them."
good,Job can become boring quickly but is very secure and great for young workers but mostly part time. The workers union is great at communication most of the time.
good,"The company itself was not bad, it is the managers, in which make it bad. Majority of the time, the associate will have to wait in between 15-30 for management to come out of their office to deal with a customer. Therefore, as an associate we are left to deal with an upset customer. Not only that, most associates never see management out on the floors or interacting with the customers, because he/she is too busy doing things that they shouldn't be doing, such as watching Netflix and etc. As a result, associates are left to basically run the store themselves. Not only that, associates are either halfway trained or not trained properly. Therefore, as an associate, you are basically forced to learn on your own or learn from a coworker with a bit experience. Moreover, breaks are sometimes forgotten and you are basically forced to learn to bring snacks for a ""just in case"" situation. Though it really seems to be bad, it is a very fun place to work at and they do very well with working with you and your schedule."
good,everything about working here is great other than the occasional manager being a stickler about small things and that the pay is absolutely insulting.
good,Good job to have good place to work they are limited on hours and they pay low. If they would fix there pay rate and allowed there employees to earn more hours then it would be a more better job because it is very hard to live off a Kroger paycheck at this moment
good,"A typical day at work would consist of being a cashier for 4-6 hours, then doing everything the courtesy clerks did not do before clocking out. As a cashier, I was responsible for doing all that was expected of me, and then any other grunt work that needed to be done before clocking out, including but not limited to: retrieving carts from parking lot, changing trash cans across the store, vacuuming the lobbies, putting unwanted items back on the shelf, taking damaged items back to their respective department, and wiping down every black surface in the store. The managers are average and usually the only time you get to talk to them face to face without them being too busy is when you are in trouble.  There are usually not enough courtesy clerks to help bag groceries, so cashiers must do it themselves, which takes up the cashier's and the customer's time. The hardest part about working at Kroger is the fact that the company can schedule you on days that you have said that you are unavailable. If there is a holiday on one of your days off, you are still very likely to work that day. On the brighter side, breaks and lunches are usually close to being on time and the company does have some very good discounts on many items and events. There is also a 7 minute grace period for getting to work, so getting to work on time isn't a problem for most people."
good,"My overall experience at Kroger was a delightful one. "
good,they pay well but the benefits are not that great . i worked there a while an the management is always changing and nothing stays consistent.management have a hard time communicating with each other . the employees are nice but thats about it . be prepared to work holidays and late hours if you have open availbility
good,"The main reasoning that I left was because of school, but I also had to leave because I wasn't being respected as a human being.  If you've ever wondered what a dead-end job looked like, look no farther than your local grocery store during the rush hours of dinner time."
good,Its a good first job to work at! Pretty flexible when it comes to scheduling. Advancing is hard. You'll most likely work other departments without having the title.
good,"When I first joined to work with Kroger they would give me a schedule for the week on who is coming in to work. the job I signed up to do was to be a bagger which means i put others customer food items in the shopping carts as they are paying for them. The job gave me very little time for lunch which i was so happy about I pulled through it and and made work for me, also the manger and the employees were very nice and approachable and this was also my first job before i joined into the army."
good,Co-workers were good with communicating with each others. Was easy to keep busy while working. Everyone was able to work together as a team and solve [problems and any other kinds of issues.
good,There was not enough workers for the amount of worker that needed to be done. It was a very fast paced work environment. I felt bad when I saw other baggers go outside for 4-8 hours at a time for carts.
good,I learned a lot from working for this company. but it does have its down sides. they are always pushing an agenda and anybody is replaceable. not saying that if you don't work hard enough you won't achieve your goals but more times than not its who you know that gets you where you want to go. the employees are great people tho and I had great times working with all of them.
good,A typical work day at kroger would be phones constant ringing and learning how to manager angry customers and help them get their fuel points back. I liked the job but certain aspects made it hard such as meeting a quota within a week of hire
good,"Typical day will usually be busy at the service desk"
good,"fast pace, fun co-workers, compeitive  company, work was fast easy simple and customers are great meet and greet, mangement kept store top of they toes job always got done"
good,"Nice entry job, but slow on moving people up to different positions. Communication is ok, but managers and employees should communicate more for better outcome."
good,"Kroger is a good, first place of employment for individuals needing a part time income, to provide flexibility to juggle school or another employment. "
good,"I have worked for Kroger for almost four years now and from working there I have gained a ton of experience dealing with customers, how to maintain a workplace environment, how to properly keep a department conditioned and well stocked with goods for the customer and much more. A typical day working for Kroger can be described as exhausting but you definitely will have a sense of achievement at the end of each shift. Management is pretty satisfactory. Workplace culture can be described as a busy environment for most of the day. The hardest part of the job is really just being able to bite your tongue if you are having a rough time there. The most enjoyable part is when you are enjoying what you are doing and it seems like you are doing a great job."
good,Working in the Deli can be stressful when busy. I learned how to cut meats and cheeses on slicer. I learned about different meats and how to make a variety of party platters.
good,"I work as a pharm tech in kroger and well lets just say for the 10.50$/hr pay rate, aside from gaining some experience for my resume, its not worth it. I can guarantee there are other drugs retail place that will pay more. "
good,I think working at Kroger is a decently hard job for little pay. I was willing to do the work but the pay for the hard work did not compensate well. But I did like the discounts they gave for the food.
good,"If you want to work at Kroger, I would recommend it for a good part time job. You get almost all the same benefits as full-time employees and its nothing too stressful. I will say that it can be monotonous, and it seems that management is constantly changing. It's hard to build any peer-to-peer relationships with anyone, when they are constantly on the move."
good,Dealt with account receivables customers through emails or phone all day.  Pulled invoices to email to customers. Answered 800 phone line.                         The management that I worked under are no longer working at Kroger due to cut backs.                               The department I worked in was very easy to work in as most co-workers had worked together for several years.                                                                                               Employees are all frindly and helpful
good,"Hard work but good people. Too much stress put on the workers and management expected the impossible from employees. Did not feel appreciated there. They expect you to do about a thousand different things at once, and when it's not done they get upset at you."
good,"I love the environment here. It's fast paced, the interaction with customers makes you feel you're making a difference, and you learn a lot. The poor pay, however, makes it impossible to keep this job. It is difficult to pay bills with a job that is barely above minimum wage, and requires you to have a large knowledge base and skill set. I will say that this job has allowed me to grow, and become a very knowledgeable pharmacy technician."
good,"Some days are slow and some days are extremely overwhelming. Since you're working with people who are usually sick, they are not always friendly. Coworkers are fun."
good,Kroger is a great job with great opportunities for advancement with your desired career. The company also has great benefits for you or if you have a family.
good,I enjoy work at Kroger. When I started I was in the deli and was unhappy asked to move departments. We need more people in click list though. We are using other employees for the departments they aren't in.
good,Kroger is a good job they to up their pay and treat their employees a little better .Also they to hire good managers and treat the workers good when they come do they work and no play around
good,"I've been with Kroger for almost 4 years now. I've grown a lot in the company, learned a lot of information and I also got the chance to learn do accounting."
good,"Kroger is a good place to work. It is only ""good"" because of the people that work there. Everyone works their hardest and is willing to help you where they can. I noticed as time went on that the company as a whole has a problem. They are one of those companies that believes the customer is always right and they do anything and everything to ""make it right"" even when they shouldn't. They bow to every customer and developed a culture of the customer is always right even if they aren't. Also, being in a union sucks"
good,"Showing up on time. A new customer needed help in the HBA aisle, and i helped  them to that area. Management is acceptable."
good,"While having personal issues with a few coworkers, the managers at Kroger are amazing. They are kind and understand, making it easier to bare any issues that crop up. Some people are not fit for retail I've experienced, but that ones that can work hard and be friendly make the environment much better."
good,As a Stocker we was under staff with unrealistic expectations. It's a Union job. In the orientation they make it said like you have to join the Union and pay the their fees. Even though they don't tell you that you don't have to join and they will still so call represent you still. BUT I did love interacting with the customers.
good,"Kroger was a great job, with great benefits & discounts. Good & positive vibes. I wouldn't mind working their again & I'll always be a Kroger plus shopper."
good,Was a good job to start out with. was a bagger moved up to cashier. Was a easy job but my hours were always random every week anywhere from 8-40 hours a week.
good,"Availability must be open for all shifts every day of the week. 50+ hour work week. Can be tough to get off weekends or for holidays."
good,Could be stressful at times. I do love interacting with customers. Getting to know them and making them happy. It is a fast paced job that keeps you going until quitting time. Makes the hours fly by.
good,"I enjoy the pay, I don't enjoy the hours. They don't work with your needs for your shift and don't care about you being sick."
good,I enjoyed the job at first. Then everything just became less about work and more about my private life for upper management (gossip and such). I just became increasingly unhappy as time went on.
good,"The job can be stressful at times and is fast paced unless it is a slow day, which is almost never. overall decent job that will work with your schedule."
good,"Pick N Save is not exciting. You will not be challenged much. The few things needed is good customer service, trainability, and common sense."
good,The job was okay !! We just needed more organized people !! An also they needed a person to keep up with stock ! The job is a great place u would want to be if you love drink an shopping
good,I have gained a lot of experience from Kroger management and the pay isn't bad but they isn't any work life balance at all. There is a path for advancement but its hard.  I've learned so much for this company and i am grateful but i've made a lot of sacrifices in order to be successful as far as time with family and my wife. Overall its a great company but its just hard to maintain any type of personal or family life.
good,"I enjoyed working with my co-workers in my department. I liked the fact that they would rewarded us from time to time in the breakrooms with meals and drawings. "
good,I enjoyed my time here but I did not like the job. It wasn't what I was looking for. I was promoted but my pay didn't change. I was basically doing more work for lesser pay.
good,I worked at Kroger when I was in high school. This was my very first job I enjoyed learning and working for the first time. I was even able to achieve being the fastest cashier at my job. The management rewarded me for a hard work and I allowed the store to be the top 25 in the district. The management was very nice and I enjoyed working in a fast pace environment.
good,helping people out with their groceries making sure they got what they wanted and to make sure they have a blessed day. l learned alot working with the people
good,"Overall, I like Kroger but the only thing that I dislike is the career path that I have to take in order to advance. I have a degree in fashion and I would like to stay within that field but I was told that I HAVE to become a co manager in order to advance within the company and that includes going for a corporate job! I can be relocated within my district meaning that I can possibly be sent from a marketplace to a traditional Kroger store and that would not make me happy. Lastly, I did not get much of a raise when i became the manager from 1 department to managing 3 departments. I learned how to be patient with coworkers, associates, and customers but many of the things I have learned was self taught as far as the job itself. You can advance very quickly though if you work hard and inform management."
good,"I was always a interesting place to work, you never knew what you was going to see or hear. And you really never seen management. They didn't even know your name."
good,"Flexible schedules, low key work envirnoment,however the management is poor and so is the overall attitude about the company. Breaks are real short,  employees would probably work harder if they had longer breaks."
good,very busy store and there is always a lot to do. hardest part of the job is dealing with the intense amount of customers on a day to day basis.
good,"It was a fair workplace, some slight performance issues with management sometimes but nothing too bad. Daily work was fairly straightforward as a cashier, co-workers were fine and the interactions with customers was fairly decent most of the time. There was just alot of instances where they didn't schedule enough baggers or other cashiers fr some reason or another or they asked you to come in on days off a bit frequently due to poor scheduling."
good,The store is very old and unappealing. The managers were disorganized and never seemed prepared for stressful situations.
good,"Great people, the new Mgmt Team is putting money back into the infrastructure. Changes are all positive. Many projects to manage, some support is available from the corporate office."
good,"A typical day at work, for me, is pretty stressful. The management doesn't do the best job helping the front of the store, but they help when they can. My immediate manager often leaves me to do her job and my job. My co-workers are amazing people though. The workplace is such a good environment. The hardest part of my job is probably being so busy all the time. I love running around and I really don't mind ""problem"" customers, but when I'm the ONLY one running around and dealing with customers, it gets old and really hard."
good,Everyone starts out at $7.55. A typical work day depends on the day of the week it can be fast paced or it can be SUPER slow. The management is terrible but in the front end it doesn't effect us as much but I feel bad for the other departments. Co-workers are like a family and we all try to get along because the the management isn't on our side.
good,I can do most of all jobs in bakery so they would be able to move me in any direction needed. breakout and setting up for the morning shift. I was able to learn more about selling and helping people on items they would need for their party and more. management for the most part was great. the hardest part was not being able to grow with the company.
good,Kroger was a new experience for me being that I was previously at a deli before working in a grocery store. Everyone there was pretty well mannered and got along with each other great. Only thing about Kroger is they feel like you should dedicate your life to them when you sign up to work there and the pay isn't all that great especially if you have no prior experience in a grocery store.
good,"What your job entails will vary by your work center. I worked in produce, so being in the coolers was the only downside. Since you may wear a jacket or undershirt, it's minimal."
good,"Kroger has a dynamic work environment and improves and individuals critical thinking skills and ambiguous problem solving. During rush and being short staffed was the hardest issue that frequently happened at Kroger. Looking for innovative ways to surpass these issues was a skill often used. For customer service and skills dealing with retail, a solid team effort and foundation is a must."
good,"This business is always moving and encouraging its entry level employees to do their best to seek promotion. Overall, this company has flexible hours for a student seeking a degree and it works well."
good,"The work was easy, Cashier and Customer Service. Co-workers were friendly but managers had no control of the store or what went on in the store. Managers were constantly going over each other and changing the rules, causing confusion"
good,I enjoyed working at the meat department in Kroger with my coworkers. The department manager is horrible. I learned a lot about how to deal with customers in a professional manner.
good,"Pick N Save is a decent place to work for, but if you don't plan to fast track to management it will be a dead end job that will circle around you. management is dependable on the store you work at, and since the merger with Krogers, the company has become more tolerable."
good,the work place is joy able the customers are the ones that makes my day . what I've learned since I've been at Kroger is my scanning process i didn't know all the codes to vegetables or fruits but i mainly know all the codes without looking them up
good,When you work at Mariano's you get straight to work. What you learn in your department is what your supervisor tells you to do. The management is poor. The co-workers are awesome they are all friendly and are easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job is when it's super busy and you are by yourself that day and you just have to do the job the best you can. The most enjoyable part of the jobs is the co-workers and the customer relationships i had there.
good,Great place to work while in high school or college. works around school schedule. decent pay but no work life balance. asked to do tasks no in your job description.
good,"I was a cashier. My main job was to take care of the customers needs. I checked in vendors, stocked shelves and accounting. I had some great co-workers. I loved the health benefits. After I got my degree I felt like I should be making more money but instead my hours got cut. I guess you can say that was the hardest part of my job."
good,"nothing special but it seemed like they had trouble organizing, i was lost in the system until i quit and then even after that"
good,very stressful job. it takes forever to get any sort of raise. good thing is if you're going from a bagger its easy to get a promotion.
good,"You will be trained to handle many customer service situations constantly. People will come to you for any and everything, so you basically have to know where everything is."
good,"Removing products from pallet and stocking own aisle"
good,Was always dealing with retail theft and cashiers who liked to steal. When it comes to management they were untouchable.
good,"Krogers was a fun and fast paced place to work for. You're working with different attitudes ,just like any other job but overall it was a place I enjoyed being at, they just didn't work with my school schedule."
good,Well first you would arrive and depending on the day and time of day you would either be slammed with customers or have to be making/preparing meat for later on in the day. If you were closing the department at night you would help customers until about 10 and have to clean the whole department with 2 or 3 other people.
good,a typical day begins with serving my usual morning customers. During my time working at Mariano's I have learned to be more patient. my coworkers always make it fun to be at work. the hardest part of my job would be dealing with rude customers. the most enjoyable part is building relationships with customers and making someones day better.
good,"Co-workers are fine and the managers are nice and understanding. First, you clock-in; then, you go to one of the supervisors and ask them where they want you to go, or what they want you to do. and, they will direct you to do something depending on how many workers and your job description."
good,I enjoyed my time at work as far as helping customer but the communication between associates and management need to be improved. The lack of communication causes a stressful workplace between associates.
good,"Extremely busy work place with lots of regular customers you cant help but bond with. Management had regular quarterly lunches prepared for employee appreciation day. I really enjoyed meeting all different types of people while in the retail setting. My lead technician was an awesome influence for me and my peers. I learned very valuable communication skills, while under stress, including different problem solving strategies, along with successfully participating with running a demanding pharmacy."
good,Doesn't want to pay enough for the amount of work they put on one person. Very high paced place. Great customers and environment. Benefits are good.
good,"Kroger could be great. Cons: They do not train their workers, The pay sucks, The hrs suck, drama, drama, drama, You get put on the schedule by yourself with the little information you are given. They don't really tell you anything like you can find your schedule online or how many break you can have. The scheduling is bad, I don't know why she don't have a shift coordinator or something similar to that. If you work with another person your job is easy but thats rare. Pros: The benefits are great, some of the management are friendly, The customers are friendly, The job isn't hard."
good,"A typical day is from 4am-12:30, working on varies tasks to provide excellent service and meet department's expectations for the day."
good,"The manager in my department wouldn't get off me, the new guy, about every little mistake made. It wasn't just me, either, it was the other new hires. I didn't even apply to be a bakery associate, I applied to work at the Starbucks. "
good,While working at Kroger I have learned that the customer is always right and that you should treat them like guest in your home so that they will contiune to shop with us.
good,"Produce is the hardest working department followed by deli and bakery. Produce is very fast paced and physically demanding and not very many women work there. In my short time there I was in charge of a section which included restocking,markdowns, and reordering needed items."
good,"The hardest part of the job can stem from poor management.  If the top does not care enough to get things done, the store slowly starts to look bad.  The shelves can be empty due to incorrect ordering or inadiquate stocking.  Poor scheduling can cause there to be too much help when it is not needed, or not enough help when it is."
good,it was a good company to work for. they pay good .they have good benefits.they carry more product than most grocery chains
good,"My typical day at work has to do with communicating with customers, selling gas, and other various products in the Kroger fuel center. I love management and coworkers. But my favorite part of the job is meeting and seeing the new customers and same old customers. I love being able to maybe make an impression on someone's day just by showing them a positive attitude and smile."
good,To be able to work with a good group of people thats takes responsibilty and makes the job easier. A few times we were short of people and the few of us worked harder and we stayed on time.
good,"Fun for the most part if you like science, and medicine. Management was not professional, and my pay would mess up weekly. My co-workers were enjoyable on a good day. The hardest part of the job is that only women were workings it would get a little catty at times."
good,"The typical day at work starts off before I do anything is count my tell while at the same time assisting customers. than help run the front department of the store while I am separating groceries that needs to be put back on the shelf. The great part of working their are the associates and customers, the hardest part is trying to help 6 or more people all at the same time. while working their I have learned how to communicate with customers and associates, understanding the customers needs and wants, and to be patient."
good,i enjoyed being at work because the employees and coworkers made it very pleasant. It was very hands on and very busy. My job was to sample cheese to customers and to provide them knowledge of the cheese i would sample on that day.
good,I didn't have too many issues working for the company itself. I was a part-time and had full coverage health insurance as a deli clerk. The only thing I would say I liked the least was the employees I worked with and the management at the time.
good,I enjoy getting to know people and learning skills that may improve my chances of finding a job subtle for me. Kroger was my first job and love my co-workers despite the negativity that stirs up. No one is perfect but we must act professional at all times. People never know who they are impressing when they are working. It could be your future boss.
good,a typical day at work was productive. I learned how to balance a register. the management was highly concerned with the well being of the store. my co workers were professional and fun. hardest psrt of the job was cooperating with rude customers. the most enjoyable was being quick for the customers.
good,"Kroger can be stressful or it can be self awarding."
good,"Some managers play favorites, but overall a good place to work for. The people were nice and you get great benefits starting as soon as you start working."
good,Able to keep busy because there was always something to do.  The hardest part of this job was to be nice to the customers that were disrespectful.  I enjoyed working with the other employees and management and seeing new people daily.
good,"I do not mind working for Kroger. I like working with my fellow co-workers, but jobs are very competitive to get and people get mad if you get a promotion over them. Union work so a lot people are lazy."
good,"Whether you are a student, partial retiree or looking for a career, Kroger has a job position for you.  If you are friendly, willing to learn and work hard there are long term career opportunities here."
good,Great Company with benefits but poor management. A lot of work and decisions made by underpaid associates. Enjoyed my learning experiences with the customers. Co- Workers some really great some not so great. The hardest part is filling like you could of done more but couldn't. The most enjoyable part was definitely serving the customers.
good,"It was fun to work with customers and to help to the best of my ability. Kroger does a better job of showing respect and helping the customers more than most stores. I felt like I worked harder than most employees and was kinder to customers, but others would advance up instead of me. I felt like I wasn't respected enough. I liked the atmosphere and the work however."
good,"I enjoyed helping the customers, and my co-workers. I wish I had a better manager. The hardest part of my job was being mistreated by some customers and my boss. okay place to work, the better employee you are the more hours you get even if that means taking someone else. pretty much do your own thing when you're not a grocery clerk."
good,"There are many very good employees, but there are some of them that love to gossip, create employee to employee drama that has dramatically decreased work output, and who do not wish to fully complete their given jobs. There are employees who do not call in and who do not show up. There has been multiple offenses of this, but no action has been taken. Just recently, the weekly schedule had been changed after the time allotted to do so. There had then been employees who had missed their shift and written up. Nearly all of their managers, however, are great and understanding of situations that happen outside of work, such as family and finances. They do not seem to have any problem in taking responsibility for the mistakes that occasionally happen. These individuals make it nice to work there, but having someone put there foot down on the employees who do not pull their weight, shirk their duties, and try to pass off their mistakes on others would greatly increase the likability of this place."
good,"Fun place to work, they usually work with your schedule.  Depending on who you work for the management is pretty good. They sometimes pick favorites but other than that good place to work."
good,"Depending what store you work at, it is all different. My first store in St. George, UT was awesome!! Great people and very organized place. Then I transferred to the store on 45th S. SLC, UT. This place has some good people, very busy store but not organized at all! I would never work at this store again. They just don't appreciate you. Smiths is a good company to work for though. Has good benefits, can transfer throughout the US. If you're looking for a fast pace job then this is for you!"
good,"Easy to get into, and it's very hard to get let go from. If you work hard and have decent people skills you can move up. The pay isn't great but all things considered a good hourly job."
good,"Typical day at work would be stocking shelves, scanning groceries, helping customers and associates. I learned how to do multiple departments and use my time effectively. Management was always good to me and I have only good things to say about them. They always gave me a chance. Loved my co workers a lot of us keep in touch. Hardest part of job was not having enough help most days but I would always adapt and overcome. Most enjoyable part of job was seeing the company and our store grow daily through the ups and downs."
good,"A typical day at work would be taking prescriptions, billing and communicating with different customers insurance companies, and communication and helping customers. I have gained a lot of experience in the medical field that I believe will help me achieve my career goals of becoming a Physician Assistant specializing in orthopedics.  "
good,"A typical day at Kroger is pretty busy walk in help customers unload the truck work the truck make sure everything your ordered came in. Help up front either bagging or checking. Setting up for the seasons and holidays doing end caps and planograms."
good,A typical day at work is preparing different salads and hot food.  I have learned quite a bit being from the medical field.  This position is something I have never done before.  The management is a great team who are fair and interested in me as a person.  I love my co-workers.  We not only work hard but we manage to make it fun.  The hardest part for me was all the physical work that needs to be done but after a year I have muscles I never knew I had.  The most enjoyable part of my job is making the customer happy.
good,hectic filled with stress. how to direct my anger into a positive. no respect for employees. no respect for themselves. going to work. getting off work
good,"typical day at work:"
good,A good company to work for if your looking for job security. The company pays well if your willing to be management. I have found the problem with the company is that you have no time for a social life. The schedule for when you have to work gets posted the last day of the week. and your online schedule will never match the in store schedule due to last minute changes by management. The company wants to run the stores on a skeleton crew and expect you to complete every job as if you have a full crew. The bad news is they will pay part time only minimum wage for a night full of hard labor.
good,"A typical day at Kroger begins with conditioning, making each self look like a brick wall. management was terrible, co workers didn't work together as a team."
good,This was a good job. It was a very good job for me being in high school at the time. I was a cashier and I also stocked the shelves at night. The did offer employees a 15% discount on all items in the store. They pay wasn't very satisfying and the management never seemed to be of any help.
good,"Good starter job. Job duties include merchandising, stocking, cashiering and being a utilities clerk."
good,"We had a very nice lunch and break area with table and chairs, I was fired unjustly due to a Kroger plus card. Mgrs and Assistant Mgrs. using their cards for discount to customer , I put in a phone number for taking discount , this was taken  and received and a disagreement ensued concerning this incident, I feel this was a unjust and misunderstood happening.  I was very disappointed because I really liked and enjoyed my job of 23 yrs."
good,Kroger has a good system and work ethic that anyone can be okay with but there are alot of people that will set you up or give you the short end of the straw.
good,"a very stressful job with a lot of turn over. you don't get much money for the work you put into the job. but when you help customers and you make the store a better place, its rewarding in that way. most people are friendly."
good,"A typical day at work can be challenging depending on the shipment that came in that night,the conditioning of my work area and whether or not we had enough members to complete the task that particular night. Over the several years of being employed by Kroger, I've gain interpersonal skills and the ability to multitask.Poor management! My co-workers are all hard working individuals. The hardest part of my job is working throughout the night. The most enjoyable part of my job is, the moment I satisfy the customer by providing them with whatever it is they're seeking."
good,"Supervisors were more friends than supervisors, they showed favoritism. Workplace was clean and a somewhat friendly environment. Most enjoyable part was making a customer smile and helping them with what they needed."
good,"enjoyed working there, Associates are very friendly and enthusiastic . Managers are very friendly too and helps you where necessary. they don't boss you around . The only bad thing is that the pay grade is low"
good,Is a good company to work for if you only want to work Part Time. Full Time positions are not readily available to everyone.
good,"The day would often start with a lot of hand washing and pleasantries between coworkers, and if the time was right, lots and lots of customers. The chefs working with us were very nice people, though would be more irritable later in the day, as customers and (after the manager change) bad scheduling would grate on them. Some coworkers are very good people, others are very bad people, it's a mixed bag, and you never know who you're going to be saddled with. Some employees will carry their own weight and far more, going above and beyond, while others flippantly refuse to work unless someone important is watching. Some coworkers would often verbally abuse others, and higher management would usually ignore reports of bad behavior unless the union was called. Higher management punishes those who report bad behavior anyway, usually by actually enforcing the rules they usually ignore on those reporting. If two employees have a conflict, the aggressor will usually be ignored, while the victim will be watched closely for rule breaking, and sometimes given untruthful punishments for things like ""insubordination"" when no rules have been broken. Upon the month many employees were laid off, including me, a new manager was hired to make the structure of the location more like a Walmart (not hyperbole, those were his exact words to me) and replaced our existing deli manager with one that had been a manager here before, but was previously replaced due to complaints of incompetence."
good,Fun staff and enjoyable customers make any day a good day. Kroger does their best to satisfy the customer. There was no hard part of the day if a positive attitude was kept. The most enjoyable part of the day was to know that the customer were 100% satisfied with their Kroger experience.
good,"It is a fun place to work at, but at the same time things can be rough"
good,"I am a people person. Meeting new people amazes me, and also I learn different things from them. I love the attention they love getting from me by making sure I know their names or asking how was their day. Knowing that I may can turn that frown into a smile, makes my heart smile. The customer service I provided is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"on a daily basis I make sure that my team is alert and providing quality service as a customer service rep I help manage the floor making sure things go smoothly and making sure that customers are happy. I also handle money services such as money orders, western union & till drops and balances."
good,i was a floater for the most part but when i settled into a permenant store...many of my co workers were'nt as welcoming and it made work very uncomfortable.
good,I would come in at 5:00 am and start on the books by balancing the tills first. After tills were out I would move on to balance self check out. The store would open at 6:00 am. After the first cashier was at work I would move on to the lines and looking for shortages . After the books were closed I would come out and open customer service. Once the customer service associate arrived I would move on to giving all of the front-end associates their breaks. On Sundays I  came in at 4:00 am to do the payroll for the store. My responsibilities were to make sure all they associates were paid for the hours they worked and post their hours in kronos.
good,Easy job. Taught me how to stock and rotate and how to operate RF gun. Management is typical. Co-workers are nice. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the cold. Most enjoyable part of the job is friendly coworkers.
good,"A typical day at Kroger consists of tons of transactions and lots of customers. You won't get bored. However, some of the members of management can be difficult to work with. Most of co-workers are easy going and fun to work with. The hardest part of my job is dealing with irritable and rude customers.The most enjoyable part of my job is the friendly customers that I see regularly that always speak to me and make my day a little better."
good,"A typical day at work would include, bagging a customers order, jumping on a register as needed (if we got too busy), and attending to customers needs. This job taught me that you cannot please everyone so you should pick and choose your battles. Customers love to be heard, so listen carefully and engage. Management at my store was awesome, but you do not interact with them often, instead with a front end manager. My co-workers were very sweet and willing to help with anything anyone might need. The hardest part of this job is definitely criticism, not only from managers but especially from customers. They are not afraid to tell you that you messed up, or something is wrong. I personally, love being around friendly people, and by that I mean my co-workers. I loved them!"
good,"My workplace is very fast paced and organized. My actual position on the assembly line could change any time of any day depending where my supervisors feel we need the most help. It varies from manually filling prescriptions and labeling them, to bagging and stapling paperwork to the drugs to be processed out. It is very important to be ACCURATE to ensure that the right customer receives the correct drug assigned to them. I've learned quite a bit working in this facility. Mostly, drug names and their purposes. (Generic to Name Brand). Along with ""sig"" codes, proper dosage forms, and liquid medication measurements. I've taken two Kroger certified test which gave me raises, just for acknowledging what I know. The management here are friendly and they are always looking for ways to make our jobs easier but, also maintain our quotas."
good,I learned alot being though i got promoted 4 times in 18 months. I have grown within myself and in the company in the 3 years i have worked there.
good,Would typically work 10-12 hours. Store Manager was very helpful and i worked well with him.
good,"This grocery store is superior in offering a wide variety of goods.  The customer service model implemented at Mariano's is wonderful, with the main focus always being the customer."
good,"The usual day working at Kroger would consist of keeping the dept clean, cooking and preparing food as well as providing excellent customer service. My fellow associates were lively and made the job three times as enjoyable compared to being alone. Managers at Kroger were a bit iffy, you had some decent ones but most were ok and fun to work with as well. After leaving Kroger I have learned that just some if you can enjoy what you do, life would be better for you, your peers and for customers"
good,Enjoyed my position as Sales Consultant and Fine Jewelry Auditor
good,"I learned to work on computers, fix registers, computers, printers, order supplies needed for employees to do their jobs."
good,"They gave me minimal training, for all the videos and reviews about box stacking or selling tobacco to minors, I was given very little information on how to actually work the cash register. I was not informed on processing WAC, or dealing with errors of customer cards. I found myself having to call up a supervisor constantly."
good,i have been with Kroger for over 21 years and i have seen a lot of people in many ways. Working for this company has allowed me to talk to people and have hope for myself in my occupation at the same time. Everyone has to eat so i guess that is why we all feel so secure about our job.
good,this job requires a lot of attention and you have to complete tasks that you dont have the time to do.
good,"The best part of this job was that you are guaranteed a raise every 500 hours you worked, they also ask which direction you want to advance in. They are also constant with their hours. If you ask for hours they will give them to you. The management wasn't very nice and they did take 4 months to get my drug test in."
good,"Reset work"
good,bagged groceries and stocked shelves. met alot of good people and enjoyed most of the work.
good,"Typical day: I was assigned to mostly night shifts which was okay. The morning shifts go by a lot faster and are thus more enjoyable. The particular store I was at got shut down and the culture and the repertoire varies from store to store."
good,This was a fun loving staff to work. Never had a problem working around your schedule. Made it a place you didn't mind working
good,"Some days I didn't mind working there and some days I did. I loved when I got to be up front dealing with the customers and setting up flowers for them. I didn't like when I had to be in the back room for hours setting up flowers by myself. I'm definitely a person who's very comfortable working with others and alone, but sometimes (especially since the work was repetitive) it got lonely being in the back room for hours at a time. I enjoyed being able to talk with some of my customers and loved making custom flower arrangements for them. It gave me a chance to be creative and show off some of my design skills. My co-workers were also great. Loved my supervisor. He's such a nice and funny guy. The best feeling was when I'd only just arrived and was asked to make a flower arrangement for display. I had a day off and the next day when I came back, I found out that my arrangement had been bought in bulk for a private party and everyone on the team was making my creation. I definitely learned how to be creative and use my resources in a new way. The hardest part of the job was the heavy lifting when it came to filling and dumping all the flower water buckets. But, just do like I did and think of it as a great workout. ;P Most managers are really nice and understanding, while others just didn't seem to be particularly nice. Just gage who you're working with and how to act around them."
good,kroger is a good job to start off with. I think i have out grown the job so I am searching for better. The mangers are ok They do not award you when you are doing your best at your job
good,"The best thing about working for the Kroger Co. in my position is the  opportunity to meet many different cultures of people,       feeling as though I don't have to travel, my passport is my job I see, I talk, I learn."
good,Was an ok job. co workers just wanted to sit around and talk. You cant have any piercings. A lot of customers and many times you are alone working the area
good,it was a good overall experience is good. management is great and benefits are good and life to work balaqnce is great.
good,"Roundy's is a great place to work for a short term or part time. They value customers and most managers and employees were friendly, polite, and helpful when needed. Its also a great place to shop, they have weekly sales and coupon ads that offer great discounts. However i would not reccommend it for long term employment. There isnt much room for advancement."
good,"In a typical day at Kroger as a customer care representative/accounting office clerk I would more often than not split my time between all of the available tasks on the front end including bagging, cashiering, supervising, and running the self check out center as I cover for breaks or help manage large rushes. "
good,A typical work day consisted of coming in and stocking shelves with product to be sold to the customers. The management team was quite nice and very respectable. Some of the coworkers had bad nights as is expected. The hardest part of the job was filling the required product in the required time. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning a new experience.
good,"Keep up with displays, milk, and eggs.  Unload trucks when they arrive at the store. Order products for the store. I learned skills to work with public.  I learned to be flexible with my availability.  My management was good in some aspects and bad in others. They weren't good with communication, employees didn't understand some things that would happen in the store until a couple of weeks later.  The co-workers within in my department were mostly dependable but others within the store are less dependable and can your job harder at times. Hardest part of the job is working during the holidays and weekends trying to keep up with the demand of the customers.  My co-workers within my department were the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,started as a sacker and worked my way up to customer service. It was a great opportunity to get my work career started.
good,"I leaned how to be quick and safe when stocking.my co-workers really help me get ajusted to the job.the hardest part of the job is going in the cold.the most ejoyable part of the job is just coming to work with my co-worker,it's real fun."
good,"I will say that with a union, you have some very strong job security. But you also have the opportunities to move up within the company if you choose."
good,"Usually work days are busy, filled with trying to get customers checked out in a timely manner. From working at Kroger, I've made numerous friends; even some who I hang out with outside of work. The hardest part of my job is keeping up with the demand of timely checkouts because the volume of customers just keeps pouring in. The best part of the job is getting everyone checked out and having a bit of down time and get prepared for the next rush of customers."
good,Had fun working in deli interacting with people.But i was not train right and i was left alone to closed up.
good,"Your shifts are lax...the coworkers always have fun together. However, scheduling is terrible. Your hours change constantly without notice, and management goes outside your availability often. "
good,"This was a great job in High School, mainly because they would work around my school schedule. The people were great, and very helpful at first. I was a deli worker, and I would also help out with the front and customer service."
good,"A typical day working at Kroger is good, fun and very entertaining. With it being a grocery store, so many different types of people come through the store. Since working at Kroger, my attitude has gotten a lot better. I now speak to people without being spoken to. My co-workers are great. We relate a lot and get along very well. The hardest part of the job would probably have to be... Honestly there aren't really any hard parts to the job. The most enjoyable part is the relationship I have with my co-workers. It makes the job go so much more smoother."
good,"I had worked for this company for  years, started out as a minor making $5.35 in which I worked so hard, I got to see people with the worst work ethic advance to better paying positions with better hours because of age and when I finally turned 18 I was bumped up to minimum wage at 6.35. The three and a half years I was there before being 18 should have counted towards a pay raise, however it didn't. I got to see people my age get a pay raise as well as break rules as they were favorited. I had worked in almost every department. I loved my co workers as I grew up with them and they were like a family to me. My management would change every so often however they all played favorites as well. The hardest part about this job was investing six years into this company only to be topped out at $7.90. The most enjoyable part was the people I worked with as they were the only reason I stayed so long."
good,"A regular day would consist of-"
good,"The average work day is more or less the same. Sacking groceries and pushing carts is what you do most of the time with carry-outs and take-back on the side. In the summer, it gets draining due to being out in the sun part of the time whereas the winter can be rough when it rains. Management, overall, is good. A notable trait about management is the upkeep in the store is sloppy. My co-workers were nice and good to be around. The hardest part of the job was pushing carts especially in the summer. The most enjoyable part of it is getting to meet new people."
good,"Assisting customers with a great experience at Fry's. Management isn't the best with helping there employees to expand in the company. Co-workers are great and always lend a helping hand. The hardest part about the job is helping an angry customer, but yet it can be the easiest too."
good,opened stored pulled sales counted cash and balance cash drawers and over/ short for the store. got deposits ready for armored car. Wrote four weekly schedules. set up new employees. Retail has a high turn over rate. Ran customer service. answered multiple phone lines. The hardest part of my job was keeping the frontend staffed efficiently while staying under allotted hours.   
good,"If you're a cashier, and the day is slow, you have nothing to do. They don't always give you the time you ask off for and they constantly expect you to come in on your off days. Your coworkers are friendly and fun and meeting new people is always interesting. You have some different people that come through your line."
good,"Typical day"
good,I worked for Fred Meyer for 6 years and got great benefits and good pay. I learned alot from customer service to merchandising and being a Person-In-Charge
good,"the work was fun just as a cashier, but stressful when I moved up a bit too stressful, the manager when I started was very efficient, well mannered and knew how to do his job. The next manager was the same but the current manager doesn't know how to give constructive criticism well at all. A lot of the co managers were nice and knew their jobs really well. The hardest part was the dealing with the constant barking of orders and being told by a manager to go tell someone that they aren't doing right then them coming back and yelling at you cause you didn't grip at them enough or something. the most enjoyable was the customers and the co worker. Also the benefits were very nice. it was only 5 dollars a week for insurance"
good,"Service Deli Clerks are responsible for preparing, slicing, wrapping, weighing, pricing, and merchandising the department’s deli products. Deli products include deli meats, cheeses, salads, sandwiches, dips, gourmet and hot case items. They inform customers about our deli products and services and help increase sales by handing out food samples and by recommending additional items to customers. They work with equipment like fryers and slicers, and use store intercoms to announce special promotions and weekly specials"
good,"It's a place you can excel if you are into retail. If you are one you believes in giving your all and being a team player, you have a very good opportunity to climb the ladder."
good,"You would clock in, then you would go see the manger and ask what register they would like you at. Most of the time you were getting someone for break or leaving to go home. I enjoyed my co-workers they were very friendy and nice to be around. My hardest part of the job was trying to sell the Kroger credit cards. People just want to leave and i feel im bugging them. My most enjoyable experience was getting to listen to all of the customers stories and being able to communitcate with new people everyday. I'm a very social person and I enjoy to meet new people."
good,"Conduct plain clothes surveillance to detect internal and external loss within a store environment. Conduct internal and external investigations on matter affecting the company. Apprehend individuals involved in illegal acts. Comply with all federal, state, and local laws, as well as company policies and procedures when carrying out responsibilities. Conducts physical security checks. Makes recommendations to prevent loss and improve profitability. Partner with law enforcement and prepare case reports for criminal prosecution. Work in a multi unit environment. Complete thorough reports on all loss prevention related activities. Assist the District LPM with external and internal investigations as required. Testify in court and labor hearings resulting from loss prevention related activities."
good,Krogers is a great place for a first job. However advancement is hard for those with limited availability due to religious reasons etc. Most often late nights till 11 or 12 are required and the schedule is inconsistent. I am consistently running into the problem of not being given the hours I need. The people are enjoyable to be around for the most part. The job is fairly easy.
good,"A typical day at work would include giving the greatest satisfaction that can be given possible, working very hard to earn what is fair, performing all tasks and responsibilities in a timing manner, using my knowledge and intelligence to make the job much more pleasant and satisfiable when it comes to all tasks and duties at hand, and working within time to give all customers everything they desire. I have learned a variety of values which includes the value of being a hard worker and how that affects my life, working together in teams which I believe is important in any working field, becoming more of a responsible person when it comes to important tasks and duties that have to be complete, and giving myself into the motivation that it should require within it in order to successfully complete whatever goals I have that relate to where I work. My co-workers have been very supportive to the work that I have accomplished and I have the same feelings for them in regards to what has to be done at certain points in time. They have been there for me whenever I need more motivation to help me succeed and have made my life easier in the working field. The hardest part of this job would have to be the ability to maintain a time-consuming amount of work with thousands of customers coming within the store each day no matter what department you work in and the most enjoyable part of this job would have to be the people you can have conversations with about in regards to being social."
good,"Being in the grocery retail for almost 20 years I have learned to ""give back to the industry"". I enjoy teaching,coaching,and training the younger associates and watching them develope into key staff members. The hardest part of the job, and the most forfilling is watching the really good associates leave the store by promotions to either higher volume stores or to become department managers. My typical work day is always customer service. Making sure that we meet and greet the customers, ask them to come back,and have the right pruduct in the correct location. Always try to make the customer want to return and put one more item in the basket."
good,"Kroger is an enjoyable place to work. However, the income is low."
good,"Union.....pays very low...management can be good can be bad, depending on pay, they expect you to unload trucks with hand jacks, because they are too cheap to buy good power jacks/forklifts"
good,Great first job. Good work experiance. Gained interpersonal skills. Worked as cashier and utility clerk.
good,"Fast paced environment. Conveniently located, high demand place to purchase gas. Managers were easy going, Hardest part of the job was trying to close,"
good,"Spent my scheduled time bagging groceries; providing customer guidance, stocking shelves and cleaning when needed. Retrieved carts in all types of weather and at all times of the day or night."
good,"load trucks by hand and lift, clear convyers when they jammed up work values,attendence values. management ok,co workers we got along learned alot from the people.the hardest part of the job staying busy . the best part of the job was getting an education of all values of life that this job the people that i worked with taught me"
good,Pharmacy and managed care is secondary to primary grocery business
good,"A typical day at work would be bagging then the other 85% is on the register, checking/ringing customers up, while still providing my customer service that I have been trained and also like to give. My co-workers are great never have I had a problem with anyone that's whats kept me working in the same environment for so long, The team is great :)"
good,"Stocking,Filing,Reporting,Managing,Pushing,Pulling and etc... I did it all when it came to the grocery store and i miss the people and loved all my customers and thats the part i really loved about Kroger."
good,"get partime job, good benifits"
good,I learned how to write on cakes and slice deli meat and cheese
good,"A typical day at work started off with putting product back on the shelf, sweeping all floors, bailing cardboard,and assisting the manager in their morning duties. I enjoyed the people I worked with however everyone in the company wanted an advancement and positions didn't open up fast enough. Overall it was a good learning experience for me."
good,"Kroger is a good job, for someone wanting to work while in school (high school and/or college). At times, the job can become hectic and stressful."
good,My job was always busy from the start of the shift until way after my schedule work time.
good,"Kroger is a very diverse company employing workers with ethnic backgrounds. Although I have worked in retail, learning the register was different and fun. Management was great to work with. If you needed anything or time off it was not an issue. My former co-workers were fun to work with. I have learned a lot from several people about the job and how to work the register. The ""hardest"" part of the job is knowing the produce numbers when ringing a customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers. It was gratifying to hear them say please and thank and most importantly remembering my name."
good,"The only really big downfall to working for kroger is your wage, and maybe working different shifts every week but overall its a good company to work for."
good,"Kroger is a national grocery store chain. They also have a union. Without the union Kroger wouldn't offer any job security, no pay raises, no paid time off. I wouldn't work there if there isn't a Union. Even the Union is useless but they will help you switching departments and helping you when your about to get fired due to your own neglegence. Management is understanding and trust honest employees. You MUST sign a job bid to get full time. ALL employees are hired in part time."
good,Was a grocery bagger and lot attendant through my high school years. Parents wanted me to focus more on my school work than money so I had to quit.
good,Employees and managers were friendly. I enjoyed coming to work everyday.
good,This company has great medical and denta benefiets . Very organized with job security and the option of working on your day off .
good,It’s fun to work there it easy to get along with everyone but I’ve only gotten 2 checks out of 7 they refuse to do anything about it. They won’t give me any information about it neither
good,"Pay, benefits and employee perks is decent, biggest issue is understaffed. Kroger will not give the departments enough hours to schedule employees. It's not only at my store but all stores.  Dairy/Frozen is lucky to have any help, would love to have seen upper's come and do the job for a week.  Everything they want you to do-not enough hours in the day!!  Good luck to the new person!!"
good,One thing you may like while working at Kroger’s is getting paid weekly. The job will never be hard but it can be stressful at the busiest times but they pay very nice!!
good,"Majority of the reason why I stayed at Kroger was because of the flexible hours (as a college student) and health insurance. I have learned a lot and I like the fast-paced that it brings. However, as a college student, I would not work here for a long time."
good,"Days or nights are rather long and tiresome."
good,"Though the wages for starting positions may not be anything to write home about, Kroger is definitely a good starting job for anyone. Working there will get you used to customer service, as well as working fast and effectively. Management-employee relations can be tedious, but patience is another work life attribute that working here will help you build up. I will say though, If after 6 to 9 months you are not offered to move up, I would recommend looking elsewhere."
good,Kroger is a good place to work. The coworkers and managers is super nice and friendly this is the job i would recommend to work at and they put customers first.
good,I worked there because I needed money but the work is repetitive and boring. I knew it would be so I’m not complaining but it is also a high stress job.
good,"If you are a full time or part time student then this is a great place to work. They worked around my school schedule every semester. The pay is not great, but the insurance is very cheap."
good,Liked Kroger but a lot changes caused me to resign. I loved meeting new people I loved helping customers. Loved my job it was perfect until the changes. The changes did not agree with me or help me any
good,In my position I felt like I was constantly fighting a losing battle. The company expects employees to do more without paying more.  This seems to be the way all companies are going though. The jobs themselves aren't hard per se. It just always felt like a struggle.
good,"Good place for a first job.  Started off as a deli clerk, and worked my way to a cake decorator. Everything was good from the start, as far as work.  The management could be better."
good,"I worked from"
good,"Pushing carts day/night, hot/cold. Stressful and fast paced, must stay on top of it at all times to ensure costumers have carts. Starting with bagging for a month or two and then you become a cashier as well."
good,"Overall, working at Kroger has its good days and bad ones. It really depends on the location. Lately, I havent been enjoying Kroger as much because of lazy coworkers but that always makes any job more stressful to deal with."
good,"Benefits are fantastic, health insurance is amazing and reasonable. Pension, 401K and life insurance.  Ability to move up quickly in-store. Doubled my hourly rate in the three years I've been working there."
good,"Was a good learning experience, will miss some of the people. Learned a lot about retail sales and how to manage people.  Learned a lot about myself too. Overall a good company."
good,"Walk check department. Look for opportunities address any problems."
good,"Nobody there treats you right and basically is the hardest job ever. I have been working there for 2 and a half years and never let me off for school, which is terrible due to not having any time to do it. Plus, they schedule you at 5 am in the morning."
good,"If you come in and work hard Kroger is the place for you, if you looking for job advancement there are some opportunities. The more your willing to learn the better"
good,"I was a sticker I put up flour,suger,oil ext I use to love working there it teach me alot of working with people's I experience alot of stuff I didn't know"
good,"While working at Frys, i enjoyed many of the co-workers, only having one person give me a hard time for being fresh into working. Other than that, the management was unorganized, Managers would place their responsibilities onto others unqualified, eventually to me. The backroom stock was also a mess, sometimes we would be missing supplies for a week."
good,management switched up a lot during my year at Kroger. The Department managers could have done a better job. The proceedings that lead to my termination were unfair and confusing. But overrall I learned a lot and would defininetly reccommend Kroger to anyone seeking employment.
good,"Kroger is a great company to work for even if you can only work a few days a week. "
good,My career started with Kroger in 2013. I started as a courtesy clerk. A few days later I got promoted to a cashier due to my strong work ethic and my ability to create a wonderful experience for all of our shoppers. Kroger is a great company to work for but I feel like they changed their 1 priority and now all they care about is making more money.
good,"I was the meat market back up mana•	Ensured that company directives are met following the brand standards"
good,Kroger is good company that is very well established and solid. Kroger Co. has been and will continue to be a growing company. Working for Kroger you will hurt yourself and your family financially because of the low pay scale.
good,"Kroger is a good company, they offer a lot of benefits, employee discounts, and other incentives to please the average employee."
good,"not a great place to work, people always calling out and quitting because of management. Low staff for the amount of customers. which makes the store slow and crazy"
good,"I started there 3 years ago and learned a lot of about retail pharmacy, great benefits, best pay around for techs in retail. I will probably continue to work there for many more years."
good,Working at Kroger’s you looking at hard Labor. It’s all about going to give you quality service to the  customer and being a loyal employee let me know. Before going to work I pray that the day go smooth
good,My store is no longer around and was small and old but the workers there were amazing. The atmosphere was warm and welcoming and I enjoyed everyone there. Especially my regular customers.
good,They have flex schedules but they are not very flexible as you can only work from 7a -7p and not on weekends. Loved the people in my department and my immediate manager but did not like their Human Resources team at all. A lot of their company policies were ridiculous.
good,"Poor training, management & health code compliances.  Was put in the hands of a well trained chef.  But, between opening a new store & still transitioning from his old store.  He had little time to train is.  I was sent to the Missour City store.  Where I ran into numerous health violations.  I never should have left HEB.  I never had any problems there."
good,I enjoyed working here. Kroger was my frist job and everyone there was nice. The pay was good concering I was an 15 year old. I was only a season worker.
good,"Kroger is an overall excellent store to shop at in many different ways however the fact of the matter is is that the management was very poor in my opinion. The pay was decent and weekly but it was lacking so much in the management area of the store. It was a great first job for me in many ways however it was very stressful as well. You never knew when your break was and would have to search for a higher ranked team member to ask. They never had enough front end assistants or workers and sometimes I would be the only one up front bagging. The shopping carts system was very hard as well. I had a hard time bringing in carts from the lot and had to deal with all kinds of terrible weather conditions such as rain, cold, and heat."
good,It’s okay for a first job. They pay you based on your retail experience and years of retail experience. Then it goes from there. Part-time and full time benefits and pay is different.
good,"A paying job, but just that. I never saw much room for advancement. I left because I saw I was going nowhere with Kroger with management we had at that particular store."
good,"I liked working here, but stress levels did become high. I liked having break times, but working the dairy department's products was good too. It was nice."
good,Kroger is a decent place to work. It has its good side and not so good side. I like the people that work there and the customers. Kroger does have some room for advancement in some positions. However if you are looking to move up in work position make sure management follows through with their side of it.
good,Ok place to work employed for over 5 years like it here could be better with hours an pay management is ok here an staff is friendly  would recommend Kroger to anyone just looking for something to do .
good,"A typical day at work is fast-paced. I am always on my feet and working. I learned how to work collaboratively with a team and how to multitask. Management was very nice and interacted with the employees. All of the associates are great to work with and have become friends. The hardest part is how fast-paced it is, but I eventually got used to it. The most enjoyable is interacting with my co-workers."
good,"Great for the graveyard job, work at your own pace. The night manager is cool. The union is always there to help you out with any situation. "
good,Krogers was a fun company to work for. The managers were friendly and helped you when you needed it. The employees were a good group of people that worked well together
good,My honest opinion not all workers were friendly some were uptight disrespectful some were childish some were bossy and the managers were hard on me mostly then others
good,"Working at kroger was stressful, it is fast paced at certain time almost everyday. Also, some costumers were a a hassle to deal with, they would be really picky about fruit and would always want fruit from the back. When all the fruit was delivered on the same day."
good,"The company can offer hands on training programs. The company can introduce more diversity. They should offer managers sensitivitivity training. Lastly, they should have more incentivites for their employees."
good,"I had a great time working at Kroger, but i was working 2 jobs. As a cook, i'd completed my requirements, clean the kitchen and sometimes stocked empty shelves for the next shift, and assisted customers."
good,"The discounts suck. They only give you 10% off of KROGER BRAND which you most likely won't be buying, and sometimes they're picky with those too. The management team is large, yet no one ever explains the changes being made to the store to the employees, so people are constantly thrown into work that they had no idea that they were responsible for. As a cashier, it seems an easy job, but the physical exhaustion and pressure on you to stay at the register constantly is draining. Also, a lot of benefits that they promote don't kick in until you've been employed for a year!"
good,"I felt work was balanced gave us time to focus on patients needs, Provided training for cpr and immunizations.. Trained on consulting servces . Given apptopriate time to spend with pt"
good,"walk in retail clinic, increasingly busy, pay could be better, upper management is inexperienced and can be inappropriate at times. The work is good, and as an independent practitioner I have learned quite a bit and am able to increase my skills"
good,"The job did well for me to begin with as a 17 year old just looking to make some money. As my needs outside of work grew through, the pay and hours wasnt matching up well enough for me to stay any longer. Don't know how that applies to people who hve worked there for longer and were more experienced, but for me it was no longer what i needed as a workplace."
good,"Working at Kroger has been a rewarding experience with growing my character, patience, and understanding of other people. We were often understaffed and just left to complete every task to the best of our ability. Wages are not competitive with Wal-Mart, Target, or any other big box store unfortunately. However, the fellow associates made the experience enjoyable and helped to get through the monotony of every shift."
good,Good productive environment with great management and coworkers. Not the best at all when it comes to adjusting for your availability or in the pay department.
good,I do not like how the management is not consistent. Managers get switched around every few months. You do not get paid enough for the amount of work you do.
good,"1. Very fast moving each day. "
good,The people are friendly and the job is simple. The managers have been rather pleasant and have made my experience very easy. I also have no trouble changing my schedule when needed.
good,The management was not the best and needs to be improved. The co- workers were not as motivated as everyone else was. need more serious workers working.
good,"My time working here was okay, I advanced from a bagger to cashier pretty quickly. I did minor customer service also. This job is usually quick placed"
good,It is a great job to have! You will meet a lot of new people and your co-workes will become more like family! Great place to be in! Lovely establishment
good,"My job consisted of management of over night operations of the store. Receiving trucks, making orders, inventory data maintenance, organizing inventory, merchandising and presenting a wow factor to our customers shopping experience."
good,There is many different departments you could work in. The customers are very nice and respectful. There is much to learn about the store and all the positions.
good,when it comes to Kroger it depends on the location. some stores treat their employees better than others but its  great company overall if you worked at the right ones  .
good,"it's an alright place to work as long as you're doing you're job, coming in on time, doing what you're suppose to be doing and not getting in trouble. go to work and come back that's it."
good,"Good job. Management is stressful at times. Corporate expects way to much and doesn't give you the tools you need to accomplish what they expect. It's a fun, fast paced place  to work, other than corporate expectations."
good,"You will stay busy, and management is very easy to work with. They offer training for all levels of associates. Good benefits, not good chances for promotions."
good,The work was very easy but pretty boring. The management was very nice and thoughtful since I was in school. My co workers where super nice and welcoming.
good,"I wish the management and upper levels of people there would care more about the employees. They did not try to get to know who you were at all, and were very inconsiderate of personal things going on in people's ;ives"
good,"Kroger is very much a barge.  It's been stuck in its culture and methods for what feels like centuries, but is slowly changing to catch up with the times.  Changing direction for a company with 450K employees doesn't happen overnight, but it's happening slowly.  They have needed to upgrade systems and processes for about 3 decades and the new processes, once in place, will be far more efficient."
good,"It was okay. People were written up and nothing ever got done about problematic employees. Management wasn't all that great, some were just a bunch of jerks and some were just 'how did you even get this job?'. Generally I liked my coworkers. It was a job but it wasn't that great. I definitely am glad I don't work there anymore."
good,"The only thing I have an issue with is the rate of pay per hour, no other issues or complaints. I work with a wonderful team and enjoy my morning shift hours."
good,"see resume. Sales driven company. Fortune 500. Many ways to advance in the company. Jobs available for anyone. Always something to do. Merchandising, operations, HR."
good,"I was a Customer Clerk at Kroger, which is essentially a fancy term for bagger/cart pusher. Overall, the job was pretty good with fair hours, breaks, and work load per shift. However, the company does pay this position minimum wage, which worked alright for me since I was in high school, but was highly problematic for some of my older coworkers. Furthermore, management was often annoyed and not very understanding with time off as I was a cheerleader in high school and needed certain days off."
good,"Liked Krogers, but was not crazy about the Union. I felt the money I paid the it could have helped me better with college things. I worked there to help cover college expenses."
good,"They will work around your schedule, but a lot will be expected from you for little money. Management seems more than willing to take advantage of their most productive workers."
good,Working at Kroger's was my second job and the roles that I had to perform were cashiering and stocking. The skills that I got from cashiering was accounting and customer service skills. The worst part of the job was the salary because the pay was $7.25 per hour and that pay cannot support most lifestyles.
good,"As the title may imply, working in a Kroger Support Center has its ups and downs. They do not typically terminate associates because of performance issues, and instead will offer additional training to ensure the associate's success in the company. However, the policy regarding tardiness/absences and write-ups is extremely strict. Each tardy or write-up has a full year rollover period, and little leniency is offered with tardiness especially."
good,Was very hard to move up. Couldn't really get the amount of hours i wanted to work. Learned how to help customers in need. The hardest part was trying to move up in the company.
good,"Let me say this, If you like to work overnights this is not a bad job. I work 9pm-5:30am and never have to deal with customers, management, and just me and my headphones. Really pretty sweet. However, any other shift is absolutely terrible and any other job would be better then this."
good,"Typical hours for management is about 60 a week. LOVE LOVE LOVE the people who work there. Kroger sends you to the stores they want you to go to....even 1 hour away from your home. Overall it's a good place, you WILL work hard and you will live in your store."
good,"Good company to get your feet wet in the working world. Decent pay and great coworkers are nice bonuses, however, not much room for advancement and sometimes hard to keep new and younger employees at times."
good,Easy work pays very friendly customers you were basically on your own after training nobody else was around you no benefits in the gas station even though is the most dangerous job cuz if anything happens no security can get to you probably in time take a good 5 minutes just to get to you a fire you're on your own
good,The hardest part of the job was dealing with the customers. Sometimes i would be in the middle of making items on the menu for the day but still help customers who needed help.
good,"During my career at Kroger, I have experience people skills, as well as money management. I do not get as many hours as I would like however. On a average work week i get roughly 17-25."
good,"Kroger is a good place but only for a first time job, good for learning about working in the real world, dealing with people and management. I learned a lot from there"
good,"Plenty of great people and great customers. Culture was fantastic, but there's just no way up. You have to wait years for raises or benefits and when you get them it's twenty cents or so if you're lucky."
good,Growing up Kroger was a good place to work for extra spending cash but living on my own with a daughter to care for I couldn't afford to live. Everybody is super friendly and you become like a family I would still work there if the pay and benefits were better.
good,"It was fun working at Kroger. A regular day at my job was getting carts and bagging groceries for customers, which made the day go by very quickly. The hardest part about the job was gathering all of the carts together."
good,This was a good environment to work in. The co-workers were very helpful and accepting when it came to me first starting. The management is helpful as well.
good,Need to give more information about vacation sick and paid holidays give full time job information about benefits like insurance 401khow long will it take to be able for a full time position
good,Kroger's was a very friendly environment and was very accommodating to a new hire with no work experience. They were also flexible with the scheduling.
good,it was a good experience to work with south native of usa. new system and new drugs and drive thru-pharmacy experience was excellent and was good input of my experience
good,It's a nice starting job but they over work you for the amount your getting paid yes you can move up and get promated but pay still is low having gotten a promotion i was expecting much more then just a quarter
good,"Don't do it seriously, Actually it was a fine job just really boring, the benefits were great but the pay was below average and standing for 8 hours a day is exhausting."
good,"I loved working at Fred Meyers. The only down side is that there are no consistency with the hours people receive. For me as a single parent and having to secure daycare, it makes it very difficult when the hours are not the same every day."
good,It was nice working there especially during holidays.It gave one an opportunity to meet customers of a diverse culture and needs who would have various preferences.
good,"Over all the Kroger Company is a good place to work. If an individual would like to go forward into management, then he/she has the chance to do so. As well, the Kroger Company will help an individual with college."
good,"Kroger is merging with the division of the enterprise I worked with, Frys Food and Drug. The change has not been excepted well by the employees or the customers. The union in Arizona is spineless and will not stand up to make the merge more successful for the Employees. Ultimately the employees themselves have taken the hit, year after year in insurance hikes and poor raises or the lack their of."
good,Working at Pick N Save is a nice place to work for a first job; it's very easy to catch on to and teaches you about the different products. Nice culture and environment
good,I made good money. You get raises. You can change position in store. You get meals courtesy of the company. The customers are pretty ok. The hours are fair. You can get benefits as well. I worked with interesting people. You get employee discount which is cool. I feel like I made a difference when I was employed. I think there are many perks to being employed there.
good,I really enjoyed working there in the beginning. They have good benefits but the pay isn't what it should be. They don't seem to screen their store managers well enough
good,a typical day would be slightly fast past sometimes because of the area. I learned a lot of things from my fellow employees by being flexible in work positions. its a nice place just has some minor flaws as all jobs take advantage of the union
good,I had a lot of fun working there and learned many things. The management could've been a lot better. Job responsibilities weren't evenly distributed at times.
good,"used to look forward to going to work now I just look forward to my days off. not fun anymore. However the employees are great to work with everyone looks out for each other always willing to help out."
good,"Kroger is a union based company, which has both it's pros and cons. The pay was fair and based off of my experience, and my boss worked to cross train me in several departments to help me gain more work hours, as I was only able to work part time at first due to seniority. The benefits are unsurpassable. I was provided top notch health coverage at a very low price. That in itself makes the job worthwhile. Advancement opportunities depend on the area, size of the store, and attrition. If you have patience, the retirement benefits and opportunities are worth the wait. In the meantime though, you may need a second job to supplement the income."
good,"I started here when I was 16.  They were very flexible with my schedule while I was in high school.  The pay was so-so, but I did get a vacation the first year and two weeks vacation after 3 years.  Good starter job, but had to pay weekly union dues no matter how many hours I worked."
good,"It's an okay job. You get paid weekly, hours are flexible, and a vacation every year.In my experience, management was a bit lax and were often negative."
good,"The most enjoyable place to work, because the people are friendly. The only down fall is that the pay is minimum wage, but it is every week instead of every two weeks."
good,"it is a very cool job, a typical day was usual kinda busy not to bad , management was really nice and stuff and i learned alot about things from this job"
good,"This job I would recommend to people who are just starting to build their work ethics or to people who really enjoy working with and around people. Although your pay is based on passed experience in related type work environments, compensation is unfair to people who has job experience not related to their work."
good,There are a lot of pros and cons of working here.  They have excellent benefits and it is a great way to get your foot in the door for someone who recently graduated.  Worst thing about working here is not all managers are created equal.  They have some wonderful managers and some that are horrible to work with.  It seems to be the luck of the draw.
good,Very fast paced job with not enough employees expected to do the same work as would be performed with adequate employees.  No home or personal life.  Had to work and deal with employees and problems on days off most of the time.
good,"Kroger is a very good place to begin a career for maintenance "" A/C and refrigeration""."
good,If you're not over the age of 18 this is not the place to work.Most of the jobs are over 18 and they also provide quick promotions for better benefits.
good,"Typically working with wonderful co-workers in a good atmosphere but needs better organizational in department leadership. What I learned from Kroger is that everybody works better when everyone is operating in the same level of excellence and productivity expectation. Culture is friendly and the people you work with are helpful and enjoyable. Hardest thing about Kroger is time management and organization because if you do not organize and time manage well your work will not get done, especially if your hours are cut. Most enjoyable part of my job are the events we have victories over big projects accomplished."
good,"bag every bag. place in cart, ask if they need help."
good,At the time I was working their I received full custody of my two grandchildren.  They were too young to leave alone by themselves so I was unable to work the schedule given to me.   Today they are 14 and 15 and the work schedule is no longer a problem .
good,Place was always busy and you always had something to do. They wont hire you for full time. Management was mean and poor managers. The hardest part trying to get more hours and a part time job. The most enjoyable part is the benefits.
good,"Kroger was a secure job although we were consistently under staffed. Overall I liked management, and the opportunity for advancement. I would recommend the company because of job security and decent management."
good,"As a certified pharmacy technician, you get paid more (starting at $15.50 with increased pay based on performance) at Humana for sitting all day whereas at a Fry's a certified tech gets capped at $15.85.  At least that's how it was before I left in 2015."
good,Good company. Flexible hours. Responsive management. Limited career advancement. Not necessarily a place where you will be left behind but definitely a unionized work environment.
good,At this job you work your butt off and only get paid minimum wage. They are part of the union too. Kroger is a very unfair work place. Management is really super nice.
good,"the management was so good with the employees, they helped us to learn different stuff. i used to start at 5 am and finish by 1 pm which was a very good schedule."
good,"Kroger is a good job to get when you turn 16, it is fun at first but it gets stressful real quick. Cashiering is alright but you start to get annoyed standing there for hours and hours. If you want a job you get to stand and just scan items this the job for you."
good,I haven't worked here long but everyone has been very professional and helpful.  Management is very approachable and seem to spend a lot of time on the floor and engaged with employees and customers.
good,A typical day at work was bagging customers groceries pushing carts cleaning restrooms and doing store sweeps. What i learned is that you  have to keep busy and not be lazy while working or your management will use that against you.The hardest part of the job was balancing your duties within your shift.The most enjoyable part of the job was removing carts every day.
good,"Slicing up meat over 2 pounds is very tiring. It's okay but at times you will get unexpected moments with customer needs. Which happens at every other place, however, people would expect you to slice up meat out of the shelves THAT weren't suppose to be slice up because they aren't a Krogers Brand."
good,"Pay sucks. Manager attitudes are horrible! They want you to do tooo much for such lil pay! After your anniversary there, they do not change your position or up your pay! Its all on their time! Lets not forget the perverted old men!"
good,Kroger is ah very good starting job for youth but if you want to go further within the company they are more willing to help you get there as fast as they can good benefits can Manager your personal life promise 2 days off every week the pay sucks but other then that good place
good,"Kroger has union, weekly pay, hours, and the ability to try new things. From working in the front to dealing with customers to dealing with freight and products."
good,"I worked there for quite sometime, and in different departments. Kroger is a Union company, so contract negotiations come up every few years, making the top out pay less. When I was there the company paid for our medical/dental/vision benefits, so there was no premiums paid out by the employees."
good,"Spacious Work Environment with lots places to eat nearby, Tons of Areas to work in and learn different crafts. Floral being my favorite area that I worked in"
good,"Lots to do, can be very fast past at times, will receive lots of demands from supervisors, as well as, customers and sometimes all at once, so you will need to learn to, work well under pressure and think fast. There is plenty of opportunities to advance and move up, if you're a hard worker, there is also a variety of different people from all walks of life you will meet in the process."
good,"They make you push carts for a long period of time without breaks, they play many favorites and cut many people's hours. It took a toll on my shoulder having to push the carts i now have tendinitis in it."
good,"High-Volume, Fast-Paced Distribution environment that services approximately 250 stores in Ohio and Michigan.  Turnover is high among newer associates, but fairly stable among more-tenured associates."
good,"High demand from time, dealing with unsatisfied customers on a daily , and offering alternatives to an issue. Limited management supervision. The most enjoyable part is building customer/employee relationships."
good,"Need a quick job while in high school krogers is the place, great environment to be in, a place where hard work and relaxing balanced out it was somewhere you felt comfortable."
good,Productive workplace . A great job to learn the basic necessities for having a real job. Provides great benefits for those who take advantage of them .
good,Loved working at Kroger especially with the people that I worked with learned a lot to do with retail. Management was always allover the place but once you got the hang of the way things run around the store it will be a breeze.
good,Krogers provided a productive and fast pace environment.  Fellow associates for the most part work together in a timely manner to provide a friendly courteous experience for the customers who have chosen to remain loyal customers.
good,The pay should be higher. It's a pretty fast-paced job especially during holidays. The people I work with are nice. There should also be more full-time positions.
good,"Management vary by store. They can either make your life and everyone else's, including their own easier or a living nightmare  Again depending on the store are always understaffed and will move you around like a dog to fill in the gaps that they created and can easily resolve if they wanted to. Definition of insanity: using the same methods over and over again and expecting different results. That's the state of mind for this company."
good,I am very fortunate to have been able to have worked at Kroger for my very first job. The environment was always so welcoming and the customers were so very friendly.
good,Smiths is a great place to work Part time. fast paced easy going job. It was fun to have different walks of life come through the door all the time. Great company
good,"It was my first job in a fast-paced, retail environment. It was an important experience for future success in employment. There was a constant circulation of managers which made work more difficult."
good,This company is good to work for. I enjoy the people I work with/ for. The reason I am looking for other opportunities is because I am a recent graduate and would like to use my degree.
good,The job at Krogers was not very challenging. It did not push me enough to achieve or met any goals that I had set for myself at Krogers or in the workforce period.
good,I worked for Kroger for 3 years. i enjoyed my time there but it was not always the most professional work environment. I would go back but not long term.
good,"On a typical day, employees assist customers and make sure everything they need is fulfilled. Management have two to three meetings a week to make sure the tasks are being met. The hardest part of the job is not showing up. The most enjoyable part of the job is everyone working as a team to help the customers."
good,Working at Kroger helped me to experience and deal with customers better. I was trusted to deal with money and valuable lessons of money and customer service.
good,Very simple and easy job for any skill level. A basic retail store with a wide range of co-workers and managers. During my employment the managers were more than helpful if you had problems either in the workplace or at home. The culture is very basic with a good team. The hardest part of this job was accepting the pay while the easiest was having the opportunity to relocate to different jobs and departments.
good,"strict organization, low pay, management is friendly, taught how to reach sales goals, learn how to cash handle and run a cash register. I enjoyed my time working with them."
good,I loved the 2 years i worked here. Would recommend to anyone especially for a 1st job. Great at accommodating work schedule and awesome coworkers to work with.
good,Getting work experience at kroger was a good thing. Kroger doesn't offer that many benefits if your under the age of 21. 401k plans was definitely a down fall for someone that trying to save money.
good,I used to love working at Kroger when I started six years ago. Now it is stressful and too much to do for little pay. I do not enjoy working there anymore due to the way management handles their business.
good,Work environment is friendly although management during the time I was employed at this specific location was unwilling to work with school schedule. Plenty of opportunities to seek promotions if interested.
good,working here would be best for a high school or early college student. the flexibility in hours allowed me to work around my school and then class schedule.
good,"The Starbucks in the Kroger had issues with finding a manager so employees were often left to fend for themselves. The average employees in a Starbucks are 7/8 but in our case I was often working by mysellf or with one other epmloyee, 3 MAX. It did teach me how to work under extreme pressure."
good,"You will make great friends with the people you work with. You'll get to learn how to properly serve customers and get your job done efficiently. Whether you're in deli, produce, Starbucks, etc., there will always be a place for you."
good,"If you are a student or an individual looking to just pick up some extra spending money, this is company for you. However, if you are an adult trying to raise a family, this is not the place you want to find yourself working at. It does not offer great pay or even substantial pay for all the expectations they put on you. The insurance is unbeatable for the price you pay, which is wonderful if you have a chronic illness. Advancing can be easy if you know or are related to the right people. This company is RIDDLED with nepotism. However, keep in mind, once you are in management, you are salary which means that this company can work you as LONG and as HARD as they want. That being said, a work/life balance can be difficult to find."
good,"I've been here for about 7 months now and I can't deny that they have a good system about their flexibility. One downfall is that if someone calls out, there is usually no one else to come and fill their place and depending on the day, it can be extremely busy and sometimes low staff. That is what I experience from my work place at least,"
good,"I worked for krogers for 14 years, I worked through high school, worked all departments including back up head cashier. I left to further my education."
good,"my only con is that the work and balance really don't work well for"
good,On a typical day I would restock the shelves and order more using an rf handheld. I would also would help the customers with finding products that are hard to locate
good,It's a great place to work have to be on time and you get off right on time. Have to able to keep up the fast work pace bagging the groceries scanning the items.
good,On average normal retail environment but pay could be better. Great family culture though but management could use better training. I learned a lot of marketing skills though.
good,I enjoyed working at Kroger and I liked working at different stores. I did not have any benefits while working there but the pay was ok. I did a lot of surveillance and cctv work.
good,"the staff was great the managers did not rate that high in my opinion. i learned they did not care abut there staff and did not care about there customers,"
good,"A typical day at work was arranging and folding clothes, organizing merchandise and helping customers."
good,"Great place to work at. Management is great as are the other employees. Easy work, not much to learn, great place if your looking to move up in the business"
good,"The problem in our work place is the employee that they hired are to young.They don't care about their job duties and they act unprofessional. For me, job are so hectic sometime you're doing both job (cashier and bagger) when people called in and they don't pay you enough. Break is my concern, they give employee only 30 minutes working for 8 hours shift and sometimes its hard when we are to busy and you couldn't even go to the bathroom."
good,Is a decent place to work if you want to have a part-time job .  Some of the benefits of Kroger offers are things such as healthcare and paid vacation  these options are available to all the employees.  Another thing that makes Kroger popular is the fact that they have a union ensuring that your job is safe.
good,fetch carts baged grocies my very frist job in highschool was a decent job but my grades was falling in school so i had to drop that one so i can get to my studies
good,A typical day at work is very busy simply because its one of the highest rank grocery stores in USA. I learned alot working with the company considering that I was there 6 years. Management are very involved depending on which location you're at.
good,You don't get paid a lot at a minimum 7.25 an hour. You are always harrassed about something not being done when your shift is over even though you did what was told for that day. I would never go back but the benefits are well worth it.
good,"Workers and managers did not do a good job communicating, thus placing either parties on different pages when it came to job duties and work schedules."
good,The co-workers are very fun to be around on a good day. The scheduling for courtesy clerks is basically based on if you are new or been there for a while. The hardest part of the job is pulling carts from outside into the lobby while customers are coming into the store. The fun part of the job is being with customers and creating conversations with customers and workers.
good,"I worked at the company from the time I was in high school until I was about to finish college.  As a part time student the hours were flexible and manageable.  Once I became full time as an Assistant Customer Coordinator I found the work hours difficult to balance with my home life, the hours range from 5-1 to 4-midnight.  I also found that the job was demanding to the point where some tasks were impossible to finish within a work day.  The company has a heavy focus on customer service which is great, but sometimes it is at the expense of its employees.  The pay is good, especially the more time you work there and the benefits (at least in the columbus division) are phenomenal and extremely affordable.  It is a company that requires you to make it your number one priority."
good,It was good staff the pay was poor the hours were flexible good benefits kroger is more of a just starting to work job it was alot of teenagers that  work there.
good,"I was a morning shift person because before I had 2 jobs at the same time. I've learned so much about my job in Mariano's. I've learned to deal with different kinds of people with different culture. I've enjoyed their company. I was able to put so much patience to irate customers, witness different kinds of demands, complaints and appraisals as well. It's just that I feel that I am more capable of doing other job than making breads in the bakery, that I know I would be able to know more about myself and point out my weaknesses and strengths."
good,I met a lot of interesting and unique people as well as gained knowledge and my current field of study in college. I learned to truly work at a fast pace here.
good,"Great Company!!!!! "
good,Nashville division vs Atlanta division.....I would not be looking for a new job if I hadn't moved. I fill the Atlanta division is harder on the employees and not as well cared for. Kroger is union so that's a great thing. All in all good enough company to work for.
good,"Management culture seemed more stressful the higher you climb in the ranks. I watched one of the kindest managers get transferred just because the new GM didn't like him that much. Each store directly reflected the GM."
good,"Great benefits, opportunity for advancement is bogus, job is close to where i live.Co-workers are good to get along with, most of the customers are enjoyable."
good,"Management was laid back but yet up to speed and always on top of things, they got to know you on a personal level and would ask how your family was doing, or how your weekend was. Co-workers were fun to be around and worked as a team. I learned a lot of things such as how long certain things are able to be left outside of the cooler before they are considered 'no good' anymore. The hardest part of my job was having to unload the truck, break it down, and have everything on the shelf in the allotted time frame when we were short handed."
good,"working here prepares you for almost any retail job in the future, because you'll see the best of the best and the worst of the worst. But they do take great care of their people."
good,"Benefits in this job were great, however the pay for the amount of work was low. The staff was constantly changing and seemed to be less serious about their work."
good,"on a typical day at BK , I would simply just go in count my inventory, clean my station and start cooking. I also helped with cashiering from time to time, the people and managers are great!"
good,"Kroger has a great team of associates. Each day, the management team would assist the front end in meeting its goals. The most enjoyable part of working at Kroger was meeting new people each day. The hardest part of the job was maintaining the proper register requirements, specifically during times of large budget cuts."
good,My job is not that enjoyable. The management is not that good. There are  lot of people that leaves the department. Most workers do not enjoy their job on a daily.
good,most enjoable part of my job was the customer service. learning new ways to deal with situations and meeting new people.
good,"It was an ok business if you are a student in college or in high school. I would not suggest this job for a career job. For a typical day, I would go and retail the bread, water and the front shelves. Occasionally they would call me to the front and ask if I can help them with bagging. I did not learn much from the job except patience and how to deal with people. Before this job, I have never worked upfront and personal with other people. I usually work in the back doing hard labor. The hardiest part of the job was dealing with the customers but I got accustomed to that. The easiest and most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with my co-workers."
good,"For the most part a typical work day consisted of ringing out customers as a cashier and on understaffed days I worked back and forth as a grocery-bagger and a cashier. The management for the most part lacked competence and leadership capabilities. It was hard to find a balance that worked well with my life as a high school student, though scheduling as a college student work."
good,"Good as a starter job, but I am happy to move forward in my career with other opportunities. The job taught a lot about retail and I learned how to work a register and manage cash totals better."
good,"Typical day began with checking which jobs I had been assigned for the day other than the given. Examples included sweeping the store for a time, bringing back carts, or cleaning the bathrooms. I got along with my co-workers and most of the management team too. Socializing with them and interacting with customers was most enjoyable part of the job. "
good,"Scheduling isn't all that well; I barely get any hours and my pay is poor. Other than that, It's a typical day at work. Management is a little bit funny. I was trained at a training center so, it's not like you're just thrown out there to fend for yourself. Otherwise it's a good company."
good,steady work same thing everyday summer job barley got to experience the work environment at Kroger's just came to work did my job and went home
good,"The most exciting part of the job is meeting new customers and gaining a fresh outlook on lives. I enjoyed improving my leadership skills as I trained others and being a problem solver. This job had poor management with a lack of communication and organization. Additionally, their were always new people ever other week as old members left. The things I remembered most will stay with me for a lifetime."
good,"The longer I worked at the company and the higher I advanced in seniority, the clearer it became that this company does not realistically understand what the employees put up with. While there are simple positions available for high schoolers and young people, the job in the bakery itself is not an easy one. There is a lot of multitasking and whatnot, which is easy for someone like myself who does well in a fast-paced environment, but the management does not take kindly to employees working overtime, which has been extremely necessary as some co-workers are not pulling their weight, and many departments have workers drop out overnight."
good,Working at Kroger is tough especially if you're a supervisor of people who are all older than you and choose not to respect you just because you're younger than them. The hardest part of the job was keeping a smile on my face with all of the disrespectful customers and staff.
good,I like working for Kroger but i would like to branch out to new opportunities. They make you feel welcomed. I deal with many attitudes every day but i manage to maintain my professionalism.
good,"I began as a general merchandise clerk. A typical day involved seeing what new items have arrived for the store, taking them out to the sales floor, and putting them where they needed to go. While doing this, it is necessary to assist any customers with questions or helping them find what they were looking for. After that, we would go through backlogged items and see what could be worked onto the floor as well. From 6:30 onward, it's time for conditioning: pulling items forward, straightening them out, and making sure everything's in its proper place."
good,"My day consists of bagging groceries,  bounce between registers to bag,  every hour start to bring carts in.  Towards night time clean the bathrooms,  bottle area,  and break room, then pull trash from every register."
good,A typical day at work Krogers would be coming in and working trucks and stocking shelfs doing orders and . Over my time there I learned to load and unload trucks. Write for grocery stock that we would need in the store. I learned how to work well with others and always be respectful to the costumers. Management would always come and help out as much as they could some where better then others. My co-workers we probably the best part about the job and have made many friends because of Krogers. The hardest part about the job wouldn't have been anything anyone did it would of just have to be the dependability of the trucks and if they would show up on time. When they didn't which was often that really made it hard on all of us to catch up. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to easily be my fellow employees because like I said above I've made many lasting relationships.
good,The pay is very low. It would be the best job in the world if they actually paid the employees a livable wage. The benefits are great but most people are part time and get no hours
good,"When i worked there many years ago it was a nice place to work because f the team i worked with, there wasn't a lot of promotional opportunities and upper management never really talk to us. communication is the key to success and unfortunately there wasn't a lot of that.. im glad for the experience i had and when i left i was paid pretty well. i worked 3rd shift so there as a lot of overtime then so it was hard to spend time with our families. my most enjoyable is the costumers that would come in. they became our regulars and it was nice talking to them and them always saying how they appreciate all our hard work. it was nice to hear."
good,"I had the opportunity to meet some great people and enjoy help my customers. There was not a bad day at my co- worker made the job interesting. I learned how to be humble, and the rewards of help each and every customers."
good,"Closing shifts have you working till 9:30 at night, making no time for family also no weekends off unless requested. Good beneifits and nice pay for retail job."
good,stocking shelves and making customers find what products they are looking for.  while maintaining a productive and positive attitude.
good,"I enjoy the benefits offered.  The vacation benefits are great.  The work is enjoyable, rewarding and challenging.  I provide excellent customer service and am rewarded for it."
good,"Up until 1 month ago Kroger could not have gotten a bad review from me. Since then, My hours have been cut by over 50% and after several occasions where I try and speak to Management; nothing seems to be done about it."
good,"Working in the Deli is a very difficult job. Especially when in comes down to cleaning. Even during the rush hour when your trying to get certain items made just for the customers and suddenly there is a long line, it makes it even more difficult. I never enjoyed any part of the job because of stress and frustration."
good,"It a great first job for teenage. They work with you schedule as well. It a great meeting new people, and get to know your customer."
good,"I loved working with the employees and customers. Advancement opportunities are limited. It is almost impossible to get into management. The pay is very bad for the amount of responsibility that I had. I was working in accounting, which was a huge responsibility along with accountability. I was pregnant and considered high-risk and was not allowed to sit down at anytime while doing accounting. There was  never anyone scheduled to work that knew how to do my job, therefore, I rarely was able to take my entire break. I was very poorly treated during my last month there."
good,"This company has many locations, many entry level positions, and many hiring opportunities. If you are efficient and work hard, you are likely to be quickly promoted. "
good,keep meat wall stocked. cut steaks and provide great customer service. closing and clening up at the end of shifts. opening up setting seafood and meat cases.
good,"I love working here as a part time job, the company is pretty awesome. Kroger does not offer the best insurance benefits for my family and I, so I am looking for an alternative job to better suit those needs."
good,"I typically enjoyed my job on a day to day basis."
good,": easy work "
good,this is a great company for a high school and college student. They wont you available all the time. basically wanting you to only have a Kroger life. Its all about the needs of the customers but never about the needs of the employees.
good,"Always busy, which causes the work day to go by pretty quick which is a plus. Could use some better supervisors (hardly to be found when needed)"
good,"Compared to many other companies, Kroger is an easy place to work. Typical day consists of stocking product, helping customers, working with other employees, and keeping a clean store. Management are generally easy to work with."
good,Kroger Marketplace has great benefits and will also have great flexible hours for people who have second jobs or going to school. Great discounts on all Kroger brand products.
good,"A typical day at work is very busy. You must wear your uniform. Be nicely groomed. Come to work ready to work. I come to work prepared for anything. I've learned to be friendly, fast, and clean. i have learned to smile through out the customer interaction. I have learned to be a better person by working in retail. My Management in my department is pretty good. I have never had any major issues with management. Store management is the same way. Pretty decent and knows exactly what he wants the store to look like and how he wants it ran. My co-workers are all pretty good, but sometimes, they lack the skill of being helpful. Most times they would rather go home, and leave me stuck with a lot of customer's which is something I do not like the most. Sometimes it feels that I am the only one working. I never leave anybody hanging. I do my job, and I go beyond to get it done. I feel like my co-workers could put in a lot more effort like me and help out the way I help them out. The hardest part of my job is working all 3 sections with no help. Unlike my co-workers I never complain about a thing. I am a very determined worker. I am aiming towards a higher goal in life, and that is to be happy and successful. The most enjoyable part of the job, is satisfying my customer's needs. I make them laugh and enjoy their time while in Kroger."
good,"I stocked shelves of dairy products, bread, and items misplaced in the store as well as working the bottle return. I learned how to communicate with all types of people and how to give good customer service to any type of person. I learned that some co-workers tend to not meet certain requirements that I like to meet. The most difficult part of the job was the heavy lifting I had to encounter. The most enjoyable part of my job were my co-workers, although most of them slacked off, they often depended on me to maintain a professional work environment."
good,The hours are okay. You will learn a lot if you want to. Dress code is important. Must be a people person.
good,"This company is big but they don't care lower level employees."
good,"When you would walk through the doors you are greeted by happy/cheerful employees welcoming you to work. Management is always on task and asking if any of the departments need any help, with keeping us focused. My coworkers are helpful and fast and efficient in their work. The hardest part of the job was when customers were lined up, impatient, and demanding us to help them saying they would complain, while we try our hardest. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is leaving a customer happy and wanting to come to the Deli again. I love the feeling I get when I made a positive impact on someone’s day"
good,It is a very fast pace office.  I order equipment for the kroger stores .. I have good days . we all get along in the office
good,"Worked the register as my employees and handled vendors to receive products and scan in invoices.  Ordered merchandise once a week, and maintained the stores image by often putting in my own two hands."
good,they have fairly good benefits and don't make it difficult to work your way up they management isn't all that great but it is a good starter job to get to start school because they work really well with schedules so you can work and go to school
good,"A typical day at work  is that mostly you will be upfront bagging customers orders. Each day you work you will have to do carts for an hour they pick the hours you do carts and be prepared for the weather. The co-workers there are pretty fun to work with. I would say the hardest part is working on big holidays, working Sunday, and doing carts. The most enjoyable part is that Kroger has different events to promote the store."
good,A typical day at work for me is being in charge of money and helping customers with their needs. I learn new things on a daily basis when it comes to interacting with people. I enjoy talking with customers and getting to know them and making them smile. My job can be very stressful at times but I have found the balance on how to handle it.
good,Work life balance is not great.  The time you work is awful such as twelve to nine which takes up your whole day really.
good,Kroger is a job company to work at but the Kroger I work does not always treat employees fair and the environment is not all that great.
good,A typical work day could be slow or fast depending on the day.  I learned alot about the grocery store business.  I didn't think the store management was good.  My co-workers were great to work with.  The hardest part of my job was dealing with store management.
good,"everyday work, first thing of the morning you would set up the full service counters then start out cutting any item that needed to be cut for the day then from there move to stocking the lunch-meat shelves."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of helping customers and giving breaks while keeping up with queing. I learned a lot about other people and how to work as a team. Management will always take the customers side before anyone else no matter what the situation may be ""the customer is always right."" The co-workers are great for the most part and very nice, but never really willing to work on their time off. The hardest part of the job would have to be Quevision as well as dealing with unsatisfied customers that refuse to be happy no matter what you may do for them. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the people that have become your friends."
good,Days are filled with creativity and visits from regular customers that frequent the bistro. Wonderful co-workers that work together to get the job done.
good,It was part-time job while I was in high school. I had fun most days except when I would have beg for a day off for basketball practice or games. It was also days where I would have to beg for more hours but that's just how things were I guess. I learned a lot I had to deal with all types of people so if you weren't a people person you weren't going to be working for Kroger that long.
good,Good place to work.. I am looking for something with more money to use my degree
good,Co-workers and Managers working like a good team. Everyone is helping each other out.
good,"A typical day at Kroger as a courtesy clerk required me to bag customer's groceries, help customers to their cars with thier groceries if requested, lead customers to items they could not find, as well as cleaning bathrooms, spills, and retrieving carts bringing them back to their correct loaction.  Secondly, a typical night at Kroger as an overnight conditioner required me to obtain all misplaced items, in the aisles and on the shelves, relocating them back to their respective places. While doing this I would have to straighten up all items on the shelves not just the ones that were misplaced, making the aisles presentable for the customers. I would also have to crush boxes in the stores bailer at the end of the night.  Moreover, this particular store's management I did not care too much for. It seemed as though they really did not care about the employees.Only coming to our needs if the store would soon be under inspection from the distrct manager.  However, my co- workers were all genuine, caring, funny, and loving people. They made my work experience enjoyable everyday giving me memories that I will hold on to forever.  In conclusion, the overall work experience Kroger gave me will carry me a long way. From the skills that I have obatined. To the encounters with different people that I have had."
good,The job is fun and I meet all types of people. We pride ourselves in great customer service. Everything about the company is smiling faces & positive attitudes.
good,"A normal day at work would hit the ground and running approach. Its fast paced and challenging, The co workers and managers for the most part are upbeat and do take time to help each coustomer and employee that needs help. The hardest part of this job would be at times breaks in communication, but most ppl work to correct it even though it does happen often. The enjoyable thing of this job would be the co-workers, they help each other and smile whil doing it. I have learned patience and team work to a greater plane since i startted with the company."
good,I had a blast with all the customers. I started out as a deli clerk and moved up to Deli Manager.
good,Theres nothing I can really say about MC Donald's!!! Over all it's a big restaurant that millons of people have worked there at less once in there life time.
good,I have worked for Fry's for over 6 years and am topped out with no where to move up. Presently stagnated in my current position.
good,"wasn't with the job very long, due to me finding a new job, but the hours are low, good for high school kids, and the pay is typically close to minimum wage. The job is good for young people who are in school full time."
good,"Good place to work, great for young part timers. Pretty decent management, I would recommend working here, for the extra cash, or even a career. "
good,I learned different things that you just don't learn in school and my passion for cooking grew by watching and learning from my executive and sous chef.
good,I have been there 5 years and would like to learn different position but have not had the opertunity. I am at the top of my pay scale and would like to find a compny that I can advance in.
good,"I do like this company, but they do not allow full time employement due to insurance reasons. I require a full time position."
good,My store was great. Was really just coming to work with a big family.
good,i love working at kroger love helping costumer .i learn a lot at kroger.learn how to have a lot of patients.and learn a lot to the retail store..love working with my co-worker the all nice..
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job were the customers. It was a small town and everyone knew you. So being on a first name basis was nice, and conversations made the customer feel even more welcoming."
good,"Typical day at work is generally slow. Very few foot traffic within the store. On a positive note, co-workers are friendly and great to get along with."
good,I would clock in log into my register and when its wasnt to busy they trained me for other positions because i was a fast learner. I learned alot working at krogers I was a high school student at the time so it was a wonderful learning experience. The management was very fair as long as you do your job they wouldnt give you any trouble. The hardest part of the job was the busy days cause i was all over store doing almost everything. The most enjoyable part I must say was payday cause it showed me the value of a dollar.
good,"Kroger has been excellent, as far as on-the-job training and working around personal schedules, but their compensation, as in pretty much all retail pharmacy, is below par. Now that the base pay has raised, starting technicians will make more than some experienced technicians once they train (which only takes a couple months). It's pretty sad that Kroger apparently has no desire to keep experienced technicians around, which they have made clear by refusing to even raise EXPERIENCED technicians' pay to what NEW technicians make. It's ridiculous! I'm very disappointed. I really saw myself with Kroger for a very long time. This is where I wanted to settle, but they are pushing me out the door."
good,"I had the same assignment everyday. I learned how to bag grocery at an amazing speed, and cleaning up bathrooms good. Management was nice after awhile, My co-workers were very cool. Hardest part was going outside in the snow and grabbing all the carts. Most enjoyable part was payday."
good,"I usually go in at the start of my work day by taking a walk around the back docks to see how big my work load is for the day. Then me and my manager for that day get a game plan going followed by a end of the day goal. What I've learned there is to have more confidence in myself and also having better leadership skills. My co-workers are very kind and are always willing to give a little extra help when needed. Management is very helpful when it come to finding what we can do to make the store better and helping costumers in situations with things us workers do not usually know the answer to. The hardest part of my job is balancing between my work, helping up front, and giving costumer service. The most enjoyable part is the people I work with and getting to know newcomers."
good,Doing many tasks at once is very typical for the job. Helping customers at the counter is the main priority because we try to build relationships with customers. That is the most beneficial experience I have had a Kroger. Friendships with customers over the years has encourage me to appreciate my job at Kroger.
good,kroger is a decent company to work for but im looking to move somewhere near myrtle beach south carolina
good,"sanitation of store,helping customers bagging groceries or answering questions they might have.Assist with carry-outs"
good,"A typical day at kroger depended on what department you worked in. It was a grocery store and I worked on the front end as a store clerk. During a typical day it would be 4-8 hours of work. I bagged groceries, used the cash register and brought carts inside. Kroger was a place that taught me a lot about customer service and always making sure customers come first. I learned effective ways of being a cashier, bagging and bringing carts in. In my 4 years and 11 months at kroger we had a few different managers. I got along with all my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was usually during Christmas Eve, which was the busiest day of the year. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work with people and getting to know the customers while helping them out."
good,I felt that I had a great experience here until right before I left when there was a huge change of management and felt the new management played favoritism in a big way and pushed people out to bring in people they worked with before. I was able to have a good work/life balance and felt secure in my job until the few months before I left. They had awesome insurance benefits and great pay rates.
good,Good first time job. Good way to gain experience . Good management
good,"Typical day was waiting on customers, data entry, answering phones, counting medications, stocking shelves. I learned to be more patient with individuals. Management was ok. Co-workers were great to work with. Hardest part of the job was really dealing with the stressful days. There were not a lot of stressful days, but when we had them, they could sometime be really hard. The most enjoyable part of the job was having the knowledge to be able to assist the customers."
good,"I met people from all walks of life, I enjoyed the people I worked with, and who I worked for, Though sometimes it could be stressful I would do it all over again."
good,They provided good pay and benefits. It was a conducive work atmosphere. It provided great training and flexibility.
good,A typical day at work is fast paced with a lot to do.I've learned if you help customers happily you will get happy customers.Management is excellent.I have very outgoing and funny coworkers.The hardest part about the job is having short breaks.The most enjoyable part is making people happy.
good,"I didnt work there very long.  But I did make some life time friends. I moved back home to the MI, IN area and stayed good friends with a lot of the people I met there. They are all nice and caring."
good,"Friendly management and super flexible with your schedule. Makes it perfect for students. They even love to see you succeed, even if it's not with the company."
good,"Pros "
good,Great people to work around some just aren’t nice and others didn’t like to be there . Wasn’t very organized but overall not a terrible experience. Had a lot of help from fellow employees and they made it better
good,No longer work there  seeking new job with better work hours. I have worked at a credit union also and check cashing at food town years before   Kroger is great for after school students but for 45 women trying to have a life   Its too hard with the crazy long hours
good,"This job has a flexible schedule and the customers are the focal point. I have learned what my customers like and dislike, about the community, and good recipes."
good,"Due to Union rights, the manager/Union Steward I worked under (who is lousy at his job), can't be terminated until certain qualifying factors are met under the Union guidelines."
good,Working at Kroger was a nice easy job. I had no experience before entering the job. It gave me many useful skills that I will use in future jobs. The management wasn't the best but over all not a bad part time job.
good,It is a difficult job when you start until you get used to it. You have the opportunity to make extra money through an incentive program. Not alot of opportunities at the moment to move up in the company.
good,Benefits are good if you are full time you get more out of working here the more years you put in. I recommend this place of business for employment to almost anyone
good,Kroger was an alright job i just felt like they made the young kids do most of the work it was only a summer job for me but the managers liked me they kept saying i was a great worker.
good,This place is a good place to work but they don’t give you enough hours. The people that work there is nice. The management could be better. This job is good for college students.
good,"I had a lot of experience working at Krogers from my previous job, Walmart so it wasn’t hard for me at all to catch on to the work, I love how flexible the hours were."
good,I Enjoy Working There Only Thing Is They Were Different Didn’t Give Many Hours Pay Was $11.50 But Work Part Time. I Had To Stop Working Because I Didn’t Have Place To Stay In Atlanta Anymore But I Would Go Back Just Full Time Because The Pay Good But The Hours Don’t Show For It.
good,I've been there for 31 years. I have seen many changes happen. When I was hired is way different today.  There were good and bad like everywhere. I'm glad Kroger is here. Overall.
good,Will accuse you of something and won’t show you proof. Customers are very nice. Can easily make new friends. But will accuse anyone of anything and will never show proof.
good,It was really hard at times... I was everywhere at once basically and it screwed up my back. I had to do physical therapy and now im better. It was a good work place for people that like to be on the move.
good,typically at this job i would come in and get straight to picking the products for my orders on the screen when i first got hired management was a little unstable but it got better the longer i stayed and they got it under control. i really enjoyed the freedom of roaming the store to get our products it almost felt like shopping for yourself. The hardest part was when the store was super busy because fitting through the isles with everyone there was challenging.
good,I loved stocking but where there were only three of us we never got a day off and when we did it was one day a week i liked that we got paid weekly but the schedule was never correct the time i was supposed to get off was never the right time i got off when the manager told me i could
good,They adhered to my availability and worked with me to get my best fit job in the company. They worked me around the departments and showed me the whole side of kroger
good,"At the job, we use trolleys and we go around with a scanner and pick the customers groceries. When the customer gets there, they call and we use tablets to cash their orders out and we load their groceries into their vehicles."
good,"I been at Krogers since 15. you get paid every Thursday "
good,Super intense work environment. Very highly pressured and timed. You need to be a machine to work here and be ready to work 60 plus hrs 6 days a week for the unforeseeable future.
good,Most of the workers were nice the managers were mostly nice although  a few of them i had a problem with for example when i try to to help customers one of the manager scolds me for not doing anything  even though I was trying to help a customer.
good,"Great job , highly recommended , meet new  people everyday and make binds with returning customers. You learn the ends and outs of a cash register and the difference between fake and real money."
good,I like my job but the pay is way too low. I have a great manager. I like the team I work with in Pickup. I do not like my shifts always being at different times.
good,"Providing an amazing customer experience to each and every customer. Standing while assisting all customers, handling all cash transactions. Able to communicate clearly and thoroughly with everyone. Worked for customer service front desk at times to help those who spoke Spanish only. Hardest part working at Kroger was the hours were at random so it was not a fixed schedule. The most enjoyable part working at Kroger was seeing similar faces and able to have a full on conversation. Friendly customers were always the best through out my day their."
good,"Been in the industry for over 4 years now and I've never been able to say this. The people I work with are awesome, caring and very friendly and all around awesome people!"
good,"This was my first job, and I enjoyed it overall. The pay was pretty bad though, so it's basically only good as a first-time job. The environment was pretty chill, but management wasn't the best."
good,"Just dont like the drama. Alot of high school kids. "
good,"My time at Kroger would be a positive one. I left because of the amount I was getting payed was too low to the amount of effort and time I had to put in. It was a great place for me to start, after moving from a different state but it was time for me to find a job that pays me better and could put my college background in good use."
good,"Too many managers giving different job duties is a little stressful. However, the hours are pretty good and they offer lots of breaks during your shift so you don't get tired easily. Co-workers were the best part of this job for me."
good,Overall Kroger is a very good company to work for. If you are coming out of college and single the potential for growth is great. If you already have a family the pay is very low and that what makes a lot of people leave.
good,"I worked at 5 stores since I started at Fred meyer, the first 4 was a really good experience and overall great work environment and business ethic, the last store I worked at it wasn’t so, the upper managment was really rough, and won’t listen to reason yet they would stay on the associate until they force them to quit, or get them fired ."
good,Kroger is a place to grow an expand your work ability I’ve been with the company 14yrs an have learned a lot from the company an ready to expand more growth n another company
good,"Work together as work family, everyone got alone and helps each other out. Managers are great to get alone with. Managers helps you out when stock needs to go out on the shelves and to build displays. Help unload trucks and break down pallets."
good,"Worked at Kroger for 2 years, in produce the whole time. Transferred 5 different times around the area to promote and yes the pay is good, but if you can't handle the stress of constant pressure from the store management and higher up executives then don't work there. The company's ""standards"" are some of the highest yes, but also the most ridiculous ones out there. They give you absolutely no time or help to achieve those standards on the daily. Cutting hours and raising the amount of work to do, you can see where that goes. Kroger also gives no motivation to work well to help the company out. They have pay and benefits yes, but to most of the people under 25 that they hire, they could care less about a 401k or anything of that sort. They just blow it off as another job and will not help you whatsoever and that's where the management lacks. Kroger is unionized and because of that the most they can do is write a paper saying you aren't doing your job."
good,"Overall a great first job experience, but as I grew older, I began to want more out of the job and my particular location wasn't providing me room for growth."
good,Great job for those who are looking for a flexible work schedule. The company provides multiple discounts for employees. I recommend Kroger for those looking for a part-time job during school. It's also a great job for those who enjoy working with a wide variety of people.
good,"I enjoyed working at Krogers as a younger adult, the store was huge and I remember feeling so important for helping keeping this huge building running for my community around me"
good,Kroger is a fine place to work if it’s your kind of job. Has plenty of departments to transfer to if you don’t like your current position and are fine with grocery store jobs.
good,Kroger  has many ways to advance in whatever profession you desire or to make a life time career out of it.  overall a good working environment however it has little ability to balance work/life. It is a very fast pace department I worked in and if you can not keep up or get anxiety I would not recommend it. Otherwise it is a great opportunity.
good,Kroger is a good place to work it can be fun and stressful at the same time. You can advance in a career if that is your choice. Kroger is interested in advancing their employees and satisfying their future needs.
good,I loved working here when I was in school. Flexible hours balanced well with my school schedule. I got to meet new people everyday. The employees were really laid back and great to work with.
good,"Job was very easy given it was my first job, and coworkers were very nice. Hours do get changed for part time employees, and it is up to you to come in and see if your hours are changed."
good,it is a nice part time job to have when you're in high school or just starting college. The managers were consistent and there weren't any random policy changes
good,"I enjoyed my time working at the Columbus Bakery, specifically in the Snack Department. We processed raw corn to create bagged snack food for the Kroger grocery. The interaction with upper management, lab techs and hourly associates was key to running the operation. The hardest part of my job was probably the long work weeks but enjoyably the friendships created a family atmosphere."
good,"This was my first job in high school and that is a good amount of the employees there currently. Not a very hard job, but it could get boring toward the end of the night."
good,"Every company you work at is going t have your up downs. But Kroger is was sometimes was on whole another level . We would have lines backed up and you will be short staffed . And certain managers wouldn’t even help , they will just look at you and tell you the problems they seen. But the people there were amazing . We had a good team behind the customer service desk ."
good,"This company no longer cares about the people they have working for them. They are doing more with less but costing thousands to lose their jobs. It is all about profit, no matter the cost."
good,You have to learn to control and deal with different types of attitudes and people. You have to know how to remain calm under pressure and know when you’re trying to be scammed and not make a big scene for other customers to know.
good,Pay wages are not great. Advancement opportunities are almost non existent. Union is weak. Paid vacation and paid personal days come after a year and they add up the longer you are there. Full time is a thing but it’s a bid job based on seniority so if you are a new hire be prepared to wait a while. I’ve heard that how nice coworkers are differs from store to store I was lucky enough to have great coworkers. Management move around a lot which is quite frustrating because as soon as you get used to a manager they are forced to move.
good,The thing that I enjoyed most about this job was the customers. The regular customers were always great to talk to and to make your day. The manager was very nice.
good,"My coworkers were a great part of the job. If it paid higher, I would go back to it just to be in that environment with them. Management works with your requests and you get a 10% discount on all Kroger products. Also, you get annual raises."
good,They are covered by the union so you have 3 strikes and then you're out. They do have options for advancement and raises pretty often. Curtsey clerks just get the short end of the stick.
good,"The work wasn't hard, it was very self paced and easy to pick up. The environment was awesome, if you like friendly faces, this is the place to go. Just wish the hours were a little more reliable. one week i would hhave 40 next would be 15"
good,My boss makes it accommodating for me to work there part time in coordination with my other job. There is nothing much to tell. I stock groceries at night with no customers nor members of management around. I often work by myself but have worked in the company of others.
good,It's a great place with great workers but the pay is low. I have worked for the company for basically 4 years and got up to $9.50 a hour. They recently changed the contract to $10 minimum for start pay and I pushed up to it but I'm someone with 4 years experience and I'm now working at the same payout as new people with no experience.
good,"Personally, I believe the company should bring back the 30-60-90 day reviews. Based off my experience it is needed, due to the fact that it would help benefit the store. For associates, it is needed because it gives them the opportunity to see if they like the job, and to see if they would like to further their job search.That way you wouldn't have the problem of a high turnover rate. For managers, it is REALLY important. When you have someone running a store, you want to make sure they are legit enough. And what I mean by that is they could put on an act just to get in the seat. The 30-60-90 day reviews should be confidential between district and employee to see how management is operating the store. If is more than enough employees having the same issue, then they are not the right candidate for the seat. I say this because I've had 3 store managers since I've worked for Kroger and I've only had problem with 1. Nobody's perfect, but you know who is fit for the job, and who's not. I know every situation can't be met, but just to keep an open mind."
good,Each day was always fun. Great seeing the customers smiling. The employees were great for the most part. It was a great experience and I hope to find something that is as great as this job has been.
good,"Kroger is fun and relaxing the people are nice. I learned how to use a palette jack.The hardest part is interfering with people. The most enjoyable part of my job is the relaxed environment. I rate management a 5 star because, the manager helps out a lot and gives me praise when I do a good job."
good,Could use a bit more help. more employees scheduled. Pay scale should be higher. Needs to be more to compete with other retailers in the area. Kroger does have a lot to offer for advancement.
good,Kroger is a decent place to work! However work life balance is awful! Atypical day is being understaffed and no hours from cooperate to fulfill all your jobs duties. Management tries their best to hold it together and stay positive and fun throughout the hard times!
good,Kroger is a good place to work at just need to do better on compensation. But they do give the opportunity for one to move up. Over all good place for employment
good,"The work environment is not bad. It is a little bit of a struggle personally because of our pharmacy manager. She does not handle time management well. This makes everyday working with her very a very harrowing and exhausting task. "
good,"Kroger is a good place to work if you like working in a team, speaking to customers and having a set schedule. Management was very nice you would often get free gifts like sweatshirts and food. Overall the pay could have been better."
good,I had applied for full time and was never granted it. I was constantly searching for a job. The great thing about Kroger was the acceptance of me. One of my co-workers was harassing me about my gender identity and they had fired him due to that.
good,The environment is great along with good people the pay just isn’t enough for what I needed. They were very flexible with when I could and couldn’t work.
good,Kroger is a wonderful place to work but I just need to advance in a carrer.Management is always nice and not hard. It is very hard to advance in the business.
good,"Get more employees or pay the ones that are there better. Managers should help employees as well instead of just sitting in the office the whole time. Managers should give credit were it is due, and not put someone under the bus when something does not go right."
good,I enjoyed working part time at Kroger over the summer. I worked there for 3 months and then left due to my college starting again. I really liked the environment of workplace and the colleagues  working besides me.
good,There were exciting things happening on a daily basis.  I had the opportunity to meet people from all walks of life.  Although every day may not have been all smiles I was still able to learn many tasks that may help in the field with another job.
good,The job was overall enjoyable. The main downfall was the lack of leadership skills within the leadership team during shifts. Management was very flexible with hours.
good,"A nice working environment, fast paced, and hard working establishment. Management very strict. And customer skills are good. Just work hard stay focused and do the job your supposed to do."
good,"Great benefits offered, dental, vision and medical benefits. We has a lot of team building activities such as family picnics and basketball tournament. The work is hard but fair with a very high paced work environment with demanding production goals."
good,it was a good company to work for. they had very good benefits and the management was always fair. the work hours were very flexible. i was thought and learned life long work lessons.
good,"mostly laid back, can get a little fast paced at times especially on weekends and big sales days but its nothing no one cant handle. stay busy when on the clock and you'll do well."
good,"Work is relatively easy, though it can be stressful at some times. Would recommend it for someone in school or looking for part time work. Overall easy way to earn a paycheck."
good,First starting the job everything is great but it all depends on what department you start in. Some positions get paid much more than others starting off even if the lowest paying title does more work than the other ones.
good,It was my first job when I was 15 and I enjoyed it because it was easy and you could make friends with the coworkers. But it does get old doing the same thing every day over and over again
good,"You basically work yourself to death and barely get paid. You have to be there for a certain amount of time to get benefits, and the pay raises are junk. You get them by the number of hours put in, so it takes forever and you only get like 5 cent raises. If you show you are a hard worker, they completely take advantage of you, and they also call you up from your department, even if you are busy to run a register, instead of scheduling the right amount of cashiers."
good,"just have good costumer service "
good,"The pay is low, if you wish to get into a decent paying position with the company you have to get into management which is very competitive and are sparse."
good,this job was Ok the pay was good to. when i got sick with pneumonia and i asked if i could take a sick day the said i have to work or quit. i was sick and did not want to get other sick so i quit.
good,Fast paced most of the people are in clicks like high school management changes a lot so once you get used to how one person is running things they leave and in comes a knew manager
good,"Kroger is a great starting point if you want to get into the work force. It really helps you learn how to interact with all kinds of people, especially the upset customers that come in. It also gives you some problem solvong skills since not everything is shown to you and you have to figure out things on your own."
good,"Weekends are stressful, but its the only way I make enough money to pay my car insurance. A regular day is the pace I like it at, fairly laid back most of the time with a few steady streams of customers per every hour or so."
good,"Kroger actually has a very good work environment as long as you don't mind interacting with the general public. Its also nice because you can choose the days and hours you are available. The downside of working here is that you get paid very little, there is virtually no opportunity for overtime, and some of the management can be unreasonable at times"
good,"Job duties were pretty simple, job had low supervision. We were required to pull our pallets to the floor and sort items according to each aisle prior to placing items on shelfs. Unfortunately sometimes we were short staffed with heavy loads of pallets to finish."
good,"minimum 10 hour days, guaranteed to work holidays and weekends. required to work days and nights. great health insurance, up to 5 weeks vacation great job security. Great for single individuals who want to immerse themselves in work."
good,"Working at Kroger was ok and everything but they seem like they didn't really want to pay, out of the four years working there when i stopped working there i was only making $7.55 so i wasn't really feeling that anymore."
good,"this job was really good as i worked there for 4 years, i had no issues on this besides there is no way to become full time unless you're there forever. Some of the management there didn't seem to care much for the employees at all. easy to move to different departments"
good,On average it was a good company to work for but there was so much division between management and employees. The company closed the location without informing employees within 3 months of closing.
good,While working at Kroger I learned a couple of tips that I still use through out in my life. Making sure I was on time for my shift. Also making sure I made it back from my breaks on time. Being on time is everything to me now!
good,"the people were really nice, helped me a lot, learned and gained a lot from them. great environment friendly faces would love to do it again. I learned how to multitasked from working there"
good,Kroger was a fast paced environment but it was also a easy to learn and very great people to be around. Worked with your schedule very well and also had great benefits.
good,"Nice environment, although not much pay nor flexability for scheduling. Kroger does not appreciate hard work over tenure which seems to be their main focus..."
good,Large company that numbers on paper were more important than the people they employed.   The benefits were great if you were fortunate enough to be part of the old contract.
good,I enjoy shopping at Kroger they have fresh food and the company has great benefits! Hardiest part of the job is making sure the customers are happy. I don't like the management there because they are not all nice some of them have attitudes. Most enjoyable part of the job is that I got to learn about different cheese around the world.
good,Management was always around to help if you had questions. Nobody ever had any issues with helping if you weren't sure of what you were doing. Hours were plentiful even if you had to go to another department to get them.
good,At Kroger you Work 8 to 11 hours  A Day typically 11 when its busy ive learned how to stay with it And work really no matter how long of a work day we have there. the management if okay but we need better training here. the hardest part about the job is maintaining your percentage for a whole week and what i enjoy most about the job is stacking pallets and riding on the power worker
good,Kroger is a very easy and fast paste job. Time goes by quick. I worked at least 40 hours and eventually got moved up to front end supervisors. Co workers are very friendly.
good,I love the job and the customers and they loved me to and they also want me to come back.... I can't because they don't give me the hours that I'm looking for
good,I started working at Kroger's in high school as a courtesy clerk and they were very flexible for the most part but i did hit a few snags as far as management.
good,"Working at pick and save was okay but I always had to work in other departments like deli , the front  end etc . The management sucked because I had  zero hours some weeks."
good,Kroger is a pretty nice place to work the only thing I HATE about it is that it's really hard to go full time and part time hours aren't consistent. One week you may work 27 hours then the next week you only may get 16 hours.
good,My review on kroger is that it is a productive workplace     and also it could do better with the instructions they want the courtesy clerks to do because its not all that organized.
good,good place to start out as courtesy clerk and then move up to cashier. The company culture is great and involves management meeting with employees to showcase importance of customer service and goals store is trying to reach.
good,"The workplace is great depending on co-workers and if management decides to pick favorites. But, this happens in many facilities. I learn a lot and its fast paced."
good,"Good Company culture, great benefits! Not sure of stability of division TLC, stability of Co (Kroger) is great. the TLC division is still growing, and seems to have some struggles within."
good,"job is really for teenagers, you cant get overtime or work over 8 hrs a day. some of the mangers are cool depends on who you have. its a nice work place just wish we'd get paid more for the work we do"
good,"Very difficult company to work for as a manager.  You are almost always working about one hour from home.  Ten hour shifts, five days a week that almost always go over.  Average at least 60 hours/week on salary wages.  Excellent benefit package."
good,The store GM was awesome and so were most of the managers but there was one manager that was a jerk. He never listened to anyone elses opinion. Besides him the job was great. I would still be there if they never closed down.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the public. The management and coworkers were nice to work with, everyone worked together to serve the public. The benefits were very good, however the pay was a little low. Advancement was not encouraged."
good,"9-12 hour days goes quick from working hard"
good,It's not a terrible place to work. But the managers choose favorites. Not everyone is treated equally. Breaks aren't on time. And everyone knows everything that is going on with everyone.
good,the store in general is a great place to work. the pay is average and the environment is good. it was a good first job for me. it was a great place to start to stand on my own two feet
good,"Very good job for kids in high school and or first job. I worked there a while back, and I enjoyed myself but I needed better pay. You meet a lot of people and your coworkers become your friends."
good,Stores do include the union which can be great but in my experience they were not. After working for general office I lost many benefits and had to pay the union and insurance more.
good,It's a cool job to work at you just have to have the mentality to go get you some money every night working as a conditioner. Working as a conditioner for Kroger is a good job because you get benefits and good hours.
good,I love management but some of the floor managers had nasty attitudes. I enjoyed being a cashier because I love to help people and sometimes going to work made my day better. You have to be patient to be a cashier at Kroger.
good,The people in my department made the overall work experience enjoyable. The management took care of their employees and had flexible hours.
good,"samethings day in and day out "
good,"I enjoy most of the people and the work, customers can be rude but that's expected. If you like moving around a lot and helping other departments, this is a good place to work."
good,It was ok but work could have been better I was treated like your not a good worker they got on to me about stuff that I didn't do but didn't say nothing to anyone else if they did anything wrong it was a good work experience but they don't let you move up to manage ment they pick who they want
good,"I liked working at Kroger it just the management was terrible, i worked hard though with a very positive attitude bout the customers i believe strong in customer first at all costs so i had a good time. i enjoyed the fast paced environment, schedules and friendly customers. But at the the time i was Homeless i got low income and left to go to school, but What basically learned out of the experience was the great customer service way of putting the customer first in all circumstances. A  lot people dont think of others before themselves no days so i loved that part the most and enjoyed while i could."
good,The problem I've had with this company is when the higher ups in positions of power do not know how a certain department operates and how time consuming certain jobs within that department can be. This has caused many conflicts of what needs to be done within a certain amount of time vs what they want to add onto an employees job. With what I have experienced I was never able to have a guarantee that I wouldnt be stuck an hour past my shift because somebody wants to add to my list of things. I've even noticed this with other employees that I have worked with having the same issue.  However the people I have worked with were really nice and easy to get along with in getting a job done.
good,"I have to say my employment with kroger as a stock clerk was not too bad, the only downside was I wanted to stay a grocery stock clerk and unfortunately at my store that meant having to work night shift. On the plus side there are many great benefits to working there."
good,My co-workers are awesome! some of them i am still friends today and we like to talk about our experiences good or bad  at krogers.
good,"Kroger is overall a good place to work. They work wonderfully with my school schedule but the pay isn't very good at all. I have been there for almost three years, and I know how to work in every department and I only make $7.70 an hour. "
good,Kroger Co. is a great company to learn as much as possible and take greatness to another company. Kroger is a good company for teens and people seeking part-time jobs. Managers can be more motivating.
good,I gained expierence in a ton of fields while working at frys. I learned efficient ways to rally carts and also how to maintain a clean workspace for me and everyone around me. a typical day consisted of a ton of different things. Co-workers were always a plus along with the fact that if i was sick or really needed to go home i could count on someone to take over the rest of my shift.
good,"Typical day at work: stock the product, clean the saw, take out the trash, and help the customers "
good,Friendly coworkers and managers. customers were  cool could be a pain sometimes. Pay is decent. gets busy on weekends. overall good experience
good,Its great working there. I learned how to mange money and work under pressure. You also learn how to manage your attitude when dealing with different people.
good,"Good co-workers,enjoy customer service and selling a good product to the customer so they will return back for the customer service they got."
good,Kroger Inc. is a great place to work for any teenager that is looking to make extra money while furthering their education. They have a large staff and plenty of schedule flexibility. This job showed me how to provide excellent customer service and how to build relationships with customers that encouraged them to come back and shop again.
good,I actually liked working at kroger but the job was not challenging. associates were not happy but they have a great skill communication with customer.
good,"A typical day would include opening the office, counting and reconciling the tills, completing the daily reports.  Assist customers with solving problems, answering questions, Western Union transactions, money orders and the selling and paying out lottery tickets.  Assisting in supervising the cashiers and baggers.  The store had a lot of good workers, but there also were a lot of very young employees who had no idea of work ethic.  They needed a lot of guidance to bring them to the level of a good employee.  I really enjoyed the majority of the customers.  Even today, I see customers (store was closed in 2010) and they will stop and chat with me."
good,Always friendly no matter the day and time when busy with customers. They strive to bring the very best for the customers everyday.
good,"Casual, innovative and modern.they're very nice people, always willing to help.Awesome place to work as well as great time with co-workers."
good,good place to work but management could be better. the management typically do what they want and really don't think about others.
good,long days hard on your body. I met a lot of new people everyday. too many workers thinking they're in charge. the left hand doesn't know what the right is doing.
good,"It's a good place to work if you're in high school, it is a family oriented environment where everyone is being treated like family, and it teaches you about good customer service."
good," Greeted customers as they entered the store. Presented customers with any promotional "
good,Very easy-going job. Fast paced at times however nothing overwhelming. Fair opportunities for growth including relocation. Mostly involves bagging groceries and pushing carts.
good,"Krogers is a great company, though stressful at times, it is a great first job with possibility for growth.  The co workers and management were a bit childish and hard headed, but they all mean well. work load and compensation were unbalanced, as well as having a social life."
good,This was my first time working in the bakery at pick n save. I thought it was fun meet a lot of different people and serving the customers was my number one priority. They also don't pay enough either.
good,"Ralph's Grocery Store was a good job overall. Unfortunately, it was not the path I was looking for. I would like a little more challenge in my future jobs as well as higher pay. The scheduling was also not convenient for my schooling. The staff was very welcoming and made the job enjoyable."
good,Would come in at night and do the job of the person who was suppose to un load the truck then we would separate the groceries and start working the frozen aisle
good,"Working at Kroger can teach you a lot about customer service. Sometimes you may even learn something you didn't know. Sometimes you may approach that one person that makes you smile. And when you find that customer that always smiles when they see you, then most likely they will come back to see you again."
good,"At Kroger I helped customers and stocked the store before it reopened in the morning. I learned how Kroger operates in stocking there story on a daily basis before it opened in the morning. management really wasn't there because managers would work all the way until there was 2 hours left before the store closed, right before I came into the job. my co-workers would stock there area of the store and if they finish before everybody they would go help my other co-workers. the hardest part about the job is working on a certain area of the store that has the most items in it. the most enjoyable part of my job was the co-workers I met while I was working there. They were friendly and always worked just as hard as me."
good,"A typical day at work is clocking in on time, going to your supervisor or PIC to see what they want you to do for the day. Do what they say and then get started. I learned a lot about how to deal with all sorts of people with different cultures and rich to poor. Management is pretty decent there and co-workers tend to be like a family, "
good,"I enjoyed helping the customers, and my co-workers. I wish I had a better manager. The hardest part of my job was being mistreated by some customers and my boss."
good,Biggest traditional grocery in the US.  Sometimes you can feel lost in the mix.  There is room for advancement but there is high competition for the same spot.
good,"Depending on the area you are assigned to for the day you would either pick store orders and deliver them to the right dock and location in the warehouse.  Or I would recive the products that came into the warehouse organize it and send it to its right place throughout the warehouse."
good,I deal with people all day sometimes it can get hectic but with a positive attitude you can get through because we have a strong group of employees.
good,Kroger is an awesome place to work at. But it doesnt pay enough to pay the bills and have an awesome life outside of work.
good,Kroger allowed for the ability to have a life outside of the office and not to have to take your work home with you.
good,"stoking"
good,fast pase  customer service with the intention to help every customer positively. I learned that by having the best attitude contributes on how you effect others. Being an active listener helps a great deal when dealing with people. my coworker were really down to earth and we work together great as a team. The were some difficult times but with a assertive positive attitude things always get done. I enjoyed meeting new people and being able to help them.
good,I started out at Kroger in the Dairy Department working in stock. After a few months I moved into the Meat Department working stock and occasionally helping prepare fresh meat. Working at Kroger I learned how fast-paced the job was and how important it was to make sure that everything was done correctly. My co-workers were good to me and helped me whenever I needed it and also gave me some great advice. The hardest part of the job was making sure everything on the floor was full in stock. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know everyone and interacting with customers.
good,"Not a bad job to have if one had other means of earning money, otherwise a second job is a must. Perfect for a high school student but not for someone looking for a job that gets you a lot of hours or money. If one is working 7 hours or more you only get 2 15 minute breaks OR a half hour lunch, not both."
good,My fellow employees helped out and the management was great. My wage is the only thing that i have something to complain about.
good,The People of the company are welcoming and it is a tolerable workplace but the pay is not that great at all. The jobs are too extreme and the company is more than willing to work around your availability. It is hard to get the full benefits but the union can be a useful tool if you ever need them to help you fight the company.
good,"My typical day at work was be on time and work hard and finish on time."
good,Management needs to have better communication with employees.
good,This was my first job I had and I was treated well. However due to circumstance I had to leave. Management was great and worked well with my school schedule and managed to find some extra hours when I needed it.
good,I enjoyed taking care of every customer that came through the doors and was always ready to give them my best foot forward. I enjoyed working for this company for the short time that I was there. I have never had a hard day at work and it was most pleasing to see everyone smile.
good,I love meeting new people and the avancement in the program is amazing
good,Has some good benefits and higher postions open.  Dont like how its is so diffcult to get full time contract there.  Doesn't encourage new people to want to apply
good,I don't know about every Kroger but the one I am currently at I couldn't ask for a better supervisor. He has worked with me on various things and I have never had a more honest or down to earth supervisor that I can be honest and speak frankly with. My day consists of unloading a truck and getting the most work I can possibly do done in a night. I wish that the pay was better honestly but its better than nothing. The hardest part of my job would be nights when the light crew is made lighter due to illness or requests for days off.
good,"I appreciate the oppertunity i was given working at Kroger. I was going to a tech' school at the time, so i only worked fri-sun, top of the morning. though I didnt have that many hours, Kroger made me realize that i like to work, earning my own money. Thank you Kroger!"
good,I worked the morning shift.I got to work at 4am and off at 1. pm.I made sandwiches for the whole day. And made holiday trays and trays customer's wanted during the week.I also did customer service.And cooked when needed.
good,I have learned a lot about managing the department and I am even in command when the manager is not there. We are typically free to make our own choices about what to do when working but are usually given a starting point. majority of the workers do as much as they can so that the next person is not overwhelmed and has enough time to make sure things are together for the next day. the most enjoyable part are the bonds we have with each other and the hardest part is the different attitudes we have.
good,"It is a great place to work as far as they will work with schedules and help you be happy, It hard to advance in the company and also hard to get a raise, typical day at work is just selling rings, and doing some small paper work responsibilities, management like all places can be hit or miss i have had 2 managers one was great the other difficult, the regional is great, co-workers in general has been a great experience,, hardest part of the job is making sales when no customers come in i have gone days without helping a single customer"
good,I learned how difficult it can be to manage fellow coworkers especially those who have been with the company longer than I have. Management has an open door policy while is nice if needing to raise a question or come to them with ideas. Most difficult part of my job would be having to know how to remedy any problem that may arise in a quick and timely manner.
good,"A normal day at Kroger consists of maintaining certain standards reqiuered by management. This can include inventorying and ordering the correct product needed on a daily basis. You work with employess who become part of your Kroger ""family"". Along with the daily tasks of stocking product, being customer friendly is just as important. Job security, good working conditions as well as meeting new people helps to mold an individual."
good,"I started my days getting my depaqrtment in order for customers and sales, satisfying customers and keeping fresh product out for retail.Happy customers was my motivation."
good,This was a job where my skills with money and people came into effect. I was always apart of a transaction where i had to keep the customers attention. That help with confidence and learning how to deal with money professionally
good,The Bakery dept. has great team work. Everyone gets along and works together to get the job done every day.
good,This was a good company to work for while attending college.
good,Family friendly grocery store. Pretty clean place. Good customer service and management. I would recommend in the future. Overall satisfaction was good.
good,"I felted at times their was favoritism with other employees and I didn’t belong truly."
good,"Never seen a chance to promote from part time to full time."
good,"Management is not the best at assigning roles to people that would fit them well. Everyone is viewed the same and therefore it doesn’t matter where they work in the store. Many employees would rather be in other departments due to their skill sets, but nothing is ever really changed."
good,Although i enjoyed working for kroger i did not like the pay the employees where nice and friendly as well as the customers very comfortable place to work
good,Working at Kroger I had problems with management. Most of their managers don’t treat you right. some customers can be rude but you just try to help them the best you can.
good,Was good start for my first job. Staff was very open and accepting of me. Felt I could have went far with the company if I never relocated. Overall enjoyed my time there as an employee
good,"Kroger has some issues due to being part of Union. Such as people getting promotions you deserve just because they have seniority. They pay no more than they have to for workers, and will keep you in the same position for years. The people are friendly and the work is good though. It is a good first job with amazing benefits."
good,I am just a Kroger through college. They pay above minimum and wage and give decent hours for the summer. The work is not difficult and most of the workers are friendly and helpful.
good,The store is a nice place to work at but the supervisor and manager at the produce department too many racist germans feels overpowered over other people. Like my manager in the produce department needs to change his attitude he act aggressive like he wants to fight and shows hate to the hispanic people. I as myself the harder i work the more complains i get i never get any appreciation but i learn how to keep my own space and continue working there to survive my days of living. They know i am a citizen born but still treat me like i am illegal god bless each one of them.
good,"I was a part time courtesy clerk and it wasn't too bad of a job despite the Arizona heat. Customers treated me nicer than managers, but overall it was a paycheck. As a courtesy clerk I bagged groceries and assisted disabled/elderly individuals to their vehicles. I was also in charge of collecting carts from the parking lot and bringing them to the front of the store for the customers. Management was pretty bad to say the least, they never really had cart schedules ready before shifts which caused miscommunication between the courtesy clerks as too many would be outside or inside leaving customers to bag their own groceries or not having any carts available for the incoming customers. And we needed their approval for a ""break"" but they told up they will relieve us when its time and there were 10hr shifts I've covered without a break."
good,Management was better than the last job that I had. They will put you somewhere where they see fit. The only problem that I had with the company was the position that they put me in. I didn't like the last position that I had before I left. The store moved to store clerk and I was not comfortable with that position. They are not flexible enough on hours. They were totally unfair when it came to my hours.
good,Its a good start out job. If u are trying to stay there for a career you better want ti stay. Its pretty busy because customers are in and out all day.
good,good work life balance.  good job security.  excellent benefits and compensation.  good Potential to move up in the company.  Technology group has enormous budget.
good,The managers are easy to talk to. All around a decent place to work. I only had one scheduling issue which was fixed the next day by HR. Everyone was easy to reach when I needed them.
good,Kroger have great staff but they just work you a lot for little pay. They would work me 5 days a week but I only get paid two hundred dollars or less but other then the pay Kroger is fair.
good,working at krogers has helped me develop  my people and social skills as being a bagger/cashier forced me to get out of my shyness rut i was stuck in during high school.
good,"Stressful and fast paced. There's never enough employees. The benefits are great though. Cheap insurance, and weekly paychecks were a plus. Too many people in the chain of command so it's difficult to move up."
good,This is my view recorded I need a job I would be a cleaner in the job I always be a good worker even The Vacation I will get the information tour guide
good,"Fast paced and a bit stressful at times, Co-workers were awesome. Hours are very up and down though. The managers seem to play favorites and that can be a bit discouraging. The benefits are great though."
good,"Once you get the hang of things, its very manageable. It's hard work but you get paid well. Learning to manage your work-life balance is the key for this job."
good,Heavy workload fast paced friendly environment clean food served on job breaks are a plus management always available great benefits nice week vacations
good,The company is okay I would recommend it to a friend that need a job. It had its ups and down but that's with every job. But it was bad management far as in the higher boss. Rude and disrespectful
good,"This was my first job and i really enjoyed a lot. I learned how to be responsible, organized."
good,Kroger is a great place to work for people how don’t have bills to pay such as teenagers the pay rate is low and the raise we get every six months is only increased by five cents so the first six months your raise is only five cent and the second is ten cents
good,It is a pretty good job but what i noticed i did not like is going outside almost every other hour to retrieve the carts from the parking lot in all types of weather.
good,Kroger is definitely a good time with great benefits I just want to be in the health/ medical field. Kroger is definitely a fast pace job and the coworkers are great.
good,"I was hired on as a full-time employee due to perfect attendance and no points/write - ups before the 12th week of training was finished. When you start...your base rate pay is $13.50 but there's an incentive program they use. Long story short the incentive program allows no cap on your pay so if you maintain the required performance rating you'll be making alot of money. However, the incentive program is flawed severely and that's one reason this job has a many people that leave. If they got rid of the incentive program, gave everybody increased ""hourly"" pay there might not be an issue but they don't do it. As a part-timer you only work 8 hrs. but after being hired on as a full timer it's 10 hours and mandatory shift change to 2nd shift which is 5 p.m. - 3 a.m. unless they let people go home early. 2nd shift is rather chaotic and even more fast paced than 1st shift. It's a young persons job. The majority of all employee's are 18 - mid 30. DO NOT think you'll join this fast paced job at 40+ and you're going to retire here. You're either assigned to work in a refrigerator where it's about 30-40, freezer at about -20+ or grocery at about 60-70. You get 2 15 min. breaks and 1 30 min. lunch break. Cafeteria is fairly large with atleast 10+ microwaves but on 2nd you'll be waiting to use one due to so many people and not enough microwaves. Takes about 6.5 years to max base rate hourly pay at about $22 (?) at 2 pay increases per year. There's more perks and cons here to mention. "
good,"I loved working at Kroger, especially as a student. Great environment, workers, customers and management. Only complaint was the hours. I was doing part time for a while doing about 30 hours a week. I wanted a full 40, but eventually went to under 20 hours a week. When I was working they tend to cut hours a lot for all sorts of workers."
good,"Working at Kroger was both fun and stressful. It was fun because I was able to interact with customers and talk with other employees. It was also stressful because their schedule is inconsistent, and get done from my shifts at 11 at night."
good,"other employees are fun to work with. if you have a good manager the store runs smooth, if not your life is miserable. upper management is constantly changing everything, and you are stuck trying to explain it to the customer. but its a UNION JOB get them bennies :)"
good,It was a great way to start off one of my first jobs and I also liked how the job helped me with strength . This job at Kroger was a big help with my personality and the way I acted toward people also
good,Working at Kroger’s was a well fixed job for me because it was consistent and very professional when it comes to worker justice. It came with plenty benefits and the money was good. Working here will improve social skills and awareness. I was thought a lot from this job. It was good.
good,Kroger was a good experience because it teaches you to work fast and it teaches you people skills. There were some days when we had to deal with a rude customer but that was it.
good,"Most of the department managers reflected the store manager's attitude at that time. He was an insensitive bully, and many of his department managers, behaved in the same way. I have heard, however, there has been a change in management."
good,krogers is a price friendly place to shop for groceries and the price are reasonable and sometimes everyone crashes into each other while busy rush. plus everyone like to enjoy one another and have nice conversations.
good,I enjoy my team as worker and as work friends I also enjoy my lead which I am assistant too he has taught me the ropes of the company and leads by example as a hard worker
good,"Working for Kroger became more difficult-- a severely increased workload and not enough employees to help out. My department was put on the back burner, and that proved to be extremely stressful when Corporate came to view the store."
good,"some of the managers talked to your any kind of way , poor managment over all the work was productived and the coworkers always tried to stick togther in situations"
good,"Typical day at work wasn't bad with the group we had at the deli. Check in, cut meats and cheese for customers clean up here and there then check out."
good,"Kroger is a nice place to work for your first job. I worked here while I was in high school, and they were always flexible with hours as long as I notified the schedule-maker in advance. The discounts are also a nice bonus."
good,"this is not a place to work if you are easily bored or impressionable. everybody should be cool but watch out for the bossy ones ,they come and go. Kroger was my first job it took a while to get it."
good,"If you like meeting the public face to face this is the job for you. If you like giving good customer service and assisting others you will enjoy this job. Management is compensated very well. The bar is set high and you are not expected to reach it, but you are not told that."
good,"You’ll work with some of the most funny and loveable people that you could ever meet. Some of them are like your second family. All you have to do is make sure that you do whatever that you’re told to do and serve and greet every customer with a smile, even the rude ones."
good,"A typical day of work consisted of: constant stock of produce, friendly customer service, cooperation with coworkers, and quickness when placing product. I have learned that if you stay on task and be polite to customers that the day will progress much faster. Management was ok when it came down to answering any questions that the employees would have, as well as making sure each department was functioning up to company standards. When working there my coworkers were very helpful and friendly. the hardest part of my job would have to be lifting the heavy cases of product, but the most enjoyable part was being able to get the job done with out conflict and the helpfulness of my coworkers."
good,"I enjoyed being the Lead manager at the fuel center, however, I did not the fact that we worked 8 hours or more and did not receive any breaks or we were not able to advance or get raises."
good,Never was placed in a permanent location after 5+ years of floating. Pleasant staff at most district stores. Fast paced and competitive pharmacy. Lack of encouragement from upper management.
good,The company was good to work for as for as the mangers in the store and the people in the Corprate office they were cool people i have to see that if i ever needed to go back i would gladly go back or if i was to refer a friend i would all in all its a good company to work for and with.
good,A typical day at kroger is very busy. there is always something to do to keep you busy especially with it always being short staffed. They hire a lot of teenagers and people who do not take the job serious so we tend to have a lot of no calls or call outs.
good,"Management is amazing when it comes to my manager, I've seen and heard of some managers who are absolute psychopaths."
good,I loved working at Kroger for the time I did . The staff were very friendly they made me feel at home quick . I always catch on quickly also . They had me off the schedule for a month before because I wasn't needed. It was the type of job that had me on call and would call me if they needed Me.
good,"Okay job, don’t like to give more hours, easy work, nice people, the job isn’t that bad, just need more hours and more money for everyday life, and gas"
good,The workplace wasn't the best but the co-workers over there were really nice. The part i didn't like was when I would have to go get karts. After all it really helped me how to work and what to do in a workplace environment.
good,Kroger is great place to gain experience in the industry. It provides a great work life balance and terrific culture. The company provides an adequate amount of PTO and a great 401K plan.
good,Loved working with Kroger but thought I was being treated unfairly with the short time I been working for the company. Employees was professional for the most part
good,I work there during high school. Its was a great place to work. They work around you school schedule.  Its a great workforce place. Management always welcome you with a smile and if you have any problems they make sure they can find a solution.
good,"The people make the job a great place to work. The management is very poor. The work is simple. Put stock on the shelves, keep things organized, do your reports and scans, rinse and repeat. However management is very slow about hiring help for your department and make unreasonable requests that your and your team just can't handle without proper help. The benefits are great and they will work with you on hours. Only place I've been that lets you put family first instead of the job. If you stay long enough the pay isn't bad either considering what you do every day. Overall not a bad job, just needs better management."
good,"The manager could have let me explain my situation before he just let me go. Instead they let me go due to me calling in twice and the first time I had a hospital note. The second time I got sick from the heat, and didn't think it was best for me to go into work to push carts in the heat when I already felt like I was going to pass out."
good,"sometimes it can become stressful, and they could be unfair. When another co worker would call off or not show up I would it would usually affect me because I would have to stay later even when I was supposed to be off."
good,"ive been with Kroger for almost 10yrs. 1st few years started off great but aft a while store management changed and employment struggled. we became dollar signs instead of honored and respected workers. union representatives harassed employees daily an no good benefits with them really, they just took their dues every week with n help to us. i loved my job, dept. manager(s) co-workers and benefits but not the place itself. we change for the better but for the worst."
good,I enjoyed working at pick n save because I met so many new people. I enjoy interacting and conversing with people. Although people may have tendencies to be rude I enjoy them all
good,"The longer you last, the better. Hard to become full-time as a new hire now. Starts at minimum wage for new hires. Hourly pay. Hours received based upon store senority."
good,Its an ok company to work for. on a regular work day we have our busy times and our layed back times. overall kroger stores is a decent and fair company to work for.
good,"Good place to begin a career as a school schedule can be met. It's like having a huge family, and the customers most of the time are just part of the family. Kroger is loyal to not only their employees, but also to their customers. The mission statement is definitely upheld, and the core values of the company are of utmost importance."
good,the job was fine as long as the department was properly staffed. but other than that the job is great. the people there are always so friendly. the job is also fast paced if you're into that.
good,I really enjoyed my part time job at Kroger pharmacy. I was a certified pharmacy technician. I left this job because of the demands of nursing school.
good,Great company alot of people are losing their jobs due to positions being cut. The Insurance is great. Everyone shops at kroger so the job stability is there
good,Was an employee that was dependable and willing to learn all skills that were required by the company and was able to communicate to the public the information correctly that was required
good,"A typical day at Krogers wasn't really stressful, but it was a bit challenging at times. I learned that even if a store is really nice and clean doesn't mean the manager running the store is nice. Management was probably the main reason I didn't enjoy the store. The workplace was fine and I enjoyed majority of the people. The hardest part about my job was putting up with the management. The most enjoyable part about my job were the friendly staff(sometimes) and happy customers who I had no problem helping."
good,Good place to work. Good for a first job. Management how ever is not good. Management only seemed to care about their bonuses And not their employees. And I recommend not working for a unionized store
good,Not a good work place cause won't work with you whe n an injury or an accident occurs. Dont care if you can't or have a ride or if injured and won't let you get rehired and want to investigate you cause of missing or calling work in wgen not feeling well and want to put you in investigation but i did call union but no luck with that either.
good,"Has a lot of benefits, union, holiday pay, insurence, personal days. Job security. Full time gets fourty hours, paid 15 min breaks. I get two paid vacations wince ive been there for 5 years.  Weekly pay. Its very much so a secure job. You just gotta stick with it and be a people person."
good,Kroger as a company is a good company to work for. Co-workers are all friend and very helpful with each other and customers too.
good,"it was a great company to work for. met a lot of people. the job wasn't hard at all. management was great, they did want they needed too do to get stuff done."
good,"Fast and furious is my workday."
good,Cut meat and cheese for customers. Fried chicken and managed temp logs. Cleaning everything. Flipping and making salads.Helped with ordering.
good,Most people there are great and will be missed.  You will stay busy and never be board.  The hardest part of the job is finding time to do your job in their time frame.  The most enjoyable part of the job is that most of the co-workers are friendly.
good,"I was employed for 12 years,as a grocery checker, and enjoyed my job, my customer service skills, my honesty, and genuine courtesy to all customers, were always at a 100%. I had built a great amount of trust, and respect not only with customers, but with my co- workers as well."
good,"A typical day at work would start by ordering, completing replenishment reports, filling all out of stocks,"
good,Everyday there is something new to learn and experience with people also associates. I manage departments and set expectations so we can reach our goals as a team. I train and educate the Kroger way in the company.
good,I enjoyed working for this company a typical work day waking up operating register. I learned customer courtesy. Management able to work with. Great co workers. Hardest part customers. Enjoyable part customers
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers with their needs, thus feeling helpful."
good,"Kroger is a great workplace for high school and college students looking to make money while in school. A typical day at work included helping customers, cleaning, and doing small tasks.The management is a bit disorganized but overall fairly productive. The co-workers there are extremely friendly and most very easy to work with. The hardest part of the job was doing tasks that were not necessarily your job. The most enjoyable was the relationships built with co-workers and frequent shoppers."
good,it was pretty much ok to me I did enjoy my co-workers though that is what made the environment a fun environment and always the customers too
good,An overall good place of employment for anyone from students to retirees.
good,I enjoyed blowing up balloons and making flower bouquets for customers. I also enjoyed working as a cashier because I got to interact with the customers before they leave the market.
good,I worked there all the way till after the strike. It was great and wore many hats. I love to learn different aspects of my job and what might be better for me to keep my attention. I love challenges. I have to say this job did it for me. One day I was a cashier then the next I was decorating cakes. I loved it.
good,a good job but definitely needed better management. I did love my co workers as we all got along. I learned how to do inventory and give superior customer service and make displays on the sales floor.
good,get between 50-100 customers a day management was respectful and co-workers hardest party of the job on fridays rush hr large money orders and alot of customers cashing checks.
good,"I preformed bagger duties of placing groceries into plastic paper and cloth bags, assisted customers to their vehicles, put hand baskets and carts in their proper areas, and removed carts from the parking lot. I learned to work with people of all different orientations and found the pleasures of working in a team format. My managers and co-workers were all always great people and supportive of me and my goals. The hardest times at work were the busiest of times and the most enjoyable was being around people who knew me after so many years."
good,"A typical day at kroger is giving breaks, helping customers, checking, and training new hires. I learned a lot from kroger it gave me a good understanding of customer service, taught me how to manage other people, showed me how to balance and count tills, and showed me what to do and not to do. The management had good days and bad days some days it doesn't feel like they work. The people i work with are hard workers and are very good with customers. There wasn't a hard part if i didn't know how to do something i would take the time out and learn it. Putting a smile on customers faces."
good,"The hours were flexible, and my co-workers were friendly. I learned alot about fuel and oil spills and safety proceduers, I also learned excellent customer service skills. The hardest part of my job was being away from my children while they were younger. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with people I am a friendly person and love being around people. Mangement was really nice and worked well with there employees."
good,"I've learned that you have to approach each individual different. The way you may talk with one person, you may have to talk differently with another."
good,"A typical day at work was to find the Store Manager and find out if there was any thing he needed done right away. Walk the store, if nothing is urgent, to check all condition and communicate with Department Managers any concerns they might have with their department. Talk with employees and customers as I move from one department to another. After the walk make out a list of jobs needing to be accompished. Management and co-workers friendly and hard working.The hardest part of the job was the multible fires throughout the store on some days. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with the customers."
good,"A typical day at work will be interacting with customers and serving customers throughout the day by helping them locate items and assisting them through the check-out line. The hardest part of the job was not being able to be recognized as a hard-working cashier by getting a pay raise or promotion due to school schedule allowing me to only work on weekends. The managers and supervisors were great, the work environment was very friendly."
good,Some days go by faster than others. We have hour rotations on the tasks we are doing. Co-workers are very caring. The most enjoyable part has to be seeing people leave with a smile.
good,on time every day.love communicating with people as I assist them with their needs.co workers were awesome.
good,It is a noraml day to go clock in and seat yourself in front of the window..you take payment for gasoline and help customers as needed. In some cases there may be a spill or mess that needs to be cleaned and you take trash out clean the area. Sometimes customers may ask for help with teh gas it self and we can go out when not busy and pump their gas for them if needed. Basically you sit in the station and take payment.
good,A promotion to this company is only a title change. You have to work 600+ hours to get a 10 cent increase. Once they see you can finish your task early they'll add tasks over time. The job does not reflect what you are making.
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with. The job was fun and the pay was good for the time
good,"Working there was nice, but management could of been a little more in tuned with the employees. Hardest part was dealing with rude customers, but when you get past that I met some ready nice customers as well."
good,"Enjoyed working as a cashier here. This was my first job. Management was always there when you needed them but I never saw my supervisor she was always in her office hiding,"
good,Kroger ensures job security and they promote employees more often then other companies.
good,"The job I held at Kroger was your typical minimum wage job. My co-workers at the front lanes did not like it there, complained all day long, and it made it that much harder to stay positive working there. The culture at the front lanes is very negative and makes your life kind of grey and bleak. The advancement opportunities are there, but upper management does not approve as long as you are beneficial to that current department you work in or to the store as a whole."
good,Been working for Kroger almost 3 years for the most part it's not to bad currently working 3rd shift so makes things easier i advanced pretty quickly so worked about every department some are better than others
good,"Kroger is a good company to shop at. However making 8 dollars an hr with the stress the job brought.... well it wasn't enough. I had to many bills to pay, and since the stress was to high I had theropy  bills to pay too. I tried changing departments, and the wouldn't let me out of deli/Bakery. I just did not enjoy working there."
good,In need of hiring but has potential to be a really great place to work! Benefits are very good! Flexible schedules as well! You are part of a union so that is always a positive aspect in the work force.
good,Every grocery store runs differently and pay. I love people I work with. Job is challenging.  It's a small store with plenty products to offer . It's a guarantee job
good,The company is mainly about numbers and if you don’t meet the numbers daily you are put on weekly evaluations. Overall the company is a good company to work for. They offer good benefits and has a very clean work environment.
good,I liked working at Kroger at the beginning but as I started to work in the winter it was very cold and you had to go outside for a long time and in the summers it was very hot and had to go out for 30-45 minutes which is tiring.
good,Great place to work. Doesnt pay as well as heb or walmart. Its a union company. With seniority rankings its hard to get full time. A good stepping stone to get more experience in retail.
good,"Kroger is great for benefits and only that. Pay is bad. Raises take too long for close to nothing. Work is annoying. You get paid weekly. Other than that benefits are literally what makes this job ""good""."
good,Kroger is a good job if you plan one rising though the ranks as in long term stay. Over time it becomes a good job but I havent heard of anyone happy about there time at Kroger if they stayed a year or so
good,Kroger can be challenging when you cant get the help you need. But overall its good for high school and college students to get through school.They are good with working around your schedule.
good,"Daily tasks are not difficult, and your direct supervisor depending on your department can be more then reliable. If you're willing to put in the work it's a good job. The hardest part of the job is the few bad apples that get through, but that could be said about any business."
good,"Been with the company for over 15 years. A job with good hands on work experience and work knowledge. Stock shelves and bag groceries. Bagger helps customers with loading their vehicles, being kind and giving them a smile and welcome them. Stocking is keeping the shelves stocked and keeping them full."
good,Kroger is an awsome place that will work hard to accomidate for a family or anything else important in your life! I have a child and anytime I ever needed off early or a day off they made it possible!
good,Basically I love working with a team things you can do and get things done goals that must be met competition I love socializing and having regular customers I am a very outgoing bubbly person with a hard work ethic and great personality.
good,"the workday was pretty much an active one from helping people solve their issues to ensuring they are satisfied when they leave the store. I have learned that within a work environment everyone is treated fairly and that we work together to ensure the satisfaction of the customers. "
good,I loved the place but I did not like how they were sending me outside for hours a day in the cold by myself while others were going as groups. Other then that it is a great job.
good,"Everyone there was very nice, but it was very stressful. The stream of customers was constant and besides work mandated breaks, there was hardly any time to pause."
good,"Its an okay place to work, the management works with you on your schedule.  working as a cashier they make sure you are always busy and they want to make sure you are always working."
good,"Typical days consist of cashiering, answering phone within your department, stocking shelves, assisting customers needs, learning about specific products, building displays, and working with a team to meet goals, or deadlines based on advertisements to reflect pricing for sales."
good,"Have had my up and downs but its is a solid job for a tempoorary basis but even as you get promoted it takes a years to reach a decent pay due to the way the union pay scale works, including me who has been promoted to one of the higher catergories of the company. the union can be good but can also protect those who do half your work."
good,Kroger is a fun an friendly environment we’re u can meet all kinds of people.Sometimes you have rude customers but it’s ok bare with them I’m pretty sure they’ll be alright in no time with the employees of the Kroger family.
good,Need change policy on part time employees they would work you 30 to 38 hr but you only get part  benfits. Open up advance to move to other departments to pick up hours.
good,Good place to work organized managers great people to work with they help you out if you have question about the area. Help out each other if we dont finish with our areas. Be on time and ready to work.
good,"Always busy and have a lot of things to stock. It is rarely to have a day without delivered truck which mean it will be a slow day. Most people, workers and managers are friendly."
good,When I worked at Krogers it was my first job and I was only 15. They paid 7.25 an hour. It wasn't that bad. You get good discounts. The only part that I didn't like was getting buggies from outside.
good,Hours where all night for me. I did not like my shift. I had to work truck and the frozen was heavy. I enjoyed baking. I came in a packaged the bread that was baked in the morning. I baked pies and cookies and decorated cup cakes.
good,I was only there a short time but felt like family from day one. The management was always great listen and help right away with an issues right away.
good,"fun workplace, but very stressful. management asks way to much of people for very low pay. i was doing multiple jobs a day and barely making minimum wage."
good,Work hard  make everyone happy and do as your told clean up after your self makeing sure customers are happy and have it there way. Be nice and respect other and customers
good,The employees are great and you really feel welcomed but Management is to impersonal and it really discourages alot of the workers on a regular basis.
good,Great company to learn in a fast pace environment! You will cross train in every department Almost! Makes a great part time gig with a ton lof benefits
good,"My day consists of being on register, being in produce, deli, or meat. I am one of the busiest employees in the store and I wouldn't have it any other way. Its hard to deal with customers sometimes, but when your patience level is as high as mine you learn to give the customer what they want. I love this job, but I can see myself taking my skills elsewhere to benefit other companies and build a career."
good,my hours were to be 11pm-4am many days worked well into am sometimes 6am or longer then when payday came  always problem with pay
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was always being challenged. It was a small store but people were always needing assistance in locating items and with the store constantly changing, you had to keep up with the new shelf locations."
good,Very enjoyable surroundings and nice people at the location in Tn. Have great opportunity for advancement and to be trained in other areas within the store.
good,"It was a job of bagging groceries, and taking them out to peoples car. When there weren't many customers there would always be something to do like re stock, janitorial things, etc. There were nothing but nice people customers and co-workers alike."
good,"I have been working at Kroger part-time for going on two years. Good environment, great opportunities, and good benefits. The management could be a little better with communication. Also, the pay is not good. We get a 5 cent raise every six months, which is the only raise your able to get unless you become a manager. Other then that, Kroger is a wonderful company to work for."
good,"Management was very unprofessional. 400 Pio Nono Ave."
good,It was a fun and easy place to work but the pay was bad. I got paid every week but my would only be like 100 more or less depending on hours.
good,Responsible for maintaining price integrity for all managers. Associate discount Kroger brands only. Great health insurance and retirement benefits. Hardest thing is being committed during the holidays.
good,"Physically demanding job with lots of earning potential. you receive productions bonuses on the hour for going above and beyond. you work ten hour days and when your shift is over it's over, unless the workload requires over time. You can earn good living working for the company."
good,"The job was fine .Just not enough hours to met my needs . I would go back ,But I would have to have more hours.I liked learning the new cuts I was being tought . Wanted to learn more about seafood"
good,"Kroger is a grocery store in which i was responsible for bagging the groceries, gathering carts from the parking lot, housekeeping, and often stocking the shelves."
good,Good work time and people. Enjoy working with everybody management works well with your schedule
good,go into work with a smile and leave the same way. what i learned! How to  treat or act upon different customers. how new things to me work. management let me know how to deal with struggles and how to make the right. co-workers we get along great help each other out. The hardest part of the day is when it comes to a rush. The most enjoyable part of the day is when I get done stocking and cleaning all the necessity's.
good,Job security with a union is great but the pay wasn't. People who were grandfathered in with old contracts had it better than anyone my age and for what I was doing for them I could have easily been compensated for more on the hour. Good if you stick with it but not what is helping me live.
good,it was a good learning experience they open all sorts of new ideas in the store to make my time here mor enjoyable.
good,A typical day at Kroger is fast pace and at times very busy. I learned how to muli-task and use my time wisely. The co-workers their are very friendly everyone worked together as a team.
good,Kroger would be everything a person wants in a job if only the job paid like an Wholefoods.Other than that everything about working for Kroger is Great.
good,"I am still employed as i enjoy working here. I also am still looking for other employment as I need more hours,higher pay, stability and benefits. There is room for advancement but is long coming."
good,"This was my first job, and it's pretty much what you expect. Most of the people who work there do not want to be there, which can lead to lots of stress for the people who do. They pay fairly, but do not mention that you are pretty much required to join the Union, which takes a noticeable amount of money out of each paycheck."
good,I loved working at kroger. LOVED IT. front end management and store manager was kin and they would bully you out of the store if you wasnt the front ends favorite.
good,its a good start off job. very flexible hours. will work with your schedule. will promote you and train you if you want to learn other things. benefits are good
good,Kroger’s was the place of business where I really learned how to work an effective and efficient way. Kroger’s really taught me the value of knowing a stores merchandise like the back of my hand.
good,Kroger was hard work but I liked it. In the bakery you got a chance to express a lot of individuality by decorating. I also got to do work independently as an overnight baker. It was fun.
good,"a typical day at work is cleaning the floor and doing the trash. I learned a lot from being a courtesy clerk, like knowing how to properly clean the bathrooms and cleaning up some areas like the break room. Our manager is nice."
good,"Kroger is the type of job you get when you first enter the workforce. As a bagger, they put you at the bottom of the line thus you have to do everything pertaining to the low end of the store: spills, bathrooms, cart retrieving, etc."
good,"Worked for 14 years working as a produce clerk.  The management was pleasant, knowledgeable and fair. I worked in a team environment, making it a place to work everyday."
good,"I loved working at Krogers. It was my very first job and I learn a lot as far as; customer service, how to deal with a customer, being a clerk and how to handle transactions."
good,"I was to Prep food bars at the buffet, keeping them looking fresh and clean all day. it was fast paced to keep the bars up to par, had to have time management to make sure tasks were accomplished in due time, and everyone was very clean and organized in their area or work."
good,I had to learn that I wasn't there to make friends. I just wanted to enjoy my first job with them. I just wish worked a different way than try to get friends.
good,Worked the whole shift in an upbeat manner. Some days we were not given a break even if we were there for 8+ hours. I learned that companies aren't always as great as they seem to be.
good,"They didn't pay very well, the managers were pretty good, I had no issues with attendance. The lunch break was 30 min, so i had no problem with that, but yeah thats my review"
good,I like my fellow employees.  The management is ok.  The customers are interesting.  I got a promotion after six months of employment.  I like my new position.
good,The most enjoyable part was getting to know the customers and staff. I got to learn great story from how people was as child to now. I love playing with the children when they was upset.
good,"1: A positive culture of creativity"
good,"I enjoyed going thru the OMT program, and I became a salaried manager right after."
good,"conversing with customers 100% of the time, bagging groceries, management's usually pretty friendly and not strict, hardest part of the job had to be during holidays and meeting a customers outrages request. co-workers are down to earth people and easy to talk to, they dont mind helping you out with something you dont know"
good,I like the hours that I had. Working in the back with the electronics and handling the buyers and managers at the stores.
good,"A typical day usually starts out and finishes busy, it is a very productive job and the Store manager and co-managers are always willing to help out.  The most challenging part of the job is getting all tasks from the department heads completed. All in all, great place to be."
good,"Communicate with multiple people and wok with math."
good,"I enjoy working at Kroger . I meet lots of interesting people from all walks of life, most are friendly. It feels like we have known  each other for years {some costumers and I }."
good,They can get really busy and it could get frustrating but you have to just work it out and keep on pushing your self to finish and become better and patient
good,"It’s been great working for krogers, I like working with people. Krogers was flexible when my children was younger. They have given me the tools to achieve many goals with in my job. I’m hoping to continue my career in Florida ."
good,I loved working at this gas station. My teammates and I got along great! My manager was a very nice and helpful man. I just couldn't get the hours I needed.
good,"i loved it, best job i every had, and my supervisors was awesome if i could go back i would. i really enjoyed this place and it was very convenient foe me since i did go to school there."
good,is a hard working day but I make it fun by having a good smile and doing my job and helping people. The best thing I love working for my job is meting new people ever day.
good,"Advancement in the company is fast. management is fair. Fast paced environment. Customer service is #1. Must work well as a team. Some heavy lifting daily. "
good,"You get on your shift and besides serving customers you are temping refrigeration periodically, prepping items like kabobs and stuffed chicken, stocking shelves, logging fresh and frozen raw products, and cooking samples or making good to go bags to sample. If you are unlucky you will do these things by yourself. It definitely happens and there is a lot of pressure. You will always close or open alone. The most time consuming events of the day."
good,"good place to work, good place to work if your trying to advance at this job. Great atmosphere , great people to work with. A great greet and meet place, good enifits if you are there long enough."
good,I just started there back in November as a cashier. It stays pretty busy most days so you are always working. The hours though aren't that great. Been only getting 12 hours a week.
good,"The people who work with Roundys Supermarkets (specifically Metro Market of Cottage Grove Road) are genuine, helpful, friendly, and they care about their work.  We provide excellent customer service and hold frequent social gatherings to provide a real bonding experience.  I love this store."
good,A day at Kroger is fast pace and pleasant. I learn something new most days. And meet new co-workers too. The hardest part of the job is standing for 5-8 hours. The enjoyable part is interacting with the customers.
good,"I am a very hard worker with a lot of knowledge and different skills under my belt. I can adjust in any environment. I am a hard worker, dedicated loyal to the company as long as they are good to me. I go above and beyond to get the job done."
good,This job has really molded me into a great worker. I am able to do work not only fast but productively. Management at this company has shown me how to manage and work in teams to achieve a common goal.
good,"Kroger is a really good place for a teenager, or college student to work to earn some income. The pay is was not enough for me. Even if you have previous experience in retail, the will still start you off at $7.25 an hour."
good,"Tending to customers in seafood, steaming shrimp, live lobster, snow crabs, stocking rotating meats and lunch meat, cutting raw meats and packing them, cleaning meat saws and machines and sanitizing it, taking down seafood department putting all the seafood in a bag and putting it back in the cooler, cleaning and sanitizing the whole seafood room.  I learned how to cut raw meat steaks chickens, how to ground hamburger meat, I learned how operate in the seafood department."
good,"Culled all the produce on the wet rack, fruit in boxes. Set up displays to sell items by cross merchandising. Placed orders, Unloaded and loaded items off truck, kept track of inventory, placed orders for nutrition and floral."
good,Kroger is a good place to work for.  They offer good health benefits along with raises.  They are union so u get raises more often.  They will work around school schedules too.
good,very busy taking customers orders slicing meat and cheese. sometimes their undecisive of what they want. i let them sample the item to see if they want it or if we have anything on sale i let them sample it to get them to buy it. the hardest part if the job was trying to clean the slicers during the middle of me having customers. the most enjoyable part is slicing the meat and cheese.
good,Good to start out with. But they need to increase the cost of living pay other than that I had no problem. Management was good job was not hard to do long as you have the right team if pay was good I will go back
good,A typical day at work would start off by getting carts from outside (if needed) then coming back in and start bagging groceries for customers. I learned to form relationships with customers and fellow employees.
good,"Typical day was very stressful but remained calm, i learned to speed my skills up. management  was awesome! hardest part of the job was collecting carts when it was busy. enjoyable part of the day was bagging groceries."
good,Its very easy work nothing is hard to do anyone could work there honestly the starting off pay is very low and pay raises are only 5cents but they have good benefits
good,"Working for the Kroger company honestly wasn't that amazing of a time. I didn't like the way some of the older employees treated the newer or younger employees. We got put in departments based off who signed up for it and had the most seniority, I personally think that if you are a hard worker, regardless of seniority, you should still get the opportunity to get a job."
good,Working at Kroger I learned how to work with customers that raise their voices and get angry for no reason
good,Ready to start my new job and start back getting paid every week I don’t miss it . It was great meeting new cool people but management was very nasty and bitter it was sad .
good,I was only there for four months. This was my first retail position. I liked working in the Clicklist dept. I liked being helpful. I liked most ot the customers.
good,"it was a great place to work because there was different people to be around and even different foods."
good,"Day starts with checking into the front desk for location to work, i.e. front end registers, full or express lanes, over in cafe area or at Todd's Barbecue.  My coworkers are fun to work with and work very hard.  Hardest part of this job sometimes is the attitude of the customers, with the employee having to deal with very difficult customers.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when a customer is very appreciative of your hard work and you have been able to find a product for them, or checked them out in a very quick but accurate manner."
good,"Great place to work, people are great customers are very nice. A typical day you didnt know where you would be working. Management was horrible.  Hardest part of the job no one stood by your work or words you had to deal with allot and with a smile on your face."
good,"it was a great job while I was in high school, but the pay compared to the hours you work is outrageous. I was promised a raise after 3 months and did not receive it within my 6 months of working there."
good,i would show up for my shift and do what i told to do. a lack a management was why i left. worked so much it took away from my schooling. the job was not hard but was mad hard because of the lack of management. the best part of the job was the discount i got
good,Worst company to work for.never enough help managers don't listen or care they don't play enough or give enough hours..store doesn't always have products in stock.
good,overall its a good place to work open 24 hours a day but they don't give long hours or even enough hours.
good,They where very unorganized And very judge mental and they talked about people everyday. I liked the co workers I worked with they were very helpful and cooperative
good,A typical day at work consist of helping employees and customers. The work culture consist of team players. Working in a customer service industry included everyone.
good,No work /life balance. Depending on who you know is how you advance. Sadly you are hounded constantly to make sure the store at all times is in mint condition but the manager would sit in their office and not help
good,"It was a good job if you were willing to work hard and strive to be good however, it had problems with advancement and a political game in order to advance. Repeatedly showing hard work and effort was rewarded by having work shoved and pushed onto you."
good,"Pushing carts and bagging groceries were the vast majority of the job. Had very little training on carts, making it subtstaniousally harder. Reason for leaving was poor management."
good,I look forward to going to work. i love talking to customers and working hard. Management did not appreciate or care about the workers. I loved working their all the employees are friendly i just wish management was more understanding.
good,"Management and supervisors are unapproachable and it is difficult to determine who is in charge and in what capacity.  Most requested days off are given but the schedule, in general, is a mess.  There is an online schedule, an office schedule, and a schedule for the different departments and each one may have different scheduled hours for an employee.  Overall, it is a good place to start out but do not expect full-time or advancement."
good,"Supervisors at Kroger are an underpaid group. While the insurance benefits are okay, it is hard to get the required amount of hours scheduled in order to maintain your eligibility. Scheduling is done based on favoritism, not seniority or even skill. Kroger does not provide their employees with wages suited to their title or station even after years of working there. The pay is better suited to one with little or no responsibilities. "
good,I liked working here until new management came to the store. I'm in school and wasn't willing to work with me with my hours with school. I had to choose the importance of work and school. However when I had functions with my children they were willing to accommodate. The benefits are good if you qualify for them. There is a certain hours you have to meet a week in order to have insurance if you do not meet those hours the insurance is not available. I enjoyed the people I worked with but not the management. For the year I worked there 4 people have left when there was a new store manager.
good,"I enjoyed working here but need to move on. "
good,Not much to say really Kroger management isn't the best. Management is unprofessional and the store manager is as well. Coworkers and supervisors are in cliques and unprofessional and rude.
good,It is a great company to work for but the ethics here in Las vegas were quite different from California. I love my job and what the company stood for.
good,"It was very strict, management had no idea what they were doing and could cut your hours at any moment. They held you schedule hostage if you messed up."
good,This was my first official position and was a great starter job. Unfortunately I did not get enough hours and the pay was not that good.
good,Not difficult at all to maneuver through page answering questions are simple level of difficulty Is the minimum very easy to complete only takes three minutes
good,A typical day could be hectic with a lot of shoppers around holidays/snow days.  I learned that you have to have a lot of patience with customers--the customer is always right.  There weren't any hard parts to the job...just punch in right code to the produce items...different prices for items that look alike.  I enjoyed working as a grocery cashier.
good,Its alright for who's trying to just get there feet off the ground and just starting out. I  just feel like I'm working with a bunch of kids who are just getting out far.
good,"I was a pharmacy tech for almost 2 years at Kroger.  It is very fast paced and high pressure.  You are on your feet rushing around all day. After the 9-10hr shifts, my feet were always throbbing. The customers are mean to you, and management treats you like you are totally expendable. You can never work fast enough.  It doesn't matter, because no matter how much you get done, there will always be more work.  You don't make a difference to anyone, you just do the same thing day in and day out.  The training is a joke. Almost no one had adequate skills to do their job effectively.  We were constantly understaffed, because any new hire would end up quitting, because there wasn't anyone available to train them properly, and they'd get overwhelmed.  This job should pay a lot more.  "
good,"Pay is what you expect for every position"
good,"I loved the people I worked with but the company’s rules itself, and the customers made my job really hard and stressful. I’m thankful for the opportunity that I had to work here and would recommend to other people."
good,I enjoyed working at Kroger because of the fast pace and great customers but not enough hours so many employees had to work two jobs instead of one and can not afford health insurance and we all know we all must have health insurance
good,Busy.   Productive. Coming to work Learning to be a cashier was fun.There is nothing more I can tell. It was always very busy.  Time to go home.Stand.
good,They have good customer service program to help someone that hasn't had a lot of experience. The training program is a very helpful with customer service.
good,I enjoyed putting king soopers/krpger shoppers number one and making them happy and keeping my bagging area clean and bagging items perfectly. People had their favorites which I did not like.
good,Kroger is and always will be where I shop for my groceries but it was not the best place to work. I always felt bored and like the days dragged on and on.
good,"management does not chip in to help associates.  When asked for help, we get ""i will see what I can do"" and nobody returns.  Expecting answers and accountability but none for management."
good,"My co-workers were amazing. However, the management didn't know what they were doing and there was horrible communication between associates and management. I feel like there should be more order there but I couldn't complain too much about this store."
good,"busy start to the morning, i learned how to multitask and work fast. bakery manager is awesome, i stay out of the drama, the hardest part of my job is a employee there is constantly throwing me under the bus, the most enjoyable part is iam working in my own area at my own pace."
good,to be a manager at fred meyers all you have to do is say yes to the customer thats all they care about.  no manager skills required.  Bad management = bad attitude.  Its hard to be friendly and fresh in an environment that isnt.
good,counted cash drawer
good,"Working in the pharmacy was ok. They was doing major cut backs while I was there. They lost a lot of great workers. Long hours, little help/relief...."
good,"The management at the Kroger that i worked for, was very self- centered. you had NO chance of moving up in titles. "
good,They don’t pay enough for the work they want you to do and the overtime they expect out of you. The work isn’t hard but the long hours for the low pay doesn’t seem worth it
good,"We didnt always work 8 hours a night. Sometimes they would schedule is until 4am or 6am, but then have us stay because we were short staffed. Our hours were supposed to be from 12am to 8am, but we didnt always get them. Or they would have us stay until 9 or later, depending on how far behind we were."
good,"the job itself is easy and fun. The hours weren't flexible with my schooling, I was in high school working till midnight most nights. When I requested days off work for school events part of the time I didn't get them off and would have to find someone that could work for me. Which wouldn't have been an issue if they would have given me the days I requested in the first place."
good,"I don’t think one realizes how much goes into convenience life. Fast paced, low employee team work, little advancement, gossipy. They say once you join Tom Thumb if you’re not crazy you will be, it is true. They need to have higher pay as it’s a harder job mentally with customers than other places."
good,Company is union employees - you have to join have no choice. The union is unfit. the company is not bad but some locations are worse than others. Really comes down to management
good,"Its a great company to work for,  however when I got hired, i was told i would be a full time job but I'm only getting 16 hours a week and I can't afford to live on that."
good,"Every day was basically the same. Understaffed and over worked. Never really guaranteed a break in that department because of understaffing. Not enough people to keep up with the workflow. Management never cared enough to learn the job in order to be able to lend a helping hand when needed. They never cared enough to push hiring more competent people for the department. "
good,Okay place to work overall. I unfortunately had a terrible department manager. I enjoyed helping customers and had good co-workers. Most of management was nice just not informed of what went on in other departments.
good,"I would open up the Starbucks, prepare all the pastries for the day and make sure everything was stocked. Make drinks and food items while providing a fun experience for the customers. Management changed often."
good,"Overall kroger is a good place to start looking for a job. It is a friendly environment with amicable employees,  however I would not reccomend it full-time."
good,Managers never have time for you when you need to talk. Supervisor's tend to be short and smart with you and never want to hear constructive criticism.
good,"I worked 3rd shift at Kroger's Kwik Shop for over a year. I did a great job cleaning the store and loved the customers. Our store manager was moving to a different store so we got a brand new replacement. He had never worked one day in the store, he just got out of college and began manager training. We had a family type team. We helped each other, we respected each other and we liked each other. This new manager came and we tried to respect him and treat him like one of our team members but he was so rude, especially to the women. Within 6 months of the new manager taking over the whole crew had either transferred to another store, quit or got fired! It was extremely stressful every single day and sadly it not only effected our team but also our customers."
good,"After working with the company for several months, I was able to pretty much work every in every department and any job in the store. I was promised to be promoted to a closing manager position but was denied when a new manager was brought in to run the store."
good,"I enjoyed working at Krogers. I met a lot of great people, both customers and fellow employees. There is not a lot of chances to advance in the company unless you want to relocate to a larger store."
good,"Most everything is of a routine, however, what wasn't great was management moved employees out of their department without warning. Training also was not managed well."
good,However the management lacks initiative to understand and get to know the employees. Wonderful people work for this great company but the management needs training.
good,"Decent part-time jobs, flexible hours but not enough hours, not much career advancement opportunities, good multiple discounts available, pretty friendly staffing"
good,Managers at store have too much power and treat clerks like dirt. Authority over all aspects of employees. General manager treats all like they are beneath him.
good,"*BASED ON A DISTRIBUTION WAREHOUSE NOT A STORE FRONT*"
good,"Management for cashiers are poor, needs room for improvement, hours will get cut as a cashier if you request time off, or if you have a small disagreement with the managers. The employees that you work with are great. Management is the only REAL issue. I haven't learned much from Kroger, and there is no room to move up in the company. Hours are great for someone that works full-time, but if you are a part time college student, this place isn't for you as a first start up job."
good,This job was a good first job for a high schooler. My only problem is they would tell me that I would get trained but then never train me. I would recommend for a year.
good,This is a perfect job if you are just starting out and looking to gain skills to make a nice resume. Great benefits and employee discounts. People are great to work with.
good,"My fellow associates were great, but my managers were another story. Especially the store manager.  I was thrown into my position and not taught the Kroger ways to do things and subsequently got into trouble for it. I was pregnant while working this position and rarely was able to take breaks OR lunches in a timely matter (or at all.)  I was not allowed to keep a bottle of water to stay hydrated with me (I would have customers buy me one sometimes too!)"
good,"Deli bakery is very demanding a lot goes into this job. Every thing from Cutting fresh meats and cheeses, measuring out salad, baking and packaging cookies, to thawing new product for next day bake. The management is picky, the turn over is high, it's union so there is a 90 day probationary period, and the coworkers can be harsh."
good,This job was a healthier life work balance which was great for my current family situation. I was able to be there more for my daughter which was important to me.
good,It a great place to work and meet different people. You have the options to move up in the business if that is the goal. Never a dull moment since the store is busy.
good,Over all it was a great place to work except for a few of my immediate managers. No just with me but a few of my fellow co workers if you got on their bad side they would frequently mistreat you with no repercussions.
good,Typical day was to come in and cook by a log book. Some days were busier than others but the store was an older one so the traffic was minimal. Loved everyone i worked with despite a few new people towards the end of my working there. Management was wishy washy...quick to blame its employees without finding out the roots of any issues.
good,besides the fact that so many employee's wants to be managers quickly before learning the store operations...it's ok.
good,Kroger was a nice job. I was a cashier. I specialized in serving the customers.The management was nice. They were easy to get along with I enjoyed working there.
good,My day at work was great I learned more as the day went by my co-workers are awesome I got along with everyone I really didn't have a hard part of the day and i enjoyed it a lot the people are nice.
good,"I was scheduled an interview a couple of days after the new year. Went in got hired on the spot. Came back to do drug test & paper work everything went smooth until January 6th 2015 I went to my orientation only to be stood up by whoever was supposed to handle it that day. Me & 3 other people. Hiring manager told us to come back the following Tuesday.. Came back only for me to start My KTVS for about 1min & the computers shut down.... They stopped working.. Sent me home again, told me to call for hiring manager in the am around 10.... I called & called & called no hiring manager nobody could help.. Finally two weeks later I get a call to come in on the 17th to finish online training.. Came back to finish the next day 18th of January was told by a manager that I could come BACK to finish on the 19th but I got a call on the 19th of January saying I was fired.. Because I was taking too long with my training!!!!! Lol, only on day TWO of my training.. I don't understand.. Only good thing that came out of that was sitting in the back room on the computers listening to managers... YES MANAGERS talk junk about customers & employees.. Still currently trying to reach a supervisor"
good,"The Kroger Co. is not a very ""friendly"" place to work. I am a team person and I like to work together, not against each other. The management was not taking needed action as far as employees who were stealing, not doing their jobs, ect. I reported a co worker who told me he gave away cigarettes to customers under 18. They never once took action which upset me, that's against the law. Would not recommend to work for this company, unfortunately."
good,If youre looking for quick advancement this is not the place for you. Ive worked here for almost 2 years and Ive been trained fore management but instead of making me manaagement they took the fuel lead in. This store is crooked
good,Great job opportunity for young adults-does not pay enough. Difficult to promote due to labor unions
good,"A typical day as a courtesy clerk involved some hard knocks, a very unusual schedule (one week, you could expect to work a morning shift, then the next week, you'd be working graveyard shifts). "
good,this job helped me gain the experience i needed in customer service and cashiering. i enjoyed working w/ the different customers and some of them knowing me by first name. i took pride in knowing my job and some customers only wanting to deal w/ me when it came to certain tasks. i didn't like the constant changes in management. there was always the shift of power.
good,i learned that kroger has really ridiculous rules and regulations. but in the end the friend i earned by working there was great
good,"kroger fuel was a great position for me at the time, but with as much experience i have i am now trying to obtain better positions."
good,"this job is at its best, one to have as a part time or one to have in between finding a new job. there aren't very many chances to advance, there are not very many jobs to have. they do not promote from within.it is at best a side job."
good,It’s it a challenging place to work. It is a lot of work. Dealing with rude people and the co workers tempers but it’s not all bad it is busy work that keeps you moving
good,"Krogers was a good place to work but the certain store that i worked at had some serious policy issues. The management over my department had alcholoism they would report to work intoxicated and was very rude and obnoxious. I did what is required and i reported it to the general manager but to only have repercussion, i asked to be transferred to a different department and it was denied and they had cut my hours. So i left the company."
good,"Loved working here, just realized retail is not my best suit. Learned how lots about customer service , ways to work out conflict with customers or get help if needed."
good,"Decent place to work , poor management, lack of caring from managers also a lack of managers very short staffed constantly in all departments but especially in deli"
good,It’s an okay job but I wouldn’t recommend anyone to work here because of the bad management skills. Others don’t like to do their job so managers pin others task on courtesy clerks.
good,It was a good job you just didn’t make the money you deserve for as much work as you did needs a lot of help in the department I worked in and needed more money for me to stay there
good,Overall decent company.  Too much management and employee turnover.  It disrupts the cohesiveness within the store. Overall company culture could be better. Pay is lower than national average.
good,"As far as money goes, it's about what you can expect from an entry level retail job. The communication from managment to departments is very lacking, and all management members have thier own way of doing things and each like something else so what you do can never be perfect enough to please everyone.the customers are what push me away from this job as well, anything short of the impossible is not good enough for them. They treat you less than human most of the time and no matter how nice you are, you can never expect a shred of gratitude or respect from any of them."
good,Kroger is a good company for a first job. The management is 50/50. You will have managers and employees that will work with you or that will not. The stores are being renovated and cleaned.
good,"I liked working at Kroger, ONLY because it was a nice environment to work in, and I made friendships with all the customers. They were amazing. But the management is absolutely terrible. They had no understanding when you were sick a day, or even if you were pregnant and found it hard to come in that day. They worked me very hard over there, and the best check I ever got was $172."
good,"I was thrown into the job with minimum training from the beginning. Its a very simple job once you know what you're doing, but when thrown into it with no help , it gets frustrating and overwhelming. Management did very little to ensure that i got trained properly and when i didnt know how to do certain things, i would receive the repercussions."
good,A typical day would usually produce some form of issue or complaint by managment for different departments. Which is normal for a business. The co-workers were a team that would help eachother any time they could unless management made them stop. The job isn't very physical and you have powerlifts. It would be a good first job for someone in school with no bills.
good,"It was a good job with lots of friendly people, sure there were bad characters, but what job doesn't have those? There were lots of fun times too, and I wish it hadn't closed up and left the state."
good,"3 main jobs"
good,"I learned that if you do your job, work hard, and treat people right, you will not only have respect for yourself but also from coworkers, customers, and management."
good,"A typical day as a cashier, after clocking in, you'd go get your money from your CSM, log on, and help cash people out. I learned wonderful people skills while working. management was rather scattered; you never really knew whom to report to."
good,Working at Kroger was not a bad job. It was my job while I was in High School. I enjoyed working there because I was able to work with people and everyday and able to make their day easier.
good,Working for Kroger was okay. The managements were pretty bad and power hungry But the employee were amazing showing me how to do things around the store
good,"Management handled situations very poorly, made no worker feel comfortable or helped. Indecent situations of them acting rude to multiple employees, made us clean up unsanitary things constantly just so they wouldn't have to."
good,"answering phones, processing credits, billing donations,meetings, scheduling appointments. finding product that stores are missing and processing pick ups for mis delivers."
good,I really enjoyed the work. But it could be very stressful. And they are not good at listening to what you have to say. I wanted to just work part time. But they kept scheduling me hours that I couldn’t work.
good,A lot of turn around. A lot of uncovered shifts. A lot of unhappy grouchy people. Manager that's does the schedule doesn't take the time to make sure all areas r covered.
good,Didint have enough people wanted us to work so many hours I just needed something different try out work in different environment I was good working there but needed something fresh
good,This company is perfect for someone who doesnt want to work a lot of hours or a kid in school. There isnt alot of room for advancment unless youve been there for awhile. They also dont want you to work over 20-25 hours a week. Other than that this place is great.
good,"Not gonna finesse, they were ok, except for the pay, and they want you to work a lot of hours with the final outcome of the pay to be subpar. They give you good discounts though."
good,"Good company to work for,  as long as that's all you want out of a company.  Management is management and staff is staff. No compassion,  they don't care if you have family or bills to pay.  They have no problem giving their employees less hours to work to the point of unable to live.  Biggest downfall."
good,"I worked there for a short period of time , became the favorite clerk . I always cleaned bathrooms and collected trash in the store i never really bagged . Its an okay place to work."
good,Kroger is an okay place to work just to increase your skills or gain new skills. The pay is horrible and they do not offer enough hours each week. I would choose Kroger as my last option.
good,"manager is very nasty, quick to come down your throat, never gives second chances, discrimianation against blacks, reduce hours often, and not enough pay."
good,I did not enjoy the work environment. Upper management ruled by threatening the supervisors of the associates under performed. That attitude led the supervisors to turn on one another for job security.
good,The pace is fast which I like. The chances for advancement are very low. It is a union shop and is hard for someone who may be qualified but don't have the seniority to advance.
good,"I enjoyed most of my time with Kroger. My biggest compliant was with the supervisors and their supervisors. Serious complaints were not taken seriously. Responses to have a meeting to fix the problems were not addressed by any of the supervisors. And the main supervisor would cut back hours or send an employee home if the numbers were not met each week yet other employees who wanted to play games while at work would not get sent home or have hours cut. It was a very difficult situation to work in. And to have an employee who would drink alcoholic drinks between store locations and for it to be known to all employees and supervisors is a joke. Kroger only ""wrote"" this person up and told him to cut it out and stop doing it."
good,Fun work place with a strong belief in great customer service. The most enjoyable part of my job is making sure a customer leaves happy.
good,Overall a nice place to work. Nice employees but the management sucks. They are very annoying about flexible scheduling which is bad when I'm trying to go to college at the same time. The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction I get when I get a job done that no one thought would get done.
good,"no time for family if you do maintenance"
good,"Didn't like the workers, but loved the job and most of the customers"
good,"Basically all I did was stock produce, and interacted with customers and making sure they had a great shopping experience. I had great co-workers we worked well together in making sure things were done in an orderly fashion. The hardest part of the job was having to many bosses to have to listen too, and it caused a lot confusion and bad communication. The most enjoyable part was learning about all the different produce that I never had a clue about. "
good,pick n save was a great job. its the kind of job you would love to have for a second job for extra cash. typical day at work was helping out in the deli area the best way i can. helping the customers with their choice of food and fast. my co-workers where helpful i must say. the hardest part was the rushes pick n save had around lunch time but we made it through.
good,"At the time they had a big strike,and work was available,I had a very serious family financial burden,so I took the job."
good,"I help assist the pharmacist on a daily basis with filling prescripitons and double checking for errors. Putting drug inventory on shelves and engaging with customers about their insurances, meds, or over-the-counter products."
good,"It's a great place to start for a first job, all of the associates are great people that you'll love to work with. Managment needs work though. They're okay but they need improvement on how they handle things and keep things going. Scheduling can be bad they'll either not give you enough hours or they'll overwork because they didn't schedule enough people that day so then you have to make up for about 2 times the work."
good,"I enjoyed working around the customers and helping them with their purchases. I enjoyed some of the teammates that I worked with. However, I didn't agree with some of their management choices of sending their cashiers or baggers that were not able to deal with the heat to gather carts. I believe they should hire just cart pushers for this very case for those that can handle the heat or cold due to the fact there are several people within this job that I worked with that couldn't do the heat and we were always jumped on by a supervisor because, of the fact we were outside in the heat too long when we already told them we couldn't do the heat...that isn't being fair. Another thing, when you get a paycheck your only allowed to cash them out at the local store you got the check at."
good,"This particular company needs to have ""All"" members of management take a sensitivity course. They disrespect their employees by yelling at them. There is also a few that seem to have racist undertones.. The employees who work there are really nice. But management, throw that out of the window.."
good,"A typical day at Kroger sees me stocking shelves and assisting customers as they try to find items in the store. Many people at the workplace seem very unhappy to be there, but most people are nice."
good,"a typical day at work is walking in getting settled getting right to work "
good,"Stocked shelfs and organized all items neatly. Make your section nice , neat, and clean stock very repetitive and alot of movement on feet and constant lifting lightweight - medium-weight boxes."
good,Management will not  speak when approaching  you.  Management needs to be more caring  toward their employees.  Always calling on employees in when off.
good,"My wife and I have shopped there since we moved into Little River, SC... That;s why I decided to work part time there.   Great employees to work with..."
good,"Dress warm, come to work ready, lots of incentives, 40 plus hours, great people, training could be better, management changes quickly, overall the culture there is good"
good,"Management was hard to deal with, either very hard to get a straight answer out of or you felt like you were being intimidated into submission. There was no recognition for personal achievements, and those that performed poorly weren’t directly reprimanded so the courtesy clerks were treated as a whole even if you didn’t know someone or never worked with them. You could make sure you did everything to the letter that they wanted you to do, and still be treated on the same level as someone who was barely doing their job, so nobody ever wanted to improve or tried anything they could to change departments."
good,N\a they let me go. Wish I could of change possible new spot in store and if they would of giving me a chance I could of been good and have a great job
good,you have to have good customer service. helped bag groceries collect karts and straighten merchandise on the shelves. checked people out on the registers and help on the self check-out.
good,"Not a wonderful place. Underpaid staff. Unable to have a life of your own, since you're constantly in the building. Need a weekend off? Forget it, you belong to Kroger and you can kiss the weekends to yourself goodbye. Don't forget you are also going to be written up if you need to call in because of a dental appointment, that was requested off in advance but rejected for the schedule."
good,"The job was cool but, the people were kind of too much. I use to love my job at in the beginning. I needed more money once I got older and got kids also bills plus school."
good,It wasn’t great for me I was underaged for the department I was placed in. The managers were incompetent. Most of the time they didn’t know what was going on in the store. Lots of lazy managers who wanted you to do your job and theirs. I did a lot of management mark downs because they said it was beneath them to do so.
good,Good company to work for overall. Great family atmosphere. I had a great time working with associates and learning good business practices to drive results.
good,Liked my job till they closed down and we were out of job. Think they should have given more on the severance pay because people have been there years and years
good,Working there started off great and then we hired a new manager after the original manager moved. That's when things really went downhill. There was favoritism and it was noticed by all employees. People who weren't doing their jobs were getting credit unlike tbe people who actually did the job. It was a very difficult place to work because of the management not because of anything else.
good,"Other than have face glued to screen all day and dealing with rude customers, i can say that their was some rewarding moments about helping the customers with there medications and able to get their medication on time made it worth it. but the new management their was awful to work with."
good,They wouldn't work with me while i was goimg through a miscarriage. I had dr.excusses and they just wouldn't work with me they would tell me that i needed  to show up for work (after my miscarriage) witch i couldn't by dr.excuess for a week.
good,"Kroger criminally underpays their employees, as a team lead assistant I never made more than 10.50 an hour and was one of the primary reasons for leaving, I loved the store and the job, the customers were relaxed, and the management was professional and helpful."
good,Depending on who your store manager is you get promotions by how good a friend you are not by how hard a worker you are. unless you can deal with micro managing or just the favorites game i don't recommend the company
good,Management should learn how to communicate better with each other. They need to be more open to people who want a full time job. Resolve people's problem in a better timely fashion manner. Customer service isn't always on point when needing to get a call transferred. There's alot of favoritism that happens. Management alsways seems to be confused on what the next managers decision was made on certain situations. It's hard to find management at times when you need an issue resolved.
good,Working at customer service is very fasted paced. I have learned a lot that I need to multitask and to be very patient. Management helps every now and then but never enough.
good,I wouldn’t necessarily recommend my close friends to work there because some of the people are extremely rude and dont treat others the way they should be treated.
good,"Typical day as a bagger is bagging grocieries , bringing in carts, helping customers, and running iteams back if they are cold/frozen or damaged. Hardest part is carts expecial if your short. The main manager at the one I was with was a beast and not in a good way. My supervisor was nice and I loved all my csm's."
good,You get a paycheck but you definitely work hard to earn it.  There are people employed at the company who have worked there since high school.  Many of those people do just the minimum to earn their check.
good,"I had supervisors that went power crazy. They didn't follow safety producers when it came to the baggers. They would put me right below  full time hours to insure i did not get the full time benefits. All of front store was like a family besides supervisors. Managers tried to help, but in all the wrong ways."
good,Workers were great people to talk to but some of the managers always argued with employees in front of customers they need to have more respect of the customers in store they try to bribe you to do something because they know u wont do it if they ask a girl to do something if they say no they will just go to another person if I say no they will say I must do it
good,"Kroger has great benefits if you don't mind working for less than $8 an hour. They don't want to work around other jobs but refuse to give you more hours. Kroger used to be a great company, but over the last few years they've changed their contracts for their benefit at the expensive of their workers. They have plans to change the stores in the future that several associates do not agree with. Members of corporate make changes to the stores without ever stepping foot in them. A lot of their changes are not benefiting the workers, and a lot of the customers do not agree with them."
good,"The crew was really close knit, other than our head after our first one. The second was a buffoon."
good,"It's better than my previous jobs. They have an education program that lets you take leave to go to school in a different state. However, they tell you in the interview that you'll work 12-28 hours. WRONG. Try 30-40 hours. If you're in a hectic major in school as it is (such as music) that requires you to practice and work on it year round, look somewhere else. I'm leaving Kroger after this school year because of it."
good,Always great people to work with. Job leaves a lot to be desired. The constant change in management leave employees in a constant state of flux. Lack of attentiveness to employees that would do better in other jobs is needed
good,Working with my current co-workers is a challenge in itself. I like the fact that we work well together and ping off each other ideas as well as knowledge. Coming together as a team is awesome and keeps me on my toes and cause me to interact with my co-workers as well as management.
good,"My store was always poorly staffed, I was always training a new barista and working harder than I should as a part time employee. I believe that there are too many employees in which creates drama or other issues."
good,"As a cashier you are on your feet the whole shift, it's stressful at times, and sometimes the managers are too stressed out worrying about numbers to be helpful. That adds a level of stress that does NOT help the atmosphere."
good,"Work was fun, went fast sometimes, the hardest part of the job was the cigarette counts in fuel center and also the money drop for the night. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers and getting to meet different cultures. Lack of management at times, there would be no communication at times but over all each manager was always very nice and understandable. I learned a lot about money and safety in the fuel center"
good,It was a great job to begin my employment journey and I wish that I would have gave it more time.  I had pleasant co-workers and a manager that was always there to help me.  We worked as a team and individually.  I really wish that things could have worked out with this job and I could have had time to grow with the company.
good,"If your life goal is to be a manager for your local Kroger then sign right up. If you're looking for a temporary job to get paid weekly, then that's your deal. If you want a job you'll genuinely enjoy, keep scrolling."
good,"I enjoyed working here because I was able to cross- train in different departments within the store. I gained experience in different areas and enjoyed each position. However, it was difficult to move from part time to full time. I had no benefits, and management handled raises very poorly."
good,I needed it for money and the only real enjoyment came from the od times I was working at the self-checkout section because my speed wasn't exactly up to quota with the normal lanes and I got to see the nice people who worked in that area. I was as nice as I could possibly be with everyone except the front-end managers who didn't know how to manage a schedule if their lives depended on it.
good,"greet customers, break down truck , run new product/ mark down the old. fill holes clean as needed. Answer questions about food preparation and/or storage."
good,"no way to move up with company, part time cashier.  mostly liked working with public, but public can be hard on you.  management asked you to work past your scheduled time a lot, but would not schedule you more hours."
good,"Great job for high school students, or for those who are looking for part time work possibly with the benefit or shopping for groceries for the family with an extra discount"
good,"I was a cashier at Kroger right after I finished high school and the job really only required decent customer service skills (being nice to people), and the ability to do simple math (at the register). The staff was nice, the managers were decent, and the culture was good."
good,Personal problems tend to aggravate management. Make sure your ducks are in a row before you even apply. Management has a low tolerance and are not sympathetic to problems at home.
good,Store Management could be better. They are good with giving you the days of that up request 2 weeks in advance. If you need to switch hours with someone they usually allow it.
good,Pretty busy for the most part all day. hard never. Excellent customer service developers. Workplace culture is decent. Enjoyable part unloading grocery trucks ..........
good,Great place to work if the associates there would show up for their shifts. There are some great management there and lack luster ones that slipped through the process.
good,Good customer and they do work with you on hours you have find replacement if u need off if they have u schedule for shift.  U do get payed weeklypay check
good,"I stocked shelves, cleaned up, out out displays, worked in the bakery doing some of the baking, and helping out where I was needed. I got along well with management."
good,"One would arrive ready to start off quickly giving breaks and helping to catch up on work that needed to be done immediately. One would expect to learn how to handle large volumes of people, while multitasking. The upper management were often not present when needed and not helpful when problems arose. The job was failrly fun because one would be able to engage with customers and coworkers."
good,...Its a fast paced job and its fun to talk to the customers and help them. It will make you feel good to know you helped someone. I think you will love the job
good,I loved working there but felt as though the pay was severely lacking.  I felt underpaid and well over-worked most days.  Amazing people to work with and for
good,Kroger is a good company but it will require a lot to advance and even then you have to be one of the favorites. The day goes by quick with a lot to do and little time to do it.
good,"I really liked working here the only problem was that when I was sexually harassed, they said that the person responsible would be held accountable and he just got a slap on the wrist."
good,"I love being in the Wine/Spirits shop of Kroger.  I can provide a better customer service with the customers that walk in.  I love being able to provide that 1-on-1 customer experience that I feel everyone needs.  Management needs improvement with working with employees. I've a set amount of hours that I can work.  They seem to ignore those hours and schedule me what times they want me to work.  When needing to talk to someone about the schedule, I'm passed to multiple people because it seems that no one wants to work to resolve the schedule issue."
good,"nice place to shop, not so nice to work. short handed most times, expectations way to high, even for a younger person. few like the experience, many there have been there 30 plus years"
good,It would be better if the person in charge of the front end new how to do her job and that management could see this and do something about it and not just keep ignoring it day after day and letting it go on.
good,"typical day was stressful at times and relaxed pace at others depending on time of day and the season. I learned how to manage time more, when small talk was appropriate and not. The hardest part of the day was when I would need assistance with a customer and management was no where to be found. The most enjoyable part of my job was causal fridays."
good,"8 hour days"
good,There is pretty much no way to advance within the company. Also no way to really become full time. It's a good starter job but not a place to make a career out of!
good,I learned how to be a team player there I was always ask to set new goals and challenges for myself there was a lot of great planning I got to be apart of
good,Very slow and took double union fees out of my checks it has good  people management was ok didnt really get no benefits dont really have nothing more to say
good,"The people who work on the floor of my store are amazing, patient, and enjoyable to work with for the most part. The supervisors are understanding to a degree, and while it gets busy and crowded the horrible customers are few and far between."
good,fast paced customers constantly needing assistance.  The company  does care about their employees which is why they offer numerous part time benefits for them.
good,I opened tis store with them they were awesome. I loved working here I did overnights so I never had to deal with customer so essectically the job was awesome
good,Learned great customer service as well as point of sale techniques. The management expected very fast-paced work that helped me to be more productive.
good,"This position was often fast paced. Excellent opportunity to gain experience with customer service and working with diverse populations. "
good,Krogers was a great place for me to start after quitting my first job in high school. I started as a bagger and worked my way up to a customer service supervisor. I worked with great working people that were fun and hated their job as much as anyone. Besides fun people the management was horrible. They always had to be right even when proven wrong. I can't tell you how many times I've proven the co-managers and the General manager wrong then they punish me for doing so.
good,My diabetes became more acute and I developed Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy in my foot. I needed to get up and walk around every hour. Call times went up and I could not meet the requirements for the call center.
good,"Job security is very low, there are constantly new hires taking old positions, certain managers harass employees, and the managers in general are very rude and misuse authority."
good,"Management needs to learn how yo approach a situation and talk to prople. "
good,"I worked about 20 hours a week, i bagged groceries and returned the carts from the lot, Kroger was always understaffed and so it stretched the working employees of the day very thin."
good,because its a convenient store and you are often alone working you get breaks but I enjoyed the people there and enjoys my regular customers.
good,Didn't tell me how to pause a timer while waiting on customers and so they let me go before my 90th day. I don't have anything else to say
good,Great job hard work at times because Kroger is always busy especially  on Sundays but its fun seeing happy faces. Also gives flexible schedules if they are informed your in college.
good,"cleaning, baking cookies and other pastries, and the management will be gone by the time I get to work, and the hardest part about the job is when you need help you don't get it.  The good thing is that decorating cakes was the fun part."
good,"This job was okay for being a teenager needing cash to pay for car insurance, gas, and a phone bill. Working here for a career is not what it is meant to be for. Depending where you work there is a completely different atmosphere."
good,"team work is most important for a smooth operations."
good,"The company is making money hand over fist, but that wealth is not rolling down to the employees. Its not the worst job I ever had, but its not the best. The 401k is good though. Well thats all I have to say."
good,had a great experience but no health benefits and if you become sick you will still have to come in if you want hours or a job
good,"As a cashier, donations to charities are automatically removed from your paycheck even though you only make minimum wage. The turnover rate for cashiers is also ridiculous. Cashiers are required to reach and maintain a certain speed at checkout, but you are waiting on customers before your timer stops."
good,Every Day I would make sure the restrooms are nice and clean. I learned how to be a cashier. I would make sure that the customers find everything they needed.I would also clean the store and the parking lot.
good,"Excellent place to build customer rapport and custer service skills. Can bevery fast paced at times, but overall it s all worth the work."
good,"nice surroundings, however the pay isn't the greatest and regardless of how long you are there it is difficult to work your way up the ladder"
good,This company was a good company to work for very flexible to shifts and very concern with thier workers
good,"A typical day would be helping customers inbound and outbound, handling markdowns,  preparing a display case for customers and have supply order submitted in a timely manner."
good,You are always meeting new people at this job. Plus you always have something to do so you aren't sitting around doing nothing which is a plus.
good,"Working at Kroger was very much an enjoyable experience. Upper management and the ""higher ups"" of the company genuinely seemed to care about the well being and happiness of their employees, while still ensuring excellent customer service. The hardest part of the job was the irregular hours, but that was expected as a part time job from me, so it didn't – more... bother me too much. The most enjoyable part was definitely my coworkers and activities put together by the company."
good,its okay there i wish the pay was more . Its only part time work an cant get over 16 hours a week.
good,"Great company and benefits. Very long hours, and no sense of work-life balance"
good,"My typical work day consisted of stocking milk, eggs, cheese, and yogurt. Cleaning out the cooler and rotating stock. Co workers were very friendly and I learned a variety of things and have a new respect for the grocery industry."
good,"i loved my job at kroger, it was a good company to work for but the values and pay was not so good"
good,Having to make up for the work that others don't and cleaning up after everyone that just puts things wherever they please.
good,When working second shift (as I usually did) they almost never had available personal available before 7:00 or 8:00 pm for breaks. (Kiosk closed by 10:00 for day) No problems with management or coworkers.
good,"My typical day of work here was not that good. They really didn't train me that well so they expected me to learn everything in one day. Im a fast learner but all this stuff you had to do here was not something you can learn in one day. I did learn how to cook a roasted chicken and how to fry chicken. The managers was OK they really didn't learn me anything either. My co-workers were very nice to me and they helped me out when I didn't know what to do. The hardest part about this job was trying to clean up all the grease, mopping, spraying down the floor, pulling out the chicken insides, and serving all the customers. The enjoyable part about this job was meeting new people."
good,Good place to start off if you don't have any work experience. Learn the basics about a retail company. Disrespectful floor managers and employees.
good,"Work wasn't to bad, my manager at the time wasn't to much of a help, so it was difficult at times to know what our goal to accomplish for the day was. Even upper management at the store weren't available often to ask or answer questions."
good,"In the 4 years I was there, management hadn't been as bad as it was until my last year. It seemed once they transferred out 2 of the ASMs the culture in the store took a nosedive into negativity and favoritism. Up until then it was fine and the store functioned very well."
good,"Its a great place to work, it's just not for me. The environment is changing daily, it depends on who your management is. I love working there, but it's time for a change."
good,"Nice place to work paid weekly only downside is pharmacy is very busy and is combined of primarily part time employees, open availability will give you maximum hours"
good,Very competitive within the store and departments. Must be available to work any shift and a lot of back to back shifts. Your treated like a number not a person
good,"When I worked at Kroger, I discovered it was a pretty good beginners job. Being a bagger, cashier, or clicklist employee would be the best to go with if your just starting out. I didn't stay there long though, for a couple of personal reasons. The environment at Kroger is amazing as well, everyone treats you as a friend and is always willing to give a helping hand."
good,"Kroger is a fast paced work environment. I learned patience, as well as understanding of the customers. The hardest part of the job is pulling my trolley through the snow. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with my co-workers and seeing the customers smile."
good,It's a great place to work but this store management isn't the greatest so thing don't get did the proper way of doing things. I don't really have anything else to say about Kroger but needs done real people that's all about that mission it set forth not just saying it but doing it to ensure the business is ran smoothly and the customers and employees are being treat fairly.
good,"The store that I was at promoted within the store but unfairly, they would never listen to their employees and when an employee would ask to transfer departments, the higher ups would always give a roundabout answer about how they hadn't done their jobs yet. The higher ups wouldn't communicate with their employees. When I was in floral, I actually had some freedom to do what I wanted. I knew my job and knew what I had to do, so I could get away with goofing off."
good,"When customer orders there grocerys online i pull the orders bag them and stage them , when the customer is ready to pick up there order they call in and we take there order to there cars."
good,"The store was dramatically understaffed due to people quitting because of management issues. My department head was absolutely fantastic, and always went to bat for us when our fill rate was inevitably low due to unstocked shelves"
good,"Work in pharmacy,  it is not part of union. When I started, I like going  to work  everyday,  there have been so many changes, it's hard to get up in the morning  and go to work."
good,"I was part of the overnight stock team which was fantastic. Made a lot of really close friends that I still have to this day. Unfortunately during the time I worked there, there was a management team that was nothing short of bullying. Even though it was a union job the manager used our own union rep as a crony, often inviting him into meetings to report directly back to him about trials and tribulations our team was facing."
good,"They have us a raise and cut people's hours, unless they were full-time employees. The department's don't really work together as a whole. If they would allow more people to be full-time then they would be able keep more people."
good,"Kroger  is alright though you might get way more responsibility then asked for which could get crazy depending on you. People will quit anytime , so you might get a call to take their shifts."
good,"Pretty good place to work, friendly managers. Friendly environment, and flexible hours. Would get moderately busy, but the management kept things flowing nicely"
good,First off they need to pay their employees more because $9 and hour just doesn’t cut it anymore especially in this day and age. The work they require is not even close to the compensation.
good,Terrible management staff. No work life balance. They hire incompetent people they do not treat there employees well especially depending on which contract you are under.
good,I did not enjoy my time here they work you very hard for only $8. You only get a .25 cent raise every 6 months. It’s just time for me to move on to something bigger and better.
good,Great people. Fun job. Needs better pay and better hours. Hours are not always available. Management is fair and friendly. Communication between management and employees is not the best.
good,This was a great first job. The mangers did not make some employees actually do their own work and left the rest of us to do theirs and our own. I learned a lot from this company. They are a union and that was nice.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and learning about new people. Whether it's co-workers or customers, I get a lot of social interaction and learn about those in my work community."
good,"Kroger co is a very fast paced competitive environment. Co workers either tolerate, love you or ignore, dismiss you. Management at 438 is a fluctuation of terrible and worse. Management doesnt care what will make the store better as long as it makes them feel happy and in control. (Taking good people and pushing them at all angles to step down/up so the place can be filled by friends/family or even just someone they trained in the past. New Dairy manager lady cant tell up from down at 438. Someone needs to help them."
good,Kroger has very nice stores but lately the management has been really poor. They expect you to do 4 different jobs but get paid for one. Long time to get benefits and paid vacation time. No help in bakery Dept always short-staffed. I like the store but I do not see myself ever being a manager . or moving up
good,I enjoyed working at Ralphs Grocery but I thought that the pay was too low for the amount of work I was doing. I was doing accounting work and many other jobs during the day and I was expected to do much more. This was unfair I thought because they are unwilling to pay more.
good,"Great bunch of people to work with. Love helping customers. fast paced most of the time. They do little perks every once in awhile, for instance feed us barbecue in the breakroom. Give us free samples of food in the breakroom. If they have a cake or something that has not been picked up it gets donated to the employees"
good,"Now i know every store is different, but from my experience i wouldn't work at Kroger again. Rude management, always messing up paychecks. when id ask the specific person who calculates the hours and paychecks she got huffy, snobby and sometimes down right rude like it was our fault."
good,I usually stayed outside bringing shopping carts inside. I enjoyed my co-workers' company and the bonds we made. I learned how to communicate effectively with customers as well as management.
good,"Coworkers are great. Discounts on Kroger brands/special associate discounts, double fuel points definitely a plus."
good,This was my very first job. I think it’s a good place for a first start. Nice and easy environment and easy to learn. There are many different positions that can be offered here.
good,Working for the Payless in my town was good. It had poor salary and poor management but other than that it wasn’t too bad. Management was poor and they would never communicate with other departments to let them know if there was any changes coming. They’d just drop the bomb on us and we’d have to adjust to the knew changes.
good,"Kroger is a nice place but could do better with the pay, benefits and management in some stores. While there I had pretty good managers. We were more like family even when they closed our store we continued to get together ."
good,Small deli bakery. Too much placed on not enough staff. Did not have good management and there was always too much drama.  Customer service was lacking and the deli bakery did not work together well.
good,"working there was fun at times ,seeing familiar customers and knowing how to help was great. overall the weather and carts could be bad on some days. Especially for the courtesy clerks(baggers)."
good,"Good job for part-time employment. Small advancement opportunities, but good for students just needing part time pay. Paid time off after 1 year, with option for health benefits."
good,"This is a good job for starters. It allows for the start of responsibility in the real world, but does not allow for much advancement and employees ""cap"" on their pay. So, if someone is with the company for 50 years, they will have the same rate of pay one they've reached their ""cap"", which I believe is around $17."
good,"The job itself was pretty easy. You have to get used to standing on your feet for an entire 8 hours. I would have no complaints for this job if it wasn't for the customers. The customers were a 50/50 mix of the coolest people you could meet and the nastiest attitudes that misfortune would put you through. Im sure this is particular to the krogers in my area and not common across the board. Unless you can put up with ignorance, I wouldn't recommend working in the east Atlanta area."
good,"I have worked at the Kroger pharmacy for 5 years and have had mostly good experiences. My trainer was very nice and trained me very well and the store and pharmacy management was good."
good,"very stressful, people at this job is very slow paced and have a very bad attitude towards things .  I stayed to my self and worked and made sure everything was done correctly."
good,"Kroger tends to be a very get in, get out, seven or eight hours in a work day. You do your job and leave. Unless you're a lead, and then you're always working over time. Most locations in my town, at least, are union, so you can be protected if Kroger tries not to pay you correctly for your work. Other than this it should be noted that if you start part time, you may never make full time and get benefits. You'll get full time hours for a week here and there, but you won't get enough to warrant asking for full time. They have a full blackout period from Memorial Day to Labor Day where you can't be hired full time if you're already there part time. The pay is more than minimum wage, but relatively just barely. There's a lot of lifting involved, but they will write your schedule as flexibly as you need. Management is bureaucratic and constantly changes, but leave you alone most of the time. If you show some promise they will trust you with nearly anything."
good,"The company has a positive work environment, but as with all businesses they have workplace drama. Training is NOT formally provided for your positions. Associates are expected to be aware of conditions that they are not told about. Hardest issue is customer satisfaction. Many expect more than what the store can deliver."
good,the store I worked at didn't promote based off of performance. they only promoted staff according to seniority. was not happy about their views on promotions.
good,Most people did not want to be there and I didn't blame them. The supervisors abused their power that they shouldn't have even had because they never should have moved up.
good,Fast paced hard work extensive hours and great people to interact with. If you want a job to challenge yourself this is a great first step to get going and lots of opportunities to get promoted
good,No progression and if you're not careful you'll get stuck there. Good starting job.  Management is good and bad. I've worked at two stores and I enjoyed one more than the other. It's about who is managing you and your company workers.
good,"The company I worked for wasnt Kroger/City Market.  It was Storecast/ Driveline Merchandising based out of Denver, CO, for western Colorado and surrounding areas, the Kroger Compass Team.. The managers were awful. Several new managers each month. No one would get paper work right. Mileage reimbursement was always wrong. I enjoyed working as a team with 4 other people. We would go from one city market to 5 different city markets each day each week and set up new displays, pricing, for City Market."
good,ok place to work for . nothing special. management is not that good. Breaks are really short. Management nitpicks for the tiniest things. dont get stuck here
good,"I loved working here, but the Kroger On wynnewood topped me out of most of my checks none of my checks were over $100 when I Know I worked full hours , when addressed by managers the acted careless"
good,I would recommend working at Kroger. After working a year you get 40 hours paid time off as well as one personal day. Fast paced environment with also some slow times.
good,"It wasn't bad but it wasn't the best either. A lot of Drama on the front end and in departments not a lot of team work. its a check, easy money and easy to get in because the turn over rate is ridiculous."
good,"Krogers was a great first job, you got to meet tons of new people. But it had its cons with the job, they had one person working outside and one night i was harassed while alone in the parking lot working.. management did nothing. I also hurt my back while on the job, management did nothing, but send me home for a day, i had pulled muscles in my back."
good,The store I worked at had like 5 managers at one point and it's hard to know what to do when you have all these people telling you that you need to do this or this or this. You get very overwhelmed.
good,"It's about what you'd expect from a grocery job. It's busy almost 24/7 but the work is rarely very challenging, just a lot of the same stuff you do over and over.  The way they schedule is in some ways good and some ways bad.  While it's easy to be scheduled on the days you want, it's hard to get the number of hours you want (it's always too much or too little)."
good,"The managers at my location were unwilling to listen to me, and this resulted in breaks being given hours and hours later, which is terrible for a job that puts such strain on the body."
good,"Working as a produce associate was a new experience for me and also very knowledgeable as well learning about fruits, vegetables, how to keep the  fresh and when to throw old fruits and vegetables out."
good,"Kroger doesn’t pay good enough, and the management at my store does close to nothing, But my other co workers are awesome they do their job and are really fun and nice. They make working here worth it."
good,I have worked at Kroger for years. The company has changed a lot over those years. It use to be very family friendly but any more it just isn't. I enjoy working with the other employees they are all amazing.
good,"Kroger is a great place to start your first pharmacy technician job especially if youre trying to gain experience more than money for now. They have an easy system to navigate which also makes it easy to adjust to all the jobs a technician performs. The pay is low, I work part time and have my PTCB and state license and I'm only making 10.50$ an hour. I wouldnt want to work at kroger for more than 2 years so the experience is great for now."
good,The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with the demands of the customers. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people. The management changed quite often. The thing that I didn't like was that they didn't allow overtime and wasn't flexable with scheduling.
good,"I have currently worked for Kroger for five months. I worked three months in Produce. I wanted to learn more so I worked 3-5 months as a cashier and in grocery. Due to hours not guaranteed, I am seeking a full time positions elsewhere, while continuing one to two nights at Kroger."
good,"it's been since 2014 that I last worked for Kroger I missed working and without this company brand, I would not have any work experience, its too hard"
good,"I started working at Kroger because I thought I would enjoy it a lot. I liked it at first, but upon being hired I learned that they did not care how many hours you wanted to work, they would work you whatever they wanted. I am still in school and do not want to work 30-40 hours a week."
good,"Working at Kroger was nice, the training wasn't very good and they just kind of throw you to the wolves, however you pick up fast this way and they help you out a little bit."
good,"worked there for about a year and a half and the management always dresses issues but never did anything to fix them but kept blaming those trying to fix the issue, always said we didn't have enough money for more people at night but kept hiring people during the day and expected us to do what people in the morning couldn't do with less people at night."
good,"I was employed with Kroger, and had to leave for 2 reasons. I was relocating to Michigan, and I was losing my job due to a new Union Contract. Management doesn't really care about the employees. They are only concerned with the bottom line, and their bonuses."
good,I was really just thrown onto the floor to learn for myself there was absolutely no formal training at all. I enjoyed the job but wanted to learn more and advance in the company dont believe the hype
good,"Overall Kroger is a great store. However, some of the customers are rude, the employees try to one up each other, not really work as a team all the time, and the managers only really step in when there is a big problem that employees can't make right."
good,"Krogers is a good place to work.  The job is not that hard and the people are amazing.  The pay scale at the particular store I am at is lower than it should be.  Dont think its a good company for a career though.  Overall not too bad."
good,Time went fast .my manager did not like me so she held a grudge and gave me the hardest job to be able to make rate.They expected everyone to achieve rate the first night.
good,"Overall working for Frys was a good first job for me, there was a few management and communication problems but not to major. I would recommend the job to friends and family."
good,Great benefits and pay for what the job requires. Gives great knowledge and understanding of how to manage multitudes of people. Greatly develops customer service skills and understanding of how to approach difficult situations.
good,"Kroger taught me a life lesson, I learned my value. Kroger was a great company just had the wrong people leading it. Management abused their authority. That's the only thing I didn't like"
good,"i hated the music that they played on a loop. constantly covering for coworkers because they're slow, don't care, or don't understand. the benefits are a joke. the department managers are okay but the general management are unrealistic and often ill tempered."
good,I started Kroger when they hadn't even opened up but I enjoyed the company for a long time after they opened. The Produce manger worked us hard but it always paid off. That was until he left and they replaced him with someone else. The new manger isn't living up to standards and is not afraid to throw you under the bus if you aren't doing well
good,"This is NOT a good place to work, especially if you have Crohn's. You don't get your legal breaks out here I  fuel most of the time unless you have overlap or you make a big fuss about it. The fuel lead passes almost all of the work onto the rest of us, and there's no communication between us."
good,"Aggressive business plan, long hours , 6 day work week expected.  Light support staff and outdated system's.  Top down management, little personal recognition."
good,Everyday one must interact with customers and be open to conversations as they are key towards its success. Its slow paced compared to restaurants and what not but still a great learning experience.
good,bagging groceries for customers and other items cleaning the parking lot and customer service making sure every shopping cart is inside the store for customers to use
good,Overall Kroger is a good quality store and a fun store to work at .. I enjoy all of my customers and my customers remembers me and compliment me on how good of a job I do.
good,the Kroger company hired me when I was a teenger.i enjoyed my first go round til I got suspended for being immature.iwent back in my 30s and the management team got worst.
good,Job was pretty simple. The atmosphere and staff were great. I barely got any hours because the most hours go to those who have been there the longest first.
good,Upper management had no concern for the high turnover rate for the overnight crew nor the quality of people that Human Resources was hiring.  The overnight stocking Manager was NEVER given the opportunity to interview the new hires. Upper management only cared about the numbers for their store.
good,a typical day at kroger would be very quick paced because you are either checking someone out or bagging groceries for a customer. It be relaxed and laid back.
good,"Fun to work for but when you're younger than 18 you have only one option, bagger. I learned that Kroger's values sanitation and speed of service. The hardest part of the job was when it was so slow but you couldn't leave and having to stay after you were scheduled, the most enjoyable part was the people."
good,"repetitive, dealing with lots of people, most friendly but often on senior days youd get some cranky folks. Not a bad place, however the company gave me a pretty big ordeal about needing to take breaks to ""pump"" I was still breast feeding my son at the time."
good,"I enjoy the work which I do at Kroger and the people I work with,  The challenges are different each day and helps make the job interesting.  It has been a good experience."
good,"The only thing I loved about this place were my co-workers and ONE of my pharmacist. They made the crazy days go by fast and there were some days you wanted it to end. But as far as understanding mothers with sick children, there is no sympathy there at all."
good,"As per work, the company is a good team to work with.  However HR is not willing to help out anyone, to have hours looked at, audited, time sheets adjusted you have to make several meetings which pushes your time in."
good,The place is enjoyable to work in. Most coworkers are great and management is pretty good. Rules are fine and hours and great. I just don't like that they hire so many people and then cut hours so short.
good,i like the poepleFco Worker good Friend Produce I like The Hoursnot good pay not good I Learned to be a good Produce ClerkMaintains Friendly Attitude Toward Customers
good,"Coworkers are wonderful, hours are good, pay is decent. I work in the salad bar cutting fruit and veggies  for cut fruit wall and salad bar."
good,"I enjoyed my time and experience working with this company. Gained leadership skills. Learned a lot about stock, inventory, and product ordering process. Great company to move up in."
good,"schedules a week out, no weekends off, and very difficult to balance work/life...those are the cons.  The ""pro"" is why I stay...we have so very many great clerks who make the day fun!"
good,"This is your typical ""first job as a teenager or part time job"" type place. They hire you, you work, and then they slowly show you that they don't want you there anymore by taking away your hours. They cut off my hours completely without saying a word to me and without my request. "
good,"A typical day as a cashier is simply ringing up customers all day. The work/life balance is pretty decent and they follow through with the hours you tell them you are available. One thing I definitely hated was the pay. At 7.35 an hour, working almost every day, and a little over 8 hours each shift, I was still only bringing home $100 (if that) every week. On top of that, they would rather hire more people than give current employees more hours. For that exact reason, me and a lot of other employees quit. As I've mentioned in the summary, this is the perfect job for someone still in high school who is just looking to have some spending money of their own each week."
good,good part time job with benefits. union pay flexible hours. many locations to choose from great first job.  many positions to choose from
good,Very fast paced environment to work in but great team members. When staff on hand is limited due to call-ins to meet customer demand.
good,"Great job to have when you are split into fractions between the part time work with full time college and zero life, phases of adulthood."
good,"typical day involved restocking and conditioning the store so the store looked good for the public opening at 6 am everyday. i learned that there is only so much one person can do within 8 hours and some people just can not be pleased. i felt that the management lacked one thing, communication. my co workers were great. always a joy to be able to clock in and get to work beside them. hardest part of the job was working under the expectation that one man can do the job of four, while getting paid the wages of a rookie all within an 8 hour period"
good,"I loved working for Kroger.  The company is one of the best I have ever worked for.  However, the call center has a horrible culture and was incredibly difficult to work for."
good,"A typical work day consists of giving excellent customer service and producing baked goods."
good,"Kroger is my part-time second job.  I arrive at 9pm and stock shelves, condition products, etc. until 1am 5 nights a week.  Customer service is one of the main priorities within the Kroger brand.  Everyone strives to be friendly and helpful when it comes to each individual customer.  My night shift manager is very considerate when it comes to personal matters.  I enjoy my co-workers, and we all try to make our work fun."
good,"I would do pricing of meat/product, do chicken quarters next, then label the meat that the butcher cut up and generally repeated until a customer asked (or i asked a customer) for help with something. "
good,"Decent place to work if you are young and want a little bit of pocket money, but is no place for someone looking for a wage to live off of. "
good,"work/life balance sucks and getting passed over for promotions for others with no experience really sucks."
good,Working as a cashier is rewarding because you get to interact with difficult as well as pleasant people and you learn to deal with them both.
good,"Come in to work and start going down each isle  , making sure everything is well swept , clean , and safe for people to walk when they shop . Push carts and make sure members get there shopping carts to be able to shop and store products in cart . "
good,Fred Meyer Jewlers is a great company to work for with flexible schedules and a relaxed work environment. Down side is that your job is based off of commissions and even management has there own commission goals making them a competitive against workers
good,"Everything must be done with speed, felt I never had time for a break because there was so much to do and we were always behind and cleaning after a long day was the worst, I also felt management was very strict and scheduled very unfavorably.."
good,I go in and cut up fruit to make fruit bowls and back stock for the following day. I do mark downs and help stock shelves for the day ahead.
good,"Multitasking by supervising 3 teams as a supervise of dual skilled teams.  Normal day is all about prioritizing your work day, and allow many interruptions.  Running the teams, answering questions, keeping the team on track with daily workload."
good,Opportunity to advance if you make yourself stand out. A mix of people and work ethics. Customers treat you like dirt. Schedules prepared with little advance.
good,"a typical day with customer refund, deposit, money gram."
good,Worked with me until I had to quit due to child being sick. My day consist of being there in the mornings to start making pastries to put in service case.
good,"Kroger is a great company to work for if you're just starting out or need something that you don't want to stay at long, It takes a long time to get close to advancing anywhere."
good,I loved working here loved the managers and co-workers.Greeted customers and rung them up and answered there questions.
good,"I was the Bookkeeper so my work day started early. I learned a lot about people. Some management are very nice and understanding, others should not have been given so much power because they abused it. They hardest part about my job was when I first became a bookkeeper and didn't know as much as I know now. I was with this Co for 16yrs so the most enjoyable part was getting to meet all the wonderful people that I can now call family and friends."
good,"-helping people find items; assisting customers in shopping experience"
good,"In the front end where I work, it is a good first job. My typical work day is dealing with an array of customers with different requests and demands. I've learned how to deal with difficult customers while working at the customer service desk and how to respond to different scenarios. I've also learned to not take things personal when a customer says something to me that may be rude. The management at my job is outstanding and they make our store run as good as possibly can. My co-workers are great, the majority of us are around the same age so I've made great friends. The hardest part of my job is dealing with the customers here and there that have the bad attitudes about stuff that I can't control. The most enjoyable part of my job is having a customer tell me they were pleased with the service I provided for them and how I made their shopping experience more enjoyable"
good,"Aid in the prescription filling processing consisting of taking the prescriptions from patients, entering them in the system, dispensing the medications and releasing them to the patient.  Deal with inventory adjustments and ordering daily inventory for the week.  Train other technicians and assist in teaching new techniques to newer technicians."
good,"A typical day begins with logging in on a fingerprint activated system which I love for extra security. As far as management is concerned I don't feel cares about good employees but depends on a ""revolving door"" system that can replace employees easily. My co-workers are a great bunch of people who pulls together because we depend on each other. The hardest part of the job is the fact that you can't get the hours necessary to maintain a good life, regardless of how hard you work. Also you are not rewarded for increasing the company's profitability. The most enjoyable part of my job is my customer's. I and a lot of my co-workers, absolutely credit the customers with making the day something good to look forward to for the day ahead. I love working with people and I leave work everyday with the feeling that I made my customers shopping experience something wonderful that happen in their day."
good,"There is no such thing as a 'typical day at Kroger'. Each day is full of new challenges and it is up to you to formulate a timely solution in order to get the best possible outcome for your customers. By working with the Kroger Company, I have learned that hard work and dedication do pay off at the end of the day. This job has also shown me that no matter the situation, a positive attitude will get you farther than a negative one will. My co-workers are lively and fun, they are what makes the job worth it some days. Although there are many positive aspects about working with this company, I think the hardest part of the job is dealing with the management. Typically if there is a problem that you've addressed with someone higher up, nothing is done to prevent the same action from happening in the future."
good,"Mostly work alone. Department manager never came in the dept"
good,"Work can sometimes be tedious. Learned a lot about how a large corporation works, and a lot about food preparation. Depending on the stores management it depends on what kind of experience you get. My co-workers are very nice for the most part but you always get some that are difficult to work with. Hardest part of the job is sometimes keeping up with all the work, and the best part of the job is working with nice costumers that are truly thankful for the help you give them."
good,I enjoyed working with our customers and my manager and co-workers made a great team
good,"the pay is horrible for the work that is asked to be done, management is horrible for being so out of order."
good,"As a pharmacy technician, when you have lives in your hands, you should be getting paid more than a cashier. This is a problem that union employees in the pharmacy need to get in on."
good,"couldnt advance in this company"
good,This job was a job because of the location you never knew what type of day it was going to be but because i am a lovable person i enjoyed this job also there wasn't a challenge the best part of this job was working with my co-workers and the customers.
good,check out and bag merchandise make sure parking lot is clear of shopping carts
good,"Cash handling, bagging, and assisting customers. Learned new things every day."
good,"A typical day at the Kroger co. was very enjoyable, fun and free. Being a customer service representative allowed me to communicate and understand the customers personal wants, needs, and concerns.  Which in turn allowed me to assist them in having an enjoyable stress-free shopping experience. Management was a tad bit unorganized at times but still achieved daily goals. My co-workers varied, some were honest and there was those who weren't. Once I mastered all the equipment used in customer care such as Western Union, the job became fairly easy. The most enjoyable part about this job was being able to literally meet, greet, and service customers."
good,"Stocking groceries, and unloading trucks was the jist of a typical day. I learned how to better my teamwork skills, better my people skills, become faster, and manage time better. Some of the management could have used some help, but for the most part, the management team was always friendly, and helpful. All of my co-workers were a joy to be around, always willing to lend a hand, and offer a smile. There was nothing hard about stocking groceries. The most enjoyable would have to be the people."
good,Baking cakes and servicing customers.
good,"Not a hard job at all. The co-workers are great, very friendly people. A typical work day is going in getting the job done, and being safe."
good,"It was ok working there. everyone was ok, job was easy, I learned more about janitorial, and getting to go home was the best part after working so hard to make that place presentable."
good,I have been working for Kroger for ten years in the same store!
good,I became a bagger and then less then a years a cashier. Just to learn to do customer service and to handle stressful situtions also. Co workers were great to work for helped eachother out. Really whenit got busy but i like fast pace work. Working with alot of friendly people.
good,"The hours are sometime ridiculous and I've been told the computer does the schedule. Funny, a person has to actually operate the computer. Many of the cashiers and sackers are young or teenagers and there's a lot of immaturity and playing that goes on when the manager isn't looking. This also includes one of the Co-Managers. In addition, there is (or so it seems) some racial issues as well."
good,i loved the job and was looking forward to staying there but the management at the time did not like me or a few other people.
good,"Low pay...Good out Come you get paid Every week...just a job to pay bills like cell phone, put gas in your car, etc"
good,"Working at the fuel center was really easy. Just sitting inside and running transactions, answering questions, stocking cigarettes and all merchandise if available. The only difficult part is dealing with rude people and the management. I had multiple instances where i didnt get a break or a lunch on a 8+ hour shift. And there is no bathroom out at the kiosk. If you are working with someone out there its not a problem, but if you are alone like i am most of the time for closing, you have to wait until the inside sends someone out to give you a break. That is the main problem is dealing with the inside, they forget about the fuel center a lot. Overall its a decent place to work, very mild paced and not strenuous."
good,There are times when management can be very unfair to their employees . Make sure the position you apply for is worth the pay . There is also a great union to help employees in the future.
good,"i worked u scan. it was a really great job, the biggest problem i had was there was a lot of drama and i dont like drama. one time i called off and only told a manager why n had to go to the hospital for stitches and the next day at work everyone knew what happened to me.  the manager just shared my information to everyone"
good,"The days working at Smith's are long hours. It is a very fast paced busy environment, especially being an assistant store manager. I gained great experience working for this company for six years."
good,"This is a great job for a kid in high school, but if you're an adult you can simply do a lot better. I was 22 when I worked there, making 8.50 an hour and even though I 'd work 30+ hours some weeks, I made less than $500 a week. When I got to the point where I had to take care of myself, my job at Kroger simply didn't pay enough so I had to get something better."
good,So far I have had 2 stores. My first store (West End) was wonderful until I was trained wrong and almost lost my job. My second store (Greenbriar) is the worst! Management is very much unprofessional and never interacts with customers. We have to call them to the Front End multiple times. My front end manager is very unprofessional and doesn't care about her department.
good,The Kroger store I worked in was unsupervised. Employees did not wear dress code. Management lacked in authority and never enforced the rules. Cashiers and baggers stood around and talked about there social life. Very poor place to work.
good,A typical workday was always flexible. I learned a handful of things from this company. The culture of the company was always so vibrant. Everyday of the job was enjoyable.
good,"Approximately July 2019, there was a change in policy to reduce hours in the store as a whole.  I was hired for 10-20 hours per week.  Shortly after being hired, it was more like 20-32 hours per week, which I found acceptable.  After this hours reduction, being the new person in my department, and the store being unionized, I received all the department hours cuts, putting me at 0-12 per week, with then being asked just before the start of the week to add some days.  I usually wound up working 4 hour days.  I have a bachelor's degree, some grad work, and a lifetime of experience in retail; that probably helped me get hired, but did not matter when it came to getting hours, and the pay rate was what I might expect a high school student to get.  It wasn't the fault of management, they have to follow what hq tells them to do."
good,"I enjoyed working here. My co-workers were amazing people to work with, the workplace culture was a family. My most enjoyable part of the position was helping the customers."
good,"It isn't exactly a job that requires a high level of intellect which most who work there do not have anyway. If you just want some job it's fine. Anything beyond that, forget it. You'll struggle financially as long as you work there."
good,"its hard work, but easy to accomplish if you stay on task. the most difficult part of the job is remembering to communicate with your work group. without effective communication everything becomes much more difficult."
good,Depending on the day it wasn’t really busy. the best thing I have learned from Kroger is customer service. Management is okay depending on who they are.
good,"Kroger is a lot like high school, they preach acceptance and unity but its definitely divided. I know a job is a job, but I would at least like to not dread going in every day. Sometimes the work load is huge - with little to no outside help, and then if you dont get it done it looks bad on you or you're threatened with write ups. There's clear favoritism between associates and management - leading to people not being held accountable. Promotions given to antisocial individuals when customer first is the Kroger way. Nothing makes sense, they change everything all the time. Unfortunately because of the union negotiations the pay increase put me at a wage I cant beat by finding a new job."
good,I actually worked for Fry's for 8 years and moved up throughout those years and at first it was really great but in the end they started caring more about the bottom line then the customer and associates.
good,Every one that worked there was pretty nice to me. But what I did I did not believe to be getting a fair amount of money. Working outside in the heat of Texas all day and night was not all that fun.
good,"I worked at Ralphs right out of high school, and after many years I decided to leave because the culture there was not positive. The benefits were very good and time off was given almost any time needed. I just grew tired of working there and decided it was time to look for a more career oriented job."
good,No paid vacation unless your full time ..employees are only part time people they don't want to deal with benefits . very little room for job growth . over time on occasion . bi weekly pay . heavy lifting .
good,"Customers and some crew are friendly. Clicks in the crew who talk about others. More experienced crew refuse to answer questions, help, or just talk to new hires. I feel my direct reports are not adequately trained to run the area or do ordering. Favoritism. Rarely see any manager on a shift. Most of the crew don't complete their task, leave their area filthy, or stand around and talk. Minimal teamwork."
good,Most employees work to get their job done but little interest in seeing the overall store do well.  Management can be great to work with to indifferent.  Schedule can be flexible.  must work at least a year to get most benefits.
good,your always on you feet there is so much to do customer service is a much on how to handle upset customers and how to handle certain situations . management handle there employee by sonority and if they like you or not they take advantage of the youth work hard but get paid less with no benefits as well as the old employees get taken away there benefits after working for so many years its sad really .
good,They went out of business without any notice. While they were in business
good,"So this might be a long post, but back in 2013 I started working for Kroger. I worked there for almost 4 years. I loved what I did but felt I had no growth potential. I put my 2 weeks in and went elsewhere. In 2017 I had an opportunity to go back so I did. I started out as a clerk in the bakery. After 18 months I was given an opportunity to become the stores Seafood Manager. I took it. I will say I love what I do. I love my coworkers but the management is just ruining a lot. Honestly its not even just store level management. It's even upper. The benefits are not the greatest, but it's something. I will say I have learned a lot though. Like I said, I love what I do, just not the company anymore."
good,"Kroger was my first job and I loved it, the people I got to work with were great. There were some minor inconveniences but overall I did enjoying working there."
good,Staff is very well balanced in age and also gender. A very fun but also stressful place to work. Many times it would be you alone doing big stressful tasks
good,It is a place that can either be very busy or absolutely dead which will make a big difference in how your day goes. High turn over rate for everyone besides the management being it's in a college town.
good,"Management styles vary. Excellent work environment, however union Inhibits advancement. Pays less than any other store in the area. Good job security,"
good,"Never enough people on the days you need them.  Lack of leadership from some of managers.  Very stressful at times, no accountability for those not willing to do the job at hand."
good,Not a bad place to work but there is drama and my union is good and bad. You only get a 10% discount. If you are short-staffed it's gonna suck........
good,I love working at Kroger for a while then they got super annoying at my Kroger not all. I mean Kroger a good job for a beginner. I wouldn't stay at Kroger any longer.
good,There was really no room for advancement with this company. Never got scheduled enough hours to pay my bills. Never a regular schedule either. Some weeks were 30+ hours and some were 15.
good,At times it was confusing with the lack of scheduling accuracy and missing persons not showing up for their shifts. The rules were followed by management and sometimes there was no flex in those rules.  People were in and out on their own availability and it was hard to keep track of who was manager in charge.
good,Don't expect to make your rent here. If you work here make sure you have other income coming in. They do have a union if you want to shell out 40 bucks a month. They do provide health care for even part time employees. They also give a 10% discount on all Kroger brands.
good,I learned so much in the first year I worked there then it seemed as tho management had no urge to further my learning of the system. The person that I learned from the most got promoted away about a year after I was hired.
good,I worked for the summer at Kroger. Soon after I was working throw school it was fine something to do while I was in school. Most part I was able to buy chothes and shoes I like being in High School and all...later on I started just working their after I was out of school...
good,"Initially it was a great place to work as a single person. After starting a family I had asked for the managers to go on rotation so that way everyone would and could see their families more with having at least one weekend off that is mandated. After months of no changes in schedule, people not being held accountable for their actions when it came to supervision I find the place not worth my time anymore. Can and could be a great workplace but a majority are only looking out for their own best interests."
good,"I was a courtesy clerk at Kroger and would never go back. I bagged groceries, cleaned, and brought in carts. People would call in all the time and the store would call me almost every time I had a day off."
good,picked for planning for advancement no permanent steps taken to further move up. management is great to work for and fun friendly and hard working staff.
good,"Everyday was a fast day, Very busy day. Cashiering is one of the funnest but hardest jobs you have to stay cheerful positive vibe for all the daily folks coming through your line and make sure they got everything. i tried my best to go as fast as i could but stay as punctual."
good,"I came in under the impression that with my experience and working towards a degree that I would advance. However, my department manager and lead weren't too keen in me wanting to move up and being part of the incentive team associated within Kroger. At every attempt I was kept busy to do majority of the work in my department and not allowed to progress."
good,"Fast pace. "
good,Did not give me enough hours to support my family and there did not seem to be any chance for advancement in this job.  Nice environment though and managers seemed to care about the employees
good,"A fun workplace, but the cost of living was to high for what they were paying. At 8.25, I was prepping and serving meat for customers. I couldn't make enough to live off of."
good,"During my time at Kroger I was a bagger and that involved cleaning, bagging groceries, and pushing carts. The management was okay. The workplace was fast paced and you meet a lot of characters. The pushing carts in all types of weather was the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part was my coworkers and how close everyone was."
good,It is a good starter job for high school students. Can’t complain for it being a starter job. The people you work with are nice. Customers can be a pain but that’s retail
good,"You would be kept very busy at work, but the other employees would be nice and helpful.  Unfortunately, there is a clear divide between management and employees."
good,"Worked there for 9+ months, only made 15 cents increase in pay. Top out for part-time is 11.45, full-time is 14.20. You will have to work there for 10+ years to top out; scheduling is ok at best. Under the new union contract, you can work six days in a and not receive time and a half. Although, most department heads will work with you if you need a day off, but needs to be scheduled two weeks in advance at least."
good,Everything in a company rests on the strength and organization of the leadership. Without strong leadership a crew won't last or be as productive as possible.
good,"This was my first real job, for as young as I was then, it was a decent starter. The pay isn't great, which sucked but enjoyed the people I worked with."
good,"Dont have much to say because it was very little if any communication with management,i belive if management took more time to review the employees and understand and apply there views it will not be such a revolving door"
good,"Duties varied from day to day although my primary responsibility is ""Customer Service."""
good,"It was okay. just management was unprefessional. they have poor Get to meet everyone in your town and get to know them.management, no respect for their workers, and short breaks."
good,bakers would have their on and off days with how many customers they were pulling in but for the most part it would be dead in the store. also the break room was koo one unlike any ive seen before
good,"A good place to work for first timers"
good,Got hired for clicklist pretty easy just kinda boring . Communication with managers was poor . People were friendly it’s a cool first job..............
good,"Management could use some work but overall you stay busy and get good hours. As long as you come in when you are scheduled on time there shouldn't be any problem keeping a regular schedule but if you do not show up when you are supposed to, you will see the results in the removal of half your schedule."
good,"It was fun at first working at the Starbucks they had in there, but then it felt like what you did didn't matter. Most employees are very nice and charismatic, but there is a lot of drama between the employees. The extreme amount of drama made working there not fun anymore, and it started affecting me to the point where I was not comfortable working there anymore."
good,I have enjoyed working at Kroger. The people who work at my store are wonderful and a lot of them make me want to go to work. A great first job to have! I definitely recommend working here if you’re in high school and it’s a good summer job to have for college students who want to make some extra money.
good,Kroger was fast paced or very boring. Being a hostess was nice because I was able to engage and assist customers. Kroger was a good first job for a teenager.
good,Krogers has a constant turn over in employees.  I worked here less than a year and worked with two different store managers & employees changed daily.  I enjoyed the interaction with the customers.  I found myself looking for things to do to keep busy during down time.
good,"Kroger is a great environment to work in, but it’s fast paced & you have to pay attention. They work with you if you want off or need off. All they want is for you to show up to work on time."
good,Lots of ciaos an not enough time and space to work as well with the freight and checkouts and managers standing around dumbfounded. All hot messes when people only help when they are forced to do so.
good,Store opened in 1990 and I was fresh out of high school.  I lucked into an assistant department manager almost immediately and within a couple years I was a department manager.
good,The people and environment is great the work keeps you busy and motivated to keep customers happy when they come through the store. Manager at the time was a not so very nice one. Great for a starter job coming from High School
good,"I liked the job and people I worked with. I didnt like when they changed your schedule without asking you or notifying you. Also I was there three years and never got benefits. There was always some excuse, like I didnt make it in time for open enrollment."
good,"I was stocker, Produce clerk at the store,  I learned a lot by working at Kroger.  It  helped me learn more about the grocery business.  Unloading trucks was probably the hardest.  And the enjoyable part was seeing my shelves look neat and tidy.  I even found myself making shelves tidy as I would shop in other stores.  It just became natural to do that."
good,"For the most part, I really enjoyed Kroger. Biggest problem was lack of employees in my department. Too much work, not enough people. Management promised to fix it but never really did. We were down to two people at one point - for the entire department."
good,a typical day working at pick n save was me putting up shopback or cleaning up the bathrooms or me helping bag and ive learned to communicate more and to make friends and the hardestpart of the jn was being the only girl Utility clerk
good,"The job is good, but not outstanding. The customers are absolutely outstanding. I haven't had a bad customer in my ten months of working at Kroger. "
good,"However the other managers aren't as great. They play favorites with other associates but the rest of us are left slacking. They won't listen when you try to explain something about an issue if it goes against what they view of another person, we shouldn't have to take photos to cover our rears, but for some we have to do that."
good,"I was just a kid, but somehow the employees at the location felt like highschoolers more than I did. It was an alright enough first job, but I just didn't find it was the right place for me."
good,"Fast paced, challenging environment that provides multi-faceted experience.A career at Kroger provides exposure to many departments and marketing programs: Digital, email, OOH, TV, Radio, outdoor"
good,"Kroger was easy to work for but when they sold their C-Stores they didn't even offer a chance to stay with them.  All employees were let go with no options of anything,  Insurance was not supposed to be touched for 2 years but was put on a plan that is costing me twice as much for healthcare and prescriptions.  The wages paid by Kroger has put me into bankruptcy with no way out."
good,"Kroger was a fun learning experience for me. I learned about leadership, team work, daily goals, managing the floor/front end and much more. I wish i could have had more of a way to grow in the position"
good,"Management often would ask multiple tasks of employees at the same time with out conferring with each other, meaning one Manager would give you a task and while working on that another would ask a different task to be completed and both would be expected to be done at the same time. The store I worked at was extremely busy and no matter how hard we Stock Clerks would work and stock, there was always still other products out of stock, which management would then still complain about."
good,It had a terrible back up shift manager on the graveyard shift he always came in late all the time then tried to micro manager everybody who was there already working other then that everybody else was easy to work with
good,"Kroger is not a bad place to work for; however, I have had some problems with management doing what should be done. They do not stick to the rules of Kroger. I have mentioned something several times about things not being done right and I was told to ignore it. That is poor management to me."
good,Working at the fuel station was easy of course because it was so painfully slow and only had about 10 customers a day. That is why i had to pretty much train myself. They told me the script for customers and then left me alone in the booth.
good,"the job required a lot of heavy lifting"
good,"Hade fun some days other days not so much, applies for one possition got another, did not like the way the produce department was ran but had fun working at the front end"
good,There was definately a favoratism problem. Many got away with things that some others did not. If there was an issue between the shift supervisor and employee there was not much room for resolution.
good,Kroger pharmacy is overall a good place to work.They are alittle more customer friendly compared to big name drug store chains. They allow you that customer interaction that i enjoy.
good,"I was in charge of all the Baggers and cashiers, I was a supervisor by the age of 18, I liked my job but the hours was very hard to work around young children."
good,A typical day at Kroger's is accommodating customers with grocery retail products.  You utilize excellent people skills to accommodate customer requests at the Deli and Bakery Departments.  You used the cash register to ring up sales.  The most enjoyable part of the job is positive communication with customers and co-workers.
good,"Working at Kroger can be stressful and frustrating, hours are either limited or too much. Advancement or movement of different departments can be bias."
good,There was never a boring moment at pick n save. Never a time where i had nothing to do. Very easy to keep busy which i liked. Got along with the employees well
good,"Manager in the pharmacy changed 3 Times in less than a year. Retail is as retail does, first day you miss work your on a “bad list”....lots of overtime due to so many call outs....poor atmosphere. Good pay compared to the previous pay scale I had. Seniority is all that matters. Too many turnovers."
good,"Overall a good company to work for. Hard to advance from Administrative to management because of pay difference. Culture is pretty good, but too many are overworked. Managers complain of a strggle with work/life balance."
good,"The managers at kroger stores put the customers first, which is not a bad thing, except when you take into account when they put them before their own employees. Many times the managers will treat the employees worse than the ground they walk on. If you have a customer who says one thing about an items price, you better give it to them at that price or you will get in trouble, but on the other hand if you give them the item at that price you get in trouble by a manager because it was not the price on the shelf. It is a lose lose situation. The best part though about the job is it paid weekly and allowed for an easy work life balance."
good,It’s a good first job for teenagers but if you are an adult with responsibilities you will need more because this job won’t cut it. it only pays minimum wage and has no opportunities to grow within.
good,"The Store's extremely busy, there's more cashiers, than sackers, so most of the store you have to perform double duties, the pros are you get paid weekly."
good,Depending on the store can be really fast paced or a relaxed environment. Every store has a different type of management style. Can be a fun environment or a stressful environment.
good,Working with people of diverse backgrounds and experiences is a highlight of my experience with this company.The environment is fast-paced and very competitive.
good,"Pays ok people are friendly, vacation was good , if you have a y question about your job you can call your Rep they are for you and want too make sure all your question are answered also they fight your cases if one should arise."
good,"Managers can be rude and irresponsible. They aren't professional when it comes to speaking to other employees or customers. When needed assistance they call us a ""bother"" "
good,Fun workplace. Fast paced sales oriented. Teamwork environment. Jewelry store management is not that great. Benefits are good. Commission based. They pay for your diamond and gemstone certification.
good,A competitive place to work with good pay and benefits. I worked there for 4 years and loved the first two before politics got involved. Everyone that I worked with was awesome!
good,Break room was nice and had refrigerators for employee meals. The Deli provided meals for when you go on break at a discounted price. In the Bakery we handed out cookies for free to customers which was my favorite part.
good,"They are very strict with coworkers, doesn't give much attention to health and yet, still gives a hello when you clock in. They will yell at you for everything."
good,"Kroger has its ups and downs. You will have to work nights and weekends. Depending on your background and experience, you are probably going to start at minimum wage. Holiday season is horrific like most retail spaces."
good,"I worked for the Kroger Company for four years, I liked working with the other employees. The store manager on the other hand was a different case. If you weren't buddies then he had nothing to say to you."
good,"things were fine until my husband passed away. Then when I needed help the most the company turned it's back on me the most. If I was a male, things would have been different."
good,"I would definitely recommend this place for a first time job for a high school student or someone just needing a little extra cash. But not a parent of 3 trying to take care of kids and bills. You can advance here, but it takes a long time with the company."
good,I loved working with the company but there are some things I just don't care for. The hours vary week to week and they are automatic. You don't get a choice of when you are scheduled.
good,The manage that hired me was nice the interview was not scary. The lady gave me a job that best suited my passion which was creativity. They would make me work by myself after two weeks and made my floral manager work the other shifts. she would leave a to-do list for me and i'd try to exceed her expectations. Doris was great manager and friend we had fun together. flower and candy arrangement where fun to make prom is the second busiest and valentines day was the most busy. Sometime when Fry's get a new product they call people to the back to try it. All around fun and laid back in the floral department. Watering plant was a pain cause the tip of the hose would drip a lot.
good,"People are rude, I often had to work alone. Other employees were often lazy and provided no help. Hours are flexible yet inconsistent. You spend most of your time cleaning up after people."
good,"Working in the deli dept was oftentimes very fast-paced, stressful and two-faced. The management wasn't very controlled, (some had a tendency to play favorites) and, even though the hours were flexible and pay was decent (you got a pay raise every 1,040 hours, aka about every 6 months), being an introvert, I didn't like having to deal with so many people/customers on a daily basis. It even caused me to have anxiety attacks. It was just too much for me, which is why I voluntarily quit."
good,You start out with minimum wage and get periodic raises that are only a few cents I've been working there for about two years and I haven't even gotten past a dollar more that when I started. You will probably have pretty bad hours when you first start like 1pm to 9pm.
good,"Good solid job, good employees, fair wage. Insurance after 6 months, paid holidays, union, holiday pay and plenty of available OT. Employee discount, fast paced will keep you busy, time goes by fast"
good,"loved my job, especially working the service desk. Very fast paced work environment. Highly satisfied customers is the goal. Only con was getting 6 cent raises every 6 months"
good,"On a typical day, it was busy in the afternoons, but slow and a lot of people trying to steal at night. Same clean up every night, so there was a rhythm to how you cleaned up your area. Easy after doing it a couple times and learning where everything is at in the store. I learned how to handle different types of situations with customers. The management during my time working there was constantly changing. My boss got switched out and during my time, I went through several PIC's. The people I got to work with were really nice, some others were harder to work with but not unbearable. The overall workplace seems like you should take your work seriously, but a lot of the times didn't seem that everyone agreed to doing their absolute best each shift. Hardest part was trying to help people finds things within sections I never knew anything about like car parts and the painting center. The best part was the coworkers that I worked with."
good,"Was a good summer job, but was very physically demanding and could be fired at any time for any reason. Would not recommend the job as front end customer associate unless it was a summer or temporary job."
good,I liked working for the company but they did not pay enough for my skill bases or work initiative. I had a poor chain of command. The first store I worked at was much better. I was receiving recognition and promotions in lieu of higher pay. I worked with good people. Once I transferred to a smaller store it was not worth it anymore.
good,Its an okay store to work at. Others may are better management is very poor. Good thing is you do get paid every week and when you request to be off you're more then likely to be off.
good,A Typical day as a cashier is coming into work clocking in. A supervisor lets me know what register go to go on. I greet every customer and scan Kroger card. I usually get my breaks and lunch late because we are always packed and their are never enough baggers and cashiers so the one that are their get tired quick. The turnover rate is high. Most new people quit without word. Then I go home.
good,No career advancement. Would like to move up but the wait will be to long a lot of politics going on. I don't feel like I belong and too much of the politics going on around me.
good,"A typical day for my job position consists of analyzing invoices to ensure product arrival is correct. Also, it involves ordering the proper amount of product for the following day's shipment, while ensuring that product is not under/over ordered to follow budgeting guidelines. I also am involved in problem resolution regarding associates and/or customers. The best part of my job is the fact that I can ensure every customer will leave my department with a smile on their face and the feeling of wanting to come back to my store."
good,"Depending on the store manager you will be treated as just a number."
good,"managers do not give you the tools to succeed."
good,"Kroger is a good company to work for. The hours as a stocker are very flexible and the management is generally good to work with. All in all, I would recommend working there."
good,"This was my first job and it teaches you good work ethic--show up on time, diligently do your work, always check in with management to know what you need to do (and so they know you're not just goofing off). You get used to what a work environment is like and what people will expect of you in future jobs."
good,Krogers is a good place to start working for if you are needing a part time job. it is not that easy to get full time or to move up in the company to better yourself.
good,A good environment to build a work ethic and learn the skills required of a grocery store worker. Everyone was helpful and worked hard with a smile. Not much room to advance.
good,"would recommend this job for just about anyone.I would like to find a job like this that is friendly,decent job.I liked most of my co workers.I have a good reputation with kroger."
good,I been working for Kroger for five years now. There are times that it can be hard work. What I mean by that is around the holidays when we are really busy. But there are times when it is a good work experience. Working with the same people for the last five years is like working with family. I love my store manager.
good,"While working at Kroger i noticed the management staff would world extremely hard to improve the store in many ways. However,  the younger employees would seem careless and try to take advantage or manipulate their supervisor."
good,Open and close the front end I handle all the money from registers to western union and transactions... return items from customers and if something rang up wrong I fixed it and made sure my customers were returning customers
good,"Is very hard to have a good personal life working here. The turnover rate is incredibly high, and expectations of daily tasks for the budgeted hours were outrageous."
good,I stocked shelves at the local grocery store after I got out of high school.  I worked the grave yard shift so I was always tired .  I learned that food comes in on tractor trailers everyday
good,"A typical day at work was bagging until asked to sweep the store or manage the carts in the parking lots. I actually enjoyed all of these activities even with the repetition. I learned about management and keeping track of myself through that. The other cashiers and baggers were all incredibly nice to me, although the higher-ups could be more inconsistent, sometimes making differing requests, and being contradictory. Those interactions were the hardest part of the job. Talking with my fellow baggers and cashiers was the best part."
good,"Nice employees"
good,I would clock-In then go to my register and check out people. When I don't have customers i would help bag for other cashiers an dI also would help customers to their cars
good,Overall provide job stability being a union position earning full time benefits while being a part time employee way surpass the low pay rate cheap benefits employee discounts low pay company provides pension after 20 years of service
good,This store is in a PRIME place so its really busy from 8am-11pm. Be prepared to really work hard if you work at this Kroger. Its got great Management. BIG store
good,Very good company to work for if u don't want to have a personal life. Work 50 - 60 hours a week if not more come in on your off day very very stressful
good,A typical work day at Kroger's would be clocking in and putting My daily apron on. I cut 20 pounds of ham and turkey . I also stocked and swept behind my area. Another thing I did was cashier .
good,Good environment. And nice people. I enjoyed working there but we moved and I had to stop. They are friendly and very persistent.  The hours was not bad and they were very family 0rgarnize. And the supervisor work well with is if we needed to off or if someone became ill. I would tell others to work th we because the could maybe make it a career. They are building the people to be like a family.
good,"The store I worked at, they didn't care for the employees. I am a 20 year old college graduate and I have to spend every night and every weekend at Krogers, being efficient and productive. Then when I ask for a day off it's a problem."
good,"I need a job thats going to keep me active and moving. I want to be tired and fell like i achieved something for the day. Im 18 years old with a 1 year old daughter. I want to have a good job for i provide the best life i can for her. Im willing to work any hours, in any whether that i have to."
good,this job I did not have a lot of hours and I did like the fact that I had to work only 15 hours a week I wanted more hours was never late and never got them.
good,"In the afternoon it would get super busy. The breaks were so short, you never had time to go to the bathroom. Management was so bad you could never ask for a day off. You would get fired if you made one mistake or you weren't fast enough."
good,Job was easy but lacked any focus and was very boring with no real advancement opportunities. Management is never around.  It revolved around answering emails all night which is very easy and relaxing but quickly becomes data entry and most other employees take the tasks too seriously.
good,"My overall experience was good, most of the staff was friendly aside from the other half. Management was overall trash. I took the correct precautions to report problems and issues but they were all bipassed."
good,"Working at Kroger was hands down one of the best things I have ever done, the workplace was fun and ever changing, rarely did a dull moment go by! and I was fortunate to work with such amazing people. my coworkers and even my supervisors weren't perfect but we were able to work together as a team , though not always seamlessly. yes there are things i would have loved to change, but for the most part, it was pretty swell, well as far as co workers and supervisors. management however is a completely different story. truely i do not believe that really knew how to manage while i was there, I say this because the management I had to deal with, no longer work there, to my knowledge, I know nothing of the current management just to be clear. If managagment didnt like you for any reason (personality wise or prefecrence) the would crack down on you, even if you were folowing the rules to the T. They would do everything in their power to make sure that working there at least for you was Unbearable. I left for this specific reason. brash on my part indeed. however now that they are gone, it has become increasingly difficult for me to reapply and get another job there, which is strange, because they say one thing in the interview and then another when you call them to check up on things. with any luck you will not have any of the problems I have."
good,"Pretty easy job, hours suck and so did the people. The management wasn't very good, and some of the coworkers were unsanitary"
good,"Kroger is a great company to work for. Its easy to advance, the management team is understanding and its a great starter job for young people just starting out."
good,Kroger is a good company to work for. The is opportunity for advancement. Good health care plan. The hardest part of the job is work life balance. You will have to work weekend and holidays and shifts varies.
good,A typical day at work is a happy and cheerful environment. I learned how to have great custom service. Management could be strict but very fair to there coworkers. The hardest part was my job was working outside in harsh weather conditions. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping the customers.
good,"Although the compensation is minimal for the job that I was working, I only saw the company looking to improve the work experience for its employees with incentives and benefits.  I can't really complain, but then again this was a job just to make some extra money.  Extensive training process required before being hired with countless computer modules."
good,Kroger is very easy. I worked in the bakery. I started out doing prep for the sales floor and worked my way up to almost being an assistant manager. You just follow cap and you will meet the demands of customers.
good,"I hated working here because of the lack of communication and teamwork  between associates, the management team not realizing the limits of their employees, and the amount of work they pushed onto  the employees without any kind of sympathy towards their position, capabilities, or amount of work already on the employee."
good,Overall I enjoyed working with others. Maintain good costumer service. The management is wonderful. I learn how to use the stock things where it needed to be and cashier positions.
good,I enjoyed working for Mariano's fresh market. However I had no choice but to no longer be employed there. Due to over hiring too many employees hours and days were first come first serve.
good,"nice place to work"
good,"The pay you get from Kroger isn't the best, and you'll defiantly find other companies in the same business paying more, Is a union corporation."
good,"Kroger is a good place to work for, but they want loyal employees but pay very low and they have been cutting hours so its very hard to pay any bills."
good,"I learned how different people require different elements to be please. This job allowed me to help people find what they really want. Whether this stemmed from a problem or simply a grocery question, I was capable of helping."
good,"•Greeting customers at the final checkout, ringing up purchases, handling returns, and answering questions about products, policies, and services. "
good,I worked her during high school and enjoyed this job very much. It was always fun and you came into contact with different people daily. There was always someone to lend a helping hand and hours were great when I was going to school.
good,Calm work day. learned how to stock and work registers was good management she always did her job she knew it was a time to play and a time for work. i socialize with them but really didn't socialize. working there it wasn't nothing that i didn't want to learn.
good,"Working at Kroger was not a terrible job, but sometimes the boss could be a little too outspoken. Overall the job did what it was suppose to do and teach me respect and provide me with money. I take passion in every job I have ever had."
good,"Was an ok place to work. On the job training was obsolete.   It would have been fine if they had trained like they said.  I was able to use the restroom when needed, was able to take longer lunch breaks when needed. The other employees were nice."
good,"I love clothes and meeting new people so the job itself was a plus. Enjoyed ringing people up and helping with outfits. Designing manikins very creative, competitive job,"
good,i liked working there but the managers need a lot more training and guidance because there is very poor leadership and i was hopeing to progress there.
good,My day included checking out groceries for guests I learned the value a patience. There aren't too many opportunities for advancement and management tends to slack. I worked with typical his schoolers so it was a lot of joking around. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers while the most enjoyable part was my coworkers.
good,"Working a split shift made it hard to manage my personal life, Especially with late schedule posting. Poor communication made it difficult to pick up time management skills quickly. By the end I had learned how do deliver quality customer service and use time wisely to keep a solid work flow. Management lacked empathy for their employees, resulting in negative behavior towards the customers. Co-workers understanding the similar situation made work bearable."
good,"What can I say about krogers you barely get any benefits krogers will rip you off so bad its a shame they will persuade you to sign up for union which does nothing in the long run ""trust me"""
good,I started off as a cashier at Kroger. It was my first job. I enjoyed this job also. I became a floor supervisor at Kroger but now being 25 i definently wasn't paid for that position. I was at kroger for 2 years and only recieved 1 raise!
good,"The good thing is all the great customers are pretty understanding. You also get to work in different departments when they need help, good way to get your training in. Union reps are great as well."
good,"meeting new ppl was great "
good,"Work for Kroger is simple and easy. Not efficient with store standards and bylaws. Store manager is cool. I come to work, execute the production list, go home, come back and do it all again."
good,"I wrapped, priced and stocked meat.  At times I worked produce and cashier."
good,"I have been working at Kroger for almost 3 years and it flew by. Working on the south-end of Columbus, Ohio it was difficult at times. You can not please everybody but I can assure at my Kroger we tried to make sure everybody was happy. My position now is Guest Care & Money Services. I have learned so many skills with working with The Kroger Company. People skills are my number one skill that I have learned along with skills with money, computers and telephones. Management is very friendly and tries to make sure not only our customers are happy but us workers too. I work with so many different types of people from their age to their beliefs and I do not have a single problem with it, or them."
good,"It had great benefits, and love the people, and after working 12 hr shifts at my current job love the eight hr. shifts. Wish I had not left."
good,"A typical day here would consist of demanding customers, some are friendly some aren't. However, I still keep my smile. This job has taught me how to be patient, and being aware of my customer service skills at all times. I'm not too fund of the pay, and long standing hours with very short breaks, but I'm here until something better comes along."
good,"meets and greets customers,"
good,"It was under payed, people forcing you to work like you made 50k  a year, like they did. The Management was also very disrespectful."
good,"Same task every day"
good,"Hit the door running!! As soon as I got there I was doing a bank deposit, pulling money from pop machines or doing the mid-day count in the office. Orders had to be place or registers had to be counted down. Walk the floor every hour to pull empty boxes, fill ""out of stock"", check temps on coolers and freezers. Closing the store means balancing for the day so sometimes I was there tell mid-night but most the time I was out a half hour early. The more organized you are the easier it was. Co-workers were tough, they all felt like they could do what they wanted (big stores can be like that). Hardest part of the job for me was counting registers on Friday night because you had to cash checks at the same time. Most enjoyable was the fund raisers we did. Cook outs, car wash, race cars displays, fun fun fun!!!"
good,"coaching, supervising, customer service, balancing of coworkers and management. "
good,"Cleaning and maintaining a safe work environment. Slicing lunch meats and cheese's to customer specifications. Filling orders for chicken, salads and other deli items. I learned a lot about ensuring customers satisfaction"
good,After being trained in produce you are on your own which is awesome because you don't have to worry about someone monitoring you at all times. You do get popped up on at times which is understandable. They do want to make sure you are on the right track and going at a steady pace.
good,"A typical day was when we had all the help we needed to get the job done fast and make the customers happy. I learned how to deal with customers and the register...Management they were kinda there whenever you needed the help. My co workers were awesome we all worked well together on the team. The hardest part of the job was when they were no help and you had to do everything yourself. "
good,"Loved helping customers. I learned patience with my co-workers. Too many managers, not enough trained staff."
good,"I would come to work and enjoy working with customers and submitting orders for cakes. I learned about time management, and proper attire as well as doing things ahead of time as well. I loved my coworkers; they were always so supportive, like a family. The hardest part is probably closing time, as I assume other stores as well. The most enjoyable was making cakes and doing well at it."
good,Had a great experience working here just not enough hours and not a consistent schedule. Management was well. Co workers were hard working and good. The hardest part of the job was staying busy during slow periods.
good,"Bakery break out and cake design.  I learned how to frost fancy cakes.  Management was fair.  Co-workers were great.  Hardest part of the job, not wanting to eat all the goodies.  Most enjoyable part of the job, the happy reaction to a well decorated cake."
good,I had a manager who would tell us we didnt ever do anything and we were lazy and we were awful at our jobs.He threw food on me one night and messed with our employee meals. He almost followed me into the bathroom one night. I left that job because of him.
good,krogers is a great job if your in highschool but if you have actual bills this is not the job for you the lack of hours is not worth standing on your feet and getting only 15 minutes for a break. The hardest part about working is getting use to rude customers
good,"Happy work place, with customers full of life. Wrong or right: the Customer is always satisfied."
good,"The days would vary, I would either be in the pharmacy filing out prescriptions and billing and doing data entry of patients insurance information and making sure contact and personal information was up to date. or, I would be in front as a cashier, and have even worked in the deli section when needed."
good,"I really loved working at Kroger Pharmacy; it has been my favorite job so far. Unfortunately, I was told that I would be trained on the job, and that didn't end up happening, so I had to be let go. It was completely unfair in every way, and my manager even admitted that it was her fault. She was unaware of how quickly I was expected to know everything. If I had been trained properly, I know that I would have loved working there for a long time. "
good,"Kroger is great starting point for a new person out in the job market. The benefits are great. Hardest part of the job are the customers. Keeping a positive attitude will take you far in this job. Work is fairly easy, you just have to pay attention to what you are doing, especially in the perishable departments. The more you know, the better. They can use you in many areas of the store and you have a better chance of advancement."
good,"Overall, I had no problems with Kroger.  I had worked their for about five months before leaving for another job, but came back.  I was welcomed back with no hassles.  I enjoyed working with my coworkers and customers. Management could improve.  I was laid off with no good reason except that I was not a good fit for the company."
good,"As a young person this was the best job I had, it paid well and the hours were not that bad, until I had to do third shift. It was scary because you are alone and not the position for a young female."
good,"Its a fun job, meeting new people daily and starting a conversation with them. I learned responsible activities and being on time is the number 1 thing. Hardest part can be dealing with customers who just make it difficult for you."
good,"In an average day at work I decorate cakes or make coffee. I converse with co-workers, arrive on-time, and do what is asked of me. Through this company I have learned that unions only make us as strong as our weakest link and that management seems to only care when they are being threatened with someone quitting or an angry customer threatening to call the higher-ups. My co-workers are the reason i have stayed there as long as i have. The hardships bring us all together and give us a common factor in all of our lives. The hardest part of my job is when my department head is constantly reminding me of what I have to do. I understand my workload and it is quite bothersome when he feels the need to keep reminding me of trivial things. I am human, I do forget, but i know my job. the most enjoyable thing about Kroger is that for the most part i get along with everyone. I am an easy-going person and I love making friends, but I know when it is time to work and not converse as much."
good,"There's a lot to do cleaning a deli, its especially a lot for one night cleaner to have, and to be getting paid minimum wage with no benefits.  It's very tough on a college student like myself."
good,As a Senior Co-Manager you are responsible for making business decisions aside from the store manager that are in the best interest of the company. Kroger has 6 core values that influence all business decisions made by all individuals that are a part of the organization.
good,This a serious workplace with serious managers. I did not enjoy coming to work dealing with the mess the coworkers were into. I loved coming to work to spend time with the customers.
good,I do not wish to give a review of this employer. There was not many chances for advancements nor was there any positive encouragement of me returning to school.
good,"Arrive at 6:00am, work alone stocking and blocking the grocery shelves. Greeting and assisting customers when necessary."
good,"The majority of the time we keep pretty busy in the deli. I have learned how to use a meat slicer and have learned a lot about safety. Most of my managers are cool and they all do their job good. Their isn't a hard part of my job, its simple. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my co-workers, they are fun, friendly and everyone do their job. I also love being able to meet new customers and like seeing reoccuring customers, It lets me know that myself and my fellow co-workers are doing our job."
good,Great store for grocery shopping. Fun place to work. Nothing else to tell.
good,"liked some of my co-workers, liked being a cashier once i turned 18, but before that i hated being a bagger because i had to go outside and push carts all day."
good,day can be crazey especally if you have call ins !!!! i started at the bottom lvl and have d worked my way up to where im at mgmt is ok co workers are cool
good,Was a union store and Managers of Seafood deparment had been with Kroger for 9 and 10 years. So they made them managers. There was me a Sales Manager and 2 engineers for General Motors. It was a Brand new Fresh Fare store. We three made it work.
good,"While I don't recommend anyone working here full time for the rest of their lives (as the pay is less than desired), Kroger works really well with your schedule if you are in school and/or play sports; in addition, Kroger has opportunities to advance some (i.e. moving to customer service or another department from the front end)."
good,"Open and closed, made sure everything was conditioned and ready by 8 am. retrieved customer orders make sure carried out ok, with orders, inventory, preperation of food , help and train new employees. The hardest part oof job isnt really anything feel very confident in my job. I like customer service the most."
good,I worked my first real job here. Kroger helped work around my schedule and I worked my way up to a nice pay. I got a lot of customer service experience here.
good,Its a good job for college students a young people. Flexible hours and weekly pay is the best. You get to deal with all kinds of people and personalities.
good,Loved My Jov Most Days. Had A Good Amount Of Hours. I Did Not Like How I Would Have To Work Other Sections Of The Store Even Tho I Was Mostly The Only One There In My Section On My Shift.
good,My typical work day was fun with the right people I clicked with. Some people had poor attitudes but I did not let it take control of my attitude. I tried to look at it as strength. Team work and respect is a big issue for this Kroger at this location.
good,"On a typical day I am either on a regular register ringing up orders or self check out helping this with questions and helping them check out. The management can be good at helping customers answer questions, but bad with communication and bad with giving me the schedule I need since I have a kid. Dealing with the angry customers. I work with some great people."
good,I feel that it's kind of hard to move up in the company because most of the employees are kept at part time and the full time ones have been there 10+ years.
good,It was just the pay that made me leave this company. I was getting hours like i was in high school. So I started to bounce to another kroger for more hours.
good,Great place to work if you enjoy customer service.
good,I had fun making arrangements but it was not the right place for me.
good,a typical day was slicing meats and cheeses per the customers request. depending on the season hours hours peeked and lowed. the people were not all that friendly that worked in the deli. the bakery and cashier was a more pleasant environment. the hardest part was not reacting to other co-workers in a mean way when they were rude and disrespectful.
good,Kroger is a very family-oriented business. Management could've done a much better job when scheduling employees hours.
good,I'm not intrested in writing a review.. for this.. there were a great company I worked for a shame for the Restructuring.. I started as a bagger then finished as a store manager
good,"I like most people I work with, the pay and benefits are great but work/life balance is difficult. Management can be hard to work with and the work is very hard. Hours can be extremely long and everything is based on seniority. I would say that for the most part I am happy but it does get old and monotonous. Also, It's a very male dominated culture that can make it difficult for women to work comfortably."
good,Sometimes the scheduling is way off. Like one week you’ll get 28 hours and the next 10. Which isn’t great when you have bills to pay and your not one of the high school kids. Some people get away with a lot more than others. Like being late or rude. Not much room for promotions and late on giving promised raises.
good,Good place to work just know that you will work all holidays and weekends as this is retail. Your schedule will never be the same week after week but it is an overall good place to work
good,"I am saddened to say that my experience with Kroger was not exactly a pleasant one. Most of my time there was spent collecting carts and bagging items; which wouldn't be such a drag if my employees and managers were more friendly. That, unfortunately was not the case."
good,"same as above. nothing was too difficult, or too easy. Give you a good all around feel for what working in a union is like. Management was neutral, no real cliques."
good,"Most days I looked forward to going to work to see my coworkers. Most of the people I worked with were encouraging, hard working, and friendly. Sometimes I felt under appreciated at my job, but I always tried my best."
good,You get exactly what you expect when you apply to a Kroger store. It's easy work. Spent a lot of time wondering what else I could be doing with my life. In a way City market inspired me to get educated and get out.
good,The task was to bring in carts for customers to be able to use at there need. Also we made sure customers were satisfied with there purchases and made sure they were happy with their visits.
good,Place for changing positions. Flexable hours. Set uniforms. Customer engagement required. Enjoyable co workers and long lasting position. Work with a handjack .
good,Nice and clean work environment happy co workers fun to work with. Love meeting the customers some funny and some not so funny overall was fun going to work.
good,working there was always a good place to be at however management had poor communication skills with each other and fellow employees. proper procedure wasn't a top priority as much as customer happiness was.
good,The managers there are great and have a ton of energy and great personality on top of doing all the work that needs to be done even if it’s not easy. They do all of this while maintaining the idea of being a boss
good,"Standard work ethics applied, some of the management could use re-training. Should have stronger, better lasting equipment for their utility clerks to stay safer when dealing with chemicals"
good,This was a fun job to have as a teenager with disposable income. I wouldn't want to make it a career though. The minimum wage would be difficult for someone out of high school trying to pay bills.
good,"I loved working here, employees are the best thing about this company...The salary is not very good but they do offer great benefits and are very flexible with hours and accommodation around your life. Management can be demanding at times depending on the location. A good place to start for your first job or if you only need a part time job."
good,Liked working here. Customers usually nice. Usually a happy place to work in. Pay sucks. Although i did like the discount on products. Usually friendly employees.
good,"Too many managers, not enough emphasis on the job, more on individuals. The district managers were nice, they saw the potential of persons who would have remained buried."
good,The management team doesn’t always keep everyone’s best interests in mind when making decisions. They have a tendency to pick favorites and allow those employees to perform at a lower productivity with no repercussions.
good,The workday is steady and well occupies my time with consistent tasks to promote good customer relations and cooperation among staff members to give a positive shopping experience.  I have had hands-on training as a cashier.  The most demanding yet rewarding task is showing customers my people skills when interacting with them.
good,Great company however the employees need to give more input on a better work environment and the company listens and apply those ideas that are applicable.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Kroger but my CSM was a terrorist to employees that didn't fit her mold. If you weren't a female mexican, she hated you and that was that. Not onnly was it sexist and racist, she only liked those people because she was into women and prayed on the young girls. It was disgusting and she should've been fired."
good,I got consistent hours and the flexibility that worked with my school schedule. I had great managers who really cared about us. the pay was less then the stores offering similar work but they had some decent discounts. It really depends on what managers you get.
good,"A typical workday involved grocery shopping around the store to fulfill customers' orders, while also delivering groceries to customers in the parking lot. The hardest part of the job was scheduling, because we were always short staffed so ensuring that everything was done on time to meet standards was a little difficult. Grocery shopping itself was the most enjoyable part, you never know what customers want."
good,Had a lot of fun working at krogers Yet something felt missing. They need to Add more Excitement into the Place. It felt bland and boring When you walked into the store.
good,Kroger is a great job but they try to give you so many benefits which end up just stretching too thin and all being poor. This just ends up hurting pay and making workers resent the extra things.
good,"I love my job. Love my patients and “most” of my coworkers. Only one flaw. The Managing pharmacist. She obviously has favorites. I’m a top technician, never call off, take on extra tasks, and will go above and beyond with the things I do. But the pharmacist just doesn’t like me. She’s went as far as treating other techs badly because they are fr with me. Some techs had put distance between us for that very reason. They even admit it. This job made me want to do this as a career."
good,"It's alright, the position I worked in was pickup (clicklist), management was good for my department and people were nice. But the actual store management was pretty bad, they never helped out when we were behind. And trust me, we were always behind, always short on staff and they never hired when we need more people."
good,"My job was very based on how long you had been at the company, not if you did your job well. Was constantly scolded for things I did not know and was not taught how to fix it."
good,A good job for a teen looking to start out and make some money after school. Good hours and they work really well with school schedules. Need patience for rude customers though.
good,"you dont have set hours here unless you have been there a long time or control the scheduling, most coworkers are very nice, management attitude varies based on the level of management you are speaking to, cross fingers and hope you get your break on time if at all"
good,"I loved working here. The supervisors and employees are very kind overall. I was a cashier and customer service rep, and scheduling was fairly flexible. However... the store manager was just awful. She was sooo rude to the employees and had obvious favorites; the favorites were the ones who advanced in job positions. The store manager was just terrible. If there were a nicer store manager it would've been a better working experience. If you show up on time to work and make sure to greet everyone, then you'll be just fine. This is a good job if you are currently in school."
good,"A typical day at work would be going in at 6 a.m and basically getting the store ready and clean for customers. I learned the basics of satisfying customers to learning how to keep everything up to date. The hardest part of my job was trying to multitask, the most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the customers smile after helping them."
good,"They didn’t save my spot when I left to Afghanistan, and I gave them every paper work they needed so they keep my job so idk if they good wit Military men"
good,"Some people are the reason I’ve stayed. Some others plus the pay for the amount of work I do are the very clear reasons I intend to leave. Not great, but could easily be worse."
good,Working at Kroger’s was good . I worked in produce and I was a cashier.  I enjoyed my time there I just had to move on and find better pay. Good company to work for though
good,"Overall, as my first job, it was a really good way of my journey to working. It, for a lack of a better term, threw you into the fray of things. It makes you learn fast and get used to customer service. The management, sadly, was not that great, at least when I got promoted to deli clerk. There was a lot of miscommunication and had a few disputes because of it."
good,I like working at Kroger because of all the people I get to see and meet. I make everyone who comes through my lane smile because I’m always happy and it warms their heart.
good,Hardest part of job not enough hours to complete work managements goals weren’t always realistic. Union benefits once you pass probationary period are great
good,"Kroger is notoriously understaffed due to lack of hours and an unrealistic standard of the amount of work one person can get done in a day. The job is fun with a lot of great co workers, however it does not leave much room for a social life."
good,"Not a bad place to work. The pay isn't great but the benefits are. Its and union job so job security is pretty high. The management can be good or bad but its been generally better than any place I have worked before, they are understanding and are positive leader models. Some act like bosses while others lead the charge . It is a high stress environment depending on the department. Front end- high stress. Stocking- med to high stress. Click list- high stress. Deli and other service areas are low stress. Overall its a good job the best I have had so far but the pay isn't worth the effort you put in."
good,"Unless you've worked here for 20-30 years or know the right people, there are no opportunities to move up. The staffing is terrible, not enough employees and half of them are useless anyway. Way too much expected of higher up employees and not enough pay."
good,Kroger has a lot of wonderful benefits and their healthcare plan is great. For full timers. As a young mother I feel like it’s too demanding and I rarely see my kid. I also feel it’s challenging to move up when you come into management.
good,"Making sure your drawer has cash and change is important before handling customers. common math skills are used each day, management changes often, resolving customer issues to assure an enjoyable shopping experience. meeting new people, and having peers makes the job fun and enjoyable."
good,i did NOT get the respect i deserved or the pay i deserved . many creepy customers came in and i was froced to be polite and kind to them even tho i was harrashed numerous times
good,"It was really exciting at first to work there, because everyone was nice and new. Later on down the line it was getting to be a headache dealing with rude and ignorant customer's. The manager's tried their best to deal with it but stuff happens."
good,"If you need to pay rent,bills, etc this may not be the place for you, but if you're a teen that needs extra money or need to pick up a second part-time job then its good."
good,I Recommend working there. Management was fun and nice to work with. Payment is offered in different ways. Sometime I would get late checks though. The job is fun and easy in every department
good,Management was not all that great. Cleanliness wasnt really a factor. To much competition and lack of respect between managers. Very boring and could be managed better.
good,"Scanning items as fast as possible without making mistakes. The customers are always correct no matter how wrong they are or act. I learned how to pack and organize food for preservation, and how to use simple quick math to add and subtract. Work place was ok in regards to atmosphere. Worst part was that your hours were not consistent and you stood in one spot for an extended period. Best part was when you went above and beyond because it was the right thin to do and a customer told management about how well they had been treated."
good,"You'd do different things in a typical day, often not on a set schedule but as the manager needs things done. Some people in this position may do janitorial work, while others will only bag and return carts from the lot."
good,"Use the talents that are positive to the store not just your clicks or friends. Be fair to everyone and dont hold back anyone who is willing to help out. Stop trusting in liars and gossiping associates. Talk with employees to see where their passions are and use that to benefit morale for the entire store. Stop stepping on the good workers and promoting the disrespectful associates who are nasty talking  to everyone. It really is a drain on the positive thinkers when you promote the bad and mean associates, your store will have a high turnover rate."
good,"Started for my first job when i was 16, was good but only temporary so i could advance onto better opportunities with a previous job experience. Would recommend as a starter at young age."
good,I have worked there for 3 years and in that time gone from Cashier to ADL. What i have the most trouble with is that at such a higher position there are some people at Cashier that make the same as I do. Other than that though I have enjoyed working there and if you work hard it is easy to move up steadily.
good,The company is union based so the only way to advance is through the union.  It isn't an easy process to advance. They will give you full time hours but no the benefits that go along with it.
good,Great place to begin working with school and not wanting to be out too late. Very flexible and willing to work with you based on schedule. You are also able to get discounts which is good because it saves you money on grocery shopping.
good,"Poor management, hours are inconsistent, too much stress. I was under impression I was a full time employee upon be hired... later to find out I would only be getting 20-25 hours. I started as a Clicklist picker until a store manager bullied me into moving upfront to a cashier. Since I have left said manager has beeb let go."
good,I learned a lot during my time at Kroger. I worked in the floral department part of the time I was there which was creative and rewarding as well as learning how to maintain flowers.
good,"After clocking in, you will go to the kiosk and observe what needs to be done. Whether it be a line of customers that need to be helped, a sink full of dishes, or counters that need to be wiped down. You jump in where your needed. Start writing on cups so that the person who is with you knows what to make and the line gets down faster or start washing dishes, so you can prepare for another rush. On a slower day we will do a lot of cleaning, just to keep busy. I am an early morning worker typically, so I try to help with closing tasks, such as prepping syrups or whip creams that need to be made, just to help out whoever is closing and make their workload a little lighter. The hardest part about being a Kroger Starbucks Barista, is that they are constantly short staffed.  For whatever reason, we can't keep people. People apply to be closers and mid-shifters, but never want the shifts they signed up for. Another hard part is when people don't want to do their fair share of work, its really difficult to come to work every day, when other associates wont help with the workload. It really makes it a lot more stressful than it needs to be. The most enjoyable part is that it is pretty laid back and easy to do. Also, I absolutely love coffee, so that is probably why I enjoy working in Starbucks."
good,"When I would clock in I go to my assigned register count the drawer to make sure that it was correct, Then I would ring customer's items up when they were ready. But if I had no customer's I would stock the candy on all the registers and plastic bags as well."
good,"-Works were erratic."
good,"At the end of the day, working at Kroger ended up just being a paycheck. There's no incentive to work and the work is boring and repetitive. Kroger is a good place to work overall."
good,"Kroger was fairly easy position as cashier/bagger. However, the hours were not enough for me and the pay did not cover my basic needs. Employees and management were easy and enjoyable to work with."
good,"I had a lot of fun at this job, and was very sad I had to leave it. I spoke to my manager the day I thought I had a sprained ankle, hoping I could get off early to go to urgent care, but was denied that. Came in with a doctor's note that they said they couldn't honor. Ultimately, my job was to bag groceries and help with closing, but there was nothing they could do to accommodate me."
good,"Typically start the day with checking if there was any note left behind I should read before heading off to my designated department which has changed three times since I started working. If there isn't anything left on the sales floor I should work on, I focus on cleaning the area before bringing out either new products or back-stock."
good,"As a Marshall in the Clicklist Department, I can say this company has no concern for its employees well being. Corporate constantly raises our orders per hours and then gives us grief for having late orders. Our orders are way over our capacity, yet they constantly send out emails bashing us for not meeting their goals. They put so much faith in the eCommerce division yet give no support, too much stress for basically minimum wage."
good,It's a great professional place to work. Yet it's quite strict on policy almost to a unhealthy degree. This in tern leads to a very guarded workplace environment which is hard to foster trust and teamwork. Most employee's have clicks or groups for fear of backroom repercussions. If you don't mind working by yourself and can adhere to some of their more guarded and strict policies then you will do all right.
good,Great place for starting out. Not so much if you rely on it for a living. Would like to see management more involved with daily operations. Would like to see management helping more.
good,Kroger is fast pace.  Most employees are friendly and great to work with.  Time management is critical.  It is often necessary to work extra hours or time in order to get all of your work completed.
good,The jobs are easy to understand and the hours aren't bad. They are very clean and the positions are just challenging enough to keep you busy. It's a good starting place to work.
good,Kroger was a great company to work for. Great benefits and great Co workers. Very fast paced and a lot of customer service contact. Amazing customers that you get to know.
good,I was young when I had this job all I had to do was bag groceries and gather shopping carts from outside. Sometimes the weather made it tough but all in all fairly easy.
good,Kroger is a sufficient place to work for people who are looking for a starter job. It was often understaffed but it was overall a friendly place to work with decent benefits.
good,"started as a part timer only given full time when my hours started breaching 35, a lot of stress, and some sketchy management overall was an OK job and I was just unlucky and got the short end of the stick where management was involved."
good,"Not a bad job if you can handle the seclusion and retail life, in the fuel center you have a lot of liberties being on an island by yourself. But that can also be a bad thing if you don't know your situation. I enjoyed the job but wouldn't recommend it to everyone."
good,"Kroger is fast paced pharmacy and on any given day we do not have enough help.  Pharmacy management continues to take away hours, help, and pay and makes the job more stressful.  They truly only care about money at the end of the day and do not care about or support the pharmacists that work hard everyday."
good,"I really dont remember much about working I just really hated having to get carts when I proved that despite my age I was one of the best cashiers they had available but they were really lenient with wanting to come in to pick up extra hours but the days they needed help and you're scheduled were definitely the worst but definitely had a nice ""work family"""
good,"The company culture has changed and it is hard to move up in the company even after working there for a whiIe.  I have been there for almost 8 years and am now not able to move up in the company which was my reason for staying with them. The people are wonderful to work with but there is always a change in expectation to advance and I have been held back several times. In my current position shift availability is not always available. Some of these things are store specific and do not reflect the entire company.  "
good,"Would be a good job for a teen as a bagger. Other jobs, like cashier, are great for anyone looking for an easy, secure job. The union protects your rights and makes sure rules are followed."
good,"Overall, it's not bad, but there is a lot of problems with management. They seem to not appreciate what you do, whether it's for the company or management, they seem to not care at all."
good,"Been with company 5yrs love it, but it is a stressful job, they expect less people to get the job for a bigger team done and dont care about you having a personal life, kroger comes first and if you work 12hours a day to get job done they dont give praise they expect it to be done everyday wether your tired or not and act like your a machine."
good,"This was my first job, it taught me a lot of about an workplace. It taught how to manage money and count money more efficiently. It also taught me a sense of responsibility"
good,Not enough pay or people to conduct daily operation of the front end. Supervisors are not up to snuff in running the front end. Helping people find things located in the store and keeping them coming back.
good,"OK job all in all. KR doesn't understand the cost of living in the Bay Area. Keeps folks engaged just enough to keep them, no room for growth unfortunately."
good,To many swing shifts and always being called in on days off. They do provide health Care. they are Union. Front end has it easy while perishable departments struggle.
good,"My typical day would consist of checking the parking lot for carts, Returning stock to the sales floor, Checking all Restrooms , Checking with Customer Service  and Assisting Customers when they arrived and left the store,"
good,"Good store with great flexibility of schedules. They’re willing to work scheduling conflicts. Your hours aren’t guaranteed every week, and can be difficult to make ends meet every week."
good,"Kroger was an excellent job when I first started but, once I began moving up everyone became liars, and never wanted to help you. Your fellow employees wanted to see you fail"
good,"Good entry level job, wouldn't recommend it beyond this. The hours were flexible but harsh, pay was low, recognition of hard work did not happen. The union is merely corporate HR, will not fight for the workers. Would be a better place to work if real unions were allowed and not crushed."
good,"Most enjoyable part is helping customers. This job is very quick paced and busy workplace. Great place to work, can work around your schedule. Pay should be better"
good,I would not recommend working here if you live on your own and pay bills-moving by yourself. You get paid minimum wage and have to ask for promotions.
good,I love working with the customers and satisfying their needs and wants. Kroger has a very upbeat and fast pace work environment that I enjoy being apart of.
good,For the most part Kroger was a great place to work especially for a first job and great for high school students I got tired of it once management changed because of how toxic the work place got I had this job for 3 years and would overall recommend it
good,they make you feel like a part of a family managers are good easy work enviorment you get to know your coworkers but you would have to judge for your self
good,"The opportunity exists for a decent career, but corporate policies have been recently to strip all excess associates from stores, and making changes that in theory streamline processes but in reality make the job harder to complete on time."
good,"Working on the front end as a manager/customer service associate can be very stressful. There are not many rude customers but when you do encounter them it can throw your whole day off. The hardest part of my job is the frequent schedule change. You never get the same days off and you typically have to work weekends, which makes it hard when you have a family. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with and the customers. I get along with a lot of people and always try to put a smile on everyone's face."
good,"The most enjoyable part about working at Kroger is the environment. Your coworkers can be the most sweet, caring, and loving people to work with. While being at work it doesn't feel like it. It seems as if you're just with family during your shift. You could come to work feeling horrible and somehow your employees will make it their business to make you feel better."
good,It was busy. But Learned alot. Being around many people. Helping people. But hard to juggle. Mostly positive with customers. That's about it how many words does this need?
good,"I haven't been working at Kroger that long but that job is very stressful. I work on weekends and that's a tough run. There are never any baggers when it's time for me to get on the register. Just when prime-time hits, the front-end supervisor either lets the baggers all on break, send them outside, or send them home. In addition to this, they tend to cheat workers out of their hours/breaks/lunches. Lastly, if you are a hard worker, Kroger is not the job for you seeing that it starts off with minimum wage. You won't get a raise until your six months are up."
good,"Kroger's itself is a great company. I assume it depends on where you live and the people that you work with that makes each store feel like a great place to work or not. I was ""trained"" to work in bakery/deli, which is a position I enjoyed for the most part. Not too hard to bake frozen foods already to go, keep a clean kitchen, and serve customers with a smile. It was only the fact that other associates were not training me properly and were not fond of me for unknown reasons, that made it less enjoyable. At 7 weeks I was called into management and told that other associates didn't feel I was cut out for that position. I was almost terminated because they couldn't find another suited position for me. I lucked out and they called me the following day to see if I wanted a position in the fuel center. I have only been training there 3 days now. It's ok so far. Still looking for other work."
good,I worked their while going to school. Very flexible breaks and id you're running a littlw late usually its no big deal. They are overall a great company to work for especially now that it starts out at $10 an hour.
good,"Kroger was a good job for while I was in college, but I wouldn't recommend it as a career unless you can get on the management track, which is competitive. I tried several times to get into management and was passed over. The hardest part of the job was getting, and keeping, full time status."
good,"Working at a Krogger helped me ease into the work life, other jobs can quickly become stressful and overwhelm people, but with this job I felt relaxed."
good,"The typical day for a cashier is standing behind a cash register and checking out customers. The average shift would be 8 hours, and I wok.d receive two 15 minute breaks and one 30 minute lunch break."
good,Not having enough hours. Change of supervisors to much. Friendly young people. The hardest part was trying to finish all your work in such short time.
good,"I really enjoyed working there, it was a great experience. "
good,"work break work lunch work break work home, people break stuff we fixed it, same as everywhere. Maintenace was looked down on and treated like an expense rather then a benefit."
good,"Being a bagger, you learn how to deal with customers and coworkers. You do have a variety of dirty work to do, such as Gathering carts and cleaning bathrooms. The downfall is there is no room for growth as an employee, the store is notorious for not training people, and management as well as the union does absolutely nothing in terms of helping their workers."
good,I loved working for Kroger when I was in clicklist. the manager was reasonable and spoke to you when you had a question. I was by the store manager that if I moved into a different department I would be getting a lead position once I was settled into the department come to find out the position wasn't even remotely open for me and ended up wanting to go back to clicklist. I liked my job in both departments just don't like when people lie to me about moving up. I had to quit because the workload was more then I could handle with what was my first semester at school.
good,"I loved working for Dillons until or old manager moved and they brought in a new one. He had it out for all of the courtesy clerks and would write up people who previously had no problems. He even wrote me up for not bringing in carts as fast as he could, yet when I apologized for not being faster told me he didn't expect me to work as fast as he could because of my lack of experience, and still wrote me up! "
good,"Fairly good people, but not enough hours. The stores in which I have worked are fairly small and therefor the variety of goods available are small. The store is clean but is in the process of being renovated"
good,I would have to load groceries and retrieve carts in all types of weather. Management varied from day to day but over all was very pleased with them. The hardest part of the job would be the labor of being outside in the heat or cold. The most enjoyable part of the job was being around such great people(costumers and coworkers).
good,"Kroger, as a cashier or courtesy clerk, is not a bad job for a high school student or even someone in college, but would not recommend for someone trying to support themselves completely. Management at other stores might not have been that bad, but the managers at mine were two faced and tried to act like they cared about employees, but you could tell they didn't really. They also allowed their personal lives to affect their work life. The hardest part was probably how much they demanded us to achieve certain goals, that management needed to look better."
good,It was cold. The customers were nice and understanding it’s a busy and big store so that means the store is in a nice neighborhood. I would only suggest this as a Highschool first job type thing. Starting pay is low
good,"As an hourly union protected employee it is a great place to work, as a salary non-union protected manager it became more stressful and less appealing."
good,"Kroger is a really easy workplace if you can handle the public. Work hard and follow the rules and you will have no issues. The only issue would be that there seems to be this gap between management and employees. That causes some tension, and employees often feel that they are taken advantage of from those in higher positions than them."
good,"Everyday is something to do, no matter what department you are in there will always be work that needs to get done. minimum wage for the most part unless you have a bit of previous experience"
good,"If you are looking for a fun job with this company look out for Quality Assurance jobs.  I was with this company for over 11 years and in the Quality Assurance department for 10.  If you are looking to advance with the company, you will need store experience outside of the warehouse jobs.  There are opportunities to advance with company and they offer decent benefits.  I needed a change from doing the same thing for so long."
good,"Kroger is a good company to work for.  Only problem is there are too many chiefs trying to make their mark over someone else.  Once you are salary, they use it to their advantage.  Will work you to the bone and expect you to work a turn around."
good,overall poor management although i liked the employees that work there and would be willing to go back im alright with poor management as long as the people treat me well and are enjoyable
good,"Was required to complete computer training everyday when working, I was not given the opportunity. I was not properly trained. I was showed in 1 minute how to operate the machines."
good,Some people make it a career some people don't. I work with a bunch of amazing people have been there since the store opened many many years ago and they love their life. I don't see advancement even after 4 years for me so i am almost done with my schooling and then hopefully something good comes from it and i can start living my life to its full potential.
good,"I think Kroger is a good starter job . Its a good job to grow with but, after a while of working there you'll have the urge to do more than just bagging and scanning groceries."
good,"It was always busy, with the right amount of people working it was a breeze to get through the day/night. I loved the environment and the people that i worked with. A great job for highschoolers"
good,"A typical day working at Kroger Pharmacy for me was very busy and tiring. I had to learn to remain patience, calm, and positive when working along side my fellow coworkers to get prescriptions filled within a certain time frame while being short of help. Also I had to remain patient when helping impatient or unhappy customers when it came to our wait time and their medications. However, working along side great and motivated coworkesr and pharmacist made the job worth completing. This job has helped me to grow as an individual and has taught me many things that I once did not understand about medications, insurances, and customer service."
good,"For me, a typical day at work consisted of sacking people's groceries, taking them to their cars, and cleaning up messes as they appeared."
good,"I learned a great deal while working at Kroger. The main thing I learned is how NOT to treat employees and co-workers. The unwritten rule of get the job done when not given enough time or allowed to stay on one task TO get it done because they insist on giving more tasks yet all the while saying you cannot get overtime, and you cannot work off the clock.....you end up doing both basically, or at least I did. Unfortunately it creates an air of animosity that in turn inspires bad attitudes in the workplace."
good,Kroger is a slandered grocery store working there is as expected you come do what you are told and leave it only becomes stressful during heavy business hours and holidays they are only open for a few hours on holidays they dont really care about your schedule they will schedule you and if you dont show up its your fault other then that its a good place to work
good,There is not a lot of room for advancement and the wages are not very good. There tends to be a lot of politics that occur. It is a dog eat dog kind of job. If you do not protect yourself then you will fall under.
good,I needed a job since I had been unemployed for a while. My overall experience there was not too bad nor too good. The managers expected more but paid less. Needless to say they can never keep employees. At times you will work alone while others took breaks.
good,On more than one occasion management did not handle certain situations in a proper fashion. Other than that it is an OK place to work. There are not many advancement opportunities.
good,something are weird there because you can be told one thing and next you getting wrote up on how you were taught to prep the produce because when i changed locations i wasn't taught a different way to prep fresh veggies and i told them this and they didnt even bother to show me the new way
good,"The downside is that you had to be there 6 months or more and your are always considered part time. You get holiday pay after your 90 day period. At the Fairbanks West location, it is CONSTANTLY busy. If you can't handle people in your face all the time, don't bother applying. This is the BUSIEST store in the entire US."
good,"All in all it was a good job for my first time working. i learned patient with customers there. I remember making a lot of friends from Krogers because they worked there, otherwise we would have probably never met"
good,"A typical day at work is very fast-paced, very busy most of the time, a lot of customer interaction, I have learned lots of stuff, like handling food and big machines. Management is not such a big problem but I wouldn't say it is the best either. The hardest part of the job is when our department is understaffed during a busy day, however, working in groups is probably the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Kroger is a wonderful place for students or first time job seekers. The front end is very fast paced and stressful at times. I would not say it is good for long time employment, as advancement or moving to other departments is very hard. Many of the managers I had were nice, while some were rude and overly demanding, but there are so many managers that favoritism really can't effect any of the workers."
good,Working at Kroger was ok. A typical day at Kroger you'll deal with costumers and cleaning your work area. I learned how to deal with running out of product as well as what it takes to make the costumer happy.
good,get into work a few mins early to see what needs to be done. see if i can start early if they need help up front. work hard and try my best with whats going on. deal with supervisors making bad choices on self check out especially keeping only one person on both sides when you have to have 2 at all times. teenagers as baggers being disrespectful to customers then tel managers and find out nothing was done.
good,It making me write a review of places I never actually worked for just at .so this is the filler in the nothing pie it is asking for. It's a kid's job for child money you would have to steal and shop lift to survive off what they pay .they should be ashamed of them selves
good,"Most of your coworkers are great and your immediate supervisors are also pretty awesome, but the corporate office seems a little out of touch with the individual store. "
good,"Your coworkers really make or break the job. I luckily had excellent coworkers, if it weren't for them I wouldn't still be working here. Some of the customers can be rude but you just have to shrug it off."
good,Kroger is a great company to work for . Plenty of advancement opportunity. Great hours and great benefits. Work / Lift balance is something to be worked on if you are in a management position.
good,"My work experience at Fry's store 58 started great, but was not the best toward the end. I felt as if management and associates were both trying to push me out."
good,as a bagger i would bag customer grocery's then after a hour has passed by i would be able to go outside and collect the left over carts that was left behind then i would get my 15 minute break all in all it was a fun first job
good,"I worked many different departments in my time here; Front end clerk, cashier, floral, drug gm, and night crew stock. There were a good amount of people that helped each other and were a positive influence, and there were just as many people that were difficult to work with. Overall, this is not a bad place to work. It just wasn't the right place for me."
good,Working in this line of work I can say you have options to excel in other areas of work. The employees are great and some of the customers. The management is very cut throat and if they do not like you they’ll plan to get you fired so be careful.
good,"On a typical day, it is busy and slow at times.  As a courtesy clerk there are many jobs they schedule for us to do and most of the time they forget about the breaks and we end up having to ask for one.The employees are friendly. Communication needs improvement between each front end manager. The benefits are nice and the customers are what keeps me motivated at my job."
good,A great place to learn how to multi-task. Management is understanding about the learning curve for pharm techs. It is difficult to train a pharm tech however because everyone who could be helping is super busy. They would benefit from having outside trainers available. There is a lot to learn.
good,"It's a good place to work. Flexible hours around class schedules as well as decent benefits after being employed for a year. The management, as it is with most places can be trying at times, but since I've left there have been some major changes. Hopefully for the good."
good,"My usual routine at this place typically was to start off by clocking in and I would get straight to work, I enjoyed working at the front end (bagger/cashier type workers) because talking to the customers helped make the day go faster, it was hard to switch to another department because the mangers forget your requests easily. As a bagger i wanted to switch to being a Cashier and my manager promised me as soon as they are hiring, well fast forward nine months with repeated requests, they've hired 18 new cashiers over the course of the past time. I did enjoy the community and system because it was professionally maintained with the exception of managers forgetting your requests. I dont think there really is a ""hardest part about this job"" unless you have beef with a certain co worker. It was easy to enjoy as long as you do what you like when doing your job."
good,"I worked at Kroger for a year and a half, and for the most part it is a great place to work if it's your first job or you're between jobs. Most days it felt as though management was forcing me to do things I did not want to do. I did gain some great customer service skills along the way, so that was a plus. Also, if you are there long enough, they will cross train you in other departments to add to your skill set."
good,"I love working at Kroger . It can be stressful at times. If I wasn't also a mom I wouldn't be looking for another job. I can't work the nights and weekends they want me to because I need to spend that time with my son. At nineteen years of employment, they can't give me morning hours with weekends off."
good,Management not experienced: Too young to appreciate known work values. Common known work goals not shared by management or work team. Childish clique maintained by management. No options to improve.
good,"There are a lot worse places than Kroger to work, and my time there was generally tolerable. Like most retailers, Kroger tries to operate with about half of the manpower hours it needs without over working employees. Since Kroger is a union shop, it offers higher than industry average wages and job protection. A lot of managers I dealt with were good, a few great, some really bad. One could do a whole lot worse than Kroger."
good,Working for Kroger Logistics has been a blessing in the amount of opportunities I've had to grow as a leader. The unfortunate part of working in Kroger Logistics is the compensation for the amount of work you have to put in is not lucrative enough to prevent you from seeking employment elsewhere. With that said I would only leave if something more financially promising came along the provided me with a better work-life balance because of the end of the day spending time with my family and having Financial stability or the two things that I need most.
good,"It has been a long time since I worked at Kroger. I was a fun job and I didn't really get into the store much, I just stayed in my little corner pharmacy and did my job."
good,"Courtesy clerks are in charge of bagging and assisting customers with groceries. Hourly sweeps, trash-taking, cart retrieving, and restroom cleaning are mandatory. Also charged with cleaning meat department if working closing shift. "
good,"All I can say is Management was good, but pay and benefits were not. I am not sure what else you would like for me to say. I no longer work there because hours and pay were not good."
good,The overall job was easy going but the quality of people hired was poor which leads to more work being placed on people that want things to be successful.
good,"You would often stay longer than your shift indicated. I often stay hours past washing dishes in the deli and that was not something my back condition would allow. But if you're in good health, it pays well and keeps you busy."
good,A typical day usually was 4-8 hours long and involved either being at a regular register or a express lane. The express lane was a nightmare but the regular lanes were not too bad to work. The part that made me leave was the poor management a lot of things went unplanned and hours got messed up almost every week.
good,"As a deli clerk the task is simple, keep fresh food coming while keeping a clean work space and please the customers. They are usually pretty flexible on hours."
good,Lots of very young people. This isn't really a good place for people who are older than 25.There are some physical demands that are a bit challenging.
good,Its and good job could improve if management improved. This compant offers pretty good benefits that i recommend taking advantage of. If the management team from the store manager down imoroved it would be an outstanding place to work
good,They need to work on equal treatment and better pay because some workers are allowed to do things that the new workers aren't and that isn't right. Plus they need to pay more than $7.00 and some change. People deal with a lot rude customers and  still keep their composure. Kroger is a big enough franchise to pay more than close to minimum wage.
good,Depends on the store you are in my store was okay just hard to get along with the other courtesy clerks and cashiers. The management wasn't the best. Pay for courtesy clerks is trash you start out 7.25 (minimum wage) and only get a 0.10 raise for the entire time you work there.
good,"As a cashier, you would stand all day at the register. The customers would rarely ever stop, so the day would be very busy. Holidays and Sundays in particular were very stressful as management wanted customers to be helped as fast as possible. "
good,"I worked for this company a total of ten years and for the last few years as the CEO's have changed this company has really gone down hill. Poor benefits, hard to get promoted to manager or department head, pay-scale is awful."
good,"Employees and supervisors are good people.  For most part good place to work.  Customers on the other hand tend to take things out on you or just rude.  "
good,fun job great career i really enjoyed working here except for working with store manager harvey woodmansey store 351 hes not a people person why work with people
good,to all that worked or have worked for Kroger all i can say is to go into the store on different days an interact with the employees before you make the choice to work for them. i didnt have a bad time working for them. just that life on life terms happened to me an i have nothing bad to say. just they need to work on the mgr team in all there stores.
good,Loved this job but management did not see employees potential. Long hours great pay. Have to work most holidays. Benefits are so so. No PTO but flexible in scheduling if you needed a day off depending on your manager.
good,"After being forced to switch departments, which I could have fought, but it wasn't worth the hassle. I moved to the deli and began working with some pretty interesting people. The management team was pretty cool. Got along with them and was able to receive assistance and guidance from them whenever needed."
good,great place to work if you want to meet a variety of people. Great place to work for part work and if you need a second job. They are willing to work around your schedule if you have another job or kids
good,"I truly enjoyed my experience working at the Starbucks inside Kroger in Rome. My lead barista was the best trainer and knew how to teach me quickly how to operate our portion of the store and please our customers which who were often regulars. Our team was amazing too, I loved our mini Starbucks crew.  If I was still living in the area I would have went back after my surgery. The only thing I would say i would have changed is better pay for the time and duties done."
good,"This is a great place to work. Everyone is friendly for the most part. It can get crazy during the holidays, but other than that, it is great. Great atmosphere as well."
good,"Although you do get some really good managers they are usually the new ones.  They supervisors & managers that have been there a while are not happy, stressed out and take it out on the employees."
good,My most enjoyable part of the job is the customers and learning from them. I've learned patience and self-control. The hardest part of the job is having to explain the same things over and over again.
good,Working there is alright. Lots of repetitive tasks that can be brain numbing sometimes. Not a lot of compensation or bonuses.Hardest part of the job is putting up with customers. Hours are given to seniority.
good,"For a big box retailer it used to be morally and physically rewarding. But over the last few years it has become more like Walmart. "
good,"Working for City Market has been a great opportunity.  If an associate is committed to the company and wants to be in a management position this is a great place to work,"
good,"My typical work day would start out 3 hours before the store opened making sure the grounds were cleared and all errant shopping carts were in their proper places after cleaning them. After that, the store would be cleaned and i would keep everything in order once the doors are opened and help anywhere I would be needed. As my first job, the main thing I learned was how to be dependable on the job and be ready at any moment in the off chance I would be needed to cover for another employee. The most difficult part of the job was being the only employee able to work weekday mornings due to age restrictions. All of the supervisors that I worked under were very easy to work with and very understanding, and that made my first job so much easier to adapt to."
good,Only reason I want to leave is because there isn't any advancement. The pay is very low for what you do in the 8 hours working. There is not any overtime available at all.
good,Kroger was a very intense work environment based on the store. Sales in the focal point; customer satisfaction second. Store associates aren't treated the best in addition to poor pay scale for anyone NOT a department head. Management is expected to meet sometimes unachievable metrics and isn't always given support from corporate. Overall it's a productive place of employment and professional development.
good,"very decent place to work.  A flexible work schedule, vacations  and meeting good friends are a great part of this job. I have learned much about patience in dealing with the public with this job."
good,"Working At Kroger Was A good Experience. it Was A Calm,Fun Work Environment.Working At Kroger Was Like Being With A Family. The Management Wad Was Great.."
good,this job is good for a first job or for seniors it gives you good work experience with the public but the pay could be alot better which is why mostly young teens and retired
good,all around great place to work. with the new pay wage scale it seems the fixed the lacking wages. mostly part time jobs but they do offer more hours and they are willing to let you fill in at other stores.
good,"I would give any high school kid the advice to go work at a Kroger when he is still in school. Its a great way to learn how to really work a job, just don't make it your overall plan."
good,"Kroger is a solid employer if you are at the store level.  Strong benefits and a great place to work.  Upper management makes some decisions that are tough to swallow, but are overall attempting to make the company stronger."
good,"Starting out was an opportunity to learn new things not only about the store and the job but also being in the work force. Being a bagger felt great because I was helping others and helping out the store. I had to bounce from different lanes to help bag for someone. Had to go outside in any type of weather from a freezing blizzard to an unbearable heat way. It felt like doing the carts was the main priority because we had to do it even when it wasn't our turn or even if we just came back in from doing it for a half hour. After a while I didn't enjoy being a bagger so I asked to be put in a cashier position. It took longer for me to get ""promoted."" I even had to do both jobs before I could be a cashier permanently. As a cashier I just had to stand in one place and greet customers while checking them out. Being a cashier gave me the opportunity to improve on my photographic memory skills by memorizing so many codes for different products. I also got to use some math skills that I haven't used since high school. However due for my age I was told that I had to be moved to being a self-checkout cashier, which you had to be at least 19 years old due to alcohol sales. At first it was rush and it went fast each and everyday, but months went by and it just felt like it was becoming old and boring. I know how to do my job well, but that's all I did (and still do). Nowadays I'm realizing that Kroger is not what it was when I first got hired. We are running out of employees so they decide to ask me every time someone calls off or they just don't have anyone for that shift. Getting more"
good,"Able to function as individual within a team, ability to reach out and learn new things. "
good,"Great team in Meat/Seafood Dept. Educated on cuts of meat, various seafood, proper sanitation protocols. Most part rewarded for Job well done. Hiring of alot of teens not too productive."
good,"Fun to work at, very understanding and i was well compenstated. I enjoyed the job as well as the staff and found the job to be pleasureable. Would recommed other to apply."
good,"It's a decent job with fun coworkers and customers. I'm a cashier, I run U-Scan, I do Fuel, and some menial customer service tasks. I do a lot for them but don't get paid for it. "
good,"I guess it depends on your store, but my specific store was stuck in high school and the management was terrible. They pick favorites and dismiss you if you are not someones daughter or best friend."
good,Kroger was a great company to work for. Stress free job environment. Very laid back atmosphere. Challenging on many levels daily. Great customers and service.
good,It's kind of a job that you get when you're young and you do not have any other bills to pay. You get free food whilunch while on lunch. The managers and supervisors was actually nice they respected you
good,"•	Handled day to day responsibilities such as cleaning check stands, bathrooms which included sweeping and moping, along with cleaning windows and display windows."
good,"Deli management needed a change. Manager was older and not very understanding or willing to change old ways (even with changes in company). Pay rate was very unfairly decided, with newer, unskilled workers sometimes being paid 2 dollars more than hard workers.  Drug addict employee who spoke little English was paid more than a qualified employee."
good,"There were endless amounts to tasks to do, so employees can always find something to do. Customers were friendly, and interactions helped build personal skills."
good,The work is not so bad. I like making the customers happy. The hours are fine but the pay is minimum. Management can be an issue but other than that I have enjoyed working for Kroger.
good,"Knowing your ability in what you stand for if you are eager to grow you will grow but that comes with a price. It,s a great opportunity for starters but not a career path for me."
good,"The job was fast paced and expectations as such Unfortunately, the needs of the customer were rarely ever met. The customer service at this particular location required a lot of dedication and effort to meet the needs of the population we served."
good,The people there are very friendly and outgoing. You get a raise when you ask for it. You can move to a different department whenever you like. You get discounts on almost everything.
good,my review after working there for the years i have are fairly good. Only complaint i seem to have is with management and corporate not giving departments enough hours to do a good job and be able to keep up with the departments needs to keep it up to the standards it should stay. But i do have to say my fellow associates are like a family that is by far what makes kroger enjoyable to work for.
good,"They have minimal staff hired. Workloads can be big, especially during holidays. Hours are not consistent unless you are full time. terrible holiday hours. Slow advancement. Big gap between benefit perks, for example: 1 week of vacation after 1st year, 2 weeks vacation and 1 personal day after 3 years, 3 weeks vacation after 10 years."
good,"I had a good time working here because everyone around me was very nice and provided a good work environment, although i had to leave for flexibility reasons, I would say it's a good place to gain customer service experience."
good,Fun and exciting job opportunity for social people. Great for younger adults and older adults. great opportunities can arise from this job and there is a wonderful sense of culture.
good,"For the amount I had to do at such a small store for three years I was not paid near enough. The increase comes after about 400-"
good,The people you work with for the most part will think of you as a team member. management tries to pass that on but it doesn't come across like that.  Advancement comes from who managers favor and not from people that actually deserve the job or are more qualified.
good,Good hours but bad pay and room for advancement. Has union option which helps employees but in the end only hives's job security. Not a career for sure
good,"I worked the fuel center and really enjoyed it. It was a very chill environment, wasn't at all hard and the manager was friendly. I didn't like that it was almost impossible to move up in the company or that they cut hours after a while."
good,I loved the work and staff. Dept was well ran. Would have loved to work there forever as I learned a lot I all aspects of job. Was a valuable job and prepared me for future in work ethics
good,During my experience at pick n save I've learned a lot there are so many codes for so many things and you have to be fast and mental. This was a very great environment surrounded by good shoppers & workers.
good,"-Welcomed 100+ customers into the store helping to enhance their shopping experience.  Processed returns and refunds when necessary.  Answered questions and responded to complaints."
good,It was a very slow and boring job environment. You sit in a kiosk alone all day. Talking with customers through a speaker. They tell you how much they want. You type it in. Same routine everytime
good,great intro to customer service. gave lots of opportunities to prove good customer service. lots of online surveys that talked about my skills with customer service.
good,"Good store to work at, only downside when you start out you don't have very many hours and the only way to get hours is if you get called in. The store I worked at supported the community."
good,"The employees were a lot of fun to be around and work with. I had to deal with customers that were sometimes very difficult. I worked very hard in order to uphold the company name because that is what a quality worker does. I also worked hard so that my boss would look good and finally be recognized for the work she did. Overall, I would not work there again as they pay very little."
good,"A typical work day is stressful but enjoyable, my co-workers make the day go by quickly when things start to get chaotic. Every day I'm learning new things about my job and the environment I work in. Our management team is firm but fair, and for the most part understands when things happen, they strongly support us as employees. Kroger has a very broad culture of employees and customers.The hardest part of being in customer service is not being able to help someone with an issue or concern they may have because of our policies and rules.Through Kroger I have met some of the most amazing co-workers I've ever had. Some of my co-workers and I have developed friendships that may last a life time. I couldn't ask for a better team to learn and grow with."
good,"The day is usually busy, but can get boring at times. Best customer service job I've had by far. The barrier between myself and the customers makes it easier to enforce safety regulations, and makes me feel safer. Customers are rude, but that's normal and easy to deal with. Not a lot of interaction with management."
good,Working at Kroger is a hard task. Working within the department is not a problem although the managers have high expectations. Kroger tries to squeeze as much work out of you in only 6hrs of your shift. Kroger does not offer much hours. The only great thing about Kroger is the benefits and the people you work with.
good,"I was hired to work at the new location for the store and at first, things were a little rough but once I got to know the people that were working around me and started to establish a routine, things got better fairly quickly."
good,I love working with the customers.  Management does not always listen to your concerns.  There should be more help involved with the USCAN when their are problems and you need to call help desk.
good,This is a very busy establishment and I like it like that loyal customers friendly coworkers and team players also i worked the self check out station i loved it
good,"Entry-level employment, majority of employees are usually adolescents or young adults, high turn over rate. The store I worked at had unprofessional managers and poor training."
good,"Kroger isn't a horrible place to work, but could do a LOT better. Breaks and lunches are both unpaid, there pretty cheap when it comes to pay, some managers try to work with you on scheduling, others don't care. HR is great, haven't had any interaction with the union, but you have to pay for it anyway, and I don't see where they really make any kind of difference."
good,"The management was great as far as working with associates to work around schedules. The opportunities for advancement (or at least cross training) were encouraged, I believe they went to some effort to recognize associates, and make them feel appreciated."
good,"Typical day at Kroger was enjoyable"
good,"if someone called off or just didnt show up for work, the remaining clerk was expected to do all of the shut down work in the same amt of time as 2 would have it done"
good,"Every day was a new experience working as a cashier."
good,I need a hands on job that is willing to work around my schedule and is within a 15 min radius of Lawrenceburg. I'm good with my hands and a quick learner.
good,"This is a great company with employees that do not care about their job. You have to work hard to get to the top and once you are there, it's easy to get pushed back down."
good,Fun people to be around and grow a bond with. Had some problems with management. Hardest part is that your always in a rush and you have to learn quickly.
good,"-Poor Management "
good,You need to use the union to force a full time position otherwise you get very few hours. Management is inconsistent and they do not keep up with their responsibilities. Supervisors expect you to do work they are unable to do.
good,Worked with a lot of nice people. Had a few management issues. Over all nice people to work with. Had to stay late as part time a few nights. Had to do the same thing over and over. Gets boring when its slow. Can only do so much and look busy.
good,"Applaud their emphasis on customer service, but their Mgr program needs diversity and experienced individuals. Young mgr trainees need better people skills for both peers and customers"
good,"Good place to work with good compensation. Sometimes it can be stressful when under staffed, which leadership doesn't always seem so understanding of this, and as is the reality of working retail you work weekends."
good,"Taught me very much about customer service, great people to work with. Tough place to get a pay increase because not many promotions are given."
good,"The work day usually starts anywhere between 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. and I work until the store closes at 1 a.m.  Self-checkout is where I call home when I'm at work. I run six registers, sort all the merchandise that customers have thrown on a different shelf because they decided they didn't want it, fill the bags at each register, assist customers with scanning large items, voiding out the wrong produce code they punched in, giving discounts or changing prices on items that were tagged incorrectly or not put in the system at all, help other associates bag groceries if the courtesy clerks are not available, push in the grocery carts from the parking lot, sweep the area I'm working in, find products customers are looking for or issue rain checks if the item on sale is sold out, etc. "
good,"Very simple job, was just hard labor intensive work. Minimal experience required. Co-workers were cool but could get on your nerves."
good,"I enjoy meeting new faces everyday & the fast pace. My co-workers are, for the most part, fun & personable. It can get tiresome standing in one place for hours."
good,"The union in effect makes it a prime environment for part time students. However it is hard to advance quickly but not impossible, it's a great entry level customer service experience."
good,It was physical work. Enjoyed working with my co-workers. Being short made it hard to stock the top shelves. Management was very helpful.
good,"At Kroger I've learned how to better my job as a sales clerk, the people are easy to get along with."
good,Cramped space but it is a relatively fun place to work. It gets very busy and there is a lot to be done. Dating product is very important.
good,"At Kroger, I felt that there were prejudice customers and coworkers and it made me uncomfortable. I have learned to communicate with people when they're unsatisfied, but when I was unsatisfied, my managers disregarded my opinion and feelings and that made me uncomfortable. But Ive had amazing workdays but the atmosphere was unsettling. Thats why I decided to leave"
good,"Kwik Shop was a very nice environment. Although very challenging at times but, a nice environment to be in. The customers really make the happy atmosphere!"
good,"Was a pleasure to work for, a great job to work for while in high school. However management was poorly constructed with little possibilities to further my career there. Learned plenty of social skills. Great employees made the work environment pleasurable."
good,The management in the Meat needs work but the other employees are a good group. The store i work in needs some cleaning and management should expect more out of their employees. Otherwise this was an interesting job to have.
good,"I like my job working in the wine shop at Kroger. the only bad thing is that I only get 20 hours a week. other than that, I have nothing bad to say at all."
good,"Working at Mariano's has thrown me into experiencing new types of situations. For example customers. A usual day at work consists of socializing with coworkers, serving customers in high and low paces (rushes or downtime), constantly cleaning the work area and making sure everything is prepared for the morning shifts. I learned more customer service skills and how to keep my work area clean. My co-workers are a joy to be around, they always make my day. I've had barely any problems with them, but when I need to switch shifts that's when things get a bit complicated. I would say that's the hardest part about working there. At the end of the day, I don't hate my job. I enjoy working there because I've built connections with the customers and my coworkers."
good,overall is was an alright starting job learned a lot and has a lot of friendly co workers but some parts of the season were dead and became hard to get hours.
good,"Overall the company is cool. They offer affordable benefits, the guest are guest. The management varies from person to person, overall pretty descent managers, maybe a little more employee relationship management training might help with managers and employees. Communication is a need to learn for Kroger but still ok."
good,"Busy, busy, busy.  Learned some  but would have loved to have learned more.  Management - lacking.  Co workers need to be more helpful with new staff learning.  Hardest part of job, being thrown into the position not fully trained and being the only tech there without any help."
good,I worked here for about a year and it was fun. But I did notice how the managers had their favorites to the determent of the other employees. I also was feeling that I was not going to be moving from the last position I was in so I ended my employment with them
good,this job was a very busy atmosphere. kept you busy and assisting customers at the service desk as well as showing customers where items were in the store.
good,Easy to acquire full time if you are a good worker. Advancement can be tough because so many people are needed at the bottom levels.
good,I would stock shelves help customers and any other task given by management. over all it was a great place to work but I did not get enough hours during a pay period.
good,"Kroger is committed to the Kroger brand and products and services to customers as a grocer. There are many opportunities in the corporate offices and stores. At the call center, the day begins and an employee enters the building and all is under strictest security. Time management is closely monitored with workforce management and metrics of breaks, lunch are highly monitored. Headsets are worn all day and heavy phone usage of incoming calls is the  norm. Call management is graded by metrics of length on phone, after-call work and quality. Team management by a supervisor and specialists. A lot of pressure with metrics and performance and no time to just get up and be away from the  phones. A sit down job for 8.5 hours per day. "
good,It a decently fun and easy job. Co-workers are nice. I wish there was more opportunity for advancement. I also with there was more agreement on schedule availability.
good,"Very laid back and fun place to work. "
good,Fun environment. Fast pace if you can handle it. Work could sometimes keep you busy enough. Good exercise. Benefits. Good Co-workers to talk to while you were slow. Good way to talk to people
good,you would love it here its a really fun place free movies see new people everyday and see what's behind the scenes with the movies and everything but the don't pay that good
good,"Fast paced, and requires physical strength for manual labor. Staff is friendly and courteous. Late night hours can cause serious exhaustion."
good,Job was simple. Co-workers were so kind. Management seemed to be not so involved. Job had many benefits and plenty of opportunity to grow.
good,"the job offered raises every 3 months, you had to keep to yourself a lot around other coworkers to avoid drama. Union didn't help if you had a concern. A typical day started with either waiting on customers or start cleaning all the equipment to prepare for closing, My team coworker that was assigned to close we would take turns on waiting on customers and cleaning the store for the end of the night. We would have to front and organize all products and shelves and check for all out of date products, we would have to make custom food items such as meat & cheese trays, fruit & vegetable trays, cook fried checken"
good,"I would fill and refill prescriptions, input insurance information, run the cash register, inventory, put up stock and answer the phone."
good,"The job itself is easy to learn if you put in the effort, and there are plenty of hours to go around.  However, some people may have trouble dealing with the isolation and stress of operating a fuel center alone, and work/life balance leaves a lot to be desired."
good,The Management team is always in conflict with each other. You don't know what you are getting yourself into. they will lie to you daily and expect the most from you. Dont know what else is expected as far as telling information.
good,A typical day at Kroger was either steady with customers or over run. The job was easy and most of the people that work there are friendly. Some of the customers could be rude but only because someone in the store made them mad. The cheer up knowing that their cashier is friendly and cares. I would recommend this job to any young teenager looking for a first job.
good,"working as a cashier at Kroger was a great job in high school because it was very simple however as an adult it becomes time to move on. customers were kind, management did a good job handling  any issues and it would be a good part time job on the side."
good,A typical day at work involved going into a nice grocery store at 10 at night being one of only about 5 people just stocker the empty freezer isle .
good,"A good way to get experience in customer service.  Fast paced so it makes your days go by quicker, but didn't have regular or scheduled breaks (ate/drank in between customers)."
good,"It is a good job to get through college, but nothing to make a career of. My least favorite part is that it's union so employees who aren't useful can't really be fired."
good,"I began my job with Kroger in the Accounting department which I worked in for a year.  The hardest part of that job was monthly closing.  I enjoyed my co-workers and manager and was able to straighten up the Air Travel Expense account which was a complete mess.  "
good,"It was a very fast paced environment, and loved to stay busy and keep up on the new information given out to employees. Very good on time management"
good,"worked there 10 years, I gave it my all and they outsourced us to a company out of state, very disappointing. The hours were great and the benefits were very nice also, the people that worked there are great people with bad communication skills."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed the people I was working with.  There was no consistency is hours being scheduled, or number of hours being scheduled.  Each section was being micromanaged by the store, at the time I was working there, which made it difficult to work at times."
good,"Part time job  good experience.  basic interact with customers"
good,A job that can lead to more hours per shift and with the right attitude that can lead to become a manager in training.
good,"Working with Kroger Maintenance was very exciting, productive, and labor intense. learning new trades meeting new people and working with different equipment everyday their was a new Job daily so I wasn't the same routine that's what was nice about the company. Hardest part working in maintenance was the heat yes different jobs daily was nice But staying in the heat was very intense so once we where done with a job nothing was more pleasing then to jump in the cab of the truck with the AC cooler on ready to go to the next job site."
good,"decent place to work,money isn't worth it. great people work there and everyone gets equal right to contribute"
good,"I've been and ADH for a couple of months/ year in a half. I think the best way to review this job is to say it depends on the store manager. I've worked at Kroger for 5 years, and it wasn't that bad at first. Each time they changed managers it was like they were picking the most incompetent of the bunch for our store. I've worked at other stores to help out and there management team varies, some being very helpful and motivating. Others being downright rude and literally in your face. At 2 years I was promoted to second man, and told that my certification would happen with the store manager change but the new store manager didn't care what me or the grocery manager said, took over making all decisions in all departments. It's been a roller coaster from there, our backrooms is packed, people call in all the time or quit, shes not beyond yelling and insulting her workers to try and get them to work. People at my store are generally depressed and try to avoid her. But like I said it depends or your store manager. I've worked under some that weren't all that bad, beyond being a bit pushy, but arn't all bosses. I never got certified, was told I wasn't working hard enough for it, which is surprising since I one of the few who stay on overtime to finish anything undone and make sure the store is running well. My immediate boss says I'm a hard worker but my store manager seems to think everyone's just slacking off."
good,"A typical day at work included arriving on time, tardiness was non-acceptable. Come right in, get right to work. Everything was on a time frame. You knew what you had to do and what was expected of you. Everyone worked together ( I enjoy working on a team, but was more than capable of working alone with minimal supervision)."
good,"a typical day at pick n save was very fast paced,but fun at times. customers as well as some co workers were friendly. the hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers who had the need to take their bad day and impose it on the workers. the most enjoyable part to of the job was working on the register."
good,"Everyday at work, it would be the same thing. Re-stocking the shelves and cleaning it up by the end of the day. At night, it become freight and we unload and stock the empty shelves. Hard work every single day. Co-workers were great, but not many people last long in the position I had acquired. It requires a lot of physical strength and fast hands to get the job done. Only one thing I did not like about my job was the management. Our department always got pushed to the limit and was the lowest payed job. Only thing i enjoyed about the job was meeting new people everyday."
good,"Great opportunities to learn. Multiple locations, inclusive company culture in development. Well rounded business experience."
good,"simple work ,unloading ,stocking , and scanning, enjoyed the crew, Management Sucked They Closed Down"
good,"A typical day at work would be described as a little challenging due to the fact that there are so many customers to assist around the store. Working here I learned how to conducted myself properly in a retail setting and how to fulfill the customers wants prior to their needs. While working at DEB, I was able to work at the cash register, dressing rooms, by the door, etc. so it did definitely did help give me inside knowledge and training on working in retail business."
good,I had a great time completing my extern hours at Fred Meyer. Got along with the staff.
good,They do not give you any supplies for your job I had to go out and buy things for my workers because the management was to lazy.
good,"fast paced , but friendly work environment."
good,"A typical day at Kroger consists of a constant customer activity. I am always helping and assisting customers with purchasing flowers and other floral arrangements. I also help customers find products that they are looking for around the store. Working at Kroger, I learned how to properly assist customers, create floral arrangements, how to communicate effectively with my co-workers as well as management and how to run a cash register. My co-workers are very hard working but I believe that some managers can do better by communicating more efficiently and actually ""managing"" their departments. the most enjoyable part of my job is the fact that Kroger is a family oriented environment. It's a little dysfunctional at times but at the end of the day, we are one big family."
good,"My job consist of inventorying, delegating, unloading trucks, and weekly board meetings.  I have been a manger for 3 years officially but 8 years unofficially.  "
good,"At kroger my day begins with me clock in on time. After clocking in I would talk to my floor supervisor to see if I would be cashiering or bagging. On cashier days I would ring custumers and assist the bagger. Also as a cashier i would take payment upon completion of ring all groceries. Then on bagger days, I would bag groceries, help customers to there car, and clean bathroom and register area."
good,I'd always greet customers help wit bagging. I've learned how to better deal with customers. Management is wonderful and so are my co-workers. The hardest part about the job is working in thee hot heat. The most enjoyable part is making the customers shopping experience a good one...
good,"typical day at work varied each day. You never really knew where you would be or what you were doing. Most of the time if you were scheduled in a different department, you were always constantly called up front to help up"
good,"There is no such thing as a typical day at the kroger company. Your shift is never a set schedule, which can be okay if you like a change of pace in your work environment, but it makes it very difficult to have a balanced lifestyle. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and most of us are still going to be lifelong friends when I leave the company because we got to know each other so well in the time I have spent there. I am not going to praise management or bash on them because they were just trying to do their job in order to run the store as successfully as possible.The hardest part of my job would have to be the random shifts. I could go from working 5am-1pm to working 2:30pm-10:30pm. I was always tired or worn out because I never had a set sleep schedule. The most enjoyable part of my job would have to be meeting the customers and forming such a relationship with them, that I refer to most by their first name. It was a joy meeting new people and developing such pride to be able to communicate with these people."
good,"I enjoy working at Marianos Fresh Market.  I am working hard to"
good,"Great company to work for because of its diverse and engaging associates, but dedicated and instrumental employees are kept in their positions for far too long without opportunity for advancement because of a persistence of outdated beliefs and hiring techniques as well as favoritism."
good,"I did a lot of ""go backs""  which is people that will get two or more buggies full and can not pay for it all. So therefore I would have to take all of that grovery back, With a smile. A typical day would be me helping bag groceries. I was not old enough to work the register being that I was in 10th grade. If it was not that busy, you are allowed to go get buggies form the parking lot. Boy that was so heavy. I think I could only do three, no more."
good,"co-workers make it easier to get through the day"
good,This is a great workplace for students who are looking for flexibility in order to manage both responsibilities.  I've learned to become patient while working with customers and that a smile can go a long way in making the experience better for the day.  Hardest part of the job would be standing on your feet for majority of the shift.  If you have leg problems then this can be a great challenge.  The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting and meeting new people everyday.
good,It was a good place to work and I loved being in the bakery and the public but again the hours and the pay were low.
good,"everyday show up fills an stock shelves help the customers either find what they are looking for or help them with a custom order. Co-workers are great easy to talk to. then close the day doing backstock reviews ordering, maybe inventory cleaning duties.. The customers an co-workers are the best part of everyday. I've learned to cut meat, order, Operate complex equipment. Overall not a bad company to work for."
good,Kroger is an OK company to work for in the mean time but there are better jobs in retail to work for. to move up in Kroger can be very hard and even if you work there for 10 years plus does not guarantee you the chance to move up any positions.
good,have some really great coworkers. managers need to work on the communication with there employs.
good,Very much is expected of the employees with little acknowledgement.
good,"A typical day can be very stressful with trays, salads and prep work. It's the same job every day but always a different environment. I have learned how to react in a difficult situations and how to do my job in a timely manner. The management is very well, always concerned and always willing to work things out. My co-workers can be a pain in the  butt sometimes to be completely honest only because it is all different kinds of people. Still, with our differences we still manage to get past our problems and move on and get our job done. The hardest part of the job is probably the trays. Getting trays done before certain times can be quite stressful because you also have to keep helping the counter and helping your co-workers. What I enjoy most about my job is the customers. Interacting with customers and making sure they leave happy makes me happy. I want people to have as great as an experience as I would like. I like to go above and beyond for customers so they want to come back and keep coming back."
good,"Co-workers were very good friends always have your back, but regional manager was worst person i ever met."
good,Stocking groceries and dairy products. Learned how to deal with different type of people. Managment was fine nothing spectacular. Didnt really associate with co-workers. Hardest part was the different schedule from week to week. Best part was dealing with customers.
good,the coworkers was nice and self centered and steady had a great time at work everyday the hardest part of my job was when the customers wanted a spefic item that we dont carry then have to deal with the attutidudes and explict lang. most enjoyed part at the work place you meet new and very nice people.
good,Great job. I had moments where I hated it.Though I have to say I'm sorry I left.
good,I've worked for the company for five years and when I transferred from one store to another when I went away for school they cut my pay by a dollar and I was getting paid less than what I was getting paid three years ago.  When I turned to the union for help to get my pay back they did nothing.  I was never so happy to quit a job.  I never look forward to working there again.
good,A typical day was come in get ready for your customers. Make sure you had a pin and your registar and other materials to get you through the day. My co-workers were very nice and funny.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of bagging the customer's groceries and sometimes helping them out to their car with them. It also consisted of pushing in the grocery carts. Sometimes I would have to be put on a register for my shift because a cashier called in sick and it was easier to replace a bagger than a cashier."
good,"*checking out the new products"
good,"I am currently employed by the Kroger co., and it is a great place to be part of a team. I thoroughly enjoy serving customers and providing quality products quickly and efficiently. My co-workers are all unique and we share a common bond. There are quite a few tasks that we perform everyday that can be challenging, but at the end of our shift we always feel proud of our accomplishments of the day."
good,The managers need to have a class just for managing skills. I love working for KROGER COMPANY the problem I have are that you have people that Kroger chooses to run their stores don't have good management skills.
good,"packing bakery,management was ok, co-workers ok,the job was not hard-it was enjoyable"
good,"work here in high school balanced out well"
good,"I loved the people I worked with and the job. I stocked all day in produce, except when the front end needed back-up cashier during its busy time. I also helped out in floral when needed by blowing up balloons, etc."
good,My job was to bag the customers things and get charts in a timely manner. display a nice and uplifting place to come shop. 
good,I loved this position. I was allowed space to complete my tasks with minimal supervision. I would have liked the company much more if they were more understanding of people with young children and their needs.
good,"You meet nice people on a daily basis. Co-workers were friendly as well. Typical days in there can really take a toll on you from all the people you see a day, but in the end it was worth it. Hardest part of the job was gathering all of the carts in the parking lot and putting them back in stock. The most enjoyable part of my job was that you met people that made your day."
good,"A typical day at work would be hectic , because your all over the place , if your not at the the cashier , you our working the floor somewhere or either stocking foods . Co-workers were easy to get along with . The hardest part was stocking , because you have to make sure everything is in the right place . I love having breaks ."
good,Work was work. Not back breaking but decent. Loading and unloading trucks then breaking down trucks that were just unloaded. Co-workers were good but the hardest part of the job was staying warm. You were in a refrigerator the entire time unless if you were in the freezer. What i liked most were the warm days outside after a days work.
good,loved everything about the job;but would change only one thing management !!!!
good,I have worked with Kroger since September of last year. I was fired from there without a warning or anything. I believe my termination was unjust.
good,"Very easy job to fit into, onced trained and have been assigned to a specific area, the job is quite easy...a lot of customer interaction which will help with future endeavors."
good,"A company that actually trains you. Pay is poor. Management is sketchy, supposed to union.."
good,The atmosphere was okay besides the many many rude co-workers but the job itself felt almost slave like due to how hard it was and so little pay.
good,Kroger offered me a great place to learn the right work ethic early in life as a young adult.
good,This job is good for teenagers that are in high school and college until you are further in your major.
good,Krogers was also a great experience for me. i had alot of fun working there and enteracting with the customers but it just isnt the medial fied and thats where my heart is. but overall it was Great!
good,"I loved my job an everything about it,till the lady fired me for cutting my finger. She will say that not why,but thats the only reson she had."
good,Working for them was definetly a learning experience given that certain managers are not the easiest to work for. Others are great to work for.
good,A typical day in the dli was hetic. Fast paced alot of cleaning and customers that demanded things that we couldn't do. I learned how to use a slicer to clean it take it apart and more. The hardest part of my job was cleaning.
good,You have an eight hour shift to get about ten hours of work done.
good,"Go to work and do your job, enjoy your customers"
good,Typical day at work- Exciting
good,it was a very enjoyable inviorment to work in . The customers were very friendly . They have a tendency to go throgh alot of managers in a short amount of tine. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co.workers they always gave one hundred percent to get the job done and with a great attitude
good,Nice place to work for I just live to far from the store my co worker are great and my supv. is great
good,"The work was good and there were a lot of employee's there younger than me that goofed off a lot and I did not like that much, I was only part-time with no offer for more hours, and that also played a big part in making a decision to move to my friends and take care of him, He had no one to help and he was disabled. So I moved on. Kroger's needed someone that would manage the store, But instead the manager was buds with the kids--Not professional in my opinion"
good,It's a good place to work if your a part time employee in high school.
good,I like the people I work there with. Very easy going environment. The only thing I wish for is that I got a better pay rate and more benefits.
good,"A typical day at Kroger is a very busy day. A lot of customers are in and out o a daily basis. It's my responsibility to provide outstanding customer service and to get the customers out in a timely matter. I absolutely have the best co-workers. They are very nice, caring and helpful associates. Management is very nice and runs the store on a outstanding professional level. I would have to say the hardest part of my job is trying to please every customer when most of them are nothing but rude to you. I have honestly learned to have more patience since I've been assisting the public.I really enjoy my job because I have a passion for helping and caring for others. At the end of my day, knowing that I have gone over and beyond for a customer to make their day; really brings a smile upon my face."
good,"Kroger was a fun fast pace work place. Although managment had its faults, I still had fun. If the pay was better I feel I would have stayed longer"
good,"Good place to work. Usually good atmosphere, better management before but you cant have it all.  How much more do I have to write, this is dumb that I"
good,Working here isn't the worst nor is it the best. the other employees are okay to work with but sometimes you will be the only Clerk on shift. Other than that it's a pretty nice place to work at.
good,i enjoy working there most of the time. i can speak with my front end manager and he will bend my hours to how i want them most of the time. flexible if your in school
good,A typical day at Kroger as a cashier would look like making customers leave the store HAPPY. greet every customer. staying on task. scanning and weighing items. receiving payment from customers.
good,"They have it set up to where you hit a certain amount of money then you get a small raise every year there after. I feel they are more interested in the higher up people then the ones who actually work with the public. "
good,Able to communicate with the public and community and express myself while completing task at hand while helping the company succeed in the goals of the company.
good,Good pay for the work you do. This department can be a bit stressful but it can be fun if you have the right coworkers around you and time will fly for sure. Definitely a good job if you like to be on your feet or kill time.
good,"It has been a fun, yet fast paced and somewhat stressful place to work.  Good Floor Managers help me overcome occasional customer service issues. "
good,"Middle management positions are overworked and underpaid. They ""Talk"" about work/life balance, however their actions are opposite of what they say.They have let go of most everyone in the corporate office that had decent salaries and replaced with younger, cheaper executives and doubled their normal workload. Store Managers are expected to work 60+ hours and manage a bare bones staff and budget."
good,"A basic day here would be checking people out threw out the day, answering questions that someone may have. "
good,I learned a lot working in this job which includes safety for the most part. Safety is a big thing when working at a warehouse cause you expect the unexpected at anytime which is being injured that we try to avoid at all times.
good,"working at kroger was pretty great job i had a lot of great experiences there, i learned a lot about the grocery industry and felt like a family with the other employees and management."
good,"loved working there wish I could back, was surrounded by nice, hard-working people all the time. Days went by pretty fast because of how much fun I would have."
good,Kroger does care for its employees but also ask very much. they do channel to be better and do better for a better results and for the customers and its employees.
good,It was an adequate occupation to be employed at. It paid nicely and the managers did what they could to help most of the time. Would recommend to anyone getting a job for the first time.
good,I enjoyed working at Kroger warehouse. It was fast paced and a overall great job! I enjoyed the people I worked with and around. I was able to learn new things  and carry them with me to my next job.
good,"Working as a ClickList Attendent was pretty good summer work for me in between college semesters. I got plenty of hours, and the all the people at my location were nice. Lots of walking."
good,"Kroger makes for a great 1st job or the secondary of 2 jobs. Pay isn't great unless you spend decades with the company, but the benefits are decent quality and cheaper than other employers offer. Schedule flexibility is amazing- need a day off? Just ask the scheduling manager and add a request into the system. Almost guaranteed. For students studying out of town, school leave is a lifesaver; let your manager know when school breaks are and you'll be guaranteed hours while in town. And the option of joining the Union in case of discrimination or managerial abuse is reassuring. "
good,They care about people who don't deserve the position they are in when other work out perform them. They is limited advancement at the store I work at can't speak for others.
good,"They will work with you as far school schedule, church, child care issues. But, if you want hours you need to leave your availability open. My schedual had no continuity"
good,"At work I would count pills, help customers, and also release the patient medicines. Overall it was a good experience seeing the medical field and learning about it ."
good,"If you want a job where you will always be busy, & there's always room to advance, a grocery chain is the way to go. If you are willing to travel, you can move up quickly. Training was eh, but you learn to catch on fairy quickly."
good,I like the people i worked with they help me do the best i can. The job itself was more than the paygrade. 9 dollars an hours not bad for part-time but the way the managers changed almost every other month made it hard to understand what they actualy wanted yo be done and how.
good,I've been there 3 years so far but it's pretty ok. Management got less good but other than that I like it. There are great people and the customers for the most part are also great.
good,Great managers. Great customers. Fast paced work environment. Hard physical labor. Happy people working together as a team. I liked it there. Good part-time job.
good,"U enjoyed working at Kroger's for 18 years but the last two were miserable. The new manager and I bumped heads and made it hard to want to work alit of us were not happy. But the employees, customers and other managers made it a pleasant place to work."
good,"Counting medications, releasing medications to customers, calling and faxing insurance companies about medication claims, and keeping up with inventory."
good,Nice atmosphere. Stores are always very clean and the employees are always nice and helpful. Products are always available and stocked in a very presentable way.
good,Good people decent service. Advancement opportunities. Fair pay fair benefits paid weekly. Decent hours fast paced environment. Relocation options....
good,"You work a lot at Kroger, for over 2 I’ve worked in many different departments. I don’t see myself progressing any further then I am in the company. I wish there were more opportunities to get management within the company"
good,I gave Kroger 5 stars because it's a Great environment to be in. Team work is definitely why I rate them so high. They care about the customers needs and I love that!
good,I like how we got paid every week instead of bi week and the company was really friendly and gave the employees great discounts and benefits as well..
good,"The job wasn’t hard at all, I just had to keep a good face and a positive attitude towards the costumers to make sure they had a good visit and to make sure they will return."
good,Kroger was a well paying high school job. It has given me any tools such as talking to customers and communication with co-workers. Management was great.
good,"Management is not held accountable for anything it seems. Associates are the best part of the job. I don't know how the people work in the stores, the stress level there is really high.  I did repair work and work was great till they started micro managing everything, then it was almost unbearable and very difficult to complete. The work/life balance here is what will keep you at the job and suck up the other stuff they do."
good,"Very Stressful but sometime it’s fun. All of my Associates were fun and easy to work with. All the work is very easy if you learn it right. I go in Clock in and go to Customer Service Desk and starting taking people in line. Some want to send money, Recieve Money and Pay Bills."
good,Very good people. Nice atmosphere. Kept with something to do always. Only get a little downtime. Sometimes not really flexible with schedules. Expect rude customers.
good,"Working in a verity of departments to support the product for the customer to see , that they change with the seasons, making it a fun place to work always something different"
good,Just like any local stores what always matters is your clients to help them as much as possible and to make them satisfy and smiling with there purchases
good,"Working at Kroger’s as a overnight stocker was very challenging in fun , I’ve learned a lot about Kroger’s in also it helped me move faster in work well under pressure"
good,"Kroger is a fulfilling job, with great people to deal with everyday because so many people have to buy food. You have your regulars and then new faces. It is such a positive enviorment."
good,Working in the Kroger environment can be competitive. It’s can be fast paced at times. Especially when your a courtesy clerk. I loved working there It was a very fun job
good,"I enjoyed the contact with the customers. The biggest downfall was communication with management. The clicklist department was treated like the stepchild, as if we were a small entity within the store."
good,It was my first job in high school it taught me responsibility and money management skills and character and it help shape my customers service skills
good,"Typical day includes store conditions, ensuring freshness, checking the staffing, checking email, conference calls, assessing the current climate of the store, problem solving"
good,Kroger has helped me develop and grow in a thriving business atmosphere and given me the tools that I need to succeed in any job atmosphere. There is no challenge that is to big.
good,"Good company to work for, but pay is below average. Management at the time didn't care about training.  Techs will bypass safety switches and looking for a breaker was like looking for gold."
good,I wish i would have stayed I actually enjoyed working there and wish i could go back but the managers werent that good and they didnt treat there employees that great
good,Working there was a good experience. I got to learn new things everyday and I met new people. Everyone was chilled and laid back. Bagging customers groceries was not bad. I mean there were some customers who were a little mad about how every item wanted to be bagged but I didn't hesitate about it.
good,"A typical day at work consists of greeting incoming customers, checking out and bagging items, and helping out around the store. The hardest part of the job is when it gets extremely busy and the lines are long, however the most enjoyable part is creating relationships with some customers as well as coworkers ."
good,"The job is not overly difficult.  However, the expectation that you do not leave till the store is opening ready is absurd. In recent months there have been more reports, audits and job tasked added to all roles and aspects of the business causeing your scheduled 10 hour day to now be 12 hours. There is little work life balance as you will spend more time in the store than all the other associates. Due to intentional understaffing there is no one to call in. So paid time off and paid sick days will go unused."
good,"Very inclusive and diverse place to work. However, wages are a little behind with the times and can make for a paycheck to paycheck life while other major corporations are offering higher wages adapting to the economy."
good,"It was alright while I was there, I didn't stay long due to an unexpected family emergency. However, I was there long enough to know the other employees and managers are very kind and want nothing more than to do their best and assist everyone with whatever they need."
good,There are some good days and bad days working at Kroger. Sometimes they need you to work 3 jobs cause people call out but I guess that's everywhere. It's not a bad place to work but it's very stressful at times.
good,I learned a lot during my time working with Kroger. I worked with a ton of awesome people and learned so much about marketing and management. I would recommend this company.
good,Good place to shop. Nice people to work with. Bag groceries and push carts in the sun rain snow. Not many hours. Low pay. But weekly pay. Lots of people.
good,The rest area was pretty nice to sleep in and it also had a t.v. that ran NBA games so that was pretty cool. I didn't like how they had incorrectly put in my banking information which caused 2 of my checks to get lost only to turn up one month later that I helped find with the help of my bank and Kroger's was of no help.
good,lot of work to do with not enough help. employees are friendly but managers are somewhat inexperienced. overall good place to work and offers room for advancement.
good,"Not much to review, assisted customers learned how to do inventory and stock shelves find expired things and replace them. The hardest part of the job was helping customers that didn't seem to understand how the world works. The most enjoyable part was the coworkers and becoming friends with everyone that worked there."
good,"Being employed at a grocery or general store allows you to get to know the various, and oftentimes, wonderful people in and around your community area."
good,Hours may vary from week to week which can become stressful when trying to maintain a home. things change on the daily. Friendly and caring staff and well as some store leaders. Great customer experiences.   With an added bonus of employee discounts
good,"Kroger's is family friendly and understand when our if your need time off. I enjoy working at Kroger's I feel like management could show more concern within each department. They thrive on little waste I see the complete opposite. "
good,Unless you're a teen or retired and just want to work this job does not cater to you. The management is over worked and underpaid. The associates are very antisocial.
good,"Worked there in high school to gain experience, absolutely awful pay. Management is a joke in every way possible, almost made me choose a business major because I hated them so much and wanted better for others. Constant drama, worked with schedule sometimes but often ignored requests hoping you’d go along with it. Training was almost nonexistent."
good,"It is hard work working at Kroger, both physical and mental.  There is a lot of turn-around because it can be very demanding.  I enjoy working there for the most part because I like helping, I like having the relationships with customers and employees.  They do offer some health insurance for part time and that helps as well.  It does get exhausting at times.  I do like that I can usually get my 10,000+ steps in when working!"
good,"Kroger was one of the first jobs I ever had. It is a good work environment and you learn some really valuable lessons while working here. They are also very accommodating with schedules, which was very important for me as a college student."
good,Wasnt a hard job to do. As long as you were on time and finished all your work management didn't bother you. I had good discounts for Kirger brand stuff and Starbucks.
good,"The work wasn't particularly difficult, Just rather repetitive as most retail jobs are. Coworkers and routine customers are going to decide if your time here is going to be pleasant or not, so just keep that in mind."
good,"I had job security, I but only made minimum wage for 25 yrs. The overall benefits Vacation, Holiday pay were good. Employee recognition for a job well done was good."
good,it was a job like any other job in customer service. you have rude people and nice people. better hours need 2 break people on time better oganization
good,"Everyone there is very helpful and nice. Whatever you need, they are there. A typical day at work is busy. I learned how to do product dispensing as well as help customers in one day. The hardest part is wanting to complete a task, but you can't because its super busy."
good,Many stress full times. When it gets crowded everybody in management is on you but. They should increase the employee discount more and we should get paid more for what we do.
good,I really enjoyed working for the company and the people that i worked with the only issue i honestly had working for them. Was that the hours are inconsistant.
good,When I would go into work they would have me do different things they wouldn't have me in the same place I would learn different things about the job. what I liked about this job was that they would put me in different places in the store to make sure that I know the store like they do and I don't then they'll help me.
good,Retail environment very fast paced.  Reactive company. Productivity is a strong motivator at Kroger.   This is very much a task based work environment.
good,"I really enjoyed working at the Kroger Pharmacy Central Fill Center. I get bored easily, so the fast-paced environment was great for me. Some of the job duties require a substantial amount of physical labor, while others are more laid back, however extremely repetitive. You must be able to stand/walk/bend/lift during your entire shift, so comfortable shoes are a must! Some of the supervisors play ""favorites"", and there are a few silly ""clicks"" like you're in high school, but the hours are great and easy to work around home life. They are very strict about attendance so calling off often will get you fired for sure."
good,Great job for high school. Got me through freshman and sophomore year. They gave me a lot of hours with minimum wage. Good management and a lot of job opportunities within their company.
good,"Sometimes necessary to pick up the slack of other workers"
good,"I bagged groceries and carried out groceries for customers,  also collected carts and sometimes stocked shelves. Assisted customers with funding things in store."
good,I enjoyed interacting with the customers and being able to help. The Bistro area was slower paced than the front end which was nice but I kept being paired with with an employee who who spent every spare moment on his phone so I ended up doing my job and most of his. In Indiana one has to show ID for an alcohol purchase whether 18 or 80 years old. A cashier can be fired for not checking a customers ID.  On one occasion an older woman wanted to purchase wine but did not have ID on her so I called my manager because she was a regular customer. He told me it was ok to sell but I told him unless he wanted to pay my rent when I got fired he needed to come down and do the sale himself.  He did.
good,Good first job to have. Easy to apply. Friendly co workers. Friendly customers. Lots of opportunity to move up in the company and improve your work and life skills.
good,"Working at Kroger was ok, one of the mangers was a bit much and tried to tell me to come in while sick once. The other managers where ok but they do under staff and expect one person to do a lot of work by them self."
good,"Kroger is a good company to work for and be a part of. Associates are generally very friendly, and work requires teamwork. Working with Kroger also means becoming a part of another family."
good,"The work is super easy and it’s bit hard to moving departments. Also, the hours are super flexible!! Great for a student or to even be a second part time job!"
good,it's so ggod my first day at kroger the people are so good and friendly .i like to work over there i work 40hours a week thay give realluy grear hours ..
good,"A typical day in the deli is slicing meat and cheese for customers. Helping customers to decide what product there looking for. Taking orders for future pick up of fried/baked chicken, fruit and cheese trays, and sandwich trays"
good,"Kroger allowed me to start my pharmacy career. I enjoyed working for this company that allowed me to have great benefits, while working with great people and offered a good atmosphere."
good,"Kroger is a good company to work for managed well recieved decent hours and good pay, benefits were available after probationary period and about a year of working there overall good job to have."
good,Everything was great with working here however pay was very low for the work you do. Starting the job you automatically work nights as well. Not convenient for single mothers with kids in school.
good,You have good days and bad days like in any typical job. And their are times that you have so much fun the time passes by fast. Their is always something to do each and everyday.
good,"Able to grow with the company and get promoted quickly if you put the time and hard work in. Schedules are based on senority base, so longer you are there, the better shifts you will be able to work in."
good,loved working dairy department I had fun and enjoyed it. I unloaded trucks took care of salvage truck and stocked product. lot of good people it's like a family
good,They had lots of people there who helps out a lot and cleabs but sometimes the kids do a little too much   Im need more pay and better people to be around
good,"Kroger is a great place to begin one's working adventure.  It is a place where you can learn how to work, and it is a place where you can work your entire career.  On the negative side, a store's organizational structure is very flat and it is hard to move up."
good,The job was easy and not very interesting. Same things had to be done every day. Some people working there were lazy and unproductive. Fruits and vegetables were great!
good,"When I first started, I was just learning the ropes. It got easier as time went on. But it does have stressfull moments. I just wish we got paid better."
good,"I enjoyed my time here. I wish my location was more competitive with pay. It was a good place to work, the managers were friendly. I would recommend this job to a friend"
good,I like working there but I did not like how co-workers were punished for the actions of others. I did not see that as fair or just. I felt disrespect but other than that the coworkers are very nice.
good,Working for krogers was very stressful. The amount of labor to put trucks up and away can take a toll on your body that mangement never took into consideration. The amount of cases per hour was ridiculous as well. Not everyone works the same.
good,Good I didn’t have no trouble got along with all employees love my job.would love a customer service job. Working is what I love to do and cleaning is my specialty
good,I enjoyed y experience working here. was a great job to have during school and gave me ample opportunity with soccer and other after school activities. Would recommend to others
good,"Kroger is a customer friendly store. Management and co-workers were friendly and helpful.  Training was fun and informational. i valued being cross trained at the store, in order to be more employable."
good,"The Kroger Co. of Michigan is a fast-paced job that keeps you on your toes. Every day is different which makes it fun to come to work each and every day. The culture is family oriented, and i've had the privilege to work with some of the most amazing people."
good,"I loved my job at Kroger but they cut my hours very short and I wasn’t the only one, I wasn’t making enough money to pay the things I needed to pay so I had to find something else"
good,"Great for working full time after school to save up some extra money, great learning experience, and great coworkers. The training wasnt really there but otherwise a great opportunity."
good,I enjoyed working at Kroger. I loved putting smiles on peoples faces and I love to help people. I believe Kroger is a great place to work and it builds character. And whilst with co-workers I enjoyed being around there was never a dull moment.
good,It is ok just to get a start of a feel of working but if u want to have more benefits then go somewhere else that is more stable and maintained work and still have a outside life then just being at work
good,Kroger was a great place to work the employees were all so friendly and the job wasn’t to challenging. Management was strict but not unreasonable so as long as you getting your job done you will be fine
good,"Did not like the fact that my first day of working at Kroger, the manager of the department as well as the assistant manager were both off that day.  I barely made it through the day without them.  Not enough people on the floor to help."
good,"I bagged groceries and did various other tasks to upkeep the store, such as maintaining the bottle machines, cleaning up spills, and various other tasks."
good,"Learned to multi task. "
good,Not all Kroger Food for Less's are owned by a corporation. This one is privately owned. SLO county is all owned by the same company. Look in to them!!!
good,"it was a hard job but I enjoyed doing it, the people that I worked with , helped make the job more enjoyable,the hardest part of the job was lazy co workers at times and rude costumers"
good,not much down time while working when it got slow i would go out and collect the shopping carts from outside and place them back so its easy to grab for customers
good,"Department managers let a lot of things fly that aren't professional, coworkers do whatever they please in some cases with no discipline taken on such actions. Assistant and store managers are very good to work with and generally very genuinely caring about their employees"
good,"I was a cashier and this was my second Job. "
good,Decent job for first time workers and students. Eventually gets rough due to overstaffing and lots of people not being scheduled. High turn over rate. If people call out or quit fast others are forced to clean up the mess.
good,"A typical day at work had an overall steady pace with a few periods of business ""rushes"". Other workers seemed constantly under stress; however, the company did provide free food and drinks on occasion to boost morale."
good,"Kroger is a demanding place to work because you have so much interaction with customers, so it helps to know that you will be face to face with shoppers all day."
good,"If you are looking for your first job it’s a great company to get started at. However, you must be willing to work because theirs a lot of customers. Their workers are almost always productive and the managers as well."
good,"Kroger is a very fun place to work.  While working at Kroger, I didn't feel stressed out or pressed for time.  I enjoyed meeting new people and talking to customers on a daily basis.  I always enjoyed providing excellent customer service."
good,"Kroger is a good place to work, but can be stressful around holidays when the store is busy.  I think managers are highly stressed and take it out on employees sometimes. Overall it was not a bad place to work and would recommend it to others."
good,"My typical day starts at 7am. Hiring candidates can be very difficult, being a soundboard for employees that need to vent. I really enjoy working in the Human Resource/ management team."
good,Very nice place to work with nice pay. You also meet alot of nice customers. Great store when they have the right management team on hand. Great benefits. Would recommend worked there for 10 years.
good,a day here would make the day go place it was one of them jobs were you would like to spend most of your time at and wouldent really get tired of working there and being a part if the team.
good,The overall workplace is a fun place to work. Lots of people to talk to and generally pleasent customers. Management tries their best but can only do so much to schedule people
good,"Could be better on starting pay, they could offer less costly benefits! As far as insurance for their employees! Also better communication! Could also be a friendly environment for employees"
good,Always new things happening in the store. Nothing stay the same. Everyday is a new day. Employees make it worth wild. Great starter job for anyone new I'm the work force.
good,"I wasn’t paid much but I was going to college at the time. I learned how to manage an area by myself for extended periods of time and when a problem arose, I came up with a solution."
good,"Cashiering provides a lot of customer contact, which is usually enjoyable."
good,"This was my first job, so I gained a lot of experience and learned a lot about how things work in grocery/retail. The managers were okay and my coworkers were decent for the most part."
good,"I Love working here , it’s a good place to work . The wages are great they have flexible work hours and management makes you feel comfortable and that’s important to me."
good,"Kroger wasn't a bad place to work, I enjoyed the work, the job, most of my coworkers. With any place, there are pros and cons. Most of the management was excellent. Krogers was never a forever job for me and I probably stayed longer then I should have. But I will take what I learned and apply it to my next job and to my life."
good,Days could be long dealing with insurance issues and stubborn and rude customers but getting through the day was not hard with the staff I was working with.
good,"The overall job was nice.  My issue was time requested off.  I submitted it, but was taken off the schedule because the scheduling manager said they didn't receive it.  I tried speaking to him and the store manager to settle the disagreement, but to no avail.  I truly wanted to work and that was misunderstood.  Even though the hiring manager knew that I was in school and playing soccer."
good,"A typical day at Kroger is serving people, entering people and medications in the system and filling and counting medications.  There is nothing hard about the job.  I enjoy working with people."
good,"When your not part time worker, its almost impossible to become full time , because they dont give you the hrs you need to become full time, which stops you from great benefits, time and half and much more"
good,"I enjoyed my job at Kroger; however, there were times when I was expected to perform duties for which I was not trained.  I did not receive adequate payment for my services.  There were requirements that I made before obtaining the job, such as time limits on school nights that were not always adhered to, resulting in a later night than I previously requested."
good,this is really a decent job to get on your feet and have money every week the only thing I dislike about this job is different Krogers are different and ran a little different then the others for example if you are on the good side of town they make sure everything is ran differently and smooth unlike verses the rough side of town that is basically in the ghetto a lot more things slide in that area. Other than that this is a really good thing for young workers or anyone looking for easy simple money weekly.
good,It is a fun place to work. The culture there is very fast paced but if you enjoy constant moving then its for you. Management does play favorites and it is very obvious but you do get as many hours as you need.
good,"I applied for work as a Kroger Clicklist associate and was often asked to support the Produce Department.  I enjoyed working as a personal shopper through Clicklist, and only wish Kroger paid better and offered more hours."
good,The company overall was a great company to work for. However the assistant manger in the pharmacy was rude to certain customers and employees. Over all it was a great experience.
good,"The produce is fresh and i love it ! The meat & seafood could be better. The grocery department changes so much i can't remember where anything is. Other than that, it's wonderful!"
good,Coworkers are great. Sometimes management can be troublesome but thats everywhere i guess. Customers vary between great and friendly to always angry. It can be stressful or relaxed depending on where and when you work.
good,With a good leader and team this job can be a lot of fun. It also can be stressful trying to make different goals every month. You can learn a lot from each other by watching coworkers interactions with customers.
good,"Initially hired for the ClickList program. Training sucked because the program was so new. Supervisor was not flexible about hours you could work and management was no help. Moved over to grocery clerk in the dairy and frozen foods department. Aside from freezing to death in those departments, you better be physically fit to move stock off the trucks and restock the floor."
good,"Easy to rank up"
good,"We were able to get things done and it was nice to see regulars that brightened up my day, but sometimes it was disorganized, which made it more stressful on me and other employees. It was a great experience and everyone should experience working at Kroger or another grocery store."
good,"the union makes the experience bearable, but it was by no means enjoyable or competently run. The pay and benefits were nice, and the environment didn't make me want to off myself."
good,"No typical day in the pharmacy. Always busy, but good coworkers and managers.  No guarantee of full-time, hours change with the time of year and busyness."
good,"Pay vary compensates for how physical  the job is, and if you willing to wait more than 5-10 years to get to drive a forklift which your back will thank you in the long run I suggest looking somewhere else. 8hr days usually working weekends so good luck with life balance. And it’s suppose to be a union lol pretty bad in my opinion"
good,Great for first time job. Overnight gets the most hours! Management is understanding & willing to help you get as many hours as you can especially in the overnight position.
good,Employees usually work well with each other. Common goal is to satisfy the customers. Everyone strives to solve problems and meet daily goals such as cleanliness.
good,Working the night shift and stocking shelves was challenging to get the work done before the store opened the next morning. Rewarding when the job was completed on time
good,"Decent place to work for a first time part time job. The customers are friendly and interact well with fellow employees. The management is decent, with a little micromanaging to keep the store in compliance with Kroger's standards."
good,When you come in to work there’s always something to do so you’ll never be bored and we also get to meet interesting people and I get to work with a great team
good,"The work environment is one where the pace can change in thirty minutes. Can be slow and relaxed, then turn into chaos in an instant. The people are usually great and socially the community is a great asset."
good,"The managers are great!!! BUT, the employees and trainers need some enthusiasm and friendliness. Bad experience with the employees, as they are not as friendly or fair as the managers."
good,Nice people caring management and everything was well taken care of helped the customers if needed and always had each other’s backs when times got rough
good,"Very fast paced, customer oriented business.  I liked dealing with  varieties of customers and gaining new skills.  The community depends on this market and there were many regulars."
good,"I would have to wait on the loading dock for the grocery trucks to come in prior to stocking at night, Than sort the load in order to organize the distribution of the groceries goes to which aisle."
good,Good place to work I guess. You don't get guaranteed 40 hours until you've been there for a year. Cashiers upfront don't get long enough breaks. Head manager up front sucks too. You must have open availability and they rarely try to work around your schedule. So if you're a college student or have other jobs I wouldn't apply.
good,"I learned a lot about how the store runs, but had very limited hours and cut them back to keep from paying insurance which hurt employees badly.  If people could get full hours and benefits the employees would be much happier and stay with the company.  And if one upper management person  didn't like your ways, you were frozen from advancement even if most all other management respected you."
good,"Very busy, best of like the mom and pop stores, everyone pretty much knows where all of their grocery needs are, meet people haven't seen, great people to work with"
good,"Considering that this was one of my first jobs outside of home I had no idea what I was doing but I got the hang of it. A typical day at work would be bagging groceries, cleaning up at my stations and helping customers to their cars."
good,It is a great place to work and so long as you work hard and mind your own business you will really enjoy working here. They  like to rotate out managers frequently so it makes it harder to know what is expected when sections management changes. Overall it's a great company to work for.
good,"Low pay horrible managers, alots of pressure for under minimum wage pay. some of the supervisors were nice but majority were disrespectful. Kroger is a temporary job for kids in high school."
good,"i didn't get many hours and couldn't pay my bills.My pay the second time working there was less than the first ,, Silly .People were nice but not enough hours to live."
good,"It was a good place to work. The job was a bit slow at times but could pick up to  a fast pace. It was repetitive and at times could be boring, but good overall."
good,Good job culture and team work. Advancement is slow and pay raises are not given after an employee has topped out. Benefits are great for employees. Work is fast paced.
good,Fast paced job for people who actually want to work. Very physical and demanding. Advancement opportunities are an option for people that want to move up within the company.
good,We would come in and clock in first of course. You had to be in to assigned area to warm up and get task for the day. you get two twenty minute breaks.
good,"Working in the pharmacy, I found it to be very tight-knit and everyone looks out for one another. We work hard to strive to be the best we can for our customers. Scheduling can be a bit of an issue, I would have hours cut one week with no explanation."
good,"Kroger was okay as a first job, however It was very stressful dealing with all of the rude customers. They are also not very accommodation towards minors or people with medical conditions."
good,It's an outstanding job for young teens looking for a starting job. It doesnt pay a lot but it isnt a very hard job at all. It's easy to like. Most of the people that work there are really relaxed and open minded so it isnt hard to fit in and get help if you need it. It's not discriminate against anyone.
good,"I like working there. It is a fun place to work, It is a pleasant place to work. Those in management are very kind. We can determine the hours that we are available to work every day."
good,"It was a very fast paced, high tempo job and position.  Manager work on average 50 hours a week minimum and for 5 days a week.  The scheduling is tough when you have to close to store, then open the store up the next day"
good,It is a grocery store. It is a good experience in learning how to deal with the public. Store management is hit and miss. Every store is different in that regard. The best part about the job is meeting different people within the community.
good,"Had this job as a second job. It was pretty easy comparatively, but some of the tasks we were made to do weren't really worth the money being paid. Getting the carts from the parking lot during snow storms and rain storms is worth a little more than just minimum wage. Especially because I was promoted to cashier and made over $9 to stand in place and scan items for 8 hours."
good,I was customer service manager.  I dealt with the front end and the customers who had issues that needed attention. I was in charge of counting money at the end of the evening shifts.
good,"It takes somebody who is very good at not only customer service, but also being able to put themselves in others shoes, and choose a valid substitution if it is allowed. I excelled at this job, much like a I most others, but this one really hurt my back a lot. Then I just couldn't make it to when my benefits kicked in."
good,It overall a good place to work. Has flexible hours. Easy training sessions. Management could be a little more friendly. Quick promotion opportunities.
good,"Good competitive place where you enjoy working and osts fair with good managers and co workers who are happy to help you , gives you sick days off and overall good place"
good,The hardest part of the job was dealing with management. They claim your safety is their priority during inclement weather but you will get disciplined for not making it in.
good,"It’s a good first job for a teenager. The people there are friendly. Everyone has their good and bad days but they still put on a smile, friendly, and caring"
good,I really enjoy working at Kroger but I feel management is unorganized sometimes. Many times clicklist workers are pulled from clicklist to help stock etc. but when clicklist needs help only salary managers are trained to give it.
good,"A typical day at Kroger tended to be either slow and then chaotic or fast and then chaotic. The key undertone to everything at Kroger was chaos. I can't say for sure if this is applicable to this day or to every Kroger location. Management turnover in our store was unprecedented and I feel that had a great deal to do with many of the issues experienced. Additionally, the presences of a Union in the store was a double edged sword. It was nice having the protection from abuses, but it caused productivity to come to a near halt at times."
good,Not the greatest but if you can handle the people you work with then go for it cause commitment at Kroger will get you a higher pay than other places.
good,good work place and management. Customer service could use some improvement on speaking to customers over the phone and most of all face to face. Food stock Excellent
good,You would come in get your apron on. I always looked at case and refresh. To make it look good and fresh for the customers. Retail store. Getting younger workers to help. Meeting customers with a smile.
good,"A job for anyone looking for a solid first job. From my personal experience I found it to be as challenging and rewarding as you yourself allowed it to be. There's always more work to be done in any given day so if you're looking to excel, there's always a chance."
good,Kroger's was a placed I loved to worked I went t work everyday knowing it will be a good day. I created bonds with multiple people while working there .I rarely had issue there the only issue I had was the pay & the hour they weren't consistent enough for me .
good,I worked at Smith/Kroger as a part-time cashier. I like interacting with customers and the friendly faces. The hardest part of the job is covering for others that don't come to work. This is a fast-paced job and required a lot of patience with rude customers.
good,"Kroger was a fun place to work with nice people and a good environment. I was fifteen when I worked there, and people treated me with respect and dignity even though I was so young."
good,I dont really have any good reviews besides the co-workers and the previous manager before the current one...                                                                         .
good,Food4less is a store based on optimal customer service. Each employee is charged with the task of greeting every customer with a smile and a helping attitude. This company also allows you to choose which department of the business you would like to move into.
good,"I can´t complain too much about the low pay at Kroger, given that bagging here was my first job at 16. Starting out, bagging for Kroger is an extremely easy job, there is little customer interaction, and you are basically just helping the cashiers out. You also have to fetch carts from the parking lot, and that was not fun at all. After 3 months, they promoted me to cashier. That was my goal from beginning, and I loved it at first. There is a lot of customer interaction, but my location was very busy.. It got very hectic."
good,"stores are getting fewer and fewer hours to keep things going. hardly ever have enough help, always long check out lanes, and some managers believe its their way or no way"
good,"The job is flexible when it comes to your schedule. The environment can be relaxed due to only working with a maximum of 4 people, but the job also keeps you busy"
good,I enjoyed working at Krogers.  The staff was helpful and very patient focused.  I learned a lot working at Krogers.  I hope every one has the same experience as me.
good,"worked as a cashier at Fred Meyers (a Kroger store) for a little over a year after I turned eighteen. Four months in I got trained to run self-check out and got a raise. However, managers are great as people but not so great scheduling. hours were inconsistent. I could work 12 hours one week and 30 the next , keep in mind i was a Part-time 12. So 12 hours was the minimum. They are however pretty flexible on scheduling. By that I mean working with your schedule if you're a student, like myself. They don't like it when you get a second job, and some PIC's tend to always be on a power trip. Overall I loved my cowokers and met many great people, learned a lot from people and my work. There isn't much space to grow in the company. But ultimately I left due to inconsistent hours and i was tired of dealing with creepy and consonantly cranky customers. Also disscounts we okay. 10% off Private brand foods, 15% off  home electronics, 10% off home department, 20% Apparel"
good,"Good work atmosphere."
good,"Everyday I'd come in and find out where i was supposed to be for the day.It was usually different a lot of the time because i was trained in many areas of work such as Cashier,baggier and bottle room."
good,"Kroger Pharmacy has its ups and downs. I did enjoy helping people, but it was so customer oriented and they can get really crazy. Narcotics really do bring out the crazy in people."
good,"A typical day at work consists of meeting and greeting customers, scanning items and bagging items, and answering questions about items. I learned to move in a fast paced environment. Management is alright, they expect too much from you sometimes. The hardest part of the job is not knowing what to do to be honest and dealing with hard customers. The best part of this job is meeting new people and creating friendships with them. Also becoming close with your coworkers. Wouldn’t leave this company unless they paid me a little more and we’re consistent with my hours."
good,"Helping with customers out to there car. Bagging groceries, cashing out orders. Helping customers at the self checkout aisle. Scanning Ids and grabbing cigarettes for people. Stocked items on shelves. Everything you do in a basic grocery store."
good,"day at work was fast paced"
good,The Kroger company is a great and fun place to work at if you work well with your associates and keep a fair pace and get your job done you can have an enjoyable workday
good,"great first job,  typical retail pharmacy.  data entry, count, label, dispense medication.  work with customers and INS companies.  participate in monthly INV"
good,"Typically slower-paced, but, meaningful work days. Extreme emphasis on customer service and satisfaction. Kroger makes each employee feel as if the company actually cares about the wellbeing of all its workers. Holidays can be difficult."
good,"A typical work day at Kroger is good the people are usually nice, but sometimes they can be a real pain. At Kroger i didn't really learn anything to be honest. The management was kind of bad, I had one manager that would just be mad at me every day for absolutely nothing."
good,There were constantly customers coming through lines (which I enjoyed) and there was often free food set up in the break room. They did have good benefits.
good,When I worked for Kroger pharmacy I generally liked the job but there was not enough help and the pay was way lower then that of the same position at other places.
good,"the weekends were our busiest days, weekdays were laid back sometimes depending on the season. my associates were very helpful. great environment to work in for my first real job."
good,While working the late shift I would train new employees. Most of the new hires were under 20 and really not interested in training properly. They felt the amount of hours and pay they received were not worthy of a job well done. I had to secretly agree but I felt that gave them no excuse to not try to do their job as this fell back on me.
good,I was not happy about the location but Kroger is a good company to work for. Good benefits. There is room to grow within the company.                        n/a
good,"I worked at Kroger while I was also a full-time college student, and they were really flexible every semester when my availability changed because my class schedule changed. That was great. Overall, it was not a bad work experience."
good,"Tightening retail environment due to external influences (see Amazon) lead to an environment that feels micromanaged with advancement opportunities only for the favorites or chosen few."
good,Overall I liked working at the Kroger Company.  My last manager was a pleasure to work with.  The down side of working at the last Kroger was inconsistent hours.  Kroger has a reputation of having employees with bad work habits and nothing is done about it from management.  The best thing about working at the Kroger Company is the fact that there is a union and the benefits.  The Smyrna Kroger provided a pleasant atmosphere to work in the Fuel Center.  The Cascade Kroger had employees that did not complete tasks and left work for the night shift employees which made more work for them. The department was ALWAYS understaffed and so much so that the customers would say that they were used to it and the inferior service due to it.
good,"I loved working for Starbucks inside of the Kroger store. I quickly established relationships with my coworkers during training and learned a lot about coffee as a barista. However, management intervening with how things should run with scheduling and overworking employees while we were extremely understaffed ruined it for me personally."
good,"Kroger was a good place to work, the pay was low but the work environment was good. The responsibilities of the deli span to both sides so it gives you a chance to become better antiquated with the kitchen."
good,".  In this role, I prepare and deliver online orders that exceed customer expectations.  I maintain and process orders through state-of-the-art systems and deliver high-quality products into customers’ cars quickly and efficiently.  I also troubleshoot and maintain e-Commerce equipment and ensure staging area is organized and clean."
good,"Overall, my experience with Kroger was breathtaking. I learned so much since I was 16, thanks to my Kroger family, co-workers, managers, and customers included."
good,"""Out of the frying pan..."" Employment here is not for the faint of heart. As a new hire, you are practically thrust into learning everything as you go. As one who started from the ground level, bagger and cart pusher, and has worked their way upwards, it's been a struggle, but I've hung in there. However, as I've gained the experience and the knowledge and have landed a better position, this experience has not come with a sufficient raise in pay."
good,"I had a great time working at Kroger. For the most part, the people were friendly and everybody got along pretty well. The work was easy and varied enough to stave off monotony. You would never run out of things to do if you knew where to look. This is not to say that you had to be doing something every second of every day. Management would occasionally throw a party for workers, usually around the end of a quarter, as well as having daily meetings so workers knew how the store was doing."
good,"Working at Kroger was ok, the hours were manageable, and the management, at that time, was good as well. They did not allow us to get much overtime, and their was limited to no acknowledgement of working professionally, but it was way better there than at Convergys."
good,kroger has an tendancy to work you alot of hours  especailly during holidays  and alot of times make you work 6 days a weeks averager 10 -12 hours a day
good,"A great place if you want a sense of community to grow with. Customers are always eager to talk and listen. Starting out, one may feel overwhelmed, but given time and dedication it can be an incredibly warm and rewarding place."
good,Frys was a great job. I worked there for 10 years. It gave me a lot of experience to my resume to help me find other work in the future and advance my skills.
good,"My supervisor and pharmacist were amazing to work with.  We all got along really well and the techs were great.   Although I am no longer in the store, we still get together, which shows how wonderful we all worked well and got along."
good,"Kroger, while a decent entry level job, has limited room for job advancement (especially for full-time employees). The job was fast paced and very strenuous with only limited benefits."
good,I am not able to answer this question. i have not worked there in over 2 years. Things might have changed from then to now. So i cant answer this. Sorry.
good,"This job is very fast paced and requires a lot of work. I would start the day off by coming in and preparing to get on the counter. I would wash my hands, put on an apron and hair net, and put on gloves. Then i would serve the customers. I learned that you have to have patience and always treat the customers nicely."
good,In general I enjoyed working for Kroger Pharmacy both part time and full time. I enjoyed the interaction with the customers and being able to help them any way I could.
good,It's not a bad place to work but benefits could be better. I required more hours and better pay so I had to leave for another job. It's a nice company overall to work for.
good,Working here has helped me learn a lot about customer satisfaction. This will easily transfer over into other careers when dealing with customer satisfaction.
good,Everything was good working here as long as you follow directions and pay attention to what is going on in the store. i learned how to communicate well with customers and how to work under pressure.
good,great workplace to start off if anyone is looking for there first job and also the flexible hours that they give you will work with your daily life and if need changes to it they will help you with that
good,"This is a very repetitive job its definitely a routine job clock in do what you did yesterday and clock out. Its nothing overwhelming it more so can get boring. Minimum wage and nothing exciting, very bland."
good,Most people were really nice and they pay well. Confusing workhours but nothing too crazy. But you really need to know your work schedule before you start
good,I love to cook and make salads and sandwiches. Great job for me. Management was nice but the only draw back for me was the lack of hours. I wanted full time.
good,Creating strategic direction and how to go to market with other lines of business to create consistency with the overall marketing direction. Including agency management.
good,As a cashier I enjoyed working with customers and the communications with the staff was well. It was a super diverse team which was fun to learn about the places that they have lived. In total working at Kroger was a memorable experience.
good,Everyday is an adventure  and I enjoyed it tremendously . The people are fun to work with and the training is encouraging .  The management teams are responsive to employees needs .
good,"Worked with nice people.  Okay schedule, fairly flexible.  Enjoyed the store atmosphere.  Easy to get dressed for work.  Discount on Roundys products."
good,"(3rd shift) high productivity shift."
good,i learned so much within the 6 years and met a ton of ppl as well. Kroger management was pretty much unfair. only reason i stayed was because of the customers and employees. we were a family and worked together to make the customers happy and better place for all of us.
good,Too many abuse having union to do minimal eff9rt leaving others to pick up the slack. Most managers cannot balance effective usage of workers usually leaving departments unattended due to moving all workers to help upfront.
good,"Kind management made working there a little bit more tolerable. Personally I loved my job because i got to meet a lot of people, and assist people when they needed it which is something i love doing."
good,They need to train new employees better and less time having them to sitting on a computer and looking at a screen for hours telling them how to do the job they was hired for. I had hands on training and it was more enjoyable getting to know where things go.
good,I appreciate them for hiring me. The manager was a little rude. But very professional. In fact I wish I still worked their.. I enjoyed the time I did work for Krogers. & The people I worked with.
good,"The management excepts a lot for minimum wage, they get nasty with you and there devious manager that will have you fulfill one role when supposed do another just to you get disciplined and the managers just smiles. You go the restroom on your break approved a manager, but not by the shift manager, they'll say you was jacking off in the restroom...a job or in public! WTF!"
good,"I like Kroger Pharmacy but just want more of a reliable schedule, more of a steady pay, and having reliable team mates. They have helped me advance as a technician, and I have some coworkers always willing to help me learn."
good,"There isn't much to say about Kroger, which is a strange weakness. The job doesn't go or stay anywhere interesting, and felt underwhelming yet tiring. I enjoyed the heavy lifting and interacting with customers, but working alone felt empty and tempted a sense of ""If you want it done right, do it yourself."""
good,"It's not a bad place, but it seems they do not promote from within or try the help better the employees that want to become more than just an hourly associate"
good,collected prescriptions filled prescriptions and rang customers up for their prescriptions stocked the medicines on shelves and anything else that was needed of me
good,"Kroger was a very nice place to work. I always felt very safe and secure while there. Managers and employees held a good relationships with open another. typical day at kroger meant filling prescriptions, interacting with patients, doctors, and nurses to bring about the best outcomes for kroger and its customers."
good,It was a fun place to work great people great opportunities  it was hard working night shifts dint really like it for the pay i enjoyed  the people i worked with just dint like the night the main genarator cought fire and they had me working in unsafe conditions  with flash lights and no power
good,Krogers is a decent place to work. Very convenient because pay is weekly. Relaxed environment. Always had different events at the store I worked at. Reasonable management.
good,the ask for to much and not paying good they do not have long breaks only 15 mins. or less. you have to wear what hey tell you to wear and thats not fun
good,"Very busy, very entertaining and fun job with associates, management is not rough as long as you do you job and take care of customers in a timely and respectful order. I, personally, have tried to learn as much as I can from Kroger and have quite an extensive knowledge of the the company and each department. Most enjoyable is being able to have fun with not only associates, but customers as well. I don't find the job hard or difficult at all, myself."
good,"I wouldn't really recommend this as a main job for anyone older than 20. Its easy to get stuck there, and it doesn't pay enough to be an adult job. You are always expendable."
good,flexible hours at a 24 - 7 hour location is nice. good pay and good benefits for full time staff. There is a union that you can join. Lots of break time.
good,"Very VERY micromanaging Store Manager. They were the worst part."
good,"A typical day at work differed. Some days were busy, while some where very slow. I learned a lot about customer service, and dealing with with negative attitudes. The hardest part of the job was dealing with negativity from workers and customers which was not that bad. The best part of the job was dealing with the elderly people, they brought so much joy to me during a hard work day!"
good,"Store Management was rotated fairly regularly.  Some managers are good, some bad.  When under good management, fairly pleasant to work.  Area Stores closed suddenly, with no warning, without a believable reason."
good,I had a really great time working for Kroger. It's a really good job if it's your first time working. Awesome staff to work with and a great way to meet new people everyday.
good,This is a good job for people to start with if they don't have alot of work experience with room to advance if your willing to put in the effort. I particularly enjoy working out side so it just wasn't the thing for me.
good,"Alot of stocking, cashiering. Help customers find what they are looking for. Which I had a radio, so that I could show customers where the item is."
good,kroger was a fun place to work to it wasn't stressful and if you had a problem  they would address it right away.  the pay was kinda good but they didn't give you any raises when it was tie for your shift to be over sometimes they wouldn't let you leave until the next person came in but for the most part you go home when it's time for you to go.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Kroger, because I was trained to make sure the customers found every item that they may have been in need of.  I was able to tailor the needs of each customers by using our CRM systems to help find their most common or most recently purchased item. We made things quick and efficient to give our customers a great shopping experience."
good,"alot of smiles happy faces and laughter with the customer, good location for union city store location--the hours for customers are very good- customers can shop during the quiet night hrs"
good,"if you are not doing something, you should be and some of the work is very demanding. For me it was just a summer job, but I am a very small build and I found that doing carts in the parking lot was hard work and would tire me out very quickly. Must be pretty athletic to do these different jobs like carts, sweeping, and bagging groceries because you are doing this multiple times a day."
good,Identical to all other Kroger/ Dillon grocery stores.  They offer competitive pay and flexible hours.  Cross training was encouraged and opportunity to advance is available.
good,Good place to work.  Very social environment. Lots of different people to meet. It was nice coming into work everyday knowing there was a new set of people I was going to encounter.
good,"I worked as a cashier at Kroger in Georgetown, KY while I was between jobs after moving back to the United States after living abroad for 6 months. It was a good starter job for someone in their late teens and I gained valuable retail experience in a positive work enviroment."
good,A well structured company that often provides a good work pace. Often the struggle came from upper store management and their inability to communicate down to lower management that caused dailey inconveniences at work.
good,It's not that bad of a place to work. Needs improvement. More education. Workers need to work as a team and get along. Management not good but not bad.
good,Having to take to much responsibility that was on me and they was not going after people that was responsible. The managers of the store was not will to help you.
good,"At Kroger's, everyone was extremely patient with my inexperience, and helped me to learn quickly. I was able to adjust the schedule to fit into my daily routine. They allowed me to work more hours during the weekend which allowed me to work and go to school at the same time. The pay was decent, and I found myself making friends and building relationships with my coworkers and supervisors, even though I am an introvert and I like to stay by myself. I was given feedback on my work, and how I could improve. Overall, I'm glad I worked at Kroger's, and I hope that teens and young adults will consider this for their first job."
good,Kroger can be a fun and interesting place to work. There are many tasks you are able to do that keep it interesting. I helped customer throughout the store as well as at the checkout.
good,Kroger is fun to work at as long as you know what you are doing. After working there so long you become family to the people you work with and you allow a friendly face to your customers.
good,"This company is all about you working your shift, if you were sick, good luck getting off, especially if you were a manager. Benefits were good, pay could be better especially since in California, its mandatory you be part of a union, and have to pay benefits."
good,"I worked as the gas station clerk so the pacing is a bit different. The duties are minor, sweeping and mopping the inside kiosk. Putting up drinks/ some snacks (for closing). Putting out the cones at night, counting the register."
good,"cool place to work the mission is enforced and it is a safe environment and the employers are very understanding and caring about going forward in advancement,"
good,"Its a job that gets me out of the house and allows me to make varied choices when it comes to cooking dinner."
good,Don’t expect them to put you first. It will always be the company ahead of everything else. If you have no life and don’t mind working habitually understaffed you might find a career here.
good,Kroger is a so-so company to work for. They tell you that they care about you as an employee. But they don't give you a good work to personal life balance. Then when they are done with you they toss you to the side like a bag of garbage.
good,It was an awesome job with awesome people working their. I got along with some people way better than others. If you like helping people then this is the perfect place for you.
good,I didn’t have a problem with the staff or the job position while I was employed at Kroger. The job is pretty straight forward. I’d recommend kroger to a friend.
good,"Definitely a fair temporary job, pay is good for the work done and coworkers make the environment fun and tolerable. Scheduling is always unorganized and hectic."
good,"Kroger provides a great foundation for an entry level retail manager.  The work is hard, the hours are long (50 hr. a week min.), The shifts are not conducive to having a live outside of work, however, if you work hard enough and long enough opportunities are available."
good,It was a decent job.  The work was not hard.  Stood for whole shift running cash register or customer service. Atmosphere was pleasant most days.  Breaks according to shift length.
good,A typical day at Kroger was overall good.  I learned teamwork and dedication with this being my first job.  The managers were always rude but my coworkers and I still found a way to enjoy our shifts.  I enjoyed checking out customers and leaving a smile on their faces.
good,While I worked at Kroger I was working part time. I worked from 9:00pm to 2:00am but as i worked there I often had to work over time so I normally stayed till about 10:00am. It was fun at times working with my fellow partners but at the same time it was stressful because we would always have to work faster and harder when the day shift stockers didn't do their job all the way.
good,poor management. Inflexible with hours and times. Not a fun place to work. Asked to do things outside of my job duties. Not polite management. Upkeep of facility was bad. Unprofessional workers.
good,"Kroger recently has been ""streamlining"" and reducing everyone's hours. They have cut the number of operational hours given but continue to add additional tasks.  Many days you do not get breaks or  the opportunity to eat."
good,"I would go in to do my job as a courtesy clerk, doing bagging and general clean up. I enjoyed the job for the little time I did it, it was a good job for a high school student."
good,"Working at Kroger’s is not the best job , the hours are not consistent, being a courtesy clerk is slow unless there is rush pockets . Co workers are great offers great benefits ."
good,Good people with lots on their plates.  Tough industry to compete in with all the internet migration of grocery purchases makes it tough for an established play like Kroger to be nimble enough to respond
good,"Better benefits than most other part time jobs. Work can be strenuous at times, but Kroger does make an effort to recognize employees for good customer service."
good,"A typical day was very fun and had a blast with all of my staff members, and also had a chance to meet all the managers. They were very assertive and very strict on what needed to be done and I liked that very much."
good,Could use work. You work nights weekends and holidays especially when you first start. Not a bad place though. Customers are rude sometimes and the job is faster paced with a lot of stuff to do.
good,it was a good experience...i learned a lot and believe it prepared me to advance in my next career. i would recommend a new pharmacy tech to work for this company
good,"Kroger is a great place for a first job. My experience was fairly easy and I had little to no complaints, except for the low wage, hence the reason for my departure. My manager was always easy to get along with, as well as my co-workers and my schedule was always flexible, even in the event of me having to change my shift last minute there was never an issue, we received more pay for working holidays as well."
good,"This is a wonderful place,to build a career ,the company offers great benefits.you have the opportunity to work flexible hours, if you have a heart felt manager, who is willing to give you a chance, and you prove you are worthy and deserve those hours ,the reward can be great."
good,"krogers was a nice high school job , something to keep a person going and out of trouble, and I learned about more customers service with peoples and treating them right .and it was days I had a nice day at work and some day I didn't."
good,"The work is stable and provides routine."
good,Great place my mangers were understanding. They worked with me the best way they could far as hours knowing I had a child and was going to school. I loved it as a first job no complaints
good,"Great job experience, but highest pay was 8.25 with union taking majority of my money. They raised quarterly normally and did so for me more often, but they were 5 cent raises and it wasn't enough with union and time being that I was working."
good,Depending on the day of the week it can be quick paced or slow. Learned how to use deli slicer and trash compactor. Learned food handling requirements. Enjoyed the opportunities to learn. Inconsistent work schedule was the most difficult part of the job. Co workers humor was the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"Kroger is a good overall company to work for. Unfortunately I would not suggest the store in Hamburg, MI based on the experiences with the managers I had at that location."
good,"this place is ok to work but the hours arent the best. i worked here for about 2 1/2 years and the only thing that wasn't ok was the manager, but the manager is out of there now. As far as i know it still isnt a bad place to work"
good,"There are a lot of opportunities for advancement within the Kroger company. They create a welcoming environment, and are very involved in the community."
good,this job was extremely fast paced. if you don't like spending a lot of time on your feet or running around this is not the job for you. be willing to take criticism well and also be a fast learner.
good,"Working at Kroger provided me good experience and provided me a job I could work wile finishing my college degree.  The scheduling was flexible enough that I could have consistent days off for school, as long as I would work weekends and holidays.  The pace of work is very fast and the environment is stressful.  This is not a job I would recommend keeping long term but it will keep the bills paid while you continue your search."
good,I didn't have a problem working there.  They worked with my schedule and I was able to pick up last minute.  Just wasn't looking for something every week to work but needed to due to union dues.
good,"Good company to work for, customer service are  a necessity in this field. Weekly pay is a plus but part time hours to begin with. Management is usually flexible to personal needs."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was I worked when the store was closed. I enjoyed the team potlucks. The workplace culture was very diverse. The hardest part of the job is being on your feet all shift.
good,"Kroger is a really nice place to work but if you are looking for full time and benefits and to be able to pay your bills with one job, keep looking lol"
good,It was a great summer job in high school and they even worked around my class schedule when school started up again. The people are very kind. The only down side was the days before holidays and the store would get rushed. Other than that it is a great place to work.
good,"I started as a cashier and moved up to Front End Lead in 13 months. In a day I would oversee the cashiers, baggers, and self check attendants to make sure customers get through the checkout efficiently. As a lead, you are expected to close 4-5 nights a week, as you are the front end manager when the SOM is gone for the day. The people I worked with were mostly high schoolers. Weekends and holidays were very busy. I loved the variety of things I would do in my shift."
good,Working weekends sucked but wasn't a bad job overall. Great for high school students and adults alike. They always gave plenty of breaks and hours. would work there again.
good,"It was a good temporary job, for what it was. Flexible hours. Understanding managers. Good co-workers. Pay was decent. Breaks did tend to be short, however."
good,"I put my blood, sweat, and tears into working for this company. Even with that, the management treated me and my co-workers like garbage just because we were the lowest men on the corporate chain"
good,The store that I worked in definitely needed a new Pharmacy Manager. Nothing about how that Pharmacy was ran made sense. It was not very efficient. The Pharmacy Manager was NEVER interested in teaching anything to any Tech. She was hateful to the staff and caused the moral in the Pharmacy to be very low.
good,Unloading trucks and stocking the aisles with the products and rotating older products forward fora guaranteed fresh product. checking for all expired items.
good,"If you stay at the company for at least a few years there is a strong potential for promotion. However, the management varies quite a bit: disorganized, overly aggressive but there are some friendly people in management"
good,"Worked at Kroger as an intern, pharmacists and techs were very helpful. I learned basic technician work and also some of the pharmacists duties. Only thing I did not like is that I was floating"
good,"Trash hours, too intense work, not enough people to help you when you need it. the pay was minimum wage but the amount of work it isn't a minimum wage job. Good management."
good,"Work/life balance will drive you crazy,  doesn't really exist."
good,While working at Kroger I gained a lot of work experience and friendships with my fellow co workers. Unfortunately at the time I did not see eye to eye with my supervisor.
good,"It was pretty nice. I really wish I could've gotten more hours, but that seems to be the case for every starter job out there, so I can't complain too much. Bagging was easy, since all I did was move around and bag for whoever needed it, and take in cars from the parking lot occasionally. It took forever to get anywhere in the company though from what I saw at our store."
good,The training was really helpful and really liked the manangment team and the customers you get attached to while working there. Overall a good expierence for me.
good,The position of assistant store manager is a great stepping stone. It wasn't for me or my lifestyle to stick it out. The closest promotion would have take 2-3 years with little pay increase and 10x more responsibility.
good,"I’ve enjoyed working for Kroger, better than any previous job. It’s not something I wanted to do my entire life but I don’t dread going to work.  Great management, low pay and sometimes hours are competitive"
good,A stressful work environment that makes team members work long past scheduled times.  Mangement sometimes horrible due to lack of leadership.  No training.
good,"It was a fun work environment, enjoyed my co-workers, but sometimes the managers would lack in their duties. They tend to show favoritism, but overall i loved working at Kroger."
good,"slow pace"
good,Working at Food for less could get stressful at times but that comes with customers and you have to learn that the customer is always right even if you know the customer is wrong. Management particularly at the store I was located at needed to be better and more seasoned as a manger to take in such role. The environment of Food for Less was peaceful on days when we weren't so busy. The most enjoyable part about working here was coming to work on days with the people that was willing to work and clocking out of course.
good,I enjoyed working with the people that i worked with and also worked for.  I felt like my managers were people that i could talk to about anything.  They also gave me a paid internship for school.
good,Union Job but No Benefits.                                               Breaks were short and unpaid. No employee discounts. Management was friendly and attentive.
good,"Krogers was a decent place to work, if you get the work done you'll be fine and the managers have a set schedule for you to do each task before closing. You'll sometimes however have to bend the rules a bit to get work done as a courtesy clerk, when pushing carts doing 7 at a time, as your introduction says to do, will not get your work done for the day, you should push 10 at a time at least. I was the one who was out there alone, and if your Krogers was like mine you'll have to do more than the maximum you're told to do."
good,"*Assisting in preparing for Meat and Seafood sales as well as helping keep area neat, and stocked."
good,Kroger was a great place to work the pay is the only thing that I didn't like. Kroger only paid so much. but it is a great place to work. so I would tell anybody to work there.
good,It was a good place to work. When I was in the store it was a steady flow of work except when I worked until midnight some nights. I was not a fan of me being the only one walking out of the store by myself that late. When I was working in the fuel center it was not too bad but if I had to use the restroom I had to walk up to the store but if there was not anyone who could run the fuel center I was not allowed to use the restroom.
good,The old Kroger in cartersville ga had poor management and wasn’t very professional or treated everyone fairly. I had a bad experience with my first gonat Kroger but I love the new built Kroger and atmosphere is so much better.
good,"The job was great, co workers were awesome. The pay wasn't the best since it is such a large company. It did get stressful at times due to the store being such a high volume store."
good,"At Kroger they care about there employees. They offer union,4O1k ,etc. Being a kroger associate u have lots of options.  U also get trained in multiple areas."
good,"So a typical day at Kroger is slightly busy. Only time it's busy is when everyone gets off work or it's the weekend. What I've learned at Kroger is that you need to trust your Coworkers more often."
good,nice and helpful staffs. Love working at busy store for more technician help. provided fair training for staff. Nice employee discount. lack of lunch break.
good,Very friendly best place i have worked in a very long time. Manger in produce was super helpful and willing to train. Made you feel like family had expectations for each of the employees that worked under him. We all worked as a team. Stocking and cleaning everyone had a place and it felt nice. Best place to work for.
good,"Great place to work."
good,this was a friendly place. I greeted the customers as they walked through the door. I also helped stock the shelves and put misplaced items where they belong
good,Kroger was my first job and I loved it. It is a stressful job because of customers but it wasn't too bad. The only problem is the pay. It's not enough at all.
good,Great place to intern and learn about business. A little slow paced but nice people all in all. Retail will continue to grow and if you are interested this would be a good spot for you.
good,"Kroger life is not your a typical life it is hard and it has become all about the numbers, we use to be a family and a family the cared for our customers and each other and now its all numbers literally. I am not bitter and I am not angry, but a company cat say they care and then let a manager verbally beat a person down til they feel less than. I am not looking for revenge, I am looking to tell the truth."
good,Productive and friendly place to work. Great employees. Flexible with scheduling. Good extended training program. Great place to work if you enjoy helping customers.
good,This job provides a steady and healthy income. Recently they started paying more. They are flexible as longer as you let them no in advance. The big boss can be a bit of a micro-manager.
good,"the people are a good team and help each other often, management is also good and understanding, the hardest part of the job is some of the customers that come in to the store"
good,"Keeping in mind that I worked as a courtesy clerk, also known as a ""bagger,"" my experience at Kroger, was good at best, and annoying at worst. Never did my opinion of the place drop below a slight annoyance, namely with the same old shenanigans one can expect in any job in grocery. If you are going in expecting a fabulous, unrivaled experience, you need to adjust your mindset. Once more, I must remind you that as a Courtesy Clerk, my experience is not representative of the experience of other, higher positions."
good,"Not a bad job, just did not prefer third shift in this environment. Would suggest asking questions regarding hours and days provided off. Overall, not a bad work environment."
good,"Check temps, first job. Cool work enviroment.need more characters please just let me start looking for new job please i need a new job next one finally limit"
good,A typical day is pushing carts for 30 min then getting calls to help customers every once in a while. Every hour cleaning bathroom. When bags are empty stock them. Putting perishable food away when necessary. And anything any customer needs I help with. I have learned that you need to be on task and be hard-working. The hardest part is just keeping the lobby full of carts when it is rush hour. The nice thing about the job is the managers are not down your back al the time. .
good,Being a scan coordinator at Kroger keeps you busy at all times. There is always something to do whether its scanning or helping run a register. This job is not hard but stressful when situations arise and you have to resolve the problem.
good,"Working at Kroger pharmacy has taught me so much, I was able to advance in my customer service skills along with learning the best ways to handle customer complaints. Working there has been an enjoyable experience, but I am now seeking better opportunities for myself."
good,Work hard with little or no advancement opportunity or recognition. enjoyed working with the people there and the customers can be demanding. secret shopped several times. Department hours are cut for management bonuses gained. Unfair to to employees.
good,it was an ok job to earn a little extra spending money. overall the environment was fair and the people I worked with at the time were great as well as management
good,It was an intense but rewarding learning experience. The night shift was a difficult position to fill and unfortunately I did not always have to tools to fulfill what I needed to do but ultimately it performed my duties and put the client first which is company motto.
good,"In my experience – This was a good company to work for. This is a very large company with a lot of moving parts, multiple divisions and levels. Internal transfers were open to all level of employees and welcomed. Every area of the organization was open to suggestions, so you had the ability to create your own opportunities and follow through with them. Because this was such a large company it was very structured in it processes and some of the guidelines were cumbersome and time consuming, it could take a year or more to get a process changed depending on the work load, approval process or system limitation."
good,I'd recommened students or people that don't pay rent or don't have much bills to work there. They start you off on minimum wage and give you very low hours during the week. They are flexible with employees schedules. It's hard to advance or move up with them.
good,"Meet and Greet Customer assist them with finding items. "
good,I thought it was a pretty nice place to work... especially as a first time tax paying job... However I think I was left on my own way to soon and didn't fully know what i was doing yet.
good,I have been working for Kroger for almost 2 years. I love interacting with the customers. And I have developed some great relationships with repeat customers.
good,"I was employeed with Kroger for a little over 5 years, which I gained a great deal of experience from. I was able to quickly work my way up within the company and learn many different departments throughout the store to expand my knowledge. The toughest part of the job was learning to handle different situations with the customer in mind; although this was also the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,"Overall, the company was good to work at. I learned a great deal about being an effective leader over 40 plus employees. I also became quite effective as an accounting clerk. I took pride in being able to find and correct any mistake made as it relates to the accounting of the store."
good,"Surprising, working for Kroger wasn’t bad at all. It was stressful at times but trying to balance work and school at the same time wasn’t too bad. I enjoyed working there."
good,The company is under a lot of stress and the stress is passed down to the associates. Over all the company isn’t bad it just seems under stress because no one is shopping in stores but rather they are shopping online.
good,"this job help me by teaching me how to multitask. This job involves separating products from truck  and dating them for freshness. involve using machine and slicer to cut the lunch eat to different sizes according to customer preference. this job also involved cooking  food  and dating items with timestamp for freshness. Along with cleaning dishes,fryer and rotisserie machine"
good,"Kroger was a fair place to work. Educated me through the years of how to work as a team. Learned many different skills, from processing groceries to cutting and preparing meat."
good,"I was hired by Kroger when they built a new store to replace an older smaller store.  Shortly after the new store opened, I stopped being scheduled for any hours.  When I inquired why I was not being scheduled, I was told that older employees were scheduled first."
good,This place is very relaxed and you are taken care of ... one thing they could work on is understanding about peoples health a little bit better ... most workers are very nice and caring
good,"I enjoyed working at Kroger, I would come in at around 3 o clock almost everyday sometimes earlier. I would begin my day usually by frying chicken once I arrived in a deep pressure fryer, I fried about 65 pieces at a time. From then on I would go about my typical day just helping customers."
good,"Experienced my introductory community pharmacy experience at Kroger.  Responsibilities: prepare and dispense prescription orders, provide patient discharge counseling, help with inventory management, and assist with immunizations"
good,"The management was always accommodating, and I was impressed by the flexibility they allow for their workers. They still maintained a professional environment, though."
good,The job is common sense and customer service. It's not too hard to screw those up but some people across the company just blow things out of proportion and that in turn makes other people's jobs harder.
good,"This is a job where you have to be there for a long time to be able to advance into a full time position. I was there for 5 years and was as far up as I could go and still didn't achieve full time. "
good,Mainly work by yourself.  Spend a lot of time on your feet stocking shelfs and facing isles. Set goals are nice to work on with your small team. The hours were nice and pretty flexible.
good,It was a great place to work at I recommend anyone who wants to work there go in with a positive attitude and help every customer that you can don't bring your personal business into work and stay focused.
good,I came in stocked on 3rds and it was okay. the staff was nice. they were very flexible with time i needed to take off. the job was a little tedious tough because we were a bit under staffed so i would normally stay an extra hour or so to help out
good,I worked the third shift as a night time stocker at krogers in mt juliet when I lived there when I was in high school i didn't like it very much because it wasn't very fast paced
good,Kroger was a good experience. Would definitely recommend for college students looking for summer work. As a produce clerk you must be able to lift some heavy objects.
good,"A typical day for me was running as a cashier as well as a self check out worker. I learned that people can work together when needed to which goes for not just the employees, but the managers as well. Working for Kroger Co. i did not have a hard time at all. I did what was asked to the best of my ability."
good,its a pretty nice place to work the people are friendly but it is fast paste but over all i love working here i enjoyed the time spent only been here since october.
good,"Kroger and Roundys merged about 3 years ago.  Since the merger, the stores and management have gone through some major changes in order to catch up to the customer and shopping habits.  Overall the changes have been positive, but a lot has been put on the shoulders of the store management teams.  It has required a lot of time to be put in."
good,"I normally wait on customers, slice meats and cheeses, bake and fry chicken and clean the department.  Also answer phones for people wanting to place orders."
good,I haven't worked a Kroger or any job. I just been looking for a job so i can help my mom around the house and get some things for myself.  I might want to work at McDonald's where my cousin work at.
good,this was a good place to work loved working here we would come in about five every morning go straight to the work stations and begin to load or unload trucks from the night before.
good,"Good place to start out and get some experience in the workforce"
good,Kroger is overall a good company to work for. They have good benefits good pay and it is a friendly work environment. I would recommend kroger to anyone who is looking for a first time job or to someone attending college or school.
good,the job its self is easy. the most enjoyable part of the job is closing. I learned how too talk to customers. Kroger is a very diverse place to work. the job and relaxed but its a quick paced job.
good,I would recommend anyone to work at Kroger. Great environment. You meet and work with good people. Kroger has room for advancement. Kroger works with you if your in school or in the military.
good,I really dont have anything bad to say about this job besides the lack of advancing in the career. The bosses were really nice and worked with you instead of against you.
good,"Busy during the holidays, enjoyed the customers, u could transfer to a deptt, if there was an opening, had a great union, not now from what I hear, and the insurance is terrible now. I heard the pay wasn't that great either. When I worked there it was a $1.00 more an HR. On Sunday's when worked. Not now."
good,"Everyone gets along at Krogers, it’s a great work place. You have to have customer service communication skills and know how to take care of a customer and your employees if they are struggling with something."
good,"Customer service needed all the time, All eyes by the management are looking at you on how you work. More responsibilities you have the more they like."
good,"Working at Kroger wasn't terrible, also wasn't great, all things included it was very average.  Most of us have been to a grocery store at some point in our lives, it isn't a secret what the workers/employees are doing and what is expected of them.  Someone has to maintain everything such that it can function properly, be it stocking the shelves, checking people out at registers, tending to customer complaints or even maintaining fuel pumps at the Kroger Fuel Station (which was my particular position).  Probably best for someone who genuinely likes the community as you WILL be exposed to a lot of the same familiar faces in your day to day work."
good,"- Good company to work for"
good,this is a great place if you are going to school and you also need to pay the bills. they are very flexible and you can always change your schedule according to your life.
good,"When I did work there, they always kept me busy with something to do. I bagged groceries and pushed carts there. I was there for two years. I learned a lot of my customer service experience from working there. It was a nice place to work."
good,"I worked at many positions in my ten years with Kroger's. I have seen the many changes in management staff, and I have talked with the people, not the crowd, the people. "
good,"The work was easy, you just had to know how to follow orders and be able to as part of a team. The reason I left is poor raises to hard working employees."
good,Kroger was Very well job  to work at. I've worked there for a total of 2 years on and off of course and everything is produced fresh in the produce market.
good,"This is a great company to work for with excellent benefits.  I lived too far from the store to just work part time of 20 hours a week.  It wasn't worth it for me.  the store was slow paced with customers and not too many sales in the evening so making the commission very little.  If and when I worked during the day time hours on the weekends it would have been better. Manager was awesome.  She was always friendly, helpful, and always had your back!"
good,"This is a grocery store. I encourage this job if you are unemployed. However, i do not believe it will meet you minimum need for your personal growth."
good,I enjoyed my time with Kroger even though the holiday seasons are rough and if there was a Kroger in my area I would reapply and work with them again.
good,"This position has taught me the value of teamwork, consistent success, time management, all while maintaining personal health working outdoors. Emphasized safety in the workplace. Following"
good,A typical day at Kroger was sometimes hard or easy. We always had customers that were difficult to communicate with because they didn't understand English or there were just rude people.
good,"A typical day at work begins early morning.  Quality assurance, food and work safety and collaboration with management and colleagues is essential for a positive and productive learning so customers can have a satisfying and positive shopping experience.  Store management looks out in the best interest for each employees by acknowledging them, assisting them as needed, willing to educate on new programs or technology, etc.  The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers and getting to know them on a first name basis.  I enjoy it when they tell me about their hobbies, interests, etc."
good,"Good for someone starting out, doesn't offer a lot of advancement opportunities and the pay generally isn't enough to survive on. Good benefits though hard to take advantage of them."
good,I had my good days and bad. The best part were my customers. I loved taking care of them. It was nice to know they cared about us employees. My store manager really cared about her employees.
good,"I spent years working for Kroger across every department in their stores, I can honestly say that the company strives to create an environment conducive to friendliness and making life easier for the customers and employees alike."
good,"Your at the register for most of your shift, since you are a cashier. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers. Most of the managers are ok, and some are not"
good,"Really depends upon the day and how busy & well staffed we are. I have learned a lot about retail life. The hardest part of the job is when you don't have enough help. On good days when you do though, its a really good day."
good,"It takes 2 yrs to get health insurance. I need it now. My hours are all over the board. I don't like working every weekend."
good,GOOD training ground for grocery business and retail sales.hardest part of job dealing with various depts. shifts ran 4-6 hours in length. Management attempted to treat all  employees equally.
good,"I learned about the job of a pharmacy technician . I had a great opportunity to learn about prescriptions and insurance billing, I learned how to handle upset customers."
good,"Checking emails, executing various tasks each day, cordinating each days schedule, overseeing that goals are met for the day, Dealing with issues that arise from individuals throughout the day."
good,"They give you a lot of hour and the salary it's not according with the duties that you need to do.  You learn a lot, but at the same time is insane the things that they ask  you to do."
good,"I stocked and organized the shelves. The culture was ok, I worked overnight so there was a lot of come and go. It was hard to work overnight but it was peaceful."
good,"-Customer Service"
good,A typical morning at work would start off with a morning team huddle which the head of each department would send over someone to take notes An to report back to the head person over the department such as cleaning and conditioning aisles and restocking a demanded product.
good,"A normal day is, counting inventory, restocking shelves, assisting customers, making sure the customers are satisfied. Making sure all orders are being prep properly and served ontime."
good,"I had this job during school, the hours weren't alot so it worked with my schedule, they dont pay you enough for the things you have to do, then what is in your job description"
good,"Kroger is a great company to work for if you are a kid in school that needs money or if you're an elderly person who needs something to do.  They don't provide the hours or pay to support an adult on their own, let alone a nuclear family, but very few service industry jobs do."
good,"I don't know what to say about working at Kroger, for me it was just so long ago that I hardly remember all the details. I do know I enjoyed it and had fun."
good,"I was a cashier, so I got me new new and interesting people everyday. What I really enjoyed about working there, was the fun environment and great co workers."
good,It's a great job to start off with if you're in school and they'll work around your schedule. Kroger's is very family oriented and love meeting customer satisfaction before anything else.
good,"Customer first, fast and friendly. Room for growth and advancement. What you put in is what you get out of Krogers. Do your best and be better then your co-workers!"
good,"Kroger taught me how to get to work on time, and work while I was there. It also taught me that there are a lot of distractions and how to avoid them."
good,Working at krogers was a good experience except for my department didn't have a manger at the time and the manager of the deli decided it was her job to be our boss. She was the worst manager I have ever met.
good,"Flexible hours and great benefits. It is high paced environment. They are very competitive and change processes to reflect regularly. If you work hard, there will always be plenty of overtime to compensate.The health benefits are awesome. I love managing my co workers and my department. My hours although flexible are dependent on the demands of the departments needs and they include midnight shifts 4 am shifts and always week ends and holidays. I work long hours, manage 16 people and a large volume department. I love what I do but the demands are not conducive to my current life balance goals."
good,most enjoyable part was helping the customers. I learned how to manage my time better. the work place culture was ok we tried to help each other out when we could.
good,Kroger is a great company if you're looking for a flexible work schedule and don't need to be paid a lot. I had one bad manager that ruined my experience but most coworkers are wonderful.
good,Stocked shelves in a timely manner. Made sure my section was clean and presentable at all times. Occasionally worked as a cashier or in the dairy department.
good,Good place to work. Very strict with overtime though. Management doesn't know how to run a front-end. This certain store could do better and treat its employees with compassion.
good,"Customer Service ,     Helping customers find groceries and checking them out.  Making sure that customers are happy with their trip to the store. If they are not happy, make it right with them so they will come back."
good,"Worked for the summer would not be permanent, didn't really like it but its wa okay, people were nice, customers flirted way to much for comfort but i never felt unsafe"
good,"I was the back up bookkeeper for Store 15, as the bookkeeper I would arrive at 3 a.m. balance the stores tills from the prior day and prepare for the store to open with proper cash for the day. I did the daily deposit and watched all cash control."
good,At Kroger being a cashier isn't very hard but definitely wasn't something for everyone to do. Must be able to stand for a long period of time and two 15 min paid breaks and one 30 min unpaid lunch
good,"Working at Kroger is a hit and miss, much like many retail stores.  Every employees experience will be different, but we can all say that sometimes it is very stressful to work there."
good,kroger is a great company to work for im just looking for something better with better hours and offers overtime maybe. im ready for change. I want to experience a new work environment and to also see what other companies have to offer me.
good,"very political only downfall "
good,Nice people but they dont work well with people who have kids. Lack of training was a problem in the deli. Need a cheat sheet for new employee for all the numbers of the food for the scales.
good,It could be slow at times and it could be fast at times. I enjoyed that it was a fun work environment and the co workers are friendly hate that it is 95% of the time in a chair.
good,The store is quick paced but small enough to learn all the positions. The employees treated each other like family. I learned a lot working there and loved it.
good,All and all it was an okay place to work I just hated I had to move.Their very strict about a lot of things but is all for good reasons Kroger was in order.
good,slice meats and cheese to customer specifications.  I learned all the different types and brands of meats and cheeses.  Also prepared and served salads. Hardest part of the job was the close process.  Most enjoyed was working with people
good,Kroger is not a bad company to work for. I wouldn't not recommend the company though because of the pay. The pay does not compensate for what the employees do.
good,"great place to work, great place to learn at an entry level position; has great benefits and discounts offered for associates; different brands to work for in other parts of the country"
good,Wasn't bad to work there. Strict though. Illness led to me leaving so I wasn't there very long. Had fun made friends and had good pay. Overall a good place to work.
good,"Kroger is a good place to start out, but if you don't force your way up quickly, it can be almost impossible... They claim seniority matters for earning promotions or full-time, however they almost always fill the positions with new employees with previous experience elsewhere or an employee from a different Kroger store."
good,"i assisted customers with monies, navigating the store, i was a cashier, i checked people out with their groceries, stocked shelfs when needed, went an got carts from outside."
good,"I love that there is always room to advance and gain more responsibilities. The only issue is, and this is true of any retail environment, are the constant negativity from co-workers. I understand that the majority are there just to earn a paycheck and do not consider their work as a career. I am fortunate to be able to work there and go to school at the same time so this helped me graduate debt free! I have decided to stay with the company part time as I work full time in my finance field because I enjoy knowing all aspects of my job."
good,"If you can stand on your feet for 4 to 8 hours and work with customers that aren't always nice, but with a smile on your face, this is the job for you."
good,"A typical day here in my position was to assist the customers with any questions or requests that they had, and help my coworkers should they be shorthanded. The management of the store was very relaxed, but was still strict enough to ensure that everything was running properly."
good,Long retail hours but good benefits and overall good company. I was in 3 different positions over a 6 year time span. Lot of opportunities for growth.
good,"Needed more hours and better benefits,however it was a positive working environment,great staff and management,great location ,I would have loved to have made an career at Kroger..."
good,"Fast paced, customer driven daily environment."
good,"Overall working there was a good learning experience. Had really good benefits and vacation time. Very fast work pace, are expected to keep up with all competition."
good,"Cleaned bathrooms. Returned items to shelves. Bagged. Brought in carts. Talked to employees, costumers. Management didn't do much. They wouldn't provide me with a new Kroger hat or apron."
good,Working at Kroger was a great first job. I learned a lot about hard work and customer service. They were really good about working around my schedule and everyone there was very friendly.
good,"Very fast pace, loved all my co-worker, ok benefits but takes a will to to get them, can be trying around holidays, have to be ok with working late and weekends"
good,Fast paced work. Store organization could be improved. Merchandising could be improved. Union benefits could be improved. More employee incentives would be beneficial.
good,"Being in high school, it was hard to balance all the hours given to me. I had to miss out on important events and couldn't study for tests because I couldn't get the day off, or able to find someone to switch a shift with me. The workplace was friendly and I had a lot of very nice coworkers that brightened up my day."
good,"While this job was not all too bad, it also was not pleasant either. I have to say, it was a waste of time, and they made you work too many hours a week."
good,"its a nice store with great products,nice,friendly,helpful,hard working,people.they will help you right away if you ask.big store with the products that are easy to find."
good,It was nice meeting all of the new people but the management wasn't very good. I was stuck there several times when I was sick and should have gone home.
good,"Kroger was very clean and organized. I enjoyed my time there and my coworkers were a big part of that. Overall a good experience. Management was good,"
good,"This was a fun place to work, but it was not what I wanted to do. I needed a job and this was a great place to start. People were nice and I learned a lot."
good,"They worked great with my college schedule, my daughters doctors appointments and autism therapies."
good,Over all a fine place to work as long as you do your job. Its quick pase most days. They give good discounts and benefits you'll save alot of money by shopping there
good,"Kroger has a family vibe, but I didn't nearly compinsate there employees enough. The management team was never able to move forward. They kept people in the same position for to long. Also cashiers making more than management is also a joke."
good,It has its ups and downs but overall it's a pretty decent place. The management could be better but they are pretty friendly. Just not a whole lot of incentive to the grind.
good,"Kroger is a nice starter job, you meet a lot of people and learn people skills but this is not a job you want long term. Its not easy to move up in position especially if you're a cashier. Management could use some improvement as well."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my short tenure with the Kroger Deli Department.  However, their store management definitely needs better skills on how to deal with employees that actually do their jobs VS those that are just there for a paycheck.  Not giving credit to where credit is due - is a HUGE disservice to employees that work and need their jobs."
good,"Resolve conflict with customers by adjusting their order"
good,meat department customer service. learned meat department management. management very helpful and available at all times. hardest part of job was working weekends and holidays. loved meeting and helping customers.
good,"My typical day at work was helping customers and making sure they were happy with their experience. I learned to not let people get to you as much and just smile. Management was pretty good. The culture was good, I was outside in the fuel center so I did not see any of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers, after I was taught how to handle them, I handled it. The most enjoyable part of the job was our regulars, always seeing them made my day better."
good,It's a good place to work but some of the people there are not to honest and don't have honest work ethics. But I like it there most of the time. The people I work with are nice.
good,"Fun, enjoyable. "
good,"a great place to work. very flexible hours, I'm just looking  for a place to move up with the company would love to make more money  but you have no idea where you will be moved to within the district if you do move up"
good,I have learned alot since the 9 months working at Kroger.  I work at night and my coworkers at night are all team players.  It is a good place to work.
good,"It's a job that will give back to you what you put into it, if you work hard and provide excellent service it will be acknowledged. from the moment you start to the moment you finish your shift you will be, in an immersive customer to employee environment, needing to consistently help and provide quality service. The resources available to you, management is quick to acknowledge and reward hard, work be it with a gift card, or just generous with the hours they provide, as well as making known to the available steps to further your career in this company."
good,I love the place  I   work  everyone  there  Is super  friendly  and they will help  you out  if  you  ever   have an  issue. everyone  always  has  a smile on  their face
good,"It's good to start off, don't recommend staying. Plenty of workers don't strive to improve. Most of my time was spent making up for others being lazy."
good,You get almost full time hrs when you start work but then as time goes on hours keep going down..Get to meet alot of people through the job.You constantly have something to do through work shift..hardly a downtime
good,The management is good at flexibility and learning and teaching to help you do you job well. Always learning and given the ability to do so with perseverance you can go for with Kroger.
good,You are a cog in a machine but it's not a bad machine.  I had flexibility with my schedule. I was offered a lot of opportunity for growth. My managers cared about me as a person.
good,"I absolutely loved working for Kroger Pharmacy, all locations. I learned everything at Kroger, and i taught everything at Kroger. I only left because I wanted to move into the hospital world."
good,I got to work with lots of people. Less stressful than fast-food. I enjoyed the interaction with the public and the pace. I didn't enjoy collecting carts at closing in the winter.
good,"I would say working for Kroger is ""Ok""  I wouldn't recommend staying more than 2 years, even less.  It's a nice way to get your feet wet but other than that.  You'll enjoy it depending on who your management is.  Luckily for me, I've had some good ones, so I stayed longer.  The hardest part is probably physical labor, especially summer and holidays, it gets very crazy.  "
good,Working at Kroger was good. I learned a lot about pounds. Also how to use mechanary. The people were good to work with i also learned how to rotate the product and stock.
good,"Absolutely love what i do. "
good,I loved this job but the management team pushed you to much. I wish I never would have got hurt on the job or else I would still be there. Good place to work.
good,"The only way they'll fire you is if you steal so it's a pretty secure job, but you get paid basically minimum wage for a lot of work. Short handed and people call in a lot so you usually do 2-3x the work for half the pay. Managers are never on the same page, and there's hardly any training."
good,"Handled cash, debit & credit payments, made change, give receipts to the customers."
good,"As an intern this company was a nice setting to learn the basics of community pharmacy practice.  Lots of patient exposure, team-building, and communication with physicians."
good,"This was my very first job, so I struggled a little bit on balancing my social life, work, and school. Looking back on it now, it was a great job and for anyone that knew how to balance those things it would be a good place to be. I really enjoy routine jobs and all I did there was collect carts and bring them back inside, so it was a pretty simple job. It was a little hard during the winter, being outside for eight hours straight in the snow and rain. When I was there I actually had no idea who my direct manager was, so that made things a little difficult when I needed someone to go to about certain things."
good,This is exactly what one would expect from work at a big box retailer. It has its good and bad points.  It is a stable structured position but there is a lot of bureaucracy.
good,"Kroger is a good company to work for.  The days are always busy and work is very fast paced.  If you want to move up, there is a lot of room for growth with the company."
good,"Worked at two different stores and definitely preferred one over the other. The customers and over associates attitudes we better at my most recent store. I was in a department that took the most nonsense and what felt like the least rewards. Over all the company was good to work for. Though it being a corporate company meant that us on the lower level meant less to them, benefits were still go. Pay was okay when you reached the top."
good,This is the only place I have ever worked so I'm not really sure what to expect of a workplace. I have enjoyed working here for the nearly 2 years I have.
good,I love what I do at Kroger. Customers always make my day.  Good place to work. With a good management team and no favoritism is would be a GREAT place to work.
good,"Working for Kroger's wasn't to bad the only problem that I had was my fellow employees, doing my job is not a problem for me at all but when I'm expected to pick up the slack for several coworkers on an very consistent basis it becomes extremely frustrating. I couldn't blame my supervisors though because on several occasions due to that situations they were all was willing to help me when I needed it."
good,"Kroger is a great company to work for, especially in the pharmacy.  The pharmacist are highly educated and knowledgeable, and the company seems to know how to operate a pharmacy."
good,You able to try out other positions as they come available. They have a college program and will help you financially with some degrees. Their training staff are fun and make learning easier.
good,"This job is a good summer job, I have been working here for 3 years now and the management is awesome the workers are cool but there is better out there. The raises could be better. Training could be better. As I said it's good for a summer thing but take it from me, there IS better out there."
good,"I didnt have alot of fun working here simply because I felt I was being mistreated by my coworkers. It was alot more physical than I thought, and I got sick quite often due to working in the cold and rain constantly. I just simply did not have a good time working here."
good,"Everyone is cheerful! If you need help, there is always someone available. There's activities for everyone to be involved in which helps express the diversity in the office. Great supervisor teams with productive meetings! I have not ever left feeling confused as to what to do or what I've listened to during the meetings. The parking was not ever an issue as well!"
good,"weekdays: Arrive at 3pm scan stock and bring out what i needed for the next day, baked what items i needed for the day ie, cookies, turnovers and such, then break out dough needed for the morning and finally clean and close the department."
good,Krogers was a great first job to introduce me to the work world. Helped me get use to customer service and what its like to work for everyday people and ensure they are happy and get what they need.
good,"good place to learn the basics on jewelry sales, and sales in general. Love working for Kroger, have worked there previously and have chosen to come back"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I encounter on a every day basis. They are so sweet and considerate people. I have gotten some great friendships out of just working at Kroger.
good,"I learned that there are different paces in which different cashiers can go, because we are all different and individuals.  "
good,The work environment and people I interacted with was great. I was utilized in different jobs so I felt I got good experiences out of being employed at Kroger.
good,The employees are friendly and the job is relatively easy. The job would be much better if the hourly pay was more competitive. I enjoyed the job for the most part but felt like it was tough to move up in the company.
good,"Work for 2 people, pay is not great, downtown location, traffic is horrible, taste panel offering taste of what Kroger is selling and lots of lobby events with free items that will be selling in the stores"
good,"Business needs change at various times of the day & you must be willing to accommodate these changes. "
good,This was my first job when I turned 16 and worked here until I turned 18 and went to college. Definitely would recommend as first job! Just enough responsibility to set you in the right direction
good,"I worked in the deli and my job was to slice meat and cheese for stock or for customers, make salads. it was a very fast paced  job always doing something, unless your on break."
good,"I genuinely liked my job as a cashier.  I enjoyed most of the customers and helping them. I also liked most of my coworkers. I did not enjoy how the management played favorites.  For example,  one female was allowed to wear whatever she wanted,  usually a grey zip up sweater (no work shirt visible half the time)  yoga pants and most times on her cell phone. How can she be FES every time she works,  when she doesn't do any work.  She has such poor customer service skills. I've heard customers say not so nice things about her.  She definitely isn't pleasant to work with at all! The management needs help with pretty much everything at store 40. I would work for Kroger again if given the opportunity."
good,"King Soopers provides a laid-back, slow-paced, and flexible working experience.  The staff is great.  The work is be no-means demanding.  I would recommend it to anyone."
good,I work in the pharmacy and they work with my school schedules.  I need more hours and better pay. The hardest part of the job is trying to please everyone.
good,"Slow management concerns about work area."
good,Kroger is a great place to work the pay is not decent though it's at minimum wage which is currently 7.25 but thy give you raises with experience. Kroger is a union and owns a lot of different franchises over the country
good,i was bagging food and pushing carts and its was fast job but sometimes its was hard job but its pay good too and its a good work place too and i like the job
good,"Get to meet great new people, lots of different departments to work in, and you never have to stay in one spot.Good opportunity to move up in the work place, starting as a bagger you can move to cashiering, stocking, or working with money behind the counter."
good,"Continuous  work"
good,typical day at Kroger would be bringing in grocery carts. putting the customers groceries in grocery bags. helping customers out to their car if need be. hardest part for me would've been taking in the carts from outside.
good,"gave me very good hours when I first started working there, very flexible hours, very good management team, helped me out when I needed it, very calming environment"
good,The starting  wage is not so good and the courtesy  clerks do not get any raises from what I was told. They expect alot from there employees but arent willing to pay more
good,Working at a place that has a union is fantastic.Kroger has some of the greatest people I've ever met working there. Just avoid the management. They don't know how to do anything except make the job harder for the lowly peons that work as cashiers and grocery clerks
good,The company is very generous to its employees. The scheduling is flexible for college students and the management is extremely understanding. I would work here again.
good,"I won't say this is the best job, but it certainly is not the worst. There are days when this job is a casual breeze and relaxing, and then there are days where you just get swarmed by endless customers. When the days are fine, the work is fine as well. Nothing too stressful. With me working the night shift there, the majority of my shift was spent cleaning up in order to prepare for the end of my shift when I would have to pack everything away, and the rest of my time was spent helping the customers and stocking the display case. "
good,Work closely with your coworkers and customers. Builds great people skills and is a fast-paced workplace. Stay on task and complete what was asked of you.
good,Friendly working environment.  Good place for advancement and working opportunity. Must love working with the public and be people friendly and also be willing to learn other positions within the store.
good,Management is sometimes a non-motivating burden but the company itself provides a lot of benefits and opportunities to move forward. They provide each employee with great training for individual progress.
good,"The company is reliable and results driven.  Management works 5 to 6 10 hour days, nights, weekends and holidays.  Customer Service is the heartbeat of the organization."
good,Good employer.  Was able to work a flexible schedule around my school commitments.  Good team members and good boss.  Location was ideal for my commute.
good,"I doubt many of my co-workers are still with Kroger/Hannaford, but it was 1 of my first jobs and it was a good learning experience. The store was sometimes slow but overall, not a bad place to work."
good,Great people. Easy to learn. Friendly and fun staff. Clean. Managers and Supervisor made working there enjoyable. Pay need to be more other than that Loved it.
good,"Answering phone calls"
good,"I only work one weekend a month. A typical day there is filling requested and prescribed prescriptions, stocking, answering the telephone, ordering medications for the following week and returning meds back to the shelves that haven't been picked up after 2 weeks."
good,It's not one of the best places to work. They cut hours and some people call off all the time but since it's union the managers won't get rid of the people.
good,"I feel that everyone who works an eight hour shift at any job should be allowed to take a meal break, not just those who are under a certain age, but that's just my opinion."
good,"I think krogers is an ok job.... You work hard, be nice, and kind to everybody.. You always have to keep yourself busy... I really miss the people I worked with...."
good,The employees are very friendly and always their to talk if you need some one. This is not alway a good thing i learned. The employees are about gossiping and quick to label.
good,Does not matter what your job description may be. You will end up doing more of what your job indicates. You may feel unappreciated from and feel like your the only person actually working. Everyone should be treated fairly.
good,I was young but I loved working for Krogers. I left to start a family and would've considered returning but the local store closed down and I didn't want to travel.
good,"Typical Day at work, Is location dependent. Some store are busier than others so they can range from extremely fast paced without breaks to very boring days with lots of standing around. Basic Data entry--tech duty, Pre-verification--Pharmacist, Product Dispensing-Tech, Vereification-Pharmacist, Release/Sell- Technician."
good,"As a carpenter Kroger kept you busy. Kept you working between remodels,resets,and new construction. Would likely still be working there if our department/job wouldn't have been eliminated."
good,"Work one on one with customers "
good,Customers were very easy to tend  very easy to restock the store and managers were good tonme with hours and the pay was a good start I loved my job and it was a pleasure working for them
good,Working at Kroger has shown me how people who don't even really like each other can still work very well together. The work environment was a range of very slow dragging days to very quick and fast paced where the managers and floor supervisors are pushing everyone to work faster. The people are very nice to work with but after a while you just feel stressed out and eager to get home.
good,"Being able to come to work clock in a get some of the small things out of the way before the store got to busy. I learned to anticipates customer needs by exceeding customer expectations at every opportunity through trust and respect, assisted cashiers with returned items and price checks to help resolve customers service disputes, and ensure each customer receives prompt and courteous service for a memorable shopping experience. Management was very strict and was always wondering around the store to ensure that order was maintained. The hardest part of his job was making sure that everything was bagged correctly. As far as culture goes everyone got along great being a family was not only important to management but it was important to the workers as well. The most enjoyable part about this job was knowing that I was able to help our customer get what ever they needed and ensuring that I left a smile on there face as they made there exit."
good,fun people easy work and decent pay makes for an alright job can be hectic at times but manageable ...good benefits and great discounts makes it worth it
good,"Assisting customers, typing and counting prescriptions. I learned that details are very important. Good management. Teamwork is essential. Sometimes hard to meet customers needs. Satisfying customers is great."
good,"A typical day at Kroger is coming to get as much work done as possible. Some days are better than others. I have moved up from being part time to being a department lead. You do get some lead way to learn how to do things. The culture is decent. The people I work with are good. But considering that there could be a few more people hired to help, it does get stressful because some people in one department have to help in other departments so other departments don't fall too far behind. I think that has an effect on everyone's morale because then the original department also falls behind. Management will help a little. Management is sometimes positive, but not willing to show it. The hard parts about this job are that there are not enough people to work and the pay could be better, along with a little more positive attitude from management. The enjoyable parts are that most of the people who work here are good workers and we get along great."
good,"You get to help people and learn a lot. There is always room for advancement. I enjoyed the atmosphere and people I worked with.Ease of being approved for job, some what flexible hours, certain employee's, assisting customers, the food options for lunch break !"
good,"40+hours"
good,Great job for teen agers. Although it's hard to get a raise or promotion. Benefits can vary. It's not anything long term but a great first job. The atmosphere can be great when working with great people.
good,I'm a cashier for Pick N' Save.  Very good company to work for.  The coworkers are nice and all the managers are nice to work for.  I have no complaints about the job.
good,"It wasn't terrible, It just wasn't for me. My biggest complaint is the training you receive, it was difficult to take it in all at once and it is very fast paced at times and then very slow depending on the time and area"
good,"Fast paced environment, team oriented. Good training program and does set you up for success. I have been very loyal to the company and it has offered good job security."
good,"I was treated well and appreciated for my experience. management allowed me utilize my own display, business was well managed and treated wonderfully. my jobs were rewarding and the wage was good"
good,Kroger is a very depressing place to work.  the managers treat you like children and the union workers are horrible.  they always do the least amount of work they can do without getting fired.
good,"A typical day at work would be managing employees of about four to six in conducting customer service, stocking shelves, and working with management to accomplish the goal of achieving a profit. The management is great, and very communicative to assess the needs of the business to their employees."
good,"Kroger is a really good place to start out working. They have really flexible hours, which help you out in high school and college. The people that work there with you are generally friendly people that are willing to help you out and work with you if you meet any problems."
good,great expericience great management and fun experience. I learned a lot from working here and will continue to use my skills from this job to my upcoming next job
good,This was an entry level job. The customer are rude and challenge but nothing as average employee cannot handle. Fast pace job at the beginning of the each month
good,"Day goes very fast due to business of bakery, deli and Bistro."
good,I loved working for this company. They really helped me grow as a person and as a leader. I was able to try many different aspects of the company. I also had the opportunity to help grow stores around the state and improve the way the stores were run.
good,"stock produce, assist customers, maintain juice extractor,"
good,"perfect job for students "
good,"Working at Pick N Save required handling cash, credit, and check transactions and also providing excellent customer service."
good,"Loved both departments I helped manage, as well as my coworkers. Store management wasn't always knowledgeable about how to help the departments, as they are often hired straight from school, rather than working their way up in the company. Pay is also not very competitive unless you're a department manager."
good,"Slow pace, friendly people. Flexible with hours if needed. Managers were helpful and friendly, willing to cross train you to allow movement. Nice relaxing environment."
good,I liked it . It was ok I think I just think customer service could be better but over all I like working for them manger ok and think the the supvisors
good,"Kroger is a great company I work at. The environment is nice and the coworkers are very friendly over there. Over all, I have been having a great experience at this company so far."
good,Providing customer service. interacted  with customers from various backgrounds positively. the hardest part of the job is picking up behind people and the most enjoyable is assisting customers with decisions and purchases.
good,As long as everyone did their job it was a smooth place to be employed at. If some people slacked off at their job duties then someone else would have to pick up the slack.
good,"For a high schooler it was a fun job to have. I was happy to leave because the union/management there doesn't care to much about their employees. The best part is the Union would still take money out of your pay check if you weren't in the Union."
good,Working at Kroger was great. There wasn't anything that I had trouble with at that job. The people I worked with would always help me and we're hard workers as well.
good,"Typical day at work consists of  checking out customers, and restocking unwanted items. If closing, assigned to clean registers and restock paper/clean out coupons. Decent management, difficult with hours."
good,"I didn't like all the responsibility the work entailed.  Cash handling, scheduling, stocking opening, closing,cleaning  ordering. The kids I supervised were a handfull"
good,"i love working at kroger but i move so I'm trying to find a better job, i like working  with my coworker and the customer were great.but the pay wasn't so great"
good,I started working there at 16 years old as a means to save some money and purchase my first car.  I mostly enjoyed it when things got busy and made the time fly.
good,The job was very motivated on great customer service. Everyone was trained to handle situations with a smile and the best you can. It was a great first job.
good,"Customer-service oriented grocery chain. Focus on Friendly associates and fresh products with low prices. Good company for those looking to continue moving up in the company. Set-schedule not so great, doesn't leave much room for flexibility"
good,Kroger gives all an opportunity to work and grow in their company.   It is a place to have fun while working and interacting with co-workers and customers.  Kroger provides great health benefits and discounts as well.
good,Great benifits and good chance of advancement. Great place for entry level workers to get experience. I would definitely recommend this job to people I know.This company has lots of benefits such as cheap insurance and health care.
good,kroger is a good place to work. people are nice and friendly and managers do their best to work with your schedule. the place is also very clean and nice.
good,This was my first job in 2014 and I was a bagger and would help out in various departments when needed. The best thing about this job was that it helped me become more comfortable speaking and conversing with people. This job helped me get used to customer service and conversing with customers.
good,I have been given & taken advantage of opportunities while at Kroger RASC.  It is a good place to work.  Great health benefits.
good,It was a great time. The managers were outgoing and very easy to get along with. I really enjoyed my time at Kroger. I would recommend this job to anyone.
good,nice place to work. people werei rang up customers and ha friendly management staff was easy to talk to. I rang up customers and handled the closing procedures at night. deposits as well as supervising scheduled breaks
good,Working at this store was an excellent experience. Management and other co-workers were very communicative and productive giving a hands on experience for customer service
good,A typical day on the job starts by clocking in and signing in to my assigned register for that day. Welcoming and greeting customers with a smile and enthusiasm.  Each day I learn the many different personalities of people.I also learned to keep your personal life separate from the workplace.The culture is very diverse with the many different types of races. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers who may come in and be rude. The most enjoyable part of the job was working and being able to have some kind of income.
good,"For the Sweet Shop you would have to make all different types of popcorn, caramel apples, fudge, chocolate, and chocolate strawberries. You get to interact with customers on a daily basis and make special orders. It is always fun interacting with the customers. The hardest part of the job would probably be cleaning. Overall its a great environment."
good,i fill a lot of prescriptions and enter them in the computer i wait on customers and help them with insurance problems by calling the insurance company we could use more help though
good,If you are in school this is an excellent job to have. Preferably while you are still attending high school since you do not need a whole lot of money during that time & they are flexible.
good,"Good company, well organized, and treated it's employees well. The only part I disliked was that I ran a gas station in a bad neighborhood."
good,"because the owner was the chef, and this was his only eatery. You could tell the care and passion he had for his food and staff. Enjoy working here as a side gig! Looking to learn more about liquor and the industry. Have already learned so much from his sommelier."
good,"Always new things to learn, and fun people to work with. Has multiple opportunities to develop new skills that you can use in the future. Just has inconsistent hours, which is a large con."
good,"We are busy all day, everyday.  Putting up displays , doing food and beverage demonstrations.  I enjoy the customers, getting to talk with them.  I have learned that you can not be in more than one place at a time.  I said before that we are very busy.  If I could clone myself I could get more work done."
good,"Consistently moving "
good,"A great place to learn and experience great customer service."
good,Learned how to develop not only my team but myself as a leader as well.  How to become a sales driven manager and learn more about the acumen of the business.
good,Great Pepole Product sales Its Required needs. To Be A Successful Company Accomplished Goals Set By Associates.Great Priceing Customer satisfaction and acknowledgement.
good,"A typical day at Kroger includes a multitude of customer interactions. Learning to cope with varying degrees of productivity is a daily exercise. Management tends to care about the employees happiness because a happy employee is a productive employee. Culturally speaking it is similar to a family in respect to roles; those in charge look out for those under them, different departments work together easily, and everyone has a general feeling that they are, at the very least, liked by their fellow employees. The hardest part of the job is the low traffic times of the day when there is little for a cashier to do after general clean up duties have been performed. The most enjoyable part of the day is when things are flowing smoothly making both customers and employees content."
good,"Working at kroger is the biggest headache anybody can get . On a daily basis, I am juggled between self check out, a register and customer service. Kroger is a great company with good benefits but it only goes so far."
good,Pick n save was a very good job for me that was the first job that I ever had and I loved it everyday I was meeting new people and also getting to know femilier faces as well
good,Its what you can expect working at a grocery store.  There is a lot of repetition from day to day but it's an easy job.  Need to be a people person because you see hundreds of people every day.
good,"I gained experience working with a variety of people, from those who were kind and caring to those who were bitter and harsh. I do not regret working here however I wish that I could have more freely expressed my opinions about the working conditions. The best part of the job was getting to interact with customers and help them to find what they needed and the most difficult would be the late hours I had to work as a high school student who had early morning classes."
good,"Summary says it all. Alot of responsibility managing over 100 employees to make sure store operates like it should. Shifts for management are not great. 7-5, 9-7, 1-11. Newest managers get most the latter shifts."
good,"In my typical work day, I have a lot of customer interaction. You constantly learn new skills every day. Be prepared to think outside the box. In addition, follow all Kroger guidelines. Management is always around if you have a question. My tip here, is to work hard (show them you can lead). Co-workers are always there to help each other out."
good,"Helping customer find what they need, ring up there items, did bookkeeping work, helped open the store and attended to customer needs."
good,I liked working here at Kroger's. I talked the customers as well to the co-workers more to them when I was on my break. I liked taking the groceries that were in the cart of the customers to their car when they wanted to.
good,you basically make your own schedule and it is competitive pay becuase you get a raise every few months depending on how well you do based on your performance
good,"Basic grocery game. Nothing great, nothing noteworthy. Five levels of employees. Generals to the grunt work and get very low pay. Level 4's have higher pay and also do grunt work."
good,"Fast past, but, overall good staff and management. I had fun working there. They were my first employment and i loved every minute working for Kroger."
good,"Requires the worker to be fast and organized. However, the frozen department specifically is a bit understaffed. Managers are nice and appreciative of your hard work."
good,Good working conditions and friendly co-workers who know what there doing. Typical work days can be either slow or busy though depending on the day of the week or if there is a certain holiday(s) around the corner.
good,"This job was really fun but the pay for the work is a bit off balance. The hardest job upfront gets paid the least, but it was over all a nice experience"
good,"They'll keep you busy. The scheduling is a bit hectic, but overall, it was a good place to work. They pay was low, and the hours were at times."
good,"Being able to supply customers with quality service and food is a great feeling on a day to day basis, which is what made me thrive within this position."
good,Bosses and employees are very nice and helpful everyone takes their brakes accordingly flexible hours downfall is minimum-wage weekly pay which is good
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new customers, and exchanging different recipes about food. It was fun learning new ways to make new dishes or even how to spice up old ones."
good,"Scheduling and work life balance is an issue when you work for Kroger.  If you are the new kid on the block you tend to work a more strenuous schedule.  There are some really good people that work there, I miss a lot of them.  We had a good time and were working toward improving sales goals."
good,Always keeps you busy hardest part was making sure everything was clean while helping people trying to be i two places at one time the best part was the poeple i worked with they were fun
good,"Good job, wages too low, and not enough hours. but the job was fun the coworkers were nice and helpful and the customers were great.  A good place to work"
good,"This rating is in reference to Kroger. Hours were long and that wasn't really an issue. I felt that Store Management was being micro managed. I loved working with customers , being on the sales floor assisting sore associates and shoppers. Things began to change which is normal in this type of business. You must be able to adapt to change. I enjoyed mentoring and motivating my associate. "
good,"Kroger is an excellent store I worked there in the past and it was always a good day there very friendly coworkers, but the hardest part was the night shift job I had it was a challenge. ill probably never work here again not because I don't want to but because I was fired from here."
good,Awesome place to work if you are early in your working life. This was my first job and the benefits were great for a part time job. After working there for 6 months I received a paid vacation. We were paid weekly. If you wanted more hours there were always ways to get more.
good,This Kroger is a very busy store and I liked that they also will work with your schedule  pay was good and it was weekly that was a plus for me staff is very friendly
good,I had to learn the majority of the things from my co-workers because my managers were not there to teach me the ways. I got along with most of the people in the deli. I worked from mid-day to closing.
good,"Supermarket Retail, Cashier, Stock and to ring out customers.."
good,Nice Clean Calm Company To Work For. The Managers Are Friendly As Well As Your Co-Workers. Tasks That Are Perform Are Not Difficult Once So Ever And The Managers Work Around Your Pefer Schedule.
good,"It's a grocery store like any other. My time there was brief, but I enjoyed most of my coworkers and the store itself was actually really nice."
good,"This is your typical stocking job, taking product from the trucks to the appropriate shelves. With good management, everything ran smooth."
good,going to work everyday. doing my work to the best way I can. I learn how to work with different people which is great. my co-workers are fun to be around for the most part. love getting the job done
good,"This position is great for a student, parent, retiree, or anyone who seeks part time employment with a light workload. The schedule is flexible but the pay isn't great. Management is fair and easy to work for."
good,"The people and customers at Kroger is great. Drama is at every job... Very typical ! Mark , Debbie and Chris are outstanding people (Management) I just wish there was more that we could do to make Kroger more family oriented !"
good,I would suggest my friends and family to work for Kroger and the schedule is flexible and works with my schedule. It's a great place to work in my opinion
good,"Handle cash transactions with customers"
good,"While working at Kroger I started out as a bagger, but was moved up to be a cashier after a few months. With that move I did receive a small pay increase which was very nice. The job itself was a very easy going and basic position. It was not difficult to perform the tasks that were requested and the customers were also very easy to interact with. That being said it is in no way a long term position in my opinion but it was a nice part time position."
good,A good place to work for a first job.  Customers and coworkers are mostly friendly.  Managers are approachable.  Cashier job is relatively simple to learn.
good,it is a good place to work just the position i work aint the best im not a verry good people person and bagging grocery's wasn't my strong  suit i was good with getting carts and running cash register
good,"not enough hours co workers were great enjoyed my position "
good,I had a great time training and working at Pick n Save.  The work was fast-paced and much fun.  If I had to choose between this job and a new one. I would pick the new one.  I was familiar with the atmosphere at pick n save well enough that I thought it was time to make a change.
good,"I have assistant manager experience working at the kroger fuel center. I have trained other employees and am use to counting inventory, restocking  and ordering,  and keeping track of money."
good,The hardest part of the job was handling so many duties/responsibilities and only getting paid the bare minimum. The customers were awesome but management wasn't so great.
good,it's a good company if you need something as far as fast pay but management can be inconsiderate at times and not understanding in certain situations .
good,The job was okay. I really wasn't getting paid enough for all the things I had to put up with. The management team could have done better at managing their team.
good,Servicing patients and going above and beyond to ensure that my patient are highly satisfied. The pharmacy is retail so you deal with incredible people
good,its a good place to work as long as you have good people on your shift with you. the pay is alright. the hours depend on your preference. its really all what you make it.
good,"Stock,scan products.I've learned to meet people's needs well.Management are typically organizationally skilled.The co-workers are self motivated to get the job done.The hardest part is keeping up with all of the inventory periodically.The most enjoyable part is meeting and interacting with various people."
good,I  collected carts when it was 115 degrees outside so it wasn't fun but when it wasn't horribly hot it was a very fun job. The people i worked with were fine. I just didn't get along with them. The hardest part was the heat. The best part was that i didn't have to do cardio at the gym because i walked so much.
good,"Everyday was different. One day they would have me working stock on the floor, other days I was in the dairy cooler filling milk. Sometimes I would work overnights to ensure all the tasks were completed. Loved the co workers and managers because they cared about the employee's."
good,"The Kroger Company is not only a good place to work, but one of the best thing about this company is that it is involved in the communities it serves."
good,"Did not get along with the manager to good, but fellow employees I got along with fine and made friend's. Overall not too bad a place to work at. Wish I had a different manager."
good,"I didn't like the managers i worked with. The co workers were great. I never got my raises when i was supposed to, and when i said something about it I got ignored."
good,"It definitely is not a place I would want to stay forever. Although, they were very flexible with my college schedule and the job was not hard to go to every day. Enjoyable experience overall."
good,"A typical day of work was fun, decorating cakes and helping customers is always enjoyable. I learned that even my supervisor can get me fired because they feel threatened for their position. Management was decent until my supervisor feared I would take her job. I loved my co-workers, they were enjoyable and helped me out. The hardest part of the job was not being trained for certain things. I was just thrown in there and told to work. The most enjoyable part was decorating the cakes and seeing people smile."
good,"It's good, unless you are looking to move up. It's got flexible hours, paid benefits and an opportunity for work. It's a generally nice place to work I believe. Good environment."
good,"A typical day at work at Kroger as a Courtesy Clerk is bringing in the carts, bagging, and completing any chores you are assigned to on the chore list. Every once in a while you will assist customers with anything they need. I learned that it is important to work together in a team while I was at Kroger and that you always serve the customer first. My co-workers were very friendly, nice, and encouraging. The hardest part of the job was trying to get chores and cart shifts taken care of on a busy day when someone else has called in to work. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help customers and see a smile on their face from the service you provided them. It's a great job for a teen looking to fit in some work experience."
good,"I was a cashier. My job was pretty simple I greeted customers, when asked for help I would assist them and make sure they ha what they needed or if the store didn't carry the product I would let them know of a place that could possibly have what they are looking for, then of course I would check them out."
good,Loved making relationships with the customers and employees. A great business to work your way up higher in the company.
good,"I loved the people i worked with but was told i was working one position but worked another. Other then that, it was a great experience."
good,Productive workplace that has a safe environment. Its a great place to work at with many professional clients with positive attitudes.
good,over all ok however it can be improved. im interested in finding an office position to help me explore new areas and expand my customer service experience .
good,Pushing buggies up a steep hill in the rain or heat. Bagging groceries occasionally and cleaning store along with restrooms often.
good,"Kroger had a weird way of putting way too much on your shoulders for one person, but it made you a better person in the end."
good,Working in the Kroger Deli has been a fast paced and fun work environment.  People and customers are generally friendly.
good,My typical work day starts off with 8 hours. I interact with customer by check them out while I run the register. Most of the management team are helpful and professional and m co-workers and I work as a team. The hardest part of my job is seeing customers disappointed. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing my regular customer and see them smile when the they come through my line.
good,"The people I worked with were amazing. I loved what I did, being a cake decorator was such an amazing experience. Holidays were rough, but we worked as an amazing team and got everything done, not only on time, but early."
good,"working with a team and helping each other, helping customer maximize their shopping needs and keep accurate details of daily sales."
good,Great work environment with friendly and helpful co-workers. Simple daily work responsibilities and always room for gaining more and expanding upon skills.
good,"Although there were some problematic co-workers, I would say that overall as a company, Kroger takes care of it's employees. My only complaint would be their hiring process takes too long."
good,Fun and professional environment. Friendly people and managers. Helpful to customers and try to accommodate their every need so they keep coming to shop there
good,Nothing bad to say about this company. Most of the skills I've received while working here helped me advanced to bigger and better opportunities.
good,My co-workers at Kroger are wonderful people and make the day enjoyable. Through Kroger i have learned time management and how to manage myself. In a typical shift in the Bakery I am by myself for the evening. This has taught me how to manage my time wisely and to be in charge of myself throughout my shift.
good,"Met great people, easy to learn, co-workers were nice. Provided speedy customer service, everyone was willing to teach you different things in order for you to grow in the company."
good,"This job I have experienced that sometimes it can be difficult to work with upset customers sometimes, but it is always your job to make sure the you can help the customer as best as you can. I enjoyed working with the employees."
good,"Working for any municipal government comes with challenges, however working for the City of Houston Volunteer Initiatives program  was a great grant-based department aimed at increasing civic engagement through volunteerism. Great access to Federal programs and DC agencies such as Vista, Americorps, and the Cities of Service."
good,"Working was okay, didn't make much money or get many hours. Hardest part was dealing with rude customers. Some of the managers were okay they were sometiming.I loved some of my coworkers"
good,Customer would come and expect for one to be professional in their job skills. Customer Service with a genuine smile and knowledge.
good,"The typical day consisted of greet customers when they came through your line, ring up items, handle the cash, and help bag if needed. I learned how to handle the money more securely. The hardest part of working this job was when it gets packed and customers are all in lines."
good,There is always something different going on and many things to learn each day. I have been with the company for 6 years and I am still learning.
good,Great place to work. A lot of work and responsibility. Hard working job. Taking care of 4+ residents a day. Co workers are nice. Paitents are nice.
good,"great interaction with fellow employees, great work environment, too much to do in 1 day, stressful at times, greeting customers most gratifying"
good,"Kroger is a good company to work for. The most enjoyable part of the day is the people that I work with, and the customers that come in and shop."
good,"This is a good place to work as long as you realize that grocery stores do not like to pay more than they have to for work. If you have a good manager/store manager, the job is much more rewarding."
good,I am fortunate to have had the opportunity to work for this company. I learned a lot about retail and am able to share my knowledge with co-workers.
good,"I loved working with my customers!  I spent the first 3 hours of every day on the phone.  I had 1400 accounts and everyone, whether they were passed due or not, received a phone call from me.  I started this part of my job in AZ the day after 9/11.  All of my accounts were in NY or close by.  I spent the next 6 months rewriting almost all of my accounts.  Although I felt management tried to create an atmosphere of fear in order to get people to perform.  Meeting projections was imperative and so you worked until you got it done.  Failure was not an option.  When I had a baby, I could no longer justify spending that much time away from home and chose to leave.  I needed a job that would allow me to be a Mom and not be at work all the time."
good,"I been with Kroger for almost 8 years now, and its always changing to help employees have a better work life as well as creating career opportunities. The only thing is the building is older and the equipment needs to be replaced or fixed."
good,"I loved working fro Krogers, but I had moved to far away at the time to keep it. They were a great employer there, always room for advancement, great team work, quarterly raises. Kept you very busy."
good,"great place to work if you can work 2ed shift, learn all about the different types of medicine and how it can help someone."
good,I attended the floral counter and greeted many customers as they came into the store. Most of them I began to know by name! I would create floral arrangements and attend other duties as needed. I won many awards for customer service achievements during my time there.
good,Good place to work while in school however should not be a career path. They have good packages and raises. Alot of hiring and can be moved into different departments.
good,This is a typical retail situation.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers and associates reach their goals.  The hardest part of the job is being in an office where there is no privacy to conduct business.
good,A great starting job with plenty of opportunities to advance into many different career paths. Fun and easy to work with employees who were very helpful in helping new workers. The constant needed maintenance of the fuel pumps was a tedious task. The many different people met everyday made for a great customer service learning experience.
good,"Retail job where customers come first.  Strive for customer satisfaction.  Great prices, quality product.  Every store is different in their staff."
good,"Although you may start at minimum wage, there is a lot of growth potential from Department Head to Co-Manager to Store Manager.  They are also willing to train through Internships and a Management Development Program."
good,"typical day is working through same, easy tasks"
good,"I got hired on last summer as a courtesy clerk and still haven't been promoted to cashier, which seems to be the average. I liked it at first, even though some of the managers who have been there a long time are extremely unapproachable and strongly dislike / look down upon the teenage employees. I felt negatively singled out more than once in my first few months, but now that I've been there almost a year, I suppose I'm the ""senior bagger"" or ""next-in-line"" and have accumulated slightly more respect. The work as a bagger includes cleaning bathrooms, taking out the trash, sweeping the whole store for exactly 30 minutes or more by corporate mandate, pushing carts inside in literally all weather except lightning, cleaning up spills, putting back misplaced items, and then bagging. Some of the employees literally don't do their job and can get away with it because Kroger can't fire anyone. Some of the employees are fun to be around. Doing lot is the worst part of the job; I've done it in 100 degrees, 20 degrees and snowing, pouring rain, everything. Customers are constantly sexist to women pushing in carts and I almost get ran over several times a week. There are no policies on quality customer service and some employees ""jokingly"" complain to all the customers. Kroger has a seniority promotion policy, but some of the new hires manage to skip the line by moving into a department and basically just sucking at it, so management has no choice but to make them a cashier since they can't be moved back down to baggers."
good,"My typical day of work consists of myself giving the best customer service available. I have an ability to work as a manger but I can work as an hourly associate as well. I believe management needs to lead by example, be committed to their decisions, and hold everyone accountable. I take a lot of pride in how I do my work no matter how simple the job may be. I enjoy working with a variety of people and come to work with a positive attitude daily."
good,"Get to meet different people from different backgrounds. Sales are huge, so you'll always be asked about that. Most days you will get the customers in and out."
good,"Kroger has a lot of associates that have been there 20 + years, It has been quite successful and continues to grow as a company."
good,"A typical day is helping customers and ringing people up at the register. I learned how to deal with people, both customers and coworkers and how to handle responsibilities. The hardest part of the job is also the most enjoyable: the people. Dealing with people, can be exciting. You are able to meet a variety of people and interact with them. This is a fun part of the job as long as the customer is happy."
good,"Nice place to work at, nice employees and coworkers. No room for growth and they make it hard to work around school schedule."
good,"My very first job, great workplace to grow and learn at. Employess are very friendly & helpful. The mangers keep a good professional relationship with their employees."
good,"Working a Kroger for 1 year I accomplished a lot. I worked in three different departments which were as a Deli Clerk, Cashier, and Fuel Clerk. This allowed me to gain a lot of knowledge about each of the different departments."
good,"Its a really busy place with not a whole lot of help due to it being a baby company, people are lucky to get 20 hours a week there, but overall i learned alot and am glad i spent the time i did with the company and the company let me move up and learn other things for when i go out and and find something better."
good,Most days at Kroger are pretty busy and fast paced and than some days are slow. I have learned to put the customer first and to provide customer service with a smile and proper eye contact. Management goes over and beyond to provide associates with the tools they need to provide excellent customer service. The associates at Kroger are friendly and provide the best customer service. The hardest part of the job is identifying fraudulent purchases and the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to interact with people and help find what they need.
good,another great company who enjoys succeeding so doing so will keep employees happy and motivated. management was great and always working.
good,Every day was a new adventure while working here. They offered opportunities for further training and chances to advance with the company over time.
good,A typical day at work involved interacting with co-workers and customers on a daily basis. I learned how to operate the cash register and supervise others. Co-workers were great people to be around. The hardest part was working under a lot of pressure. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people.
good,"Typical day involves getting carts, bagging, helping management, general cleaning, and keeping the store in working order. All or only one of these things can happen throughout the day in any order,"
good,"This is an okay company to work for.  Management is a bit too much, meaning too many chiefs and not enough Indians.  Hours are not easy to get.  Not a really bad company to work for altogether though."
good,"Coworkers are real cool, most customers are nice and respectful. Managers aren't strict or too demanding and work with you when it comes to scheduling. Only downside is the pay, if you're looking to make more than a few cents above minimum wage."
good,"A typical day at work consists of breaking down pallets and stocking shelves, while maintaining a clean work environment and providing customer assistance. I have been exposed to working in a team while employed at Kroger. The managers are mostly friendly and approachable, and co-workers are also friendly. The hardest part of the job is probably all the bending and kneeling. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping out the customers."
good,I liked working here. I just ran reports for management. Co-workers were really nice. The only problem I had was I would run out of work to do.
good,Ralphs is a great company to work for. Offering great benefits and  job stability. Their customer first focus is evident from the office to the stores where with the shoppers. Everyone is friendly and welcoming.
good,Can be a heard job and not the friendliest management or co-workers. Scheduling sucked and not very flexible. Overall if your desperate I would apply here.
good,"While the Kroger Company is a decent employer, work with them can be a bit tedious. That said, advancement is easy to attain for most employees as cashiers, stockers, dairy personnel, etc., are always being transferred to other stores and need new people to fill those positions."
good,"Management was very nice and accepting, although it was very sloppy and laid back. Enjoyed working with everybody and changing what department I was in ."
good,"The company is customer oriented and give place to happy customers. Again, the company gives paid training to associates"
good,"solid company. its definitely is a company that you can retire from given the proper outlets. It is very challenging, but has many rewards"
good,Kroger's is a large company with strict guidelines. They give you the information to know what you need to do in your job to be successful. The deli department is very clean as the food safety is followed strictly.
good,the management was poorly wouldn't work with my schedule. the store was good but the people who was working there not so good
good,Great company to work for and to develop personal skills with customers and other employees. It has great benefits and they have very flexible schedules.
good,I thought the co-workers didn't work as a team. The management kept on switching month to month. I worked hard and gave 100% effort when I was on the clock. Unfortunately I had to leave because of some personal experience.
good,I learn a lot  at work i enjoy working with  people i have over 20 yer experience with customer care.for the company in the right one i love work Cumberland OB/GYN stale i work for if they need help so
good,"i go in for 6 in the morning and take expired product off the shelf and then count what is still good and what is bad, then i package what was made for the morning to put on the shelf for the day for customers and then slice bread, take care of customers and also get product ready for cooking for the night time crew."
good,"Responsible for assigned departments on shrink, set up, sales and profits of each department, by merchandising, pricing and suggested sell in order to maintaining profits."
good,"Overall Employee-friendly, great HR team! Quick to resolve issues at work. Individualised employee care needs. Great benefits: matching 5% on 401K after 1 year employment."
good,"I had a good and lasting impression from working and going to kroger, Very friendly and helpful staff. Very clean and functional"
good,"Ralph's is a great place to work when your younger, as you learn everything there is about a job and whats needed in a tough fast paced environment.  First job it will prepare you, however its not a job you want for the rest of your life.  It should bring awareness that this job isnt end game and you should strive for more.  It does give you great skills and you deal with all sorts of people from your city/town."
good,"It was alright working there when I was straight out of high school. Wasn't really anything, but just a part time job to make money before I went back to school, very easy work, depending on what department you're in."
good,I had a good time working with interesting people as a teen in high school.  The store was ideally placed between home and school.
good,"The most enjoyable aspect of working at Kroger were the customers. If I was having a bad day, sometimes it was the customers that would turn it around for me."
good,"•	Raised our overall total Gross Margin percent from 24.3% to 33.5% over 2 quarters of the year (May-October 2015). "
good,"Within Kroger i have held many positions all of which i have enjoyed,Kroger has offered me mnay learning and training experiences throughtout my years here and i will always be thankful."
good,"No surprises here. Co-workers are great, good job to have while in school, pay is slightly higher than competitors. Interacting with customers is mostly fun."
good,"I learned how to work the cash register and deal with customers."
good,its a good job if management likes you but overall it is a good job to have when you are in high school and you are out of class
good,I enjoyed my employment through the Kroger company. I was able to gain experience in customer service as well as many other valuable skills.
good,Come to work interact with my co workers and be as courteous to the customers making sure their experience was a good one.
good,"I have learned excellent customer service skills that I have used and developed in other positions I have held. A typical day mostly consists of providing the customers with friendly and efficient services. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to interact with people on a daily basis, there are several difficult things about the job, but nothing too difficult."
good,I really enjoyed my time working for Fred Meyer Pharmacy and my former co-workers. Very fast-paced which made the day go by a lot faster.
good,"I have enjoyed working at the Kroger Company for the past 37 years. Over the years I have developed relationships with many long time customers, which makes going to work a pleasure. It has been rewarding to help my co-workers grow, and succeed with the company."
good,"i learned how to provide great customer service, i learned how to answer phones professionally, speak great with customers"
good,"On a typical day i would clock in at 5 and clock out at 9. during those hours, i would usually start with an hour outside getting buggies. After my hour was up, i would go inside for about 30 mins until one of the supervisors told me to clean the bathrooms, break room, upstairs offices, and get all trash; this usually take about 2 hours. When that was done, i would spend ,my last hour either cleaning registers or putting away misplace. The Management changed alot. The hardest part of the job was getting the buggies on hot days. The best part was interacting with the customers."
good,Started as a teenager and learned about the vaule of working and earning your own. Learned that i could do anything I wanted to.
good,Filling orders by picking and using pallet jack. then moving order to loading docks for shipping. lots of overtime if needed
good,This job teaches you to work any many different departments. It provides many opportunities to move within the store and experiences to take to your next job.
good,Definitely a fun work place during high school years. Management was great they worked around your schedule and was always there for anything you needed. I started out as a clerk then shortly after moved to being a cashier which was much better.
good,"Doing duties as a pharmacy tech, doing produce deepening, checking out patient's at the register answering the phone and other duties as a pharmacy tech."
good,"overall a nice job with good benifits, cool people to work with, clean working environment but low pay and not enoff hours"
good,"I come to work at 11p.m. and work until 6:45a.m. on the weekdays and 7a.m., or until I'm done with my task on weekends. I unpack the pallets of boxes and place them on carts for each isle. Then we spot where the items go. I then start unpacking the boxes to the shelf's. What I learned about the job is that working together is important because if your not done, someone will help you out. "
good,"They give poor training and will mock coworkers and customers Feels like a toxic work place and was just dirty. I would not recommend this job to someone, the management is a joke, if you have a question they will laugh in your face."
good,"I enjoy the variety at work as everyday was something different. I work in multiple departments and have been trained in Produce, Floral, Liquor, and Cashier."
good,"I worked mornings and late evenings mostly so there wasn't very much traffic in the store. My days consisted mostly of routine work responsibilities and some coworker and customer socialization. On paper nothing too exciting happened from day to day, but it was enjoyable because of the people you get to meet and socializing with your coworkers during down time. Learned a lot about food and that almost all people have the most random quirks when it comes to their food."
good,great place to work  get to meet a lot of different people .Also see what household like to eat   also while there ive learn great customer service skills .
good,"It is a good place to work.  You meet different kinds of people some with nice attitudes and some with ugly attitudes. "
good,I liked the hours that I worked but I didn't like how when there was a big problem with the line they would still run and not stop the line to fix the problem.
good,"I learned alot in the 3 years i worked at Ralphs, they werent stingy with hours and they worked with your schedule, but the part i enjoyed most was connecting with the customers."
good,Good benefits but the pay sucks. I love working with my coworkers. Have so much fun working there. Some of the management is amazing. Some don't care about you. I changed my availability and they still not working around. They expect you to only focus on Kroger's.
good,"Great place to work a place to gain basic skills such as communication, teamwork, and understanding a fast pace environment."
good,"I loved this job. There are so many great people to work with, and even better management. Kroger offers great benefits too."
good,Good work environment. Positive and friendly workers customers. Willing to be flexible and work with your schedule. Workers were like family.
good,"The deli/chicken shop was a fast paced environment.  Because it was two departments in one, we helped each other when needed.  The only thing I didn't do was fry chicken which was okay with me; however, I did clean out the ovens frequently.  And wash dishes and wash dishes.  You would think there would be that much to wash in a deli but there was."
good,very un respected of employed an don't think about driver life outside on there company/ think we should be there all time to make living an don't respect there personnel all they worried is them selves
good,Nice people and work atmosphere. Picks employee of the month and week usually 8 months of the year. Currently has too much turnover in Management field- transfers happen and would be willing to hire new managers.
good,"No day is ever the same in my role. Most of my tasks have remained the same, but I am always flexible and willing to learn, so I am put on various tasks when needed. I have a good support system around me, unfortunately there is no opportunity for me to advance at this time. I really enjoy designing the floral arrangements, it allows me to demonstrate my creative ability. I also enjoy going above and beyond and making a customer feel special."
good,"Being a retail pharmacy technician at Fred Meyer was ok.  The work load was high, but manageable.  I was surprised to experience the hostility of some pharmacy customers, but management and my coworkers were very supportive."
good,Just be a hard working person. Good work ethic pays off its just sometimes really hard to advance or get a pay raise enough to actually be able to support yourself.
good,Working for Kroger was a great experience for me because it was my first job. I enjoyed working there and i enjoyed the people i worked with. I just did not enjoy the way management handled my scheduling.
good,It was a very well organized store and I enjoyed my department and the knowledge. My managers where very helpful and customer interactions where fun.
good,"Unload truck, stock shelves, condition items, work backstock and peyton. "
good,"As an Asst. Deli Manager, my days are blurred with waiting on and serving hundreds of customers per day.  It is delightful and fulfilling; however, I am getting older (mid 50's) so at this point of my life I need to find something just as rewarding but less standing and less lifting.  But working with customers do not bother what so ever.  I have been with Krogers for the past seven years and before it is too late for me to move on the tme is now for me to find something a little less stressful."
good,Too many hours. Not enough benefits. I am part time working full time hours. I get one vacation and on average I work 38 hours a week.
good,love working there. Great people. Great environment. Co-workers are great to work with. Never felt like an outsider. People are caring & fun. Learned how things work inside the meat/seafood section of a supermarket.
good,Over the years this company has seen a lot of change but over all it is still a great company to work for. The pay is decent and the benefits are very good and very affordable. There is great opportunity for advancement as well. Can be pretty stressful at times.
good,"Cant keep any ""good"" employees. Management often runs them out the door. Slow hireing process. Seniority conflicts often."
good,I really enjoyed working for market basket while attending high school because they taught me how to interact well with customers and also how to work with others around me. The management were really supportive and worked really well with my school schedule. The hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with rude customers at times but other than that I enjoyed every aspect of the job especially working with others.
good,Excellent place to learn the extensive details of being an effective manager. Typical mgmt hours ranged from 7am - 5pm or 1pm - 11pm.
good,"Enjoyable and not super stressful job with the help of management. The store and its associates gave a very ""friendly and family oriented"" environment."
good,"their is nothing but drama at Kroger, everyone is always talking about someone else, and the drama doesn't just stay in their department it goes throughout the whole store"
good,"Not the worst place to work. It is a job and it does pay well.Co-workers are not the greatest people in the world. They will sometimes not show up for work, leave early and even take longer breaks."
good,Managed 20-30 people daily. Great co workers and management! They are what make this job enjoyable although the pay is very little.
good,"I would arrive in the morning and set the meat case, restock freezer,price and wrap meat, rotate and reduce close date items.  "
good,Days starts busy due to people getting off of work around 5pm. Work usually slows down around 7pm. Management is helpful and knowledgeable in many areas of the store.
good,It was very hard work but it was exciting and very fast paced and I enjoyed it quite a bit and they have an incentive pay for top performers!
good,Can be a good to work. Each location is a different environment based on that store manager's philosophy. Lots of turnover.
good,Bagged groceries and pushed in carts everyday but never liked the customers when they asked you to rush. But i liked going to work everyday because it was descent hours and all the emoloyees were easy to get along with.
good,I went in everyday about 7:00 am and went through all my e-mails to start process for EDI. Took calls and answed questions from EDI vendors. Was available for all the clerks that worked under me. The most important thing I learned in this position was patientions with people and that we all learn differently and at a different pace. The last Manager that I had in the department was not as I would have like him to be but I did my best to get along with him. My co-workers were what made my job enjoyable. I loved going to work everyday just because of them and they helped me as much as I helped them. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the manager that was new to being a manager and felt he had to make a name for himself and didn't accecpt the experiance he had that worked for him. I enjoyed most of the day as long as I had people around me that were positive and enjoyed what they were doing. I hope that I was part of the joy that they had when they were working for me.
good,"Audit daily reports for warehouse payables ensuring correct pricing shipped to the stores.  Process manual payment for invoices.

good,"I maintained customer service responsibilities throughout the day, I assisted customers with any questions that had and checked people out in an effective and timely manor."
good,"It's a good place for people looking to start working.  It's a lot of work, more than people think it will be.  Usually work consists of bagging groceries, ringing up groceries, collecting shopping carts."
good,i really enjoyed this type of work i stayed busy and love to stay busy. i was comortable with the job and couldnt cmplain abot the pay i would do i again
good,I worked there for a long time and it was a good place to learn new skills and have a great time doing it. I would recommend anyone who would want to work there.
good,This job is very easy and its a outgoing atmosphere. A lot of the staff is very nice. The task that are asked of you are not very hard and they are pretty straight forward.
good,"Kroger is a fun place to work in, however for the younger crowd who are trying to pay their way through college, the wages are not sufficient enough to be comfortable. Pay increases happen only after so many hours one works that you can be at minimum wage for a long while. The management is friendly and so are the employees. All in all, when working at Kroger, everyone becomes one big family."
good,"As a deli clerk I worked in the bakery and in the deli. I had to learn proper food handling, communication, suggestive sells and multitasking techniques."
good,"A typical day as an employee of Kroger is fast paced and exciting. During my time there I have learned many things, such as: time management, how to handle difficult situations involving customers, and how to follow proper procedures to maintain a safe and effective workplace. Both my co-workers and members of management make this job enjoyable and are very easy to count on no matter the situation. Although at times customers make certain tasks slightly difficult, I find that getting to meet new people is the most enjoyable part of my day."
good,"For the most part it is fast paced, meeting goals, keeping customers happy, getting them in and out quickly as possible. We want the customers time to be short but sweet I guess you could say. Management changes every few years, so by the time you really get a feel for them they get sent to another store. I love my co-workers, most of them I've worked with since day one. The hardest part of my job is letting a customer leave unhappy, I strive to please every one of my customers, so letting them down makes me feel like I failed them. The most enjoyable part of my job are my regular customers, the ones I know by name and genuinely care about as a people, in the last 7 years of employment with Kroger I've developed a your heartache is my heartache attachment for most of them."
good,I like staying busy and cashier job was great.  I learned a lot about Kroger policies of handling a grocery store.  Customers was nice and  I was told by manager to make sure customers are satisfy.
good,The management was friendly and helpful. Working there was pretty interesting and there are several opportunities for advancement if you have a degree. I moved away from cashiering because it was pretty stressful i would recommend not working in the front of the store.
good,Great customer service and seeing a smile on customers face was  my job and also my goal.I enjoy helping others and know that i can make a slight difference in someones day.
good,"Typical work day, I go into work and unload the truck. Separate the totes with products in them to be works on green carts. Work products to the shelves."
good,"A normal day at work, I learned how to work as cashier skill that I did not had. The management did what they have to do, my co-workers all were a good team, I think that there is no hard work that can not me done with good interpersonal attitude. Finally, I enjoyed the job because I was able to work with very good people and clients."
good,I was a courtesy clerk at Kroger for my first job. I liked it but sometimes you really could feel that you were at the bottom of the totem pole.
good,"Fine company to work for. Fast past environment. Fun good coworkers challenging. Friendly, everyone is willing to help all the time."
good,"I enjoyed the environment I worked in, along with leading a team of highly motivated employees.Management was always changing, most of the managers were easy going but also had their mind set on success."
good,The work is not difficult.I worked in the front end as a cashier I enjoyed working with my coworkers who were relatively my age (high school- college).
good,"Fast-paced and tedious. Co-workers and customers made working here a positive experience. Dealing with shoplifters was stressful. Overall, enjoyed working for Kroger through high school and again as an adult."
good,Kroger is a great first job. Everything you do is very simple and gets you ready to move on to bigger and better things. I started bagging groceries for customers and then was trained on cash register. You are socializing with customers all day. It makes the time go by a bit quicker. The shipping and receiving was a mess at my Kroger location and no increase in pay which was a bummer. The co-workers are friendly and out going.
good,"Hello, I am a hard working women who is looking for a good paying job so I can provide for my daughter and for myself the right way.

good,Great place of employment with excellent management and training. I enjoyed my time working for this company very much.
good,I like working there but it's only part time. Was told no more full time positions. Can't say enough good things about the store manager and co- manager team. Great co-workers too. Employee discounts on banner brands are a big plus.
good,"Ralph's is a grocery store that is always busy. Which means there is room for advancement, if you are open to it. It is nonstop bagging, cleaning, go-backs, pushing carts, and customer service. Management is dry and wants people to work and not play around. They want the employees to always make sure we are cleaning something."
good,a very productive work environment that allowed me to meet wonderful people full of energy. i loved working there and the other employees
good,Clock in make sure each table and tag on tables match the fruit or vegetable in it's tag if it was low i would fill it if we could not find it or we didn't have it i would clean the table and replace it with something else. I learned that no matter what krogers you go to nothing inside that store will stay the same and Market places are all just in a big race to see who falls first.Management at kroger changed all the time so some good some bad. Some of my co-workers were really bad and didn't care and then there were some that were just amazing. The job was pretty easy the hardest part would be getting customers to fill out these cards telling us they were highly satisfied. The most enjoyable part of my job was meet of the new people everyday.
good,A typical day at work is not fun and stress. I learned nothing because I already know what to do. The management is alright. The co-workers is sneaky and talking about. The hardest part of the job is nothing. The most enjoyable part of the job is inactive with the customers
good,"I learned to take initiative, as the department managers worked morning shifts. I often had to make a judgement call, and quickly became somewhat of a supervisor to the more recent hirees."
good,"Working in the Deli at Fred Meyers was fun. Learned how to make a lot of salads that I've never heard of before."
good,There were always new initiatives and projects to install. I learned a lot about ammonia refrigeration and facility maintenance.The hardest part of the job was the ever-changing objectives. The most enjoyable part of the job was the never ending education and training.
good,"My day is split between Plant Engineering, Project Engineering and Maintenance supervision. This includes fulfilling corporate required action plans, reports, capital plan development and daily plant maintenance supervision. I work very closely with our Safety, Production and Quality departments improving the daily operations and with an eye to future business and the methods to achieve these goals."
good,Working at Pick N' Save was a wonderful first job. I was able to gain a lot of first hand customer service experience. The most enjoyable and rewarding part of the job was getting to know my regular customers. I was able to gain knowledge about cash handling that was also useful at my next job.
good,"I was trained on register and self checkout. What I like best about working for the Kroger is management are pretty nice, understanding  and flexible with schedules. The hardest part of the job is only working part time you don't revise benefits and it is vary hard to become a full time employ"
good,it is a decent place to work. I like most of the people I work with directly and they make it worth it but its more stress with management than I thought it would be. its good for a high school student or for a first job. it isn't really ideal for someone needing to make enough to pay bills while going to college. Kroger works for some but not sure it does for me.
good,I would ride around warehouse with my headsets on operating a rider pallet jack selecting the products to be shipped.Palletizing every product.
good,I liked Kroger's but the customers were just to wild but I knew most of the people that worked there and that didn't work there that would come in so I was comfortable but overall the supervisors were cool and the managers were ok.
good,"Kroger Pharmacy is a fast paced environment where you have to constantly be on your toes.  Not paying attention meant making mistakes.  My co-workers are not just co-workers they are now some of my closest friends.  You can always count on management to be there when you need them, always looking out for their employees.  Working in the pharmacy, you learn a lot and you are required to learn a lot like company policies and/or state and federal laws.  At the end of the day the best part was knowing the customers were happy and taken care of and you did your best to see that."
good,Management was very understanding.  The company did have issues retaining employees which often put a larger workload on the long term employees.
good,"I worked for Kroger many years ago. Did everything from bagging to Customer Service. Liked the job. I like customer service, so it was great for me. My boss was very good and treated me fairly."
good,"if you make the right move you get yelled out"
good,"Not enough hours scheduled to support yourself. Only hire part time. Takes over 12 yrs to become full time ."
good,I love coming to work everyday even came on my day off if they needed. I learned a lot the grocery company they do a lot to keep customers happy. My co-workers were great they helped more than my managers did but overall it was a great first job I would go back if I could.
good,"Pick N Save is a great way to start when you're young. Also great place for people looking for a fast pace job. It's busy to a point that you have to be on your toes. It's a wonderful place for people who are looking for great people, all the associates are awesome, and very respectful."
good,"Working in the Kroger deli was a fun job. I had nice co-workers that liked to have fun while we performed our duties. There were certain employees that thrived on negativity and trying to cause issues within the workplace for their own benefit, but those employees have since been removed. Overall, being a deli clerk was a very fun and educational experience."

good,"Usually  on any given day there were orders to fill, inventory to take count of, reports to produce, and some days there was filing of invoices and payments. packing orders was demanding and interesting, the types businesses that we packed for and the items that were requested. "
good,I think Smiths was a great opportunity. I loved the fact that I had the option to grow in the company and be promoted. It taught me to have patience and great customer service.
good,"I worked at the self check out and cashier. greet customer, help with problems, and guide customer with anything they needed."
good,"A typical day of work at Kroger, was interesting, fun and productive. The co-workers that I had turned into a family of sorts.  The management team was great within the call center.  The hardest part of the job was not knowing exactly what team I was part of .  They were consistently moving me around to try and find the team that fit everything that I was capable of and knew."
good,Kroger was a fast and busy grocery store I worked 3rd shift and was the only cashier up front they were still really busy in the middle of the night. they had me also to check all the cash receipts and bank drops. they were clean and pretty good to their employees I enjoyed working there
good,Great job for someone with great people skills and loving being around others.
good,"Has taught me how to make sure customers are treated as a priority."
good,Ralph's provides their management with all the skills one would need to be successful in the position they were engaged. It also offers opportunity for advancement. I believe their vision of customer service is a commitment to which they are dedicated and maintain a constant pursuit.
good,My typical day at work would be stocking the shelf's and then I would be a cashier. I was very busy and I was always working. I was always working the midnight shift. Even though I worked a lot I had very little pay.
good,"Kroger is a good place to work while in college, they work around your schedule. The job provided me with useful skills of customer service."
good,I worked in every department and did everything in the store that I could possibly do.  I think is a great company to work for but I got heart problems and had to quit.

I enjoyed being able to interact with people and get them what they needed quickly and efficiently. My co-workers were very friendly and readily welcomed me to the team.
good,"A typical day at work for me is I'll clock in at the store, grab the keys (if I am morning shift), and head down to the fuel kiosk. I'll unlock the door, turn on the lights, open the safe to count my till, and verify it. Once it's been verified, I put it in the register, sign in, and start on my daily shift checklist. This includes counting cigarettes and cleaning my pumps. Once I have completed this checklist, I switch tills with the person taking over for me, and go to clock out. The part I enjoy most is interacting with customers and my coworkers."
good,"They are a good company and have great add's, It is hard to work "
good,"it didn't feel like work it felt like home always having to clean the place up and scrub registers "
good,I learned how to help customers much more effectively in a different manner at this Ralph's. I learned more leader and management skills here in which I will now implement at home as well as in the work place. The hardest part of this job was the feeling that I wasn't being paid my worth given my customer service experience. The most enjoyable part of my job was serving the customers and making sure they were my priority.
good,"On a typical day at Kroger i will have at-least four or five order that need to get accomplished . Once I have accomplished these orders then I will make arrangement , or help run a registar when i am asked by management.

good,"It could be boring or more crazy then anything depending on the day. I worked all different shifts with different people. typical day is refilling our products and dealing with customers. My direct manager is a wonderful person to work for. Makes the day go by faster. The upper management can be like slave drivers asking the impossible at times, and also just totally forget you are there. hardest part of job is dealing with nasty customers."
good,There really isn't a typical day at work with this job. Every single day there is something different to deal with whether it's handling external theft investigations or entering reports that deal with employee misconduct. I've learned a lot of interesting ways to conduct interviews and interrogations of suspected thieves and employees stealing from the company. I work with a great network of investigators who are all very helpful. The hardest part of this job is just keeping everyone up to date with the newest happenings during an investigation. What I enjoy most is knowing that I'm making an impact and deterring theft when people are stopped in the act.
good,Kroger is a good company that provides a lot of training. Kroger does a great job of fostering a safe work environment and many growth opportunities.

good,"A typical day consisted of cleaning and stocking the sales floor, organizing incoming stock and fulfilling customer requests. I learned the value of customer relationships and time management with larger time sensitive tasks.

This goes unpunished do to the unionization of many workers at Kroger, although that is my opinion."

The first few days on the job were the hardest only because as a new hire there are things that you still have to learn, but once those skills are mastered everything else is a breeze. So far I've learned how to predict our customers shopping patterns with this information my co-workers and I are able to have hot and fresh food prepared and ready to serve."
good,"Kroger is a grate place to work for a first job or a summer job. I started as a bagger, just getting carts from the lots and bagging custimer items, also helping them to their car if needed. I was then premoted to Day grocery, just reciving kroger brand items and putting them on the shelf. After that i was shortly premoted again to Night stalker witch instead of just stalking and reciving kroger brand item i was then reciving all items in throughout the store.

good,"Kroger is like any other retail job. I didn't notice anything with grocery. Being in a union is actually a good benefit as well. I broke my ankle in the winter and was unable to to put pressure on it. Any other job where I would be making minimum wage, I would get fired if I couldn't have made it to work. Being in a union I got the necessary time off to heal and still had a job."
good,if your a good and hard worker you will go far and the co-workers are friendly
good,"A typical day at work was pretty hectic. The hardest part of the day would have to be lot. Lot was when you had to return the carts to the inside of the store. First, if you had to follow someone who didn't really know how to do lot, you had a lot of carts to collect. second, it was extremely hot and you would always be pouring sweat when you was done."
good,"Everyone pushed to get many things done with little help, low pay for associates, union environment, turnover, very high expectation.  Management working most weekends and holidays. 50+ hours a week. Very little work/life balance."

I especially liked working in Nutrition as I gained knowledge of great new nutritional meals for myself.  I feel this is a family-friendly corporation.
good,"Generally, the days that I work, I would come in and start cooking from the moment I enter the deli area. Catching the food inventory up to par in order to have enough food to last throughout the day. It is not a very hard job to do, but I have to attend to customers, clean,cook and stock all by myself. Only enjoyable part of the job to me personally, is just a paycheck. The job itself isn't great and the pay isn't any better but I am working. I am grateful for that."
good,Its a pretty well managed store. Everyone is really helpful and wants to help you.
good,they honestly cant fire you because of the union. but they work you until you are almost dead. at the most minimum pay possible. even if you switch departments they still wont raise your pay. the people are easy to get along with.
good,"i'm not sure if it's like this at every Kroger, but it is streesfukl workling here, like any other customer servie job. kroger focuses more on its customers and doesn't really do anything towards making sure the employees are happy as well. The pay is decent, but is low compared to other retail pharmacies."
good,I was in college and I needed a job. They said it was mandatory to join the Union. had no choice if I wanted to work there.

I learned how to appreciate others uniqueness and how to understand people from all walks of life. In fact, helping the patients was the best part of the job. The staff were friendly and we had a great work environment."
good,One will learn how to be productive and how to prioritize tasks in order to first serve customers but to as well be able to complete all assigned duties on time and to completion. Multitasking is a must.
good,I go to the back of store and start to unload trucks with the forklift and separate the pallets and use power pallet jack to take pallets down off top shelf and then sort the pallets and go to the aisles and stock the store. Management worked just as hard as me and very laid back and understanding. Co-Workers very quiet and to themselves. Hardest part the shift most enjoyable is you work your own pace.
good,"Running cash registers and bagging groceries. Co-workers are friendly and helpful. I learned about customer service and dealing with the public as this was my first job ever. The hardest part was the measly pay and poor hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was the nice customers and great, helpful co-workers."

good,"unloaded deliveries, organized warehouse, stocked grocery, frozen, and dairy department. operated moving equipment."
good,"I learned a lot of helpful skills and met some great people. Get in there bright and early and put the deli together, get things prepared for the rest of the day. I learned how to operate a lot of dangerous machinery and developed better people skills. Due to an overall absence of management we learned how to be pretty self-sufficient. It was a good time, making money with good people and helping people out it's just that corporate didn't know what they wanted out of the deli and threw us a lot of curve balls out of nowhere but we handled it."

good,I work the part time shifts that I want they have been very flexible allowing me to complete school and play a college sport.
good,"Everyday I would come into work and start bagging groceries.  Any other task I had to do was always entertaining as well.  I'm very flexible when it comes to job tasks.  I learned that if you smile at a customer, it makes them feel more welcomed.  This will make the customer want to return.  Management wasn't always good, but every place has their ups and downs.  The co-workers were easy to get along with.  The hardest part of my job was getting pushed around by the management because I was very low in the food chain of the store.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the nice customers that would come in.  Helping people has always been a favorite of mine."

good,"•    Giving customers my full attention"
good,good co. but the manager at the time didnt want young ppl in the store working but the co was great
good,"Everyone got along really well for the majority of the time I worked there. Back in the Deli, where I worked, we had to slice meat and cheese. We had to cook our chicken and other hot foods. Prepare all the cold salads. At the end of the day we had to clean everything up. The hardest part would have probably been keeping a smile on my face to all the rude customers. We all somehow managed. The most enjoyable part would have been being able to help anyone and everyone that came up to our counter. May not have been a life changing experience for some, but others needed that friendly person to talk to them and help them out a little."
good,My coworkers were great to work with and we all got along with each other.
good,It was an amazing experience. I loved interacting with the people that came in everyday.
good,"A typical day at work can be stressful due to it being busy or us being short staffed but all in all it's nothing that you wouldn't deal with anywhere else.  Your coworkers make it better and getting to know the customers brings another good experience to the table.  Kroger is all about giving the best possible service to it's customers, because the customer is our number one priority.  We want you to come shop at Kroger and love it and it make you want to come back."

good,Working in bakery.  Learning how to multitask. The managers were very laid-back.
good,selling cutco for vector was a good jump start to the job force and also a good jump in the world of customer service. working for vector puts you in people's homes right in front of the customer. to me this was great since im a social person. through working at vector i was able to set up a good foundation for my expectations for the working world and my expectations i hold for myself
good,Good work environment. Get to meet new people everyday. Help individuals everyday.
good,"The bakery and deli was hard messy work, there was always something to do. I loved being a cashier, being able to get to know your customers and you help them."
good,"For Pay-less I would usually arrive to work 15 mins early where i would get a quick snack, put in my log in code and then head to the cashier they needed me at. On slow days it was nice, because i could talk to my co-workers who were so amazing and helpful. On the busy days those it was crazy, customers waiting on you and getting mad about certain things. Through those hectic times you learn how to work under stress and hectic situations. My most enjoyable part of the job was making friends and getting to talk to my usual customers, when I had to leave for college I was honestly sad."
good,"It's a good place to work. The co-workers are nice, management is helpful and they allow you to set the hours that you want to work."
good,I learned how to work with my co-workers and it was a good to work with the costumers and learn how to stock sometimes it was very slow.

good,"Not bad place to work. Some of the customers aren't very nice but you learn to deal. Everyone has good days and bad days. Management team isn't hard to work for, very enjoyable and they care."
good,"My review of the place was being very fast paced. I have learned to work in a fast paced environment. Management wasn't as great as you would expect them to be, but they were average. My co-workers helped out and did their part of the job. The hardest part of the job was others not showing up to work. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people."
good,"My job at Customer service is to be attentive and ready to give my customers the best service possible. The first thing that I do is count my till to make sure numbers match before I start any transactions. I then began working either backstock, markdowns or any other tasks given to me, waiting to be called to assist a customer with any of the following, Sending Western Union transactions, Bill pay through Western Union, Paying bills through check free bill pay, also assisting in ticket master and the lottery machine. After continuing this routine for the rest of the day when closing time comes near I clean the service desk, count my till, and file all my transactions and reports into  my notebook including my refunds. I then turn my money into the safe and that concludes a normal day at work."
good,Everyday was about the same.  Employees were great but management always refused raise request
good,This was my first job and I learned so much in the customer service field. management definitely needs improvement though.
good,Working in a retail store is a good fit for young teens. Kroger also has a good reputation with satisfying customers throughout America.

good,"A typical work day included: clocking into work, making sure the register I was assigned to had been counted by the previous cashier (to ensure there were no discrepancies), wiping down the register in its entirety, assisting customers, and at the end of the work day counting down the register for the next cashier."
good,"Good job, just doesn't pay well. I enjoyed my bosses, but it seems to be getting more corporate oriented which I don't like."
good,Good starting company but upper management has a disconnect with what happens in stores on a daily basis
good,"A typical work day at kroger is hectic. Bagging groceries, cleaning bathroom, gathering grocery carts from outside. Very friendly work place. The hardest part of the job is when its very busy in the store work exceeds the workers and I have to work at double the pace. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers and pay day."
good,overall a good experience learning new systems and flexible work schedule and hours.
good,Great place to work. Provide exceptional customer service and you'll do great
good,"had a good time working at ralphs, good people, and a easy job"
good,"The normal work day as a deli clerk at Kroger would start at 3:00 pm. continue until 7:30 Id take a 30 min lunch break and back to work. The staff were alright the one thing i would say needs improvement would the lack of focus in management, that and the inability to move up in the company makes for a short stay"
good,"groom flowers, learned to groom flowers and put them into a design suitable for customers.I had sweet managers and great co-workers.the hardest part was stripping roses and the best part about the job was satisfying customers."
good,It had its ups and downs but it is your typical grocery store you stock shelves and deal with the public helping them out in anyway you can. I learned accounting here which moved me forward into my customer service career.

good,i love the customers that walk through the door. they make the job more enjoyable.
good,Kroger pharmacy was a good company to work with as a pharmacist.

good,Enjoy working with staff and managers train well. Flexible hours and flexible when it comes to requesting off. 
good,I liked working at Kroger and any grocery store but the pay was too low for me. Or I would still be there.

good,i love working and doing things if a customer have a problem looking for anything i make it my problem to get the job done make sure my customer happy and satisfied co-workers i'm good people person get along with everyone im always smiling if i'm have a good or bad day it's just me the hards part if i cant do my job i like to do my job and get it done the most enjoyable part is make is make people happy 
good,I loved my time at Smiths just an all around great place to work. Great co workers and mangers. A typical day would be clocking in and helping customers find items talk about there day. in Dairy I had to make sure every item was in stock. Checking dates and rotating items accordingly. As a cashier I had to handle cash memorizing produce key codes.
good,Learned different departments and how they work. My managers and supervisors were very laid back and willing to show me how everything was ran.
good,The employees made me feel comfortable. I enjoyed meeting new people.
good,"multiple responsibilities, friendly co-workers & supervisors"

good,Fred Meyer was a great place for my first job. I learned a lot of valuable skills during my time here.
good,"At Kroger I worked as a courtesy clerk and also in the deli/bakery. Here is where I first learned about customer service and all the steps needed to take care of different customers and their needs."
good,I really enjoyed working as clerk while in college. I met a lot of nice people. I even ended up in management.
good,"The Management isn't that bad, it's really a hit or miss. Most of the management that I work with have the same mentality which is really good, everyone is pretty much on the same page. But there are so many employees that slack off way too much. I wish that Ralphs didn't have a Union so they could get rid of the lousy people. besides that it's a great company. Also the Health benefits are terrible."
good,"Customer service, order per sales volume, design displays"
good,"I had to stand long hours, and just ring up items. It was not that bad, the employees that I worked with were just to into my business, so I had to leave. A"
good,"Productive quiet workplace typical night consist of reading taking inventory, stocking and breaking down shevles"
good,The management has always been outstanding. They try and promote the hardest working people and are fair to all employees
good,"A typical day of work reminded me a lot of what high school entailed. In the aspect of nobody could just help one another and everyone was out to get you, bad attitudes and views on the daily. I always held myself with pride being one of the few that came in daily with a smile and good attitude, willing to provoke the same out of others. The hardest part of the job was trying to understand the poor communication from everyone as an entire business environment. Seldom was anyone informed of things as a group. In my opinion the whole day was enjoyable due to the infectiously negative environment it was more of a task for me to enlighten anyone I could and help them enjoy their days.  "
good,"At first my work experience was amazing, I loved going to work because all of my coworkers and managers we're friendly and let us have fun but we stayed busy. Once I announced I was going to college they basically didn't want anything to do with me especially after the people who were working there when I first left ended up leaving and either going to other stores or took on different positions. If you aren't planning on advancing within the company, they want nothing to do with you."
good,"cooked"
good,Top of the work day would be to rotate meat case. Stock meat case than wrap meats that would be coming out and placed into meat case for the next shift. I learned the importance of keeping meat rotated because of the heath purposes but more so how to manage product. The hardest part of any day is not having enough product ready for rush periods. My most enjoyable part of the job was making sure the customers were satisfied.
good,"Learned to cut, wrap, price, and stock meat and seafood products."
good,It is a good company to work for - however the total benefits are low.
good,Kroger introduced me to the financial disciplines within the areas of  personal and institutional arenas.  My experience with working with others was positive and thus began my interest in communication and helping others.  . 
good,I worked here for 11 years.  The management treated you with respect.  It felt like a family.  The customer base was great in a small town setting.
good,"typical work day was okay"
good,"Each day was different and very rarely typical or similar.  However, the basis of each day was to ensure all product deliveries were out as soon as truck was unloaded for customers and that department was kept up to key retailing standards at all time.  The hardest part of my job was the labor of unloading pallets of produce and breaking down pallets to put product out on sales floor.  I enjoyed the satisfaction of making the department full and presentable to customers and engaging with customers was always fullfilling."
good,Enjoyable place to work with a strong focus on great customer service
good,All companies were great to work for. Allowed me the ability to grow was educated in fields that allowed me to grow with the company. Training provided in management skills to make me the best I could be. Always given the tools to succed
good,I learned about how to deal with different people and responsibilty at a young age.
good,"Great part time job. Under union privileges, so good pay. Job is easy and was in a warehouse setting. Job is easy and self expository. Management was nice and supportive."
good,Worked here for 3 years making minimum wage. Government raised the minimum wage rate but my pay rate did not increase with it. I was making the same as a new hire after 3 years.
good,working here was fun. great opprotunity to engage in customer severvice. Wonderful learning experince
good,"Kroger is a good place to work at, under certain managers. If the manager is good, then your experience will be good. If managers are bad, then your experience will be bad."
good,I clock in and proceed to the register to wait on customers to cash out orders and help with product sales. I work 2nd shift.
good,"pretty much typical bagger job. collect carts, bag purchases, assist customers to their vehicle etc."
good,This was a nice job and I enjoyed helping the customers. I learned a little about the food business
good,"I enjoyed my job but after I had my daughter I wanted to return to work part time the manager would not let me, he said full time or nothing"
good,The deli was very clean and very busy. Always a lot to do. I enjoyed the customers and especially my co workers.
good,I enjoyed my co workers and the relaxed enviroment working in the deli.
good,"The management at Kroger was very customer oriented. Working retail did not create a work-home balance, it is difficult when working retail. Kroger did not try to help anyone move up in the company, you were kind of stuck where you already were."
good,Ring customer sales. Bag items when there is no bagger. Keep pos clean. problem solve small customer issues. Big box mentality vs small box. Managemet at our location want to see people fit in the right job for their skills. Co-workers are cohesive. The hardest part of the job is dealing with provisions set by the union. The most enjoyable part of the job is our customers.
good,I had great time with this employer. We were always at a fast pace. We were friendly and honest people. I liked my bosses.
good,good people good mangement came inh and did job correct the hardest part was peoeple
good,Retail. Loved working there. We were productive but had fun doing so.
good,Everyone was great. It was my first job so I was excited to start working. Nothing was really hard after my first two weeks I was already doing pretty much everything on my own.
good,"You are pretty much isolated from the staff, and if you enjoy team work you may want to revise your decision to be in this position. It's extensively self-motivated, both in doing your daily tasks and finding work for yourself if you finish early."
good,Well educated and courteous co-workers
good,I work in the Deli department assisting customers by filling orders for various deli meat and cheese. I have learned to deal with many type of personalities and moods. I enjoy working with my co-workers and try to make the shift fun and interesting. The hardest part about my job is having to stand on concrete floors for many hours. The most enjoyable part is the interaction of the customers and co-workers.
good,I started working here when i was 15 years old. I did everything from pushing shopping back in from the parking lot to cleaning bathrooms in the store to checking out customers.
good,"My day would consist of zoning my work areas, fixing displays, bringing product from the back room to the floor for purchase, and assisting customers."
good,"Very nice co-workers, wonderful customers & union does a great job."
good,"I worked hard here and was never fairly compensated for my efforts. I worked various departments- produce, dairy, customer service, accounting, front end supervisor. I started out making 5.15 and may have made 5.40 when I left. Too much responsibility with no reward."
good,I learned how to work around fuel and how to clean up gas and oil spills. The hardest parts would be cleaning up the pumps and spills durning the summer.
good,Good Company.Working with Customer One On one. my co worker were very helpful. But you have to work very fast. i loved that part
good,Managment has problems with some areas of the store but overall decent work enviroment.
good,I lovde working here with new people everyday helping them with any thing they may need help with.
good,"Management was good, although they play favorites. Some co-workers with lots of time in think they own the place. Never join the Union."
good,"loved my coworkers they were very helpful and easy to supervise, hardest part of the job was maintaining a positive outlook even when the customers become mean and rude to you however you can not take it personal."
good,"First job in ever working in the dairy, and it taught me that hard work can pay off. Management changes but the same managers within switch locations, so you always know somebody. They give you opportunities to move up and switch depts. The hardest part to deal with are the raises. Other than that i had a great time working for kroger."
good,"There are two different kinds of days at Kroger, days where we have a shipment of product, and days we do not. On the days of product shipment received, all of the product containers must be pulled of pallets and separated into their grocery aisles and then worked to the shelf. With about three to four people working on this, the job is worked on from 8am to usually 2pm or 3pm. After than, the store must be searched to make sure there are no empty spots on the grocery shelves, and if there are, either product must be pulled from overstock, or marked out of stock. At the end of the day the product must be then neatly placed on the shelves and pulled forward so that it looks presentable for the customer (which is known as conditioning). Depending on when my shift starts for that day, I either work more on working new product to the shelf, or less and more on out of stocks and conditioning the product. On days without product shipment out of stocks and overstock needs to be completed as well as product conditioning. Also on days without shipment, I complete miscellaneous tasks such as assembling furniture and grills for the summer season, or assembling product displays."
good,I have learned working in this position is that customer's are not hard to please if you listen to what they need and you have the knowledge to help them.
good,A typical day as helping customers with their transactions and making sure they are charged the right price.
good,"same as above when it comes to certain company ""walks"" they expect 16 + hours per day to get ready claim they have a work life balance but it really takes away from family"
good,"I love this job, it was fun and the management was very helpful and understanding. We all were a family and nothing was hard about this job because it was fun everyday. I love going in to work"
good,"A typical day at work was busy during the day, slow in the morings and at night. I learned how to deal with people in retail, employee's are customers, meet their needs and answer questions. Out of the three jobs I've had all together, this one taught me the most about work ethics and such. Management was good and understanding for the most part, but one individual was mean, harassed me about my looks and others about their looks and appearances. Needless to say, no one really likes working with her, she is the store manager at work. My co-workers were great, helpful and friendly. I got along with them great and made working fun and something to look forward to. I would say the hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult people, but I did well and most of them left happy or satisfied. The most enjoyable part of my job as a cashier there was interacting with the customers, getting to know them and having conversations with them. This job really helped me alot in opening up to people and knowing how to deal with people when things got busy or short handed."
good,I was extremely active at work. I had to pick and place grocery on a pallet and shrink wrap it at rapid pace. Management was the average managers. They presented us with all the information we needed to have a successful day of work.My co workers wer primarily easy to deal with.Every thing about this particular job was easy to handle. The most enjoyable part of the job was the ability to work hard for incentive pay.
good,it was interesting having so many different types of people work to gether and shop in the same store.
good,I worked in the deli part of Kroger making breakfast so the day began at 4 am and ended at 10:30 am. The worst part of the job was eating to many biscuits with gravy. The best part of the job was the co workers.
good,A great environment to work in. Cares for their employees. Good management.
good,When dealing with the public in an area of selling jewelry which is a luxury item you have to know what you are selling and what the customer wants and needs.
good,"A typical work day was very easy going. The work was pretty simple and steady. I learned more ways to satisfy customers. The managers were pretty stern but cool people. I liked my co-workers also, they were very friendly and easy to work with. The hardest part of the job was seeing a customer walk out unsatisfied or upset. The most enjoyable part was dealing with customers, helping them get their needs fulfilled, and just going home knowing I made some happy that day."
good,"very flexible with balancing life and work, most co-workers are like family. Management has changed a few times since employed there is no personal connection or care from management."
good,like working with them and hope to work with them again and if not then i was happy with them while i had them
good,The entire store is a great place the managers just need to work on their communications skills.
good,"It's an enjoyable place to work. My co-workers are very dedicated and hard working people. We try to have fun throughout the day. Because we spend most of the day together, we have bonded like a family. We share each others joys as well as heart breaks. As far as management is concerned, employees are important. We are asked to voice our concerns. For the most part, management listens to what the employees have to say."
good,"The work day is at the least 9 hours. The day is started out by getting around to greet associates and get acclemated with business for the day. Being prepared for any fires that may occur, or at least knowing where to go to solve them is half the battle. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to establish a work relationship with your associates and being creative and competitive while achieving goals. The hardest part of the job is when you loose good employees. Also, when you have to work with a management team that has no communication amongst the group."
good,I did deposits/paper work/ attending meetings/ trying to keep the customers happy. the most i learned was how to multi task and try to do your best even when things get hard to deal with. Hardest part of the job was keeping the customers happy while busy with other activites. i loved working with public and learning something new everyday
good,"I worked with krogers for a short time, they do have a union for their workers. Legitimately, krogers is a good place to work."
good,This is an okay job for a student in college or high school. Very flexible schedule and usually will be off by 1030pm. They also have a really good tution reembersement program that is easy to take advantage of. The benifits were about par with other grocery stores that I have worked for. My particular pay was very competitve though there are a couple of underpaid hard working people there.
good,Unloading trucks and stocking product. Good people to work with including the manger on midnghts.
good,I learned how to be a manager in high-volume store and I will never forget the experience I gained with Fry's.
good,Mainly bagging items for customer or managing go-backs.
good,"I check customers out at the cash register. Whenever I had a problem with an order or the cash register, I could call a supervisor. The job is very easy, but sometimes you may get an overlaod of groceries."
good,Pick N Save is a nice place to not only go shopping but to work. the employee's are friendly and helpful.
good,as long as you got your job done you could talk to the people that were around you
good,working in fast pace place and helping cosumer using rf gun order product asneed learning alot from lead person the hardest is stocking comm with staff.
good,stock merchandise to shelves and help customers. fun coworkers and work. offer good hours to employees.
good,"worked thru highschool, worked as a cashier, and in other departments when needed"
good,Fry's was a great job because it gave you freedom to work and also associate. I learned a lot about costomer service and also about fruits and vegetables. Managment was good because they looked for things to make company better. The co-workeers were great because they were down to earth. The hardest part of the job was learning all the fruits and vegetable. The most enjoyable was actually being able to learn them.
good,"Kroger is a good secondary job or good for students. The hours are flexible, and they have a nice vacation pay after a year of employment. The best paying positions are at the warehouse,customer service, night stock and management. Many have worked Kroger for years and earned these positions,and the job is convenient if you live in the area. Working at Kroger was a casual experience with neighborhood customers,and sometimes you made tips. Kroger cares about their employees & customers to a degree, and their business. Kroger hired me during a crucial job transition. They also employ the disabled and are a drug free enviroment."
good,Good part time job. I liked working in floral. Did not like filling in to bag.
good,"Typical day at work: On average we will have 30 - 35k pallets on a 12 hour shift. All workers are required to pull an average of 250 pallets an hour, so time management is key here. My job consists of monitoring production plan requirements and track performance while maximizing ship window compliance and balancing inventory goals. I also monitor customer demand and volume fluctuations."
good,"a typical day at work was coming in and signing in , then waiting for the truck to come with the produce, then unloading them, then everybody gets an isle and starts restocking the shelves, and making them nice and easy for others to grab. I learned well how to stock items and keep them in a good order when stocking. Management was fine and my co-workers were good too, everybody did there job correctly. I find that the hardest part of the job was when we had to rush at times but not all the times, but the most enjoyable part was the breaks and jokes that happen and it keeps yo on your feet and i really like that in a job."
good,"I liked working for Kroger for the most part they were very interested in supporting their staff. It was as close to perfect as you could get in that sense, though there were problems; what place doesn't have problems? The only reason I left was because there was no way to support myself and my husband once I graduated and we didn't have extra coming in from the college loans, also I could not have afforded to pay back the previously mentioned loans while working there."
good,A typical day at Kroger Pharmacy consists of filling prescriptions and calling doctors for refill request and new prescriptions for our customers. I call insurance companies to request prior authorizations when a drugs are covered. The majority of my job is spent on satisfying customers and giving excellent patient care.
good,Great company to work for in most career fields. Locally here in Utah it is expanding at a fast pace.
good,"I like and enjoy to the fullest every day at work, giving 100% as an employee, as a partner, and giving the best to all customers. work hard every day, to satisfy both customers and my manager and market peers. giving a smile and a greeting, it is to trust in oneself, and therefore provide the best for the people around you"
good,"This job had very strict policies but reasonable ones as we were often dealing with confidential information. Once the job could be done efficiently, it became an enjoyable job. The managers were pharmacists and were very nice."
good,"Had the opportunity of hired at the grand opening of a store. Fast-paced always moving, always something to do, cross-trained friendly co-worker"
good,I love getting to deal face to face and on the phone with customers. I learned a long the lines of the merchandise and the company.
good,"Easy job, great environment, good hours. Would work here again."
good,not a lot of hours unless it was a holiday. you get paid every week which is great other tahnk that it was ok. oh yea they cash your checks for free
good,"Each day, you had daily tasks that were to be done, depending on the time you arrived. Working in the deli and bakery was not a hard job. Working 5 days a week, I was able to get to know the customers; what they ordered when they came in or if they were having trouble at home and needed someone to talk to them. A lot of the problems that myself and the other employees had, were with management. Everytime you turned around, we had a new manager. In the end, we all worked as a unit and made our store great!"
good,While working for this company I enjoyed meeting new people on a daily basis and creating that friendly environment that made the customers want to continue coming back to our store.
good,Kroger is a great place to work if you are a young person. Its a graet part-time job.
good,-loved the environment
good,Have to much experience with my background and want a better pay rate for my experience.
good,"good place to work. was just a part time job for me so no money, no benefits"
good,The company is a very nice place to start out with as well as a lot of potential growth. Is a very humble place to work.
good,"Bounced back and forth from cashier on a register to running customer service. Became a front end supervisor and trained new employees. Co-works, for the most part, were fun to work with. Had the few that didn't do their job to the best of their ability and made it difficult on everyone else. Down side would be the scheduled hours. I would offer to work passed my time or come in early to get more hours or come in on my days off. The most enjoyable part of my job would be the feeling of a highly satisfied customer walking out of the door because of the experience I made sure they had in the store."
good,"Some days were a little chaotic and stressful, but many of the workers were very laid back and easy to get along with."
good,"Pleasant customers and co-workers. Secret shopper hit my line while I was working. I received very good marks on my speed, kindness and helpfulness. I also was one of the top checkers for my speed. Only down side was not a lot of hours during the summer due to the high school and college kids. I was on the bottom of the food chain."
good,"As a cashier, Greeted, checked out and bagged groceries for customers. When needed, answered various questions from customers concerning location and quality of products."
good,"Daily, I performed data entry duties, counted medication, assisted patients with answering questions and resolving insurance problems. I also contacted physicians and insurance companies regarding patient medications. I assisted with inventory control and filing daily paperwork. I enjoyed working with my staff and was eager and willing to help out wherever needed. The pharmacy manager was very accommodating to my needs when creating the weekly schedules. The most enjoyable part of this job was taking the time to connect with the patients, but due to numerous assigned tasks there was very little extra time for one-on-one patient interactions."
good,My most enjoyable part of the job is working with the customers
good,working at pick n save was good. i enjoyed working for this company
good,"I enjoyed the Kroger company as an employee. It is a more relaxed setting than most others, but I believe it was lacking a certain strict work setting that I desire."
good,I only worked here for a summer but it was great job experience. I had training and the environment was friendly.
good,"So depending on the day, I would either open or close the store. In most cases I would close the store. I would come in and check off my list, tasks such as managing cashiers money, making sure that they had enough money for their shift. Do breaks, handle customer issues, manage 6-9 personnel daily. At the end of shifts (closing time), I would count all the money set out, close out accounts in customer service booth. Drop money, and enter data into data bank."
good,Good place to work while going to school. Work with your school schedule and meet lots of new people.
good,As in my previous jobs i worked as a cashier so i became familiar with the procedures fairly well. The people there were very helpful in making my job easy.
good,over all kroger is a good company to work with just looking for a change
good,the people that I worked with were hard working individuals that came to work ready to work and took pride in their job no matter how smalll the task was.
good,"Good people and productive work place. Working at this company was a good experience, I was able to show my abilities and the store reacted positively to my input."
good,"My job was to make sure the cashiers' had everything they needed and to make sure they had the correct amount of money in their tills. I learned how to handle large sums of money, to prepare deposits for the bank, and to track the shortage or overage for the tills."
good,"I learned to work in a fast pace deli. The deli was always busy. I enjoyed always having work to do, there was no down time. I learned more skills to work with the public face to face. Overall the Kroger Company is a good company to work for."
good,"Even though the pharmacy can get crazy, and flustered we still get a little bit of down time. And every job needs that once in a while. A typical day is answering phones and helping people with their refills, insurance questions, doctor questions, and filling and typing out prescriptions as quikly as we can. And as accurately as we can as well. The busier it gets at times is when some people can get irriated with the customers, but hey we are there to help serve their needs or we would not be doing what we do."
good,"I worked her my last two years of High School. As long as you did what you were told, when you were told to do it you were fine."
good,A typical day is non stop from the time you get there until the time you go home. I've learned alot about the pharmaceutical field. The management team is pretty good but the training aspect isn't as great as it should be considering everything involved. I love the hands on interaction with the patients and the abilty to sometimes help them with the smallest thing such as locating an item they are unable to find.
good,"i am a cashier and i get carts, i have learned that when people dont treat you nice and you still give them a good attitude in return they feel entitled to treat you nice, the management really cares about the employers and what they think, me and all my co-workers get along and some of us even chill outside of the workplace,the hardest part of my job is having to say i cant come in on days that they are short handed, having the customers come back and ask for me to serve them"
good,I really enjoyed working here until people let their position go to their head. I was out pushing buggies at 7 months pregnant. It was a good place to work though over all
good,Fun. Fast paced. If you like working with people it is an okay job. But people do tend to get on the nerves if you are not. Uscan is cool
good,"average work experience of clerk, typical day is stocking, ordering product, cashier work, unloading shipments, customer assistance."
good,Kroger was a great place to work in the summer. I did not have many hours but when I worked it was very hectic. There were never enough people scheduled and the workload was unbalanced. It was a fun environement all of the other employees were very happy to be at work and that made it fun.
good,"processed payment, collection calls, and other office duties. Learned how to utilize down time and work with delinquent customer respectfully. The hardest part of the job was making the collect ion calls realizing that everyone's situation is different and most people dont choose not to pay, but can't pay. the most enjoyable was the friendly and helpful staff."
good,Come in clock in get on the register and start checking out people that are buying their groceries.what I learned while I worked there was all the different codes for the fruits & vegetables. Managment was good. Co-workers were also good. Really with this job you deal more with the public than with your coworkers. Really was no hard part of the job. I enjoyed the job being able to meet new people everyday.
good,A good company for your first job. Its a fast pace workplce and tha staff is nice and friendly
good,"Working at Kroger was fun, exciting, but cold at times. I would have to assure that all the meat that was ordered came in on the proper truck and if it didn't that we recieved a credit for the item. I also had to make sure that all dates were current throughout showcase, lunchmeat, breakfast meats, etc. We would cut meat daily and also cut special orders for customers. I learned how to cut, package, and process meat. I was also taught that regardless of how nice you are to some customers, making them happy was highly improbable. Everyone here treated each other like Family. We all took care of one another and even assisted in other areas throughout the store if our work was caught up and another area needed our help due to lack of staffing or a numerous amount of customers at one time. The hardest part of the job was cutting meat and making sure that you didn't cut yourself. We had a bell for customers to ring if they needed assistance, but sometimes they would walk into the cutting room while we were actually cutting meat and attempt to yell over the sound of the saw to get out attention. That would startle you at times, which could have also led to someone possibly cutting off a finger, hand, etc. We had fun as a whole due to the tight relationship everyone throughout the company had with one another. We had and open door policy, which everyone used properly for the most part, which alleviated alot of trouble being started in the workplace."
good,It was my frist real job so I learned a lot about the working field.
good,employees are very friendly and easy to get along with. Poor management and poor organization skills . Most customers are friendly.
good,Most employees were students at Auburn or Southern Union. The store really worked with you to accomidate your class schedule.
good,"Good place for work in the summer, good hours. Not very challenging work."
good,"Just a really nice place to work. The hourly rotation is nice, keeps your mind fresh. Very, very good and polite to every patient."
good,"I was able to interact with all types of people on a daily basis. My co-workers were very helpful and friendly! Management did a great job in handling schedule mistakes, and customer and employee situations. Overall, I had fun working for the company, but it was time to move on and pursue other career opportunities!"
good,it can be hard work at times but it's worth it in the end when you see the smilles on your costermers faces
good,The Kwik Shop I worked at could have had better management skills.
good,I have worked at newport krogers for a year I quit only bc they had started to shorten my hours and I wanted at least 49 hours a week and I loved working there bc the managers were nice and worked with me and had me doing different duties to learn more about krogers
good,"I enjoyed working for the Kroger Company. My job as a cashier was very routine and I really appreciated this, at that time. The work was easy, yet interesting. And I really looked forward to going in and seeing my coworkers and customers every day."
good,The hours are a little inconsistent i the beginning but once you get a rhythm going you'll be set to work freely and responsibly with out them micro managing you.
good,"The hardest of the job would be the demand for the online orders on the weekends and not having enough staff at times. Friday-Sunday are the busiest days of the week at current store."
good,"Most employees and customers where very friendly and easy to talk to, they cared about you and your home life and took interest in you. the store director along with some (not all) managers on the other hand, where very stuck up and uptight to the point of trying to yell at employees in front of customers causing a scene. One winter during a particularly bad snow storm, I was stuck in traffic leaving high school to head home, change, and head to work. after realizing I was going to be late, I called ahead and told them my current position and how long I had been stuck there, they said to just get there as soon as possible. About 3 hours after that, I had literally only moved about 30-50 feet, they called me and asked where I was, I told them and even took a pic on my phone to try to send them to show I was not lying. They did not care and told me to just get to work and to not worry about being in work clothes. I told them no I cannot do that because I did not wish to ruin my nice, expensive, and some of my only nice school clothes. They threatened to write me up and put me on pending termination, and I immediately called the corporate office and explained the situation. They where much more understanding and fortunately told me not to worry about it, that they would talk with the store director and to just get home safe. The next day, the director and managers who threatened me said nothing, no apologies or anything, they acted as if they didn't just try to fire me for being stuck in my car for 4 hours in a snow storm."
good,"There is always something going on, you really enhance your communication skills. Doing payroll was easy though a lot of stress because they are shutting down a store and the workers are moving to my store and we are afraid they aren't going to give hours for us."
good,"Good company,good pay, flexible hours. You do work short staffed most of your shifts, will work around just about anything you need , very cheap insurance, good insurance"
good,I really enjoyed my work as cake decorator except they would put additional jobs on me and I would end up working overtime to get everything accomplished. I didnt mind this except there were other people that could have done the exact same thing without having to pay overtime to get accomplished. The bosses were all about money not all about employees. no benefits to be had and really no way to move up in the company
good,I loved working at Kroger. The people I worked with We're very professional and friendly. The hours and the pay rate were fair. I was let go from this job because my car broke and I could not get to and from work. I would hire back in now that I have a new car but they make you wait a full year before you can retire in.
good,"The employees were great to work with, there were a few managers that went above and beyond to see you succeed, but then there were the others, that wanted nothing more than to make them look good and be successful without doing the work and walking over the top of you."
good,"Working at Kroger was great. The management was not so good. Co workers was good.  Not enough hours. Work was not enough workers on the weekends, Thursday, Friday, Sunday."
good,"Flexiable schedule,can get extra hours. Fast paced. Get discounts on food working at store. Have to be energetic,and be able to stand for long periods of time."
good,"Good pay good benefits, rarely time to take vacation. Some upper management are something else to deal with. You get regular pay raises. Their hiring process is lame."
good,Good place for teens or adults. You can make a career out of it... but some locations are definitely better than others when it comes to taking care of its employees
good,"Wages was terrible for the amount of bs u go thru daily, management was even worse making u look like the bad person but thank God for great co-workers for making work worth it"
good,"long work days but rewarded with 3 days off per week "
good,"I loved work here, on the job you will meet new people and gain more experience in the work field. It's a pretty easy job, and have flexible hours. Loved it."
good,Management/department manager needs to help their employees to move up and not betray each other! Most management don’t realize that if people treat each other poorly then they will lose them
good,Kroger as a whole is a good company to work for. I work at various stores throughout Louisville and Southern Indiana. My management team is supportive and encouraging.
good,"Kroger is a great company that cares about reducing waste and helping the community. The team you work with is typically full of amazing and colorful people. The main downside is that typically store management is self serving and doesn't seem to share Krogers interests nor the interests of the employees or customers. This isn't true with every manager in every store, but unfortunately most of the managers I had did display self serving qualities."
good,Great opportunity to build customer service experience. Great room for advancement. Hours are very flexible. You will meet s lot of people working in grocery retail.
good,"As a pregnant cashier for Kroger Stores, it was exciting and educational. Nearly all of my nutritional information I either learned here or from my dr"
good,"Many opportunities to advance if willing to put the time and effort into it.  Well compensated, bonus rated, stock options available.  Great benefit package."
good,This job allowed me to the opportunity to work part time and go to school part time due to flexible scheduling hours. I was able to work and save money for tuition.
good,Kroger was a good working experience and had at times a great working environment. My department manager at my most recent store made working there a breeze.
good,Great company to work for. My department manager was very understanding with scheduling and working with my school schedule. Work was fairly easy understanding.
good,"The first two locations I worked at were great people, and smooth day to day.  The management were easy to talk to and very understanding.  I learned a lot in the world of medicine."
good,"Krogers is like any other retail job. Sometimes slow, sometimes pretty fast. I got to meet new people everyday, along with returning customers: tourist and locals. Supervisors helped a lot. They made sure everyone was okay on the job. On certain days gave us food and beverages for holidays, add really hot or cold days."
good,"Good place if you are looking for a job thats in a clean, and comfy environment. The tasks are not hard but the the customers can be overwhelming. Benefits are a plus, and everything but the pharmacy is unionized"
good,It was an easy job to learn and there was plenty of opportunity to advance within the company. I really enjoyed my experience and I wouldn’t mind doing it again.
good,Good place to start and build up a career and good people to work with and easy job. I learned a lot of social and customer service skills while there
good,"I loved my job, it was just hard keeping up with grades in college, two toddlers and working. Mentally I couldn't handle it, but I would recommend the job to anyone looking to work there."
good,"Overseeing and instructing staff and store to hit monthly sales quotas. Training, motivating and encouraging team members how to take care of customers so when they leave the are highly satisfied with their visit and are giving a 5 star service. 3 years as Merchandising/HR Manger instructing departments and follow up with plan-o-grams and merchandising, talking with Vendors and setting plans for sales. 1 year as OPS/HR setting weekly budgets, controlling shrink, monthly perishable inventories and Hiring and training new employees. I’ve also been on special assignments with Kroger such has helping stores with new store role outs, supply champion and RF handheld champion"
good,"During my tenure at Kroger, I haven't had any problems. While at Kroger, I have often had to change my work days due to school and other jobs. I never had any problems with being accommodated. Overall, Kroger is an excellent company to work for."
good,"This job showed me how fast-paced things can be at work and how slow paced other times can be. I made friends and learned about the environment in which I would be working. I learned how to work well with customers and how to do simple things like working the cash register or restocking. This job gave me a great learning experience for how jobs will be in the future. Well later on the management and the scheduling seemed a bit iffy, this actually benefited me. This taught me how I need to learn to speak up for myself and I developed a sense of respect for myself and others well understanding my capabilities working there."
good,"Procduct inventory, stocking, ordering, and reciveing. Working with the employees, management and venders. Helping the custmers locating product suggesting other options."
good,"I would arrive ask for my responsibilitys and get to work, work place environment was good, and the managers had their days but for the most they were good"
good,nice place to work knowing everyone needs to eat .therefore not worried about job security. worked with a great group of people that double digit time on the job.
good,A typical day at work was walk in and start on a register. You stay at the register and clean between breaks in customers. The management there was good at keeping up with the front end but of course had their issues. The culture was upbeat. The hardest part of the job was keeping customers happy every time. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the customers.
good,with alot of bonds the pay is lacking but you get great medical as long as you work 20 hours a week.Managment at most stores does not allow overtime and may shift you to multiple jobs based off needs
good,"all staff very helpful and friendly,"
good,It’s usually a slow pace store they just need to pay a little bit more then how much they pay now with that fixed I would definitely work there again.
good,"It depends on the Store you work for, and it also depends on the managers. It was a fun place before I had asked for a transfer, then they just made my life much worse"
good,Easy job if you just applied yourself. Lots of room for learning and education in your department. Management got swapped around all the time so that's hard to pin down its quality.
good,Kroger isn't a bad place to work.  The biggest drawback would have to be the wages.  You can't earn a living wage unless you get a management position.
good,"the job was simple and easy, not just in the one, but all of the departments. the only reason why I had to leave the job was everyone's hours were getting cut. If I could go back with full time I would."
good,"It was certainly better than not having any job at all, and I'm glad that they took me on when I had absolutely no work experience whatsoever. However, we were paid beans and given the tiniest work area in the store for our department, which was the busiest in the district."
good,"Working at Kroger is probably the closest you're going to get to working a job a few decades ago. The pay is reasonable, the benefits are logical, and people are generally kind. There are a few bad managers, but that's going to be the case everywhere."
good,Good company. Paid every week. Friendly environment. Customers can sometimes be uppity depending on the area (wealthy) but besides that good place to work
good,This is a fast paced job that requires being on your feet your entire shift. You will need extremely comfortable shoes due to walking on concrete floors all day. Even the younger associates had extremely sore feet at the end of their shifts.
good,I really enjoy working at the Pharmacy in Frankenmuth. I get along great with the rest of the staff and they helped me learn so much about the job. Even after getting a full time job in my educational background I still work part time with Kroger. I highly recommend working there!
good,"All in all, it was a great building experience. I've met a lot of interesting people while working there. If you are a go-getter and a real people person, this job is perfect for you."
good,"My time at Kroger has been interesting to say the least. The work environment, as well as the employees, are friendly and caring yet the multiple tasks given to you are challenging but not impossible. Every task is expected to be finished by the end of your shift and must be addressed to management if the task is difficult. If I were to recommend this job to anybody looking for one I would tell them that it's not easy but it's a good place to start."
good,"1. I would Clock in then i would go back to the deli department and start my day. I would put a hair net on gloves and a apron on then i would start calling out the number of the next customer and get him his desired meat and cheese and if he wanted something from our hot or cold bars."
good,"I really enjoyed my self working for this company being a cake decorator, It was a wonderful experience working with and meeting new ppl.It was a hit to go to work whenever scheduled the Managers was Great!"
good,Working at Kroger was a great entry level job. Not that much work but definitely great at a high school level. I worked through my junior and senior year and it was well both part and full time.
good,"Good Starting Job and friendly atmosphere, however unless you chose to go the management track would not recommend as a life long Career. The environment can also be stressful"
good,Fast pace environment  hard work  a real  fun place to work  friendly environment  good place to grow in the  company .this is a union job also start partime
good,"Nice place to work with a casual crowd. But if you’re looking for advancement, you have to work hard for it or stay on the bottom. Loved my supervisor."
good,"You are granted a lot of hours, unfortunately those hours are sometimes inconvenient with bad employee schedule planning that sometimes interferes with with your permanent availability"
good,"A very quick-paced (on weekends and major sale days) and structured position. There are many checklists that must be completed before a certain time in order to adhere to Kroger’s values. You have to stay on top of everyone’s breaks, the number of store sweeps that have been done, operation of self-checkout machines, as well as the cleanliness of the restrooms and foyers. The training could be better, though."
good,I was very happy at Kroger until they brought in a toxic manager who degraded and belittles people. I was unable to open work in a fair environment due to the hostility
good,"Throughout my Kroger Career, I've had good managers and bad managers. My issue is simply that the bad managers are the ones that seem to stay the longest, while the good managers who sympathized with the staff, and got things done through that resulting respect, often went on to seek greener pastures. Namely? Because they had the money to do so. While the rest of us were kind of stuck close to minimum wage, barely making ends meet. I came close to making management myself a number of times, but each time it seemed like the ""bad"" managers found someway to keep me locked down. However, King Soopers store 016 had exceptional management, and it was indeed an enjoyable place to work. Was I able to remain there a bit longer, I feel I *would* have advanced."
good,"My position was a little stressful and standards change often. Hard to keep up with expectations but I do have an awesome management team."
good,I was a bagger. Working in the different types of weather was hard. The customer are great. I like the diversity of the staff. When not busy you had to do other things or they would send you home.
good,The culture depended ion the store director who ran it.Overall I worked along side some great people. Dept managers were supportive of the team members that worked for them.
good,"I started at Ralph's right after I graduated from high school and the first thing I realized was that mostly everyone was so inviting. They definitely try to hire friendly and hardworking people and it does not go unnoticed. It has its very busy and stressful times since it is a high traffic grocery store.There is room for growth depending on your person of course and different opportunities to move around in the store. Management does their best but can sometimes fall short with recognition for achievements. Pay can be better with the fact that union dues are taken from each weekly check. Overall, a great company to gain experience from and create lifetime friends."
good,"Thanks to Ralphs, and by extension Kroger, I was able to earn multiple scholarships in order to advance my career opportunities and I was able to graduate from Cal State San Benardino with little debt."
good,Working at Kroger's was pretty good. I feel like I got paid a little fairly and the working condition was sufficient. I'm better at manual labor like lifting boxes or organization.
good,I enjoyed my time at Kroger. You get a good understanding of a work environments hierarchy and also gain a decent amount of knowledge on customer service on all aspects. I would definitely recommend this job.
good,"A day at work included talking to customers, helping sort bagging items, and taking control on busy days."
good,Very micro managed day. Every 15 minutes is scheduled for you. Everyone works together. Most supervisors need to develop their people skills but their work talent is impressive.
good,Management had their own 'clicks'  that they work with. It was like working for a colt. If the phone rings 4 times they want know want to why nobody answered the phone
good,"I would work long hours, I learned core skills and how to meet the needs of my team and guest. the store manager was not the nicest man. I really connected to the guest that would shop there and my team I seen them more then my own family. The hardest part of the job was trying to locate missing slips. I liked helping the families in my community and knowing many by first name."
good,"It was very slow paced. I worked graveyard shift if you want to call it that. I stocked and was a cashier. Very easy work but, the pay wasn’t enough for me at the time."
good,"My time with Kroger was very good, not really stressful from the work. But all I really have to say is just the managers at the time were arguing with each other more then getting work done. By the time I hit the final straw, I was ready to leave that store specifically because the 2 managers arguing with each other every night."
good,I got to meet many new people i learn alot while i was there i got trained in the different areas they were very easy to learn if you're willing to do it.
good,I liked working there but the pay did not match the job. I had a great manager. I worked with friendly people which made it nice. They wanted me to work full time but I only wanted part time.
good,"Kroger, in my opinion, is perfect first time job for students and legal immigrants who have just moved to USA no matter what your educational background or experience is."
good,"Overnight is not for some people every night we would have to put out what did go out the day before so we can get to the new truck, it would take use about an hour to get that done than get to the new truck, we are not suppose to have anything on the floor when the store opens at six, but it was a little to much for us, we got very close to the dead line, before the manager came in for the morning shift"
good,Kroger has a great chance for advancement.  if you show the desire and sense of urgency you have a great chance for advancement. I've been with the company for almost 2 years and have moved up 4 times.
good,"Productive and friendly place to work. Really enjoy assisting customers by answering their questions, locating the items they are searching,informing them of current sales, etc."
good,"Good place to work. You get paid weekly which is a plus. The benefits are good as well, they also have a union. Overall its fun to work at kroger but the management there is kind of shifty and careless."
good,"Kroger hires at 15 in most places. i would recommend this as a first job. A bit above minimum wage, decent pay. Easy jobs, easy hours. Must be able to stand for 8hrs."
good,Was a very nice environment to work the employees were very welcoming and friendly easy to adapt to everyone look out for each other management (for my department) was very understanding
good,"The Company is good, because you can be apart of the Union. The schedule is flexible unless you’re a manager I believe. I enjoy coming to work. Nobody is jumping down my throat micromanaging me."
good,I am very grateful for the flexibility of their scheduling they really take the time to work with you. I cannot speak for all Kroger's but the one I am employed in is a very good working atmosphere. People are generally in good spirits and most work hard. Sometimes i believe they do stress out the employees by not providing the sufficient amount of help for the tasks that management and corporate have in mind. And with their tight hold on not wanting to give soo much over time it can be difficult to get all that is needed done without stressing.
good,I really did love working here at Kroger.  I loved my employees and managers and of course my customers.  Kroger is a fast pace work place but they do a great job at making every customer feel like they are number 1 and they strive to make your shopping experience the best possible.
good,I had a great first job experience with Kroger.  I would bag groceries and help put carts away.  Toward the end I was learning how to cashier.  The only reason for leaving is I needed more hours and wanted to continue with learning the cashier and there wasn't enough openings for this.  Management was great and I really enjoyed my time there.
good,"I have worked at two different Kroger stores, and both had their own unique quality to them. Each store had a set of rules and how things were to run. I enjoyed working at both locations, but sometimes I was not given enough hours and sent home early."
good,Slow paced. Learned about handling meat in a manner consistent with protocol. Management was decent.. hardest part if the job is late hours. Most enjoyable is the team.
good,The store is overall good. You can always find what you want. The staff is excellent. I really enjoyed some of the people that I met there. The store is usually fully staffed.
good,everyone is nice and caring they are funny as well but i tried calling in sick once and they said it wasnt possible. They only give raises once every year. you have to be standing for the most part.
good,"The typical day at Kroger typically consisted of working extremely fast since the customers tend to want to go in and out quickly. You never want to make the customers wait. You also have to make sure that you're very mindful of the time, since almost every 30 minutes, you'd have to register the store sweep or make sure that you clear off the parking lot every hour. The hardest part of the job, I would say, would be the customers and the speed level that you have to work that, however the coworkers make the job enjoyable. It's a nice way to experience different people in the workplace."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company, it’s a great company to work with flexible hours. It gives you an opportunity of growth but you have to be there for a while and their pay doesn’t reflect the work you have to do."
good,"Kroger is company that you can advance when you put into it. Only problem is the work life balance, but it is contributed to fellow co workers. If you work as a team, you will be able to accomplish a lot."
good,"Like with any retail job, you'll be dealing with entitled customers constantly."
good,"Working for Fry's as a Courtesy Clerk usually involved clocking in and finding the nearest register or manager and set on a task - or checking the lot for trash or carts that needed to be returned."
good,The job is ok. It is basically a good starting point for jobs. It has flexible hours for people in school and pays minimum wage. It is also good that it pays weekly instead of biweekly.
good,"its a really nice work place to socialize with hundreds of different customers everyday, it boosts your confidence and you go home happy with a smile almost everyday"
good,"-great mangement team"
good,This job is not for the week or innocent. But you make good money and some of the guys are good there. If you want to work there then work there.  Best of luck
good,"The director at the store that I worked at was unfair and when being called on his behavior, your hours get shortened. He played favorites and worse if he didn't like you. My dept was actually a pretty chill dept and I liked my manager. It's a lot of work but the day goes by quickly if you stay busy."
good,The store manager and those that are higher up do not know how their lower management treat the employees. My manager was never one we could go to with problems and blamed us if anything went wrong. She really only worked when upper management was coming. The hours where flexible but you had to give at least 2 weeks notice. I almost had to miss my grandfathers funeral because she wouldn't give me that day off. Luckily the amazing people in my department switched with me. the store manager and most of the office managers went through the departments everyday to see how we were doing. They are always nice and listen to our daily problems.
good,If only majority of the customers were more friendly. But other then that being a tech is awesome and the training really helps..CORPORATE we need $20... a hour
good,"IT was a pretty cool, the customers are what made the job. there were a lot of confusion, but for the most part it was great. the job is for teens seeking jobs because the okay could be a lot better."
good,Hours began to be cut down. But most importantly inspite of being certified as PT & approval from Pharmacy Manager there is delay of over 5 months to be transfered. However I love working in Kroger.
good,"I had alot of great coworkers and bosses and built a great relationship with my customers. The pay was competitive for my area in that it was not the lowest but it was not enough to attract the right kind of coworkers when we needed help and even though advancement was available it is not really worth the hoops you need to jump through for some time if you are not at a first job."
good,"It's easy to move up in this company. You can make a living off of Kroger salary but only if you have worked there for a long time. Customers are hard sometimes. Management isn't the greatest. if you work full time you arn't allowed to have an restrictions on what you can work. You must be avaliable all the time, which makes it very hard to have a social life."
good,"Almost all management and peers did a great job making me feel appreciated for my work and initiatives shown, it contributed greatly to my heart to continue to excel, and the overall friendliness and warmth of this grocery store environment had little equal. Also Kroger seemed very sensitive and responsive to the needs of the community, especially in providing quality products at reasonable prices."
good,Constantly I had employees calling off and multiple no call no shows. Even when people did show up to work you couldn’t count on them to actually do any work.
good,It’s a great job starting young and wanting to get money fast. Paid weekly and can work as much as you want. It starts off pretty good at training and you’ll get the hand of it pretty fast.
good,"The people I worked with were a good bunch of people, we often worked together to complete the task of stocking and cleaning.  However, the manager ran the store very poorly"
good,"Kroger deli was a stressful environment that's too fast paced for an average person to handle. However, coworkers were wonderful and I will mist them."
good,"Fun place to work.  You get paid for experience,  but advancement seems impossible. Goes by seniority. I think I work harder than most of the people over me.  I can't get an advancement until they step down or leave."
good,The workplace was very friendly. The other employees were very understanding and helpful. The regular customer was friendly. It was always an enjoyment.
good,"I loved working at kroger pharmacy, they gave you training classes to get your certificate. But also it was hard to hear sometimes, with me being hard of hearing. I got along great with the employees. They loved how fasted i could learn their system and get times done. I enjoyed everything about this job. I was very upset that they had to let me go."
good,"Very quick paced work environment while at the same time being productive with co workers. I learned many skills in which included customer service, time management, and collaborative team effort."
good,"As a Bagger, you’d help customers, get carts, clean the store as needed/directed, and bag groceries."
good,"When everyone worked togeather things got done, but always a lot of drama on the front end. If you kept your head low normally would not get dragged in. Co workers were all great and managers were what how a manager should be. They were willing to listen and would help solve problems."
good,It's great there and I need better for myself. They have flexible hours and sometimes over time.  I just don't like how they don't make you full time. You have to wait a year.
good,It's a good company to work for the managers are helpful and friendly. I absolutely luv my coworkers. The hours are flexible. They could have a lot better medical and dental insurance they also have 401k that's really great. They need to do better with giving people hours to work.
good,"The only reason I scored management low is because the manager I had while working at Kroger was inconsistent in his attitude towards his employees, and overall had an arrogant personality (like he was better than us because of his job status) and was the overall reason that I left the company. That store now has a different manager, whom I have not met, but would be willing to try and obtain employment at that location again, because I generally enjoyed the job!"
good,all around alright slow to start benefits though and some employees don't like newcomers. and dealing with customers unreasonable demands and nonsensical questions as well as nonexistent training really
good,A very fast paced environment that meet the needs of people and the demand to drive sales higher than the competition. Great work experience and good benefits.
good,"This is a good part time job. The tasks are easy, people are nice, and there's flexible scheduling. This jobs perfect for high school student looking to make some money."
good,"Though experience with my management was poor, the people the company is made of can be caring. It is easy to advance in the job, and you are provided many opportunities to advance your career and gain better benefits. Though they only want you to pursue an advancement in their company and no other."
good,The biggest downside is they filter managers constantly. The second you get comfortable with a manager they get moved. The workload depends on the department but you have to make the best out of it.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was my set schedule. My Office which was isolated from everyone else. The Management team at the moment is not the best. They don’t care about important things.
good,"Worked the deli counter.  My typical day was slicing meats/cheeses for customers.  Learned to slice meats with meat slicer, how to clean slicers, how to clean and stock freezers and display cases, learned customer service.  Workplace was a friendly atmosphere to be working in. Most enjoyable part of job was learning about other people and their managerial skills."
good,"I enjoy working there, good benefits after you become full time (40) health coverage after 3 month 401k and stock options. Working with the public helping there needs is very satisficing."
good,"good place to work, ok management there is something to be said about a company that wont close it doors unexpectedly and go out of business. They do offer some good benefits"
good,"Kroger was a stable place to work, but with not many benefits, and hours weren't always enough. Only the hardest jobs were available for full time, and the good jobs were only available part time."
good,working here was a great place to work if you have never worked before you were given very flexible hours with few problems on how to no have to work a shift
good,I worked an entry level positiom at a store that had its issues. Overall the company has great ideals and a great mission statement but not all management is effective. Store i worked at had bad management but it happens. Great for a job right out of high school.
good,"For the most part, the store I worked for fast paced but friendly and welcoming to employees and customers. Management was good for the most part but would be quite disrespectful at time, possibly not to their knowledge. At a certain point, it is hard to move up in the company, so I would suggest joining this company for a job, but not a career."
good,They pay you not enough for the amount of work that you do. The coworkers were really the only part that I enjoyed about the job. Customers are rude & entitled to their super specific orders.
good,I enjoyed working at Kroger. The employees worked together like a family. The employees took care of each other. The company would treat is on holidays and special occasions to meals. The also support many good causes and have fun raisers
good,"I would always ask for hours, but I would never receive any. New hires and people working there for many years get the most hours. I gained many skills while working there. But, I didn't see myself moving up any time soon."
good,"Kroger is a great place to work. I started at Kroger when I was a student, and have continued till now. I have always had great opportunities, and made great contacts and friends there. I am just ready for a change before I burn out on a career I love."
good,Weekends were busy but during the middle of the week it would be slow. It carried a lot of stress with changing things and progressing for with the movement
good,Overall I liked working at Kroger but I wanted to advance in the company and didn't have the option. I loved most of the people I worked with and the manager were great.
good,Seniority took priority. No over time no chance to get overtime. Pay increased by 75 cents after 5 years and still couldn’t make full time even if I worked my tail off.
good,"In summery the job was fine, I would do whatever needed to be done. But my manager could never get my hours right  even when i put them in a month and a have in advanced. This would cause problems with school for example."
good,"Honestly Kroger didn't mind how fast you worked or how you did your job as long as it got done on time and you weren't slacking. If co-workers finish their isles before you, they will come help whoever has more to stock or front."
good,"This position is no longer an identified position within Kroger MFG, however my experience during this time was fulfilling and rewarding. I gained much professional experience during this time."
good,Very challenging. Expected to work every weekend and all holidays except Christmas. Constant pressure to meet short-term goals. High turnover rate among the hourly staff which creates a great deal of stress.
good,"For the most part I enjoy my job, especially being able to move around the store. It is a good part time job as a student because it is a primarily part time job. But there aren't very many ways to turn your job into a full time job in the click list department. The hardest part of the job is stock availability. If a delivery truck is late or the stock staff is behind click list also falls behind."
good,"A typical day at the pharmacy would begin with three employees coming in early to prepare for the day and be able to start the day ahead. You learn to work in a fast paced environment and sometimes intense situations. We also learned the importance of team work. I absolutely working with patients and developing a relationship with them in a professional manner. I strove  to make a difference in someones time of need. Also, our immediate supervisors made a point to let us know they appreciated our hard work. The hardest part or most stressful part was at times having to prevent a patient from getting too upset with insurance prices and copay, but also losing them when they would pass."
good,"Incredibly easy job. Unfortunately it does not matter how many departments you are capable of working or how many hours you work, or shifts you cover, it is nearly impossible to get a raise out side of minimum wage increasing every year."
good,I would work their again it was a good place to work it was relaxed but they kept you busy but having to be a cart pusher I felt like we were under paid
good,"I worked here for about four years and in those four years I held a number of different positions. It's definitely a job where you have to be on your toes and be a great communicator. I never had to worry about not having enough hours, although, advancing here wasn't really an option. Pay raises are few and far between. Overall, this is a decent job but they pay could be better and the opportunity for growth would have been nice. Still, nice people work along with you and usually the customers are pleasant."
good,"Great management team. Corporate isn't reasonable. Too much pressure for management teams. Not flexible with overtime or give enough hours. Honestly, love where I work just not how management is treated."
good,It was laid back but also can be fast paced. I got a chance to meet a lot of new people and the hours were flexible. Customer service was great; they always make sure the customer is happy.
good,"I worked inside the pharmacy and my job mostly was just sacking medicine and hanging them on racks and helping locate said medicine and performing the check out. Under no circumstances was I allowed direct contact with medicine outside of bottles and did not ever explain the function or usage of medicine as that is the purpose of pharmacists. Technician position is optional if you show good work ethic and are good at what you do in the beginning. They will pay for the classes to get certified and give pay raise if they promote you. Worst part of the job is when a customer cannot afford the medicine they need and you feel sympathy for them and their struggle, and when they yell at you for not being fast in putting their medicine together even though you have nothing to do with that part of the process."
good,"Great job to work at, plenty of opportunities for growth. Lack of trained management causes others to pick up slack. Often time management is shorthanded and overworked."
good,"Kroger is a very nice place to work. Where there is structure and a great chance for advancement . Kroger offers lots of perks for example 401 plans, paid vacation & personal days, great retirement packages."
good,"My experience with Kroger was mostly pleasant, however it didn't pay very well and it is difficult to qualify for benefits. They don't hire full time associates very easily."
good,Working here I feel is more of a second job for adults or a first time job for teens. If you’re wanting a lot of hours and great pay this isn’t for you.
good,Kroger was a good place to work they just couldn't give me the money I needed to live comfortably. My direct supervisor Mrs.Beverly was very nice and accommodating but the general manager of the company was not nice.
good,"Fast Paced Competetive, had to keep up with everything, had to always have a permanent smile on your face, had to friendly kind and courteous, outgoing, had to go out your way to help everyone"
good,"I enjoyed working at Kroger, I learned how to bargain shop and couponing (a little), old and new things. I was a Star Cashier meaning was the most efficient and quick cashier and register operation"
good,the job was not hard of anysort but the hours were not good and my paycheck was not enough to make a living off from i worked about 40 hours the managemeant was almost always good the hardest part of the job would be switching from bagging then running outside getting the carts from the parking lot the most enjoyable part of the day is when i could help someone find what they where looking for or help someone with there grocerys
good,"I loved the job, it was a great place to work and it was reliable. My only problem was the new employee’s threats and how management handled it and still scheduled me to work with him."
good,"Kroger Pharmacy was a great place to work as I was surrounded by good people who ultimately became my friends. The only drawback I experienced was that it takes too long to hire someone when we needed more help. Thus, many other things became stressful."
good,"When I had first started at Pick N' Save I was a cashier, and within the first year I was making my way up as a customer service representative. Making sure that customers got all the best deals they could and also the best service. I believe that with some extra character I can help any customer whether they had walked in upset needing help or not. I receive complaints from other departments of the store though I've never worked in the departments myself, I'll try my best to do what I can to solve the customers problem. I help my fellow employees with register problems, confusion or even more complicated issues like with card errors, coupons and deals that aren't coming off of the transactions. I'll keep the front end moving smoothly for example, helping customers not wait in line by checking out their groceries for them at the self checkout. Another example is making sure that my fellow employees have what they need like if their till is too full to take a ""pick up"" or even a ""loan"" if they need more coins or bills. I make sure to smile and greet every new or familiar customer that I see that come in. I enjoy my job as a CSR because I enjoy people."
good,A typical work day is entering precsiption into the system to be filled at a timely manner every day. Saving lives everyday by getting the medications to the patient is important to me.
good,"It was a great place to start in the workforce, however, it didn't provide any career advancement or compensation.  I would tell anyone who asked that working for Kroger was a good experience"
good,"Serious, good customer service environment. Stores were kept clean and safe for customers and employees. "
good,It's heavily designed to be your first job. I still communicate with the supervisors I worked with there even if they've been gone for three or four years by now. Other supervisors you can tell are the kind that think themselves to be far better than you will ever be (even though theyre 40 and working a part time job).
good,"I worked at Kroger for about 6 years and overall I would say that I enjoyed my experience. I loved working with all the customers. I worked in several different departments over the course of time. But the main reason I ended up leaving was pay. Naturally with any retail job, the pay is terrible so there is no real incentives to stay. I would have probably made a career out of it if there was potential job growth and pay that reflected the years experience and the cost of living."
good,Good place to work if you don't have too many obligations but the lack of constant hours and no full time made it had to count on and no set schedule made it hard to rely on
good,the work experience here was fair. Despite managerial staff then it was a quite enjoyable experience. I have no overall complaints about the job itself but the work load can exceed the amount of work force available to get the job done.
good,"Working at Kroger I have learned a lot. I learned how to fill prescriptions, how to input information, and all around how to be the best person I can be."
good,At Kroger's I worked in the deli so i had to wait on customers and make sure everything was ready for the day I also cleaned to make the area look good for the customers
good,The work was enjoyable. Had several opportunities to assist customers. Had a good variety in my area of work. Managers checked on employees several times throughout the day.
good,The job was not very difficult only time consuming. I felt very welcomed and appreciated while I was there.  I would say that overall it was a great temporary job!
good,money was not that great but it was a job at the time but was not enough really to get by but it was fun at the time great people and good people to work for
good,Ive been in retail for a while and this company does a pretty decent job despite the industry. Pay is decent and i feel the company is pretty transparent.
good,The department I work in is usually very slow customer wise. There are many tasks to do but not enough time to do all of them in a four hour shift. It is an okay environment.
good,When i first started working at Kroger's i loved it i had the most common easy job. i loved helping my customers that needed my help on anything. i loved working with great co-workers we worked as a team. my manager was my only issue while i was there.
good,"It's nice for a first job because it gives you a lot of customer service experience and working in a usually fast paced job. After a while it starts to get dull. Yes it's a grocery store, but it starts to get boring because you stand in one spot all day long. I was 17 when I started so for me it was dreadful. It's really not that bad, but I like new things and that job didn't have anything exciting for me personally."
good,"Working at Kroger was always fast paced and if the managers caught you slacking, they made sure you were set straight. I learned how to quickly and neatly pack groceries for customers to safely get from store to home. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with how quickly cashiers scanned items since groceries would often get smashed together regardless of how fast of a bagger someone was."
good,"Kroger was a good place to work. But the little and short hours a week wasn't cutting it. The job is well recommended to anybody. Only if you was taking care of yourself, but living and working off it will not do it. Don't get me wrong they a good company to work for."
good,Good place to work except for management and health care high cost . management change work ethic.which change environment. No chance for invacement . in company.
good,"Customer transactions, oversee the self-check machines, answer customer phone calls to address any questions and/or concerns, responsible for area including cleanness and presentation, balance out money box, and overall customer service."
good,"The most enjoyable part of being a cashier at Kroger is helping the customers and making news friends with your coworkers. The hardest part of the job is when it gets super busy it can be a little stressful at times. The management is terrible, though."
good,"Handled merchandise shelving, shipping and receiving"
good,"My job was enjoyable 90% of the time. I loved my coworkers, but I would have loved to be paid more. I developed customer service, teamwork, and time-management skills."
good,"This is a great place to work if you are starting out in high school or college where financial demands are not fully weighing down on you. It takes a while to go full-time and that requires playing it smart."
good,"Krogers was a good place to work at despite the pay,but I liked it because it was every week pay,but it still wasn't enough money for me so thats why I picked up a second job at sams I worked both jobs for bout a month then had to quit one it started messing with my health and I was barely getting any sleep at all.Overall it wasn't a bad job at all"
good,Worked in the Deli. Manager there was mean and nasty to new employees. She was rude and disrespectful. But the other parts of the store where good. Couldn't transfer to the other store. Couldn't advance due to poor management.
good,My first manager who worked there was a pain in the butt. Was very rude to customers and ended up getting fired. Other than that it was a good place to work.
good,"Management is very unstable,  one hand doesn't know what the other is doing.  One day everything is fine,  next day your told you stuck at your job,  then your amazing.... no feedback that can actually help you."
good,"I worked for Kroger for  six years in two different stores. I enjoyed working with the public and helping customers.  "
good,I would love to stay at Kroger but there is just not enough hours available. I like the work place environment and the management is great. The job keeps me moving all the time so I get plenty of exercise.
good,"Kroger is a great company if you are just a kid and not looking to stay long term. The payout cap is a joke in my district. "
good,"Relaxed for the most part, its great for an after school job, just needing extra change. Management are okay at best, you aren't in contact with them really, mostly supervisors who are really nice and helpful. Lack of communication can be an issue at certain times. Overall a pretty good place to work, with weekly pay and easy to move up in the company."
good,"A fast paced warehouse style discount food chain.  Time limits for given tasks seem too short and constant pushing to complete tasks are common.  Advancement from within is the norm, but compensation for the advancement falls short."
good,There were others who were nice and willing to help me settle into my job and were great to talk too and they were kind to point out anything I was doing wrong and tell what I could do to fix it.
good,"They did well. However, coworkers were rude or not very mannered. Also management was hard to get ahold of. but I enjoyed it there and I enjoyed the people I got to meet."
good,"I have worked for Kroger for 7 years and had the opportunity to move up to management. It has good benefits, union dues, and poor management for operating the company."
good,"It is a great job for a young adult (high school student) wanting to make some extra cash, but for a long term career, not so much with the job title I had as a courtesy clerk."
good,"Kroger was a good first job for me, had a few little hiccups along the way but I’m all it’s a nice job to start out at and I will definitely miss the people that I worked with."
good,"working at the Kroger Deli had it's ups and downs, mostly with regards to the kinds of co-workers I would have and the stress level at certain times of the day, but all in all if you had a positive attitude an focused on serving customers and keeping everything clean you will have a relatively good time, assuming you have decent co-workers."
good,It was a very relaxed work environment. As long as you did what you needed to get done no one world really bother you. Sometimes the managers would be moody but that was kind of a normal around their. I enjoyed working their just because of the customers and my friends working there. I would go back working there if I could afford it but they don't pay enough for me to stay.
good,"Paid holidays quick advancements weekly pay 2 weeks vacation after 1st year family oriented clean kept fresh food, meat  and produce friendly faces and great customer service."
good,"Kroger was my very first job, I stayed for about 3 years and some change. As time went on it was more difficult to work there because of harassment and stalking by older male customers; but, I still enjoyed working there as a whole and management did what they could to help me feel safe."
good,It's a typical minimum wage job; the pay is not enough to survive on and be independent on. There really is no typical day at Kroger. How busy it is depends on the day of the week. The hardest part of the job is the low pay. The best part of the job is meeting new people.
good,"I love my Kroger, I have learned a lot from my pharmacy manager, staff and floater pharmacists and other team members. Your voice does count and it is a great place however I have to leave the job in few weeks since Kroger is not hiring new pharmacists"
good,"I'm sure Kroger as a whole is a great place, but the one that I worked at had many problems. Time clocks didn't even work correctly. The pharmacy is located outside of the store in the parking lot."
good,"It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great either. Never wanted to have more than part time workers and provided few benefits. Worked me just under full time hours to avoid paying benefits."
good,"Usually pretty typical, good lunch break times, break room was often filthy however. flexible, reasonable pay for the amount of work required, a good temp job."
good,"work, clean and was very fast most of time , not much  fun it was work but was a good job had manager that wasn't  fair we couldn't get upper manger to do anything about it. So I look for other job good discision,"
good,"Kroger is good for a first job, but it doesn’t leave much room for advancement. The best thing is that you can work part time and still get benefits. But you have to wait until you work there a year to be eligible for the benefits."
good,"A lot of the managers would take advantage of the teenagers just because of the fact that they have little to no job experience. I have overall bad memories of working there, the only thing that i enjoyed about working at Kroger was my coworkers, the employee discount, and the fast-paced work day."
good,I was considered for the  Manager on Duty position but  never got a true  opportunity to fully perform in that role.   I was able to encourage the front is staff during my shift.   I enjoyed helping the young people  learn and improve with their clerk training and interacting with clients.
good,"Kroger is a very interesting place to work, I think they would have more dedicated employees work for them if they would pay a little more than what they offer for the positions they hire for."
good,"your feet will hurt from constant standing "
good,"As long as the work gets done, everyone is happy. Coworkers are great. But Management tends to micro-mange and then won't make a decision. Better to finish the project on your own."
good,I worked at Kroger my senior year of high school and it was great for a little extra cash and they were super flexible on scheduling.  I wouldn't recommend making a career here though.
good,Kroger was my first job and it wasn’t too bad at first. I worked every day after school and then once I graduated I tried to continue to work and get more hours but was unable to expand my availability due to the store.
good,"Managers would go over your head for guests no matter what, kind coworkers rude and entitled customers, fast paced, medium workload, must be versatile"
good,was an ok company to work with. Was promised full time but only  got 24 or less.  the benefits were very good. Nice store to work at and busy all the time
good,"Not enough labor hours to handle night stocking responsibilities.Constantly struggling to get everything done in one shift, running around like a chicken with his head cut off trying to get done daily."
good,"It's a good job for someone if they are just getting a job and if you need quick easy money, everyone was kind supportive and looked out for one another."
good,"Management congratulates you with low effort which is nice but no pay increase or promotion within the store which shows no care for the employees. When I found out that I was basically ""stuck"" in the same position for a year, I decided to move on."
good,"I work full time overnight at Kroger as one of the guys who stock the shelves and it's pretty ok.  You get paid an extra dollar on the hour for working overnight.  If you are a reliable worker managers will give you a lot of hours and will honor days you request off.  Working at Kroger is a union job too which I love, you cannot be fired very easily."
good,It is a good part time job. They work with the hours of my other job and I like that. The department I work in is great although I would hate to work up front.
good,I enjoyed my time at Kroger. The people were wonderful to work with. Kroger is very flexible with your schedule which was nice to have. You also get paid every week which is also nice.
good,"Loading trucks and picking selected food from the warehouse's shelf to go out to different store in different regions. The job consist of a lot of standing, moving around, bending and lifting."
good,"Good place to work while your in school. they do really well to work around school schedules. very easy place to work, face paced when being a cashier."
good,The pharmacy can be a good place to work and you will learn a lot. The pharmacy can be super busy most of the time and can be a lot to keep up with. One of the downsides of working here is they tend to ignore bad behavior with some technicians instead of addressing it.
good,"While the job has its good days, a seeming lack of interest or care from management makes the job more difficult than it should be. There are slower days, but most days are spent taking out anywhere between fifty to one hundred fifty orders. That many orders would not be a problem if there were enough employees to handle the workload."
good,"When I started working there, everyone was super friendly and I got comfortable very quickly. The job itself was not very stressful, the only part I really had a hard time was working the hand gadget thing."
good,"Learned to work with people of different backgrounds, co-workers are friendly, everyone is just trying to do their job. Things can be hectic and more demanding if visitors are coming to the store. Overall not bad, but wouldn't recommend full time."
good,its is a fast pace working environment where multitasking is a good skill to have. communication is key to keep your stress level down so you know what needs to be done daily.
good,The job was one of my best job I had. We had great managers and they were and they were helpful and kind. The only problem was that the higherups make bad decisions and it stresses out the mangers and they bring stress to the employees to make ridiculous standards which can make the job rough.
good,"excellent job as I enjoy working with the meat department and the people I work with, the company is heading in a new direction such as pre packaged meats, so as I enjoy cutting meat everyday, I will not be able to do what I enjoy doing, just a few times rather than everyday, so it is time to look some where else for something else fun to do."
good,"Kroger has helped me to learn how to complete MTM in a quick and responsible manner. Retail pharmacy is about to change gears. I love the people interaction, but mostly I love the ability to change lives by simply using the MTM skills I have recently learned along with the skills learned throughout the years."
good,"I worked there for many years and didnt mind it, but I got fed up with being the scapegoat for my departments problems. Management would give me a hard time sometimes because I was the on me there working and they never blamed the people working before me on how they left the department so i always got blamed for it. They may have just been trying to criticize me, but it seemed like they were singling me out and I was tired of it."
good,"Very fast pace, you have to be able to keep up with the demands of the business. Managers just demand sells, they don't care that their team is running at 117 percent of their team."
good,Very fun place to work; coworkers felt more like friends than employees. Unfortunately struggled to work out good schedules with management but would go back in a heartbeat if they would be more flexible around school hours.
good,"Can be busy and can be slow. Have to deal with rude customers, a lot. Management can get on your case. Supervisors are nice. Great co workers. 15 minute paid breaks. One break for up to four hours, two breaks after working seven hours. If your a minor you get a 30 minute unpaid lunch."
good,This was a part-time job I took in order to save money for my college education.  They would have kept me on permanently if this was my intended career.
good,This job requires lifting. The workplace environment is friendly. Management changes a lot. The hardest part is the physical labor. The most enjoyable part is the cohesiveness.
good,I was blessed to be able to work for The Kroger Company as a co-op Assistant Energy Manager while going to college full time. Management was tremendous to me by allowing me to be their co-op for 1.5 years instead of the typical 1-semester term.
good,"In this new age of big box stores, many employees feel there is a disconnect between management and associates. Employees have been treated more and more as replaceable people rather than part of the company family. Kroger is an exception to this. The atmosphere is welcoming, calm, and caring. Management tries to interact with all employees, treating them as part of the family."
good,Stressful work that needs to be done on time. Often short staffed requiring extra work to be done per person adding to the stress of being done on time.
good,Very good environment nice people good pay the hours can fluctuate the people are reasonable and willing to listen if you are having any difficulties.
good,I don't believe it is easy to work at Kroger and make a career out of it. It is also hard to live off Kroger salary because the pay you start off at is low.
good,"For the most part I got along with nearly all of my co-workers, the issues started with how quickly we moved through management, and my need for a more stable job. If you can get a cashier job or higher, Kroger just gets better the longer you work there. From bonus checks, benefits, and annual raises until a cap."
good,Overall my experience while working at Kroger was good. I enjoyed some of the people. There are some things that could've been  much better. It depends on your role of work as well. I was a Courtesy Clerk and it was not all great.
good,"Not a bad place to work for teens. But if you have a family, you will struggle. The work isn't to taxing but it can take a year to get benefits last time I worked there."
good,"Salaries are not adjusted to keep up with industry.  You have to leave and come back as a consultant to get paid what you are worth, versus salary adjustments being made internally for their loyal associates who chose to stay with a company versus job hop.  There has also been a lot of leadership changes recently for the worse which is disappointing."
good,It is an okay place to work.  But when you go to transfer call the union first to see how to do so.  I didnt do that and i lost my job.  Thanks Kroger
good,"Typical day at work is you come in and do your job, along with other miscellaneous duties. There was not much growth professionally but I grew as a person. I learned how to be patient with customers and a decent conversationalist. The hardest part of my job is standing on your feet for the whole day. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with the customers and giving them the best possible service."
good,"The days were busy, and you stayed busy. the employee's were friendly and easy to work with. Customers were easy to work with. Putting a smile on the customers face was my main goal, you never know if you might make someones' day better."
good,"A typical day at work is making sure production is continued throughout the work shift. What I learn is everyday is different. Since I've been at Kroger's some I hated to see leave, and some get really involved in the office politics. The hardest part of the job is the physical activity which at the end of the day takes it toll on you. The most enjoyable part of the job is some of my coworkers and the discounts."
good,Typical day would include multitasking and getting things done quickly. I learned to work efficiently. Management was very helpful. Workplace culture was sometimes stressful. Hardest part of the job was always multitasking with customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help the customers.
good,It was enjoyable to a degree. They were flexible with my hours and the people were nice. The management was good. Kroger hours given are based on store performance if the store does badly that quarter they will cut hours.
good,"Can be a quick paced work day or it could be slow paced. Most co workers are friendly. Management was poor in almost every department, but they are getting better and/or being replaced."
good,"Kroger has taught me a lot and I have been able to create a highly customer service based atmosphere anywhere I go, my work ethic and ability to learn at a fast pace helped me move up and advance quickly"
good,"Selling jewelry for Kroger is fun. Pay isn't great but perfect for a part time job. I would recommend that this job be for fun money only, not the main source of income."
good,"I really liked my job , i worked night shift i am also a night person . so it was very fine for me . I even got muscle now from workings so hard !!!!!"
good,"push carts, bag groceries very friendly people.ots of customers.. fresh foods, nice staff members including myself. hardworking people for the job. good team"
good,There are plenty of things that I would like to say but overall I learned what I was capable of. After working at so many jobs and going to school at the same time I found that while working here it is hard trying to balance a school life and a work life without them intermingling and becoming more confusing throughout the day.
good,Working as a pharmacy technician at Kroger was a great experience. The typical day was fast paced and involved working with the pharmacy team to fulfill pharmacy duties and help customers.
good,This is a great place to work as your first job. Although you will be required to work outside on lot in any weather condition. I would say that is the hardest part of the job.
good,"Its a union job which has pros and cons, but that at least meant you got raises every 6 months or so and that you got a week paid vacation after your first year."
good,This environment is great for those that like to work hard. I loved the fast pace and the ability to interact with the public. There is room to grow if you're willing to put in the time and effort.
good,The best part of the day is talking with the customers that you see everyday. The customers you see everyday become like part of the family and to see them smile when they see you is great.
good,"The pharmacy at kroger is usually very busy so I was constantly doing something, which I loved. It could get very stressful at times due to how busy we were and not enough help. But overall was a good job."
good,"started as bagger, then worked up to cashier, then to deli with cooking and keeping up with temps for all food cooked and frozen.  Learned some new techinques of cake decorating"
good,"I worked at Krogers for about 6 mos, the only issue I had was the lack of enthusiasm by the other employees. I also realized that the company in the higher manager areas in the store communicated better than dept level supervisors.   It was also alot more physical than my previous employer. Lack of enthusiasm from the truck drivers or help in regards to how the company brought there stock to store. It was dangerous at times."
good,It's a nice stop gap between jobs for me.  The best part is the customer service and the satisfaction of preparing their food the way they want it.  I have learned a lot about how to cut meat and seafood and how to prepare different meals while working there.
good,Fun at times and fast-paced but my hours were inconsistent. Some weeks I did not get any hours at all due to new people being employed which was unfair to the people that were there first.
good,"Worked hard daily to assist in the morale with the 4 walls of our location. worked closely with department managers with sales floor execution, Displays. Assisted with on boarding of new associates."
good,"Coming in counting medication (tablets,capsules), entering customers insurance and personal information on computer. Assisting pharmacist with customer needs and imputing information on computer."
good,My work experience at Krogers was almost 30 years ago.  I'm sure the culture has changed since then.  I had a manager who didn't understand pharmacy operations and was not supportive.
good,Full-Time is the key you can advance butt it takes time an when you move up they tend to treat you badly even if you do a good job for them.Good health benefits if you can get Full-Time.
good,I enjoyed the time I worked for Kroger Pharmacy. It is a good work environment that provides similar job satisfaction and financial compensation as other top rated pharmacies.
good,"I would come in during the morning or afternoon. I work in the customer service booth so I solved a lot of problem, processed a lot of returns, bill payments and money transfer. Great environment, great employees, great customers, but the pay is definitely not that great."
good,"They train there management to run there stores, maybe they need to train them to communicate with the employees!!!!! Also if you dedicate 5 years of your life to there store they with denain a week of vacation.... POOR MANAGEMENT and also the union is not perfect either!!!!!"
good,This job was more fast-paced on the go. Always had stuff to get done and was never just standing around. Had lots of responsibilities and learned a lot about sales and how to handle orders and inventory.
good,"Good place to work when starting out in the job market, as you work more hours you end up getting to pick your shifts from the select a schedule which meant I could take days off for family events and things, You don'r get paid leave or health benefits until you have been there over a year."
good,"Fun environment, but doesn't pay enough for a person to survive on. Management was great, listened to ideas. Not really room for upward mobility unless you are handpicked."
good,It was a great place to work until Management Changed and My boss was removed for unkniown reasons. However it is a fast paced job and somewhat a friendly place to work
good,"My days were usually great. There are a lot of hard workers and people who always help. I learned to decorate cakes, work in deli and bakery- all positions, I did get some drug GM experience, cashier experience. I was on the customer first promise team and loved it. Some people who have been there a long time were hard to get to change ways when the store was progressing. The hardest part of my job was having selfish management. I loved. Y job and working there, i loved the customers and helping anyone. I enjoyed decorating cakes and watching peoples reactions. I loved learning bew departments and different ways to decorate. I loved my co workers."
good,Working with the public sucks and it will always suck but this is the only place that will start you out at/above min. wage and give you a raise every 6 months. A job is a job but it does help that the place isn't a dump and you don't feel like you're working for pennies.
good,"Working at the pharmacy I learned is very stressful. I worked at a high traffic, very busy pharmacy that is one of the best in the district. So there is a lot of pressure to be a very good technician and a lot of room to make small errors. Communication is essential here, and there was limited time for help as someone who had no prior experience and is not certified yet, because other staff members were always busy and the pharmacists were usually very stressed out from doing a lot of multitasking at the same time. But other than that, they would try to have a kind of ""family"" atmosphere when ever there was a time to relax with other co-workers on the job. Unfortunately there was not a lot of interaction with co-workers because of how busy it is and can feel distant at times."
good,"I worked for Kroger for  six years in two different stores. I enjoyed working with the public and helping customers.  "
good,"- Calm, Relaxed and focused environment "
good,"I enjoyed my job a lot in the bakery. However, I think there needs to be more restrictions on the deli/bakery to how clean the area needs to be. I found many employees careless about the mop water, or not even cleaning the floor. The management was good for the most part, but there were a lot of relationships built to where no one wanted to fire the people who truly needed to leave. The hardest part was not getting everything done on time with my hours. Sometimes people would leave so much work behind that it made it difficult to finish the things I needed to have done."
good,"It is a fast pace environment with good employees and managers."
good,"everyone within the staff are great! great atmosphere and most of the regular costumer's are awesome. has that small town feel still, but you can tell its growing fast."
good,I enjoy the job. Pay is good and I enjoy the people I work with. Work to life balance is tuff with the hours out in but we are paid better than anyone else in the area.
good,"Kroger was a great starter job. I started this job my sophomore year of high school and left my freshman year of college. This job was a great way to make a little bit of money. The management was great for the most part. However, the downside to working at Kroger are the co workers. It seemed that many of my co-workers didn't care and would often slack off. Other than that my working experience at Kroger was quite a pleasant one."
good,"Good company to work for"
good,"When I was first starting there were many people helping to train. You will work with a lot of people and help in ways that might go beyond your role. Expect to help customers, they will ask you where everything is, even if you don't know the store layout or stay in one place."
good,really fast paced every thing on trucks has to put out on the shelves or in back stock every day. you have to run so many case per hour then at the end of the day all the shelves have to be pulled to the front edge.
good,A good first job but is okay for a long term job. I’ve had worked here for almost 5 years so not the worst job. Definitely a good choice for people in college or school.
good,I enjoyed working there most of the time. The only reason I left was because I worked overnight and had school in the morning. I would recommend Kroger to anyone.
good,Kroger was a fun environment to work in most days and you have job security because you are in the union. Management didn't always understand the tasks we had to do and how long it took to do them.
good,"All in all a good company. They are good to work with students on their schedules for schools or if you also have another job you work for.  "
good,The best part of this job is that you have nice people to work with and the hours are very flexible. The management treat you nice and they understand any situation that you may be in.
good,"My typical workday consisted getting the store ready, such as deposits, counting down each register and scheduling.  I learned a lot about each of the customers that entered the store, accounting and bill pay. The management was great the work culture was down to earth and we had a diverse culture of employees. The most enjoyable part of my jobs was getting to meet differnt people."
good,"I found myself to be out of character for the position I held there. The work itself was not an issue, The scheduling and rescheduling to accommodate school kids that applied and stated their availability was weekends only and then couldn't work weekends."
good,i really enjoyed working for kroger and think they are a great company but that said I can not say the same for some of the management there. they will force you in to work on your days off almost weekly and can and have given as shot of notice as you walking out the door clocked off for your weekend to get told you have to come back tomorrow morning. other then that everything else about that company is fantastic. from all the benefits and great pay its almost worth getting forced in all the time.
good,"A typical day at work was fun and easy going, sometimes a few problems arose but nothing I couldn't handle."
good,"I think the summary says enough.It was fast paced and met some rather interesting people along the way. The people I worked with are the best, period. We were like a unit or to some extent a family of sorts."
good,I position consisted of verifying sales plan and great execution.  I love the aspect of building displays and being able to be creative on the job.  hardest part of the job was making sure departments were set up at a certain time and that it was exactly how it was laid out on the sales plan.  Kroger gave me the opportunity to further my career and help me advance in different areas of the company.
good,"I'm part time but I want to get to full time, the work I do isn't very hard and it is enjoyable to go to work so if I can get full time that would be great."
good,The place is very fast paced and is not the most forgiving  when it comes to people not ding there job but they also under stand that your there to make money not the hole you want to make to place go far.
good,I do not have anything to say about the job. It had some great days and some not so great days. There has been a lot of changes over the past couple of months.
good,A typical day was fast paced and I truly enjoyed the customers. The job requires you to be quick on your feet and to be focused on the task at hand. You must be able to multitask.
good,"An average shift consists of ringing up and sometimes bagging orders for the customers, keeping the area around the register clean and in order, occasionally assisting a customer with an issue or trouble locating an item, and especially a friendly attitude."
good,"Wages are terrible until you top out or get promoted, but if you are persistent, they do become competitive. Benefits are good. Many discounts offered. "
good,"Not a bad first job, but don't stay to long, you'll get attached. Expect minimum wage with little increase. Union guarantees at least 12 hours a week, but takes $12 per paycheck."
good,They try to create a good working environment but it is hard because it is fast paced and high volume. I enjoyed working there and have actually reapplied.
good,"I worked as an E-commerce (Clicklist) associate. On most days, the the amount of orders the store received really stacks up. You have to move at a fast and reasonable pace while still helping those that continue for shop for themselves on the sales floor. At the end of the day, it's worth it to know that the people you work with are kind and willing to help if you are in need. These same people make the work environment enjoyable."
good,clocked in on time .   counted my drawer .  keyed in to register .  be more flexible.     one of the nicest management I have work for . very up scale culture  .  when customer wasn't listen to reason and I had to go get management. co-workers in a day.
good,working at kroger was easy but the pay was minimal so i had to find a better paying job at the time. the manager was flexible and helpful. i liked the atmosphere of the store but did not like how you would have to scrub for hours
good,"Probably the best store to work in that will provide experience with fair pay. The management tends to be quite good in most places, but a few bad mangers are in every store. Every department is quite tight knit and stick together in their tasks, as it should be, you'll rarely be left out to dry by your fellow workers. Hours however, can be either very hard to come by, or difficult to work around depending on the time of year and your department. I worked in Floral, so my hours rose a great deal around certain Holidays, but dropped a lot during the ""off season"". Which is fine, but be sure to talk to your manager about how many hours you're trying to get, most will work it out with you."
good,"Not a bad place and the people are friendly but the pay is low and it is hard to get on as full time even if you get 40 hours a week. I moved departments and the new department is supposed to pay a little more. Been waiting for about 2 months now and still haven't received the raise or back pay. I have loads of previous experience including restaurant management but was started off at 7.35 phr."
good,"Good but like all jobs, can be stressful. Not a hard place to work. Very friendly but at my store there is more older individuals and sometimes It's hard working with them, but you tend to brush it off."
good,Work with members to have store ready in the morning for the ciustomets.. work with orders to replenish the store for next day delivery.scan store to keep store in good condition.
good,The problem with the job is that a lot of people don't look there best and sharpest. There are people that are missing teeth etc and that is not attractive. There is no health care provide to you unless you are full time potion. The work place culture is kind of boring repetitive task like bagging for six hours or getting carts. A lot of the people I work with are either in High School or in College or retired. They sometimes have to hire people with special needs so that they can say they hire everybody that apply there for the Kroger store.
good,A rewarding job with many areas to grow.  Managers provide many areas to grow and advance within the company.  Uniforms are comfortable and easy to obtain.
good,A really good first job! I enjoyed it and it taught me a lot. They are very willing to work around your class schedule and are understanding to personal and school issues.
good,I learned how to deal with difficult people especially during the holidays the hardest part of my job was doing the closing duties on my first week in the meat and seafood area
good,"No day was the same. The manager wasn't helpful and I was only getting 12 and a half hours for 2 months. I loved the environment and my coworkers who genuinely made me fee appreciated. I liked most of the managers across the store, however the front end manager who I dealt with most often was very rude and wasn't interested in assisting me. Another HUGE PLUS was the break room! There was plenty of cake, all the time. And occasionally soda, cookies, donuts, etc."
good,Not enough hours given to the department for quality time to finish tasks. Pay needs to be increased and timely bonuses for good employees. Coworker were great.
good,Kroger is ok in the past few years they've leaned more towards the Walmart model of things. As in more work less pay and mistakes that cost some employees money.
good,"Well I enjoyed working for them but the pay was a little low and my hours kept changing unexpected. The people were great and I made a lot of friends there, but the management kinda  lacking in some parts of the store and the advancement was kinda hard to move up to a higher positions of the company, but other then that I would go back if I have to."
good,"I would generally recommend this to someone who has worked somewhere before, Clicklist combines the jobs of stocker, bagger, and cashier into one. Which is not somewhere to start but once you get the hang of it it's very rewarding."
good,"Good Stable Job. Benefits are decent, however pay is not always representative of ones abilities. Has retirement benefits. Overall it is a good but not great company to work for."
good,good company; making changes employees are not happy with right now; disconnected management; great potential with new improvements; promotions are good but are not paid.
good,It is a very fun place to work with enjoyable co-workers. The pay could be better but you don't really do much. The managers in the store I work at aren't as hard working. They expect a lot out of certain people and play favorites
good,"Had a lot of fun and met new people but the management wasn't the best. The General manager didn't care about where you wanted to work and tried to throw people in areas that he knew they wouldn't like. Also while I worked there, they had another bagger that constantly harassed me, threaten me, and even try to hit me but they wouldn't do a thing because his dad was head of the pharmacy. That is straight up favoritism and is disgusting to work in an environment like that."
good,"The work environment is pretty stable and laid back.  My coworkers and I pretty much all get along, especially if everyone is willing to do their share.  Kroger does not like us to have overtime.  The hours could be a little bit better.  Overall, it is an alright place to work."
good,"The employees are friendly. The managers were great, always stepping in to help when it was needed. The managers were always asking if everything was alright, and if there was anything they could do."
good,"Department managers are a little nutty because union made them with this""i don't care  attitude"" if you can get along with  worthless Union and department managers that are union butt kissers some of the store managers are okay my store manager was probably one of the better ones of any of them in the area. . they really do not work with your schedule and some of the Assistance store managers are really really crazy.  Kroger is okay for your first job or if you're just right out of high school or something however the old Krogers were the better Krogers but nowadays Krogers are hard to kind of work with"
good,"I enjoyed the time I was here. The employees were friendly and supervisors were cool. I never got full time benefits because no matter what I never got full time hours, always 2 or 3 hours under."
good,"This does solely depend on which Smiths you worked at , as an overall company Kroger Stores offer little pay to their employees for how much work they do and also give them too short of breaks for how much they stand on their feet."
good,The job was fine.  Not too difficult.  I left because of my manager at my location.  Favoritism was rampant.   Got written up for not stocking some stock on a day when I was not even on the schedule.
good,"My first job. Really low raises. Could have found plenty of other higher paying locations to work at if I had transportation to get there. Breaks were okay. 15 to 30 minutes long, though there were days when supervisors forgot to give me my break entirely. I was told to not remind about breaks as they don't like that. Sundays were really busy but that is typical in several places."
good,Working for this company was an experience I like that I have. The co-workers were friendly but to themselves. The managers are a little resourceful when they are free.
good,Lots of customer service work. Needs to be willing to help in other departments and still be able to take care of your own.  In charge of both the dairy and frozen department.
good,"Kroger was an ok place to work , I wish the pay would of been more .     The people that work there are like family and come together at your very low ."
good,"The typical day at kroger is that of a busy one; the main skill you will learn at a kroger is multitasking. Can range from many examples, one mostly being able to talk to many customers and assisting them all. With every customer you assist, it brings a warm joy to your heart. Making the customer happy and satisfied with their time at a Kroger, is the main goal of the Kroger family.We want the customer to come keep coming back each time, but happier than the last. Most of your peers work in a team to achieve the daily goals for the company. Helping customers is the most enjoyable part for myself, seeing them light up with admiration is warming. The tricky part of kroger is meeting those daily goals for the company. There are many obstacles in the way each and every day, learning to work with and around them will help the Kroger family."
good,Worked for Kroger as a pharmacy technician for several years.  Kroger was a very friendly company to work for.  Wage and benefits  were comparable to other stores.
good,"I just unloaded the trucks and gave stocking assignments. Made sure everything was done to company standards at the end of the night and clean up. I was responsible for scheduling and item maintence and dealing with the customers making sure they were pleased. I learned a lot about how to deal with people, play to employees' strengths and get the job done on time. Management was in constant rotation and was hard to deal with at times. Hardest part of the job was just being understaffed at times and at the time I was very young enjoyed the job and stayed highly motivated throughout but as time went on working thirds became difficult having a family."
good,I love the fact that i can make a customer trip easy as possible love the routine of work pretty easy going amd always on pace so time is usually never a time ! Best managers that are very understanding and always kind
good,This was one of the better jobs that i had. It was my first non-seasonal job. They were great about promoting people who work hard and get their jobs done quickly and correctly
good,"A typical day at work consists of Clocking in and Getting all products ready to be baked and then cooled and decorated, packaging and pricing all products and stocking them on shelves. The hardest part of the job would be the hours were very early and took a little while to adjust and the most enjoyable part of the job would be it was very organized and i was trained pretty well"
good,Quick paced environment with a focus on customer service. Need to be able to work as a team to be successful in a shift and have a friendly attitude while helping patients at the counter.
good,"Kroger was my first job, and I had been placed as a store clerk after a couple of months, but i was never given an opportunity to do more than what was expected. I worked night shifts where there was nothing ever to do."
good,"Over all it was a good place to work. Like any job you have your management issues, policies that do not make sense yet we made the best of it as a cashier and as a midnight tag employee. You have to laugh and be able to have fun while getting the job done."
good,Love both the people I work with and the customers. Benefits are a BIG plus in todays world. Hours I work interfer with home live both is the position I chose at this time.
good,"pretty easy job to do, environment is friendly and customers are great. only con is the pay. if they paid their employees more, maybe more people would stay. the amount of people who come and go is ridiculous. so many people get hired and only stay a few weeks because of the pay. other than that, its a decent job."
good,Was an ok job don't think I was paid enough or had enough hr per day or weekbut the job was easy just along as you get your work done you will be alright kroghers isn't that bad athoe the managers and other employees are exceptional people
good,It's a good place to work if you are willing to work hard and don't like to have much family time. If you are management your weekends and holidays basically get forfeited but it is good pay.
good,"Kroger is a great company to build and move up, but you need to get your foot in the door. Kroger is a union company so merit and promotional raises are not obtainable."
good,"Go in and put stock away for a few hours and can just do your own thing without any trouble."
good,A typical day at Kroger can be as fun and challenging in the same sentence. You are making plans to give customers the best experience possible while at the same time ensuring that you are doing things to keep you competitive and profitable.
good,"A typical day at work included unloading trucks, stocking, and organizing. Management was great. Hardest part of the job (being a girl) was unloading the heavy pallets."
good,"How some of the managers in the store get promoted or how full timers became full timers is unbelievable, the work is fine and the coworkers are awesome, but the management in Kroger is just terrible."
good,I got this as my first major job and I have now been here for over 2 years. I am trained in multiple departments (however that doesn't increase my pay just gives me more opportunities for hours) but typically I stock dairy products. I have no real issues other than their training leaves a lot to be desired.
good,"Kroger is a very nice store to shop in, the people are nice and the selection is great. On the other hand, i think it is a terrible place to work because you don't get paid enough for what you're required to do and handle."
good,"I like working in a deli one of my first jobs.. made sandwiches and other foods. Deep fried food. Prepared salads and other foods,customer service. Worked for the bakery dept once in awhile"
good,"I worked in the front end, and so I constantly had to deal with other employees and customers. It's a great starting job though and it gives you good experience dealing with people."
good,"Good job once you get through rough training. Takes at least a year to fully train someone. Over 50% of new hires quit. Training is spotty too. Managers have no control over bad employees because of Kroger's union. Managers don't participate in the union, so there's no incentive for them to correct the employees if there's an issue. Bad attitudes can ruin a day, whether it comes from a fellow coworker or a customer. Most customers are great but some are just rude and mean. The managers don't want to lose sales, so even if the customer is wrong, typically they're ""right"" and still get what they want. Not good in a pharmacy. Kroger has great benefits but they'd be better off not having the technicians in the union. The union stops the competition to be the best tech. Instead you get those lazy people that are just there to do the minimum and collect a paycheck. Then there are other technicians that work hard and get nothing for it. If you can get over the cons, it's not a bad job. The pay is not near good enough to put up with all the responsibilies of a technician (which is ever expanding but pay is not) and bad management. Dealing with insurance issues with customers is a true nightmare."
good,"I was a Co-Manager. The pay now is fairly competitive. They do work you several hours but if you actually work hard, have some form of intellect and don't steal and be of poor decision making you have a future here."
good,Handled hundreds of customers each day and learned quality customer service skills. I most enjoyed how great my co-worker were and how awesome they treated me.
good,"Typical day of work consisted of ensuring meat and seafood were properly cut ina timely manner. Weighed, packaged and labeled meat and seafood products."
good,"I work in the Chinese kitchen at Dillon's store 33 It is an okay job it is balanced but, I would like to move forward and continue my education and find a job as a CNA and the company is very good though."
good,"worked there for only six months, the location I was at in paticlar has somewhat raised standards at the department level, though so long as you are not a noticeably slow worker you should be fine."
good,the job was great. the only bad part about the job was the pay otherwise great people to work with. Management was horrific. Had a different boss every two months
good,Korger just does not pay enough it hard to live off of the wages that they pay you. the people make it fun and the co-workers make it enjoyable. other than that RAISE WAGES
good,"I enjoyed working at Kroger. The biggest problem was that I would be scheduled for 17-22 hours per week, then I would either be called in or I would have to work over the time I was scheduled to get off. There was not consistency, not even to the time frame that I was scheduled. The pay wasn't enough for my family to survive off of. Getting a second job would be impossible with the issues with scheduling. I did enjoy the work environment, the benefits were great, and they even provide help with schooling. It would recommend this job to someone who has less responsibilities at home or is going to school."
good,"I have worked there a month and they are the most unorganized company I have worked for. There are way too many people in charge per department. Nice environment, there are some great people that I work with."
good,"The Kroger Co has great opportunities to continue your career.  Depending on the field you want for your life, they have a wide arrange of positions.  When young, the position of bagger is open to teach you responsibility.  It teaches you to take pride in what you accomplish.  Cashiering teaches you to think more about the customer.  When you have a good management team in the customer service desk, they can lead you to becoming a team leader.  Once becoming a team leader, your skills will keep you moving up into the company to a position of greater value.  Working in the stores can be stressful depending on the work environment but working well with everyone will give you the confidence to go as far as you want."
good,gerat work place i learned alot of things. kroger was one of my first jobs i learned how to greet different people manages were great people and fun to work for
good,"As a whole Kroger is a good company to work for. I have learned a lot about operating in retail and running a store that makes close to $500k a week. Depending on where you are located though, the leadership can vary and you can have a great team or a not so great team that leaves a lot to be desired. Work is 10+ hours a day and while its typical to work 5 days, there will be times where you will work 5 1/2 to 6 full days at a time as well as staying hours past when you were schedule to get off depending on what is going on at the time. You work will people of all ages and backgrounds so you have to know how to communicate to high school kids all the up to people years older than yourself."
good,"On a typical day, I would come early in the morning, and open for the Starbucks inside Kroger. Since we were short staffed, I typically managed single shifts - even through our busiest hours. Customers quickly became accustomed to my friendly face and enjoyed coming back to see me to receive their coffee as well as great customer service ( a rarity in the morning nowadays). "
good,"Very good place to work.  Its a stress free job however, it can be stressful at times.  It is very diverse place to work. I think they can make more full time jobs for people since there growing as a company"
good,"Okay place to work at. Management was decent but they switched out store managers way to often so you never get a chance to work with them over a couple years to get to know them better. I learned a lot on social skills and being able to talk to people you have never met before. The culture was okay but at times it felt a bit pressured especially working with other people that are different from you and brought their own personal problems to work made it more difficult. The hardest part was probably dealing with customers since you can't make everyone happy once in awhile you will get a mad customer and management would get on your case. Probably the most enjoyable part was getting the satisfaction of having a manager tell you ""good job"" or ""great work"" after finishing a task."
good,Overall this company is great. They work very hard to keep their people happy and have great benefits. The management is normally pretty great with a few rotten apples that can't be tossed out because of the union.
good,This is a retail job dealing with customers. I would say that everything will go smoothly but that is not true. I loved my time working with Kroger and made some lasting friendship with former co- workers
good,"A typical day at work is unpredictable and forever changing. I've learned to be a more patient and understanding person from working with the public. My managers told me early on that business is business and never take it personal, everyone has their day and it has nothing to do with you. I keep my head high and treat all customers with respect to get the most out of my day."
good,I've learned a lot at this store but my dissatisfaction with this store in particular is the fact that if you weren't born in that state they looked down upon you. Other than that no complaints.
good,I loved working at krogers and meeting new people. What I didn't like however was the fact that management picked favorites over other people and when you called to say you were running late it still counted against you
good,"it is pretty easy to move up and around in the store, you work hard and you get reworded, that simple. the managers are nice and reliable, it is pretty easy to get a shift change if you need it too."
good,I enjoyed working as a pharmacy technician at Kroger. My coworkers were great and the customers were pleasant for the most part. Very organized and mostly positive environment.
good,"I was first attracted to this job because I thought they could work with my school schedule. But after Summer and school started I warned them about my classes and they weren't willing to work with me. Very unorganized Human Resources as well, and your business gets out very easily. So if you do choose to work here, keep to yourself."
good,"Typical day at work depends on the shift. Mornings would consist of balancing tills and the safe. Handling any call ins, reviewing staffing for the day in order to place employees where needed to best satisfy our customers.Night shifts would consist of gathering the tills from the registers all over the store. Adding reports into a running total to insure accurate bookkeeping. "
good,"A typical day at Kroger is all day customer service. Most days, that's not a problem. Some days, it can truly wear you down. Management lacks any compassion when it comes to your personal life or if/when you call out. It's always great when you get happy, easy to please customers. It's difficult when management doesn't take into consideration the 12 hours of work you have to get done in the 8 hours you have to get it done in."
good,There are so many different opportunities at King Soopers. There are so many office jobs as well as store/ retail postitions. It is a great place to work.
good,"Time consuming job that wouldn't be recommended for someone who is looking for work life balance. Overall pay and benefits are awesome, you work with great people, and have plenty of room for advancement."
good,"Employment experience varies vastly depending on what management is at the store. People with no business being in management get promoted based on who they know, and they'll hang you out to dry if it suits them to make an example of you. If you can find a good store, it's a great place to work. Don't expect to keep the same management team for more than a year or two, though. They don't hire full time anymore and turn over rate is high for management because they treat anyone who's not in the union terribly. God forbid you or your child gets sick often. They're not understanding about tardiness or sick days."
good,Hard to advance through the company without knowing the right people. Advancements depend on store location and willingness to move to another location.
good,This is a great company to work for at the entry level with many chances to move up and learn more about certain departments and management of a retail establishment.
good,"It was a nice place to work and nice atmosphere. I felt like I was helping customers.  It was a great team atmosphere.  You help all ages, ethnic backgrounds, and economic states."
good,"A typical work day consist of much running around the store assisting customers.I trained and worked in many departments of the store including,cashier,shelf stocker /night crew help,book keeping,deli and meat department. I consider myself to be multicultural because i enjoyed the relationship i developed with regular customers that were from different countries.I learned how to take orders/request for clients that speak only Spanish.It brings me joy to work directly with people to make sure their needs are met before exiting the store."
good,"I met a lot of great people who made the work area fun. As a fuel clerk, my customer service skills and ability to multitask grew. But eventually, the work grew stagnant and didn't present any new challenges."
good,Easy to get started. Managemnt moves around a lot. Most managers are good. Limited upward mobility. Union protects workers well. Co-workers easy to work with.
good,"I enjoyed the environment and the employees I worked with. The work was easy far as the objectives I had to complete. I performed in bagging, assisting customers, attending carts, and stocking and condition items/merchandise."
good,"I do enjoy working for this company when the management of your particular store is concerned for the store's well being. When it is lacking, it isn't as enjoyable and teamwork is severely deprived. "
good,the Management is not so great honestly. They cut your hours and then hire people in the same department that you are in. They have alright benefits. You have the option on a 401 even as just part-time. trying to make a contract that new hires make more than employees currently working there
good,"Enjoyable place to work, nothing really good or bad to say. My only problem working there was how consistent I had remind my supervisors for scheduled breaks and lunches."
good,"Overall I do like working there, I  just would like to spread my wings more and do somethig else.  Co-workers are friendly and so are the managers.  They are always there to help improve the store and whatever needs to be done, Always willing to help accommodate employees and customers."
good,"it was very convenient that the pay was every week. the management was okay. they weren't always fair, but the overall job was great, and the customers were always amazing."
good,"Experiences may differ based on location, but life as a Courtesy Clerk can be rather hectic. This is especially true around the first of the month. Courtesy clerks are expected to do quite a lot of work rather quickly and with comparatively little compensation. That said, it's as fine a job as any if it's your first."
good,"Not a job for adults more for high school students "
good,"work too much for so little we have to move baskets, bag groceries  and stock groceries, but overall I enjoy working with the staff there, they are nice"
good,"Had no problems they have great benefits, and will work with you to advance. I enjoyed working with the people they will help if needed, there isn't anyone there that tries to hold you back from advancing."
good,A typical day at kroger is fast paced and hectic trying to keep up with sales at a busy million dollar per week store. You learn how to use teamwork and planning strategies to succeed on a day to day basis. Management is under too much stress from higher management to keep the morale in stores balanced. The most enjoyable part about kroger is meeting different people everyday and the amazing benefits.
good,"It requires much focus in such a fast paced environment. It requires a lot of organization, patience, and willingness to constantly learn. The employees are what will keep you coming back."
good,"Among some other positive things working in a big store like Kroger is the insurance, and my manager was very helpful as my first job in the "
good,brought materials needed to run to production areas.learned how important it is to keep materials in order and knowing how much materials are available and need to be stocked/ordered.enjoyed working with my management and my coworkers.hardest part of the job was working 3rd shift .best part was the coworkers
good,"It's a good place for a starting job or something short term, however it's nearly impossible to get full time or make any substantial amount of money."
good,"Once I arrived at work I would clock in at the back of the store. After clocking in, I would start my daily schedule(which varied day to day) by starting with bagging groceries and assisting elderly customers to there car and loading them properly for them. Once I did that for some time I would switch to cart pushing duty and clear and clean the lot of debris as well as stray carts. To finish off my day I would sweep all the isles and make sure that items were placed properly on shelves if not done so first time."
good,"generally speaking, the management cares for the employees under its charge, and does a good job of trying to engage the workforce in improving the work experience"
good,"Kroger is a good place overall but it just seems they can't keep people at the one I work at. Easy day is you get through work with no problems and can get all the food out and close everything down on time. On a hard day when we have only 2-3 people and it can be hard to close everything and deal with people coming every minute or so. I enjoy the fast pace of the deli, it's a very easy job if you have the right amount of people."
good,"Easy job meeting and talking to new people, improving your customer service. Breaks weren't that long but it was enough time to rest your legs because you're standing practically  all day."
good,It exposes you to all types of people and differences in the preferences they choose in the foods they eat. Its interesting to exchange different ways of preparing the same foods.
good,"It was interesting to train employees, to gain sales momentum and to see profit increase. There was a lot of interaction. There were advancement opportunities."
good,"Great benefits, but poor management skills. "
good,"The days were never the same. Always fun and new every week. The customers were always so nice and would ask for certain people, including me personally, every time they would shop."
good,"A company that is a great stepping stone to a great career. You have to put in the work, but if you do that, you'll be generously compensated. The benefits are very hard to beat."
good,"Kroger's is a great company to work for with great benefits,but If your looking to move up to management its a slow process. Love the people I work with in my dept."
good,"Kroger was a good place to work, but did have some draw backs. Short staffing is a very common issue, and raises are only given on a time bases, not performance. Most crew is enjoyable to work with and management does their job. The  most difficult part of the job was the amount of staff vs. work load. The most enjoyable part of working at Kroger was the crew. I made several friends while working here and they made my days much more enjoyable."
good,Was a good job and I got to work with some friends. Not really anything bad to say except they could pay more. It was a fun job just didn't pay enough for me to more further in life
good,"Great company that lets you grow and make decisions, rewards hard work and is fair and balanced. Depending on what job function you do, it's always in support of each other and all about the customer. Solid company and core values."
good,"There was a lot of scheduling errors and it always seemed liked everyone's schedule was wrong."
good,Got real sick had to quit. I was a mourning cashier great at customer service. The staff was excellent to work with. Had a fun time going to work
good,Working at Pick ' n Save was nice because I experienced great team work and build great relationships with daily customers.
good,Management are helpful and respectful. Hours are great but need to think about full time positions. Store is organized and friendly.
good,"Kroger is a good company to work for but is difficult to maintain a personal life.  Management works a lot of nights and weekends, many days working 10 plus hours.  Rewarding to work with people and see and help them develop. lots of Training and Development opportunities with Kroger."
good,My Kroger location lack team work. My job has started to become stressful. Management sucks. Time for a fresh start. Kroger is a job for kids that are in high school trying to get money to help pay for senior dues. Nothing more.
good,"My time at Kroger was something I enjoyed, even with my social issues it wasn't too bad. Everyone was friendly, the work wasn't too stressful, and the workflow was pretty smooth. My only real issue is that when I was injured on the way to work one day and was unable to make it in, I was summarily fired after my second missed day due to having missed two days in my first 90. The fact I had a doctor's note did not mean a thing to them in the end, as policy was to fire anyone who missed two days in the first 90 regardless of purpose."
good,"Cashier, daily paperwork, schedules, submit budgets, customer service, hire/train employees, go to meeting, build displays. I was only 16 when I started to work. I learned a lot and they molded me into a good employee. I was honest and had good work ethics."
good,"There is no typical day at Kroger. You're never in the same position twice. The hardest part of working for Kroger is staying consistent in such an inconsistent environment. If you like the challenge of change in both environment and expectations on a daily basis, working at Kroger can be a very enjoyable experience."
good,Worked there for 2 years and was never given a chance to move up. Like to pay minimum wage. Buggy duty was an hour at a time and sometimes multiple shifts of it
good,"A typical day was just unloading and stocking shelves. "
good,"Interact with customers daily about different products and prices"
good,"Job was very simple and not complex. Management was nice and professional. I learned working in the Fuel Center how to deal with all different types of people in various settings. The job pay was very poor for what was asked to do on a daily basis, but it was all I could get at that time. Hardest part of the job was some of the rude/mean customers for no reason. My favorite part is when someone would say thank you for doing a good job."
good,"First job I had, not bad for a first job but I certainly did not see myself staying here. Pay was barely above minimum wage at $7.45 and only made it to $7.75 by the time I left. Not much room for advancement despite knowing how to cashier, work Drug, Grocery, Meat & Seafood, Produce, and Dairy. Was promised help to get into an assistant manager position and never heard back. If it were not for the pay, I would have gladly stayed and continued to work at Kroger because I genuinely enjoyed working in the different departments and knew how to efficiently get all of my tasks completed before the end of my work shift."
good,"I enjoy working with the employees, as well as management. Everyone is friendly, active, and works well with others. The hardest part of the job is wage and compensation, and the enjoyable part is flexibility."
good,"Working at Kroger was a nice experience. Kroger is wonderful at showing how teamwork could really get make a hard job simple. If you prefer a cashiering job, I would recommend Kroger!"
good,I learned how to smile even when I did not want to. It also taught me a lot about sales as a demo girl. I enjoyed my time there as a young girl. I would not enjoy it now that I am older.
good,"They offer flexibility but no way to reward employees for hard work, like raises or bonuses. I have been with the company for a couple years and am trained in many different positions and departments but make the same amount. I enjoy working and getting things done but wish hard working employees weren't over looked."
good,the best part of the job were the co-workers they made your day way better when you would walk in just a big happy family. I also loved the   regular customers who would come in everyday and would right away get in your line. I disliked the managers never knew what they were doing and always made your day a living nightmare with nonsense. they never wanted to give you hours even if you begged them to.
good,Our store stayed pretty busy. I enjoyed working there. The staff and managment were great. I was able to learn a lot of different things about different meds there.
good,"fun place to work at, friendly co workers, good breaks, nice customers , nice management , easy work, the hardest part of the job is standing for multi0ple hours at a time"
good,"If you can manage to get locked in at full time, your set. I worked for Kroger 15 yrs at full time, and so long as you do your job and do it better than the younger new hires, your golden. Every day was stressful, as all retail jobs are. Some days are worse than others. Holidays were always a meat grinder for the sanity. But if you're personal time is flexible and your always available, your Kroger's hero. Co-workers tend to band together in a kind of high school style click having nothing to do with popularity and more to do with self defense against the occasional tyrannical manager. But again, that's relatively normal for retail environments. The one and only thing I learned from Kroger that is absolutely vital in any other work setting is charm. I hired on as a mousy little girl, and left with the ability to talk anyone into buying anything. Customer service is the coin of the realm in retail and if you learn to sell ice cubes to Eskimos, Kroger will always find hours for you. Stressful, manic, frustrating hours. Plus it is a union company, and although the unions in the south are very week, its better than ""right to work""."
good,"Working here really developed my personal professional performance and mindset for my later jobs. Moving to other departments were easy and made me feel useful knowing a bit more about each one, but that only happened because I dedicated most of my time and effort to work. Though my pay never raised aside from the yearly bump everyone revived, I did gain supervisor weight and approval/clearance which made work more versatile and pleasant with less restrictions. Management and co-worker communications were not always clear but things were friendly (or cordial). I did like working there, but I'd recommend it as a first job/side job for sure."
good,"I was a cashier. .I've learned you have to be very fast and efficient."
good,"Got all breaks, physical work, sometimes to cold inside.Alright to work for the company. Little pay for hard work.Learned to deal with people every day."
good,"I like working for Kroger.  Great benefits.  We have contests and potlucks around the holidays.  We have fundraising for Jerry's kids, military, and we also sell shamrocks.  We have the round up program that customers can round up there total to the next dollar and feed the hungry for local food banks."
good,Kroger always provided required training for all associates. Company always added new technologies. Certifications where need for several positions and company always provided appropriate OJT
good,"Dynamic work environment, inconsistent direction with upper level management. Clear company direction and the Division leadership is solid, District level not so much."
good,"I worked as a support analyst, talking to Kroger managers about problems with their systems, both inside the store and in the fuel centers."
good,"A typical work day at Kroger varies depending on your position; as a cashier/supervisor, you come in to work prepared and ready to provide exceptional customer service and are faced with challenges that the managers motivate you to overcome. There is always something to strive for within a Kroger company, whether it be a promotion, a raise, or simply learning something new. The environment is friendly and you are able to gain close and relatively personal relationships with all your co-workers while also maintaining professionalism."
good,It was fun working there. Everyone was nice and you were never just sitting there. I learned how bag stuff and move carts.
good,"I enjoy working for Kroger, I love the people I work with. It is a fun environment with plenty of room for advancement."
good,"Register patients, conduct part of physicals, take vitals, collect co payments, Great team to work for with fair pay, incentives and discounts."
good,it's an ok place to work for a part time job. the people there are mostly friendly a few people with bad attitudes and rude to customers but nothing to bad .i get alone with most co-workers. the work place is mostly drama free.
good,"A typical day at Kroger involves greeting customers friendly and taking care of any of their concerns. The management changed a lot throughout my time here, however they all have been great to work with. The other employees here are friendly and easy to get along with. There is really no bad part about this job and forming new relationships and having highly satisfied customers."
good,Management could use more work. Other than that the work is usually good in terms of working with school as long as you have paper form to prove it.
good,"I was a new technician training at a Kroger Pharmacy, but what I managed to learn in just a short month was a lot. From data entry, correctly dispensing product, to releasing patients, and a little bit of ajudication(that was the most difficult). I enjoyed my month there. It was extremely fast paced and I gave it my all. I thought I was doing just fine, except today as I write this, I was let go. "
good,"Fairly busy day to day, good people all around, and a decent work environment could be much better maintained throughout all shifts."
good,I worked for Fred Meyer Jewelers for 4 years and it is a great company I just needed to have a better work family life. I needed to be able to spend more time with my kids and husband.
good,"It was not a great job, the management was not the best.  But the other employees are what made that job bearable.  They only give you 15 minute breaks."
good,The work can be stressful but over the years I have learned so much as an employee and advanced a lot in myself being able to more openly communicate with general public. I really like being active and keeping moving its rare that there isn't much to do but at the same time it can be overwhelming.
good,It was a great working and learning environment. I learned a lot here and everyone was willing he teach and help. I wished I'd gotten more hours. Due to what I can only describe as a miscommunication I was scheduled correctly but other then that it was great.
good,"I quite enjoyed working for Payless Supermarkets. The store had a positive work environment and I enjoyed working with Everyone there! A typical day at work meant bagging grocery and seeing regular customers along with clearing carts from the parking lot 2-3 times a day. The management was great as where all of my co-workers, The hardest part of the job was being the person who stayed the latest to clear the entire parking lot of carts before you could leave."
good,Its a good job overall. Plenty of opportunities if you're willing to push it. I learned how to have good communication skill and costumer service.
good,"Typical work day at Kroger was rough sometimes. Since I was placed in many different areas, exp: cashier, customer service desk, fuel center, and deli, I was all over the place sometimes. Which is a good thing, keeps yourself busy. Co workers there were wonderful. very nice and friendly, always smiling. Since you normally have move then one manager, some of them were nice, some not so much. but overall they were good managers. Always helping you when your stuck. Id say the hardest part of Kroger would be the Customer Service Desk. Cashing high amount checks, doing money grams/orders. Most enjoyable part would have to be the people. Being around pleasant employment and customers always puts you in a good mood."
good,love the work pase. love the interaction.fast paced lots to get done rotate stock people and interaction.done wqith this notyhjij gt wehw5lmrlctsa\p;i
good,This is a pretty good place to work but the pay leaveesmore to be desired. Managers are friendly and customers are nice throughout the day
good,Most of the employees are friendly and willing to help you out if you need help. Managers are nice and appreciate good work and leave you in peace unless you don't do your job. Unfortunately the majority of jobs seem to be part-time. Also if you work here you'll more than likely have to work on weekends and holidays because that is when the store receives customers. Don't expect being able to take vacation time unless you've worked there for more than 3 months same goes for the health benefits.
good,The job is very simple and easy to do. Excellent Co-Workers. Excellent work/life balance and working around schedules with school and everyday life events.
good,fast paced work. the more you put effort in the better results management great coworkers awesome hardest part was the time challenge most enjoyble was the employees
good,I enjoyed the interaction with the customers. It was a real satisfaction to provide service to someone who is ready to walk out from frustration or confusion. I would explain the process and provide the answers to suther the customer and provide alternatives to what thay wanted in regards to what thay needed.
good,Good place to work. Benefits were adequate. Decent management. They were very good at training new employees and providing a safe work environment.
good,some days were bad calls to lines for ajustment the operator.most of the people were good to work with.was hot in plant with 3 ovens running at 400 deg.had to watch for pan hand up pans were very hot. break downs with dought or flour
good,Good working environment but raises are few and minimal. The insurance is minimal. You can get crossed trained in many areas to provide good experience when moving on.
good,"In the months i worked there, I was taught all I needed to know quickly. The job was simple and easy to do, but you need to be quick. the faster you are, the better your odds of making the cut are."
good,Kroger makes a lot of their own private label items.  They have over 31 manufacturing plants across the United States.  It can be a great place to work.
good,I enjoyed working as a customer service associate and cashier. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping others and being part of their good day. The hardest part was when we got extremely busy and I would balance everything in a timely fashion.
good,"Everything about it was wonderful, I mean for my first job. Being inexperienced, I'm not sure what I should say or not say. The people were great, save for a stubborn few. But that's anywhere you go. Such is life. Only complaint was the Managers didn't cooperate with each other, contradicting what other managers were assigning employees. Literally leaving me doing 3 jobs at once, which was not only stressful but indeed impossible to accomplish all the tasks at hand. I did the best I could with the time I was givin to complete. Surprisingly enough, co-workers thought I was a trooper/work freak with how fast I was completing my tasks since I was over worked and didn't want to be written up. Completing my tasks so I can work on the other managers request without getting yelled at by the others. Even when I had only 4 hours of cashier experience under my belt, and they had me open the store for two weeks straight by myself. Getting the entire front end set up for a busy day, helping Night crew finish they're job, and the general merchandiser job as well. It was a stressful environment to say the most. Please note, this store runs differently then the rest of the King Soopers, from what I was told anyway. Its owned by someone else entirely yet, still does business with Kroger."
good,"I enjoy my work"
good,I think Kroger overall is a good place for work. but the fact that they are a union sometimes hurts employees. Especially when it comes to advancement.
good,This by far is the best company I have worked for. The only reason I left was because of some people in the workplace that were impossible to work with. Overall this comany is great!
good,If your looking for something basic and fitting for your schedule Kroger is a great place for that. Good management team that is on the same page and looking to better the company.
good,Our pharmacy does over 500 prescriptions per day. Customer service is a must since we are a very high-volume industry.  I have learned to keep focused and maintain a professional demeanor no matter how stressed the work is. Being a team player and getting along with your co-workers is a must to allow the day to go smoothly. The hardest part of the job is trying to take care of so many customers in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part is knowing you customers on a first name basis.
good,"I was a closing meat clerk so my day normally consisted of stripping down, cleaning, and reassembling the machinery in the back room followed by cleaning the rest of the back room and the restocking all product ending with pulling the meat and seafood cases for the night. all of the different machines and policies for sterilization were interesting to learn as well as the organizational system based on product rotation. my coworkers were fun to deal with and my bosses were hardworking I hated the smell but I did love working in the freezer and moving all around all day."
good,I learned how to move I got some awards and it was also union .I became friends with some of the people it was ok place to work.
good,"I worked as a part time technician at this pharmacy. I found the job itself to be ok. However, during the time I was there, it seemed to me that the store manager made a lot of the final decisions for the pharmacy even though there was a pharmacy manager present. The store manager was not understanding of the ins and outs of a pharmacy, being that he had no pharmacy knowledge whatsoever. The head technician was a sour old lady who was quick to give insult. The management also got my pay wrong when I first came to work at the pharmacy and it was not corrected for a long time, when it was finally corrected I did not receive the back-pay that was promised to me."
good,Fun work place and managers appreciate their employees. Customer service is superb. The hours could be better but other than that it is a great company to work for.
good,Fast paced job. Job requires goals to met and exceeded daily. Customers made the job very rewarding. Moving up in the company is very easy.
good,"need more people"
good,"My time was spent mainly checking customers out, facing shelves, or managing the younger employees. I wish there would have been more room for promotion, it appeared that they don't think anyone under the age of 40 is manager material. They long sleeve shirts and ties were not practical for the work environment."
good,"Kroger is a great employer for a student trying to get through school and paying for essentials. I worked at the fuel station. The duties at the fuel station can be alot, but you have little supervision. This can be good, to allow you to get task done on your own pace."
good,I enjoy the interaction with customers. Being the last person they see allows me to give an important impression of the store. The management is very patient and understanding. The company is willing to work around school schedules and other jobs.
good,"Working for Kwiik shop was at a great location which was close to home. I waited on customers who were great to deal with and were fun. I counted money, loaded the safe, dictated to my employees on what their duties were, gave disciplinary actions out when there was a need for them. Checked vendors in, and made sure that the lot was clean."
good,This is a good place to work and learn but promotions are inconsistent at best and usually come by who you know and not what you know.
good,Working as a pharmacy technician was quite an experience. Everyday there was something new to learn while taking care of your daily responsibilities. It was an on-hand type of job which called for a fast learning pace. Luckily I had coworkers as well as supervisors that were willing to take the time to help me with whatever questions I had. I would say the hardest part of this job was the cramming of knowledge on a daily basis but it all became simple with time. I had a lot of fun working along side helping and knowledgeable coworkers who taught me a lot about the company in a friendly and understanding fashion.
good,"Day of work enjoyable"
good,"My day begins with the preparation of prescriptions through Kroger's EPRN program. I handle customer service when taking patient information and finally when selling the prescription. Management was willing to assist me in understanding the system and the best conceivable means of dealing with customers. My coworkers were willing to do the same. I learned much of pharmacy law and pharmacology. The most difficult part of the job would have been in explaining some aspects of pharmacy unique to Tennessee: certain laws, drug usage, et cetera. I enjoyed the fact that there was always something to learn at any given time."
good,"It was a very friendly and inviting atmosphere, but the pay and hours were not substantial enough to live on comfortably"
good,"I Provide face-to-face customer service to patients and assist the pharmacists in the daily operations of the pharmacy. My responsibilities include answering patient phone calls, maintaining accurate inventory of drugs, and  processing refill requests from doctors."
good,"I Helped customers with their deli purchases, learned how to manage my time in between cleaning and assisting the customers. Also while working at Kroger I learned how to prepare and cook various menu items. The management at Kroger was great and they helped get me to the level of satisfaction not only for Kroger but for me as well. The co-workers at Kroger are very helpful and did and excellent job training and working along side with me for my entire time of employment. The most enjoyable part of my day was interacting with the customers whom came to Kroger that taught me a lot about hospitality and courtesy."
good,"There are several tiers of store operation.  My experience was with a high volume ""Marketplace"" store."
good,"During my years with this company I have been in multiple departments, but my number one goal in each is to provide the best experience for my customers. I have learned how to better someone's day with just simple actions to try and make their experiences better. I have enjoyed working with this company and being able to work my way through school. The flexibility has been one of the best parts of working here."
good,The managers aren't really in tune with their workers like it should be. Co-workers were amazing though. The work days were some days stressful but some were great as well. Normal job.
good,Work consisted of cleaning the store and organizing the cleaning products. Midnight shifts consisted of changing/updating the price tags.
good,"The company is fine. The work is enjoyable most of the time. My co-workers were very nice and I made several friends. "
good,"Working for Kroger has been both challenging and rewarding. A typical day at work would be to first open your email and address any issues that may have happened the night before. You will prioritize your day based upon the information received in your emails along with your calendar for the day. The hardest part of the job was having to put projects together with some of your team members being remote. Since Kroger is so big, it may sometimes be necessary to communicate with team members that may not be in the same city or state as you. That can also be challenging but enjoyable as well. You just have to be sure to communicate candidly and transparently."
good,I started my pharmacy career with Kroger in 1997.  I was very pleased with my employment.  Unfortunately there were several changes in management over the years and uncooperative  employees that made the job very hard to focus on.  I felt that the stress it caused not only at work but at home was taking its toll.  I appreciate the experience and training I received but decided I could no longer continue my employment with the company.
good,Pretty fun and friendly co-workers. This was my first job so it was a great learning experience of responsibilities. I was a fuel clerk so I mainly just dealt with people at the fuel station
good,very good company to work for when you hit a supervisor position other then that the pay and hours aren't so great and there aren't benefits unless you get a full time job
good,Bad management wears on even the most dedicated workers. The pay was okay but too much responsibility put on to few people. Just not enough help to get the job done.
good,"Good part time job. Didn't pay much, but what cashiering job does? They are easy to work with about scheduling and requests off, however it was hard to get adequate hours. There were a lot of cashiers there when I worked there and we would all be fighting for as many hours as possible. Enjoyed management. Work was very easy."
good,A typical day working at Kroger I would say can be very stressful only because there would be so much going on at one time. If there is a long line at another register you have to try and get the line down. Working at Kroger didn't really teach me anything new. I think the hardest pert of the job would have to be working with customers who can be rude. Only because I've had customers throw change back in my face because they were asking me to do a task that I couldn't complete. Other than that I would say it is a very good first job for somebody who is still in high school. Just don't make a career out of it. Go for something bigger.
good,well appreciated managers and awesome colleagues. Roadblock is poor infrastructure and not enough investment in IT. The do not allow work breaks at times when you need to stretch a little bit and very orthodox. Excellent work life balance.
good,Not too much opportunity for job growth. Not a steady amount of hours. Really nice co-workers. I enjoyed helping costumers
good,Great Company!!! Always putting the customer first and treats employees very well.I have learned about customer needs and wants working for the company.
good,I love what I do and enjoy putting a smile on customers faces. I enjoy working with my co workers we are one small family. The hardest part of my job is not being able to help pay for a prescription that a customer really needs but cant afford it.
good,I enjoyed working with this company. Good Management. Good hours. Some employees were immature. Don't date the people you work with. .
good,"My experience with the Kroger Company has been nice.  I worked in the Starbucks stand.  A typical day involved making drinks for customers and cleaning the stand, and preparing the stand for the next day."
good,Good company where you have the ability to grow and learn in order to be as versatile as possible.  High opportunity for career advancement.
good,"I have worked with Kroger for nearly 5 years, and for the most part it has been an enjoyable position. However, promotions are based more on seniority than merit, and I don't want to stay at my current pay rate for another 10 years while I wait for my boss to retire."
good,"Everyday was new challenge and you learn how to figure it out with a smile. I learned a lot at Kroger, because of the daily madness you learn what you are really made of. I'm proud to say that I will figure out an solution while putting a smile on my customers face."
good,"This Company is great, and the people are wonderful. The hardest part is working slow days, the efforts to draw customers in from their grocery shopping isn't always easy. The Management is supportive and are happy to help develop you for growth within."
good,"Job was fun, busy and very interactive with customers.  Holidays were fun and crazy at the same time. Enjoyed working for Fred Meyer."
good,"I suppose it depends on who you are and what Kroger you work at, but for an entry level job, it's not that bad. The management at the Fern Creek Kroger is fair and my co-workers were always nice. The only reason I had to quit was because my back problems got in the way of doing anything even slightly strenuous."
good,"A typical day at kroger was always a day full of all type of thing's mean customer,friendly customers lots of things happening at once but great to work at such a place."
good,"There are daily tasks, weekly tasks and monthly tasks that have to be completed and signed off on. Working in a grocery store one thing that you can rely on is the unpredictability of the days events. You have to be ready to deal with call outs, call backs and demanding customers every single day. Some locations do a great deal to take care of their employees and make them feel very appreciated, however it is not across the board at every single place. The hardest part of the job is having to deal with rough customers and then not getting any support from upper management. I loved working for Kroger when I first started but my feelings have changed now that I have relocated to a smaller store and no longer feel supported or appreciated by the management team."
good,"Spend the majority of your day serving and helping any customers with their needs or questions. Breaking down pallets of product to be stocked on the shelves. The customers were easily the best and worst part of your day, they could make or break your day."
good,This is a good company to work for with a typical day being like any other in a retail pharmacy.
good,"I loved the job at first but as I was promoted my pay stayed the same and I was doing more work for less pay. I was doing Customer Service, accounting, Supervising all at the pay of a regular cashier. Not fair at all. The managers were amazing and co-workers were great (when they weren't complaining about the job that is)."
good,"it was an alright job, not too hard. beware of two time call in policy,"
good,"If the company would hire store directors that are professional, That don't  play favorites, It would be a much better environment to work in. If you can find a Smith's that does this...you could retire there."
good,I had a lot of wonderful coworkers. Wasn't to fond of the management when they were never around when you need anything. Also enjoyed helping customers with shopping.
good,Kroger is good company they are just going through some changes and they I want to weigh all my options. A typical day going to San Diego doing about 10-15 stops of bakery and coming back to Paramount yard Mon thru. Wed with Thurs and Friday off
good,"I loved working at Kroger and thought it was going to be my career.  Then I had my first son and my priorities changed.  I went from working full time to cutting back part time to raise my son.  I love working at Kroger, but I now need a ""grown up"" job."
good,"Stocking shelves, unloading trucks, sorting stock. Fairly easy job depending on department. Good management."
good,fun. fast passed job. you meet new people everyday. love the enviorment
good,"As a front end clerk I bagged groceries for customers, retrieved shopping carts, swept store floor, cleaned the meat dept tools, and helped organize grocery store shelves. Regularly helped elderly or overloaded customers with taking their food to their cars. Coworkers were friendly, easy to get along with and worked really hard."
good,"Co-workers helpful, only way to get through work load, store not big enough for size of orders sent to frig & freezers for all depts.  Only now getting approval to enlarge from Westfield.  Hardest part of job, breaking the pallets, stocking product and storing backstock.  Increased sales wkly $4000 and enjoyed working w/special diets in Nutrition dept."
good,Was a good place to work in high school without much responsibility. Good hours and able to work with my schedule.
good,"Of what I could remember it was a lot of work for what I got paid for."
good,I loved my job here I got to talk and interact with different people from so many different background and cultures. The employees here and Supervisors are great to work with.
good,"You get your schedule on Friday morning and the schedule will state what you'll be doing for the entire week. Once you go in to work you clock in and start doing what you're schedule to do. Management is very nice, compared to other management I've been too, Pick N Save is very understanding and giving. Everyone is expected to help out in any way. Co-workers are great people, they come there to work and most times they are happy and caring bunch. The hardest part of work is having to take over if anyone is to call in. Sometimes 2-3 people may call in and you'll be short in people. But away from that, i enjoy all the co-workers, they make me feel comfortable and I enjoy being around people. The only time I can speak or talk is at work, so knowing that I won't be too bored at work is a blessing."
good,"I stayed at this company for ONLY 7 months as an, OVERNIGHT HOME FREIGHT CLERK. The reason i made my departure from this company was: POOR MANAGEMENT, HIGH stress, NO BLANACE for work & life, VERY SLIM chances to advance to day shift."
good,I learned how to do everything at Kroger. Kroger was a good learning experience.
good,"this was a good company to work for, i learn how to work in a fuel center also how to use a money machine and count my own money down. was a fun and easy job"
good,I think Kroger is an okay place to work. You have good and bad days. You just have to learn how to deal with rude customers because working with the community can sometimes be hard.
good,"A typical day at work consists of busy evenings, filled with meeting new people everyday. While working for Kroger, I learned you may have a bad day, but that does not mean you have a bad life. Working for Kroger was a little overwhelming at first because just like many fast food places, they had rush hour. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people. I loved our customers!"
good,Good company to work for. A positive environment to be in. very fast paced. Very unpredictable
good,"Come in before midnight and leave around the time the store opens. Start with breaking down pallets to carts and then distributing items down the aisles. Then you go by aisle putting items on shelves. "
good,Wonderful company to work for if you know the right people.  The growth potential is huge due to the fact Kroger has over 2400 retail stores and 40 manufacturing plants.
good,Very steady work. Simple Heavy in Customer experience. cut meat & chesses. did inventory. washed dishes and prepared meals for customers.
good,"Although I am one of the younger workers staffed at this location, everyone is extremely welcoming. Team breaks are taken twice a shift which allows for easy communication and good opportunity to get to know one another better. Due to the time of the shift, 11pm to 5am, we get to joke around a lot with on another, which is very rewarding and makes the evening and lack of sleep bearable. Management is enthusiastic to promote the right workers as a posed to favoritism or anything of that nature."
good,"I am a fuel center manager which my job includes running a cash register and customer service, I do fuel surveys twice daily (check on competitors gas prices) I order merchandise for the gas station and do weekly schedules for 5 people"
good,Work was a routine of food prep sales customer service and marketing. I learned how to conduct inventory and shrink out used product. I was taught how to create in store displays and up sale and product pair for customers. Management was open and available to the staff and did their best to have our schedules and job duties lined out and easily followed. Co workers were friendly and professional for the most part.
good,"Typical Day"
good,"during the hours i worked at kroger, i did alot of cooking for the hot bar and the cold case so when a costmer would come up and ask a question about what i was cooking or if he/she asked if it was fresh i would be able to to tell them the answer to the their question."
good,"Depending on the managers, you may love or loathe your average day. Definitely not a job for someone who doesn't enjoy speaking with customers every day."
good,"A typical day at work involved listening to the customers needs and then doing your best to provide what they are looking for. It was a very routine oriented job. The co-workers provided a good culture in the company. The management team however, was not very employee first mind set."
good,"You do almost the same thing everyday but the job is not complicated to land, the pay is low with hardly any raises, management is ok, they don't seem to show favoritism. The work/life balance isn't so good. Sometimes they may want you to choose your job over your family or $7.25 an hour. Benefits are pretty good. They have a high turnover rate (quitters) so there's always new hire. They will try to call you in on your day off and get mad if you can't stay an extra hour or three. Majority of the employees seem to get along, race/age was very diverse. My deal with at least 1,000 customers a week."
good,"Kroger is a great company.  The typical work week is ever-changing; one will learn a lot there from hiring, coaching and leading good associates to become great.  One must dedicated and willing to accept the ever-changing world of Kroger."
good,"there are different workstations that each tech would rotate throughout the day: data entry, product dispensing, drive-thru, and register. That aspect was good, you weren't doing the same thing all day. The management of the pharmacy is really good. She is very concerned about everyone that works there and helps assist when there are questions about a prescription. Most of the co-workers were fun to work with. The hardest part of the job is the schedule variability, and the odd hours. It is hard when the next week's schedule is made just a couple days before the next week. i would enjoy it more if i worked the same hours each day, and got off at a decent time because of my family. there is no way to plan ahead. The hours are hard when you have a family because of what time the pharmacy closes etc. I enjoyed working with the pharmacists and some of the people there- it made the job more enjoyable."
good,"Kroger is unionized, and has strict policies for advancement. Recent changes have required all employees to pay member dues, but part-time employees reap no benefits from the dues. Kroger no longer hires full-time employees."
good,"wrapping meat"
good,Same 9 people every week at different times in the meat department.
good,Bagging can be fun if you make it fun. There will be some of dealing with rude customers but for the most part as long as you bag according to the guidelines it is pretty simple. Can be incredibly busy everyday if you are working in the afternoon but it makes the shift go by fast.
good,"The hardest and most enjoyable part of the job was the same thing.....the customers.  Some were amazing while others were horrid.  You learn how to deal with the difficult one and appreciate the amazing ones.  My pharmacists were AMAZING as well, they did everything to make our jobs as techs as easy as possible.  I truly loved my co-workers and consider most of them my friends."
good,My day start early which i love i actually prefer it. I wake at 3am and i arrive at work by 4am. I come in and set up my fruit case. I love making things look full faced and have people notice my hard work. That is the best feeling for me as a employee. I try to learn a new fact a day about produce..or one of the other departments in the store. Working in produce there are about 10 other associates that your working with on a every day basis. Which  is ok by me because i love people and i usually get along with everyone. I would say the hardest part of my job now is talking with my manager..i always ask if theres something more i can do better or ask for a area that i can improve. And he never gives me any feed back. I just want feedback so i can further myself so thats probably one thing i dont favor. The most enjoyable? Probably the customers because it's fun meeting new people and when you work at one location for so long you have regulars that come in and shop and it's nice they just come in and go out of there way to come say hi.
good,"I loved working with my co - workers, getting to know the students plus other staff members.  I loved my job."
good,"Did what I was supposed to do"
good,I have advanced a lot through kroger. I started at the bottom and worked my way up to office clerk. Only down side is that there really arent any raises except your scheduled union raises.
good,"Good first starting job, you will constantly be working at all times there really is no short breaks."
good,"A nice starter for a job. Flexible schedule, easy experience, pay is okay but not easy to get a raise."
good,Customer service was job #1. Setting the Seafood and Meat department service cases was job #2. ensuring proper satitation went along with both of the afore mentioned tasks. Somrtimes it was difficult to get both service cases set in the alloted time.
good,A typical day consist of operating the cash register in a prompt manner while maintaining efficiency. Provided friendly Customer Service at all times.  The most enjoyable part of my job was learning so much about food from the customers.
good,a typical day at Kroger is generally checking out customers for hours on in. I learned that a smiling face can mean so much to some people after a hard day at work and they come in to shop for a while.Management was okay at Kroger. co-workers were also fine. the hardest part of the job is learning to deal with angry customers and the most enjoyable thing about the job is meeting new people. i love meeting new people.
good,"Fry's and Smith's are part of the Kroger family of stores.  They try to give you the small store service and do fairly well at it. But, it is cooperate America."
good,"Kroger is  a great place to work, the only issue is that moving up to management takes time."
good,Answering many questions and helping a variety of people daily along with learning to co manage with the manager. They try to work around my schedule when possible especially when its an emergency but been working many hours and even double because there isnt many who know or are willing to work in my area. The people i work with are awesome and many of the customers i meet are funny.
good,"obtain job tasks, the management was not qualified and allowed workers to work who abused drugs.  Hard part was working alongside these men, unable to count on them."
good,Cashier for the Front End Department of the Krogers Supermarket.  Have also monitored  the Self Check out unit of the Front End assisting all customer coming through this particular area.  Standing all the timeisthe hardest part.  The environment is pleasant to work in.
good,"A typical day there would be running the register and keeping the fuel center in order."
good,since this was a job where you got to meet a lot of new people I enjoyed working here im a people person.
good,Worked in a specialty area within the company with a small staff
good,"I worked as a cake decorator / baker. I would take care of customers by taking cake orders and filling them. I would keep the cake display cases full and maintain the cases. As a baker, I would bake bread products and sweets for the display cases. I would help with keeping track of inventory of product and let manager what was need to be ordered."
good,"A typical day at work would includes many tasks throughout my day between check cashing, western union money transfers, bill paying, refunds, dealing with complements and complaints, and managing the cashiers and courtesy clerks.  While working at customer service  desk there are many ups and downs to the job.  One positive of the job is being able to lean and grow with a big expanding company.  Another positive is telling people the many ways they can pay their bills and finding a more cost efficient way to make their payments.  A negative side while working the service desk is our manager states that there only should be one person working the desk at a time.  I feel that this makes some unneeded stress on myself and my customers since some tasks are time consuming which causes a back up on our busier days.  Even while multitasking one person can only do so much."
good,"Project Management Intern"
good,"Typically at work-greet co-workers doing what I needed to do to complete the task ."
good,Worked as a cashier...I love the fast paced environment and being able to communicate with the customers
good,Have a tremendous amount of experience in the grocery business. Kroger is a great growing company.
good,"a typical day- consist of helping customers find products and engage in short conversations, stocking shelves, conditioning(pull up) product on displays and shelves, date checks, count inventory and use an electronic handheld computer. may have to work in Dairy and Frozen part of store."
good,"A typical day working for the Kroger Company was fairly easy. My co-workers and managers were more like a family away from, for the most part we all got along and helped whenever it was needed. Some days were harder than others, especially being a courtesy clerk. The hardest part was having to go outside and gather the shopping carts form the parking lot while it was either raining or really cold outside."
good,I really enjoy working at Kroger and i love the people I work with. I love the fact that I have grown a bond with my co workers and that my customers enjoy me. The down fall is that my hours are not consistent or reliable. I would also love a job that i could have more benefits so that i could grow with the company.
good,"Some stores are very busy and some are very low-key; customers tend to be more patient and personable; more ""regular"" customers that you can develop a rapport with; great co workers"
good,"Working here can have its benefits it was hard to advance up in this work place. You do meet alot of new people and learn what customer service is, They teach you various work skills."
good,"Interacted with customers regularly, cleaned and managed money. worked mostly alone but had some days worked with others. the part of my job i liked the most was the customers."
good,It was fun while i was working at kroger while in college. i worked as a nightstocker and in my opinion the bestest job in that store. the hardest part was just when people called in other then that it was fun.
good,Kroger have it's ups and downs but overall it had some of the best co-workers and customers
good,"6 to 8 hours 4 to 5 days a week."
good,I get bored with my daily tasks. Grocery store is not a place for me to work.
good,"It's a good job if you need a part time job but if you trying to take the next step in life like finding a place to live or a car like the things you need, you might want to get a second job or a different one. I learned how to use a cash register and learn more about team work and customer service. The co-worker are nice and talkative. I don't think anything was too hard to handle and if i didn't know what to do then i had someone help me. The most enjoyable part of the job is being an open lane and lots of customers since I like staying busy."
good,Kroger has a very friendly work environment with relaxed and personable managers and supervisors and awesome employees. The majority of the customers are pleasant and the work is fun.
good,"Learned about Produce"
good,"No room for growth, everyone is very nice, and caring. Greats customers in the stores"
good,a typical day at work. management co-workers and accounting
good,"Counting tills,making sure cashiers doing their job. Handling large sums of money. Learned that its a job I didn't want to do forever.Management was descent they all worked very hard.co-workers  mostly good.The hardest part was finding other employees to fill in when needed.the most enjoyable working with the public."
good,"A usual day of work for a part-time employee like myself will consist of 4-6 hours on average with a 15 min break somewhere in that time. It's tough on the feet from standing for long periods of time, but you do what you have to do. I've learned a lot of people skills and met all types of characters so there's never a dull day. The management is fair and understanding of the employees and will only come down on someone if they are truly laying about and not performing their job. My co-workers are what make the hours go by quick. I haven't met such a fun and friendly bunch of people in ages. And these are the people up front that customers will both first see and see last as they leave. The hardest part is mostly just standing on your feet for most of the day except on break. The most enjoyable part is being around people and the interaction with customers, there's a sense of accomplishment when you help someone."
good,"I am the first one in the bakery in the morning. I prepare product for the proofer then the oven.  I put the toppings on the bagels and the donuts then put them on the sales floor,. I put out the stock left over from the day before on to the sales floor. After that I cut the dough to be made into different products after that that dough goes into the proffer then the oven. When the product comes out of the  oven it will be packages and put onto the sales floor. All of these tasks are to be done in a timely manner and on time, which I do each day that I work the 5  am shift, The days that I do not work the 5am shift I can prepare cookies to be baked and packaged or put out frozen product that needs to be on the sales floor.. The hardest part of the job is when I am working until 9 pm and then have to be back in at 5 am."
good,"Come in clock in get straight to work try to keep busy, need more baggers, fun people to work with, they love to give hours."
good,At the Ralph's I worked at the hours were great but management was a bit too tough on new employees.
good,"Kroger is very good at what it does. The MD1 training program is very thorough but needs work. The workers, including store managers, are so overloaded that I didn't feel like I got the training I should have. I have 14 years experience in the grocery business, and I was stocking shelves as an MD1 trainee. Not very challenging and they give you a lot of busy work."
good,"A normal day at work would be working with other cashiers and the floor supervisor to maintain a fast check out for our customers.  If I am running a register my responsibilities are; ringing up consistently and fast, scanning their Kroger card, giving them their total, giving them correct change back, and making sure they have all of their groceries in their shopping cart.  Management at my store is half and half.  Our store manager is very uptight and pretty rude, but our co-managers are very helpful and make our jobs much better.  They will often come to the frontend and help with big orders and help bag and unload the customers cart.  My coworkers are like family.  I could trust just about everyone there with my life.  The hardest part of the job is being on your feet for 8 hours in one place.  Another hard part is dealing with unhappy customers.  No matter what you say to them, they are not going to cheer up and it can turn your day pretty bad quickly.  The most enjoyable part of my job would be the regular customers I see on a daily basis.  There are at least 20 customers that know me by name and will even speak to me outside of Kroger.  I love working with customers, I am just ready for a change of environment.  When working at the customer service desk the responsibilities are; cashing checks, processing Western Union transactions, printing money orders, lottery sales, returns, exchanges, and accounting.  At night around 9pm I go around and pick up the tills that are no longer in use and get pick ups from the other registers.  I go into the accounting room and count"
good,"cooking, preparing food and taking orders from customers! the hardest part of the job was sometimes couldn't understand the customers thru the drive thru ."
good,"Even though the typical day averaged 10 hours, often emergencies would come up necessitating 60+ hours a  week.  I learned that in spite of what one is told, there are other directions and directives not told to you at management level.  Lack of communications was a problem.  Co-workers were excellent, management couldn't be fully anticipated, and the hardest part of the job was trying to guess what management stated in instruction.  It was challenging at first but after 1 1/2 years, it became tiring because of the misdirection and the lack of personal time off (never had time for family or myself)."
good,"A typical day at Kroger is customer service, helping customers with prices, finding items, taking groceries to their car, and making the customers happy they shopped at Kroger.  I have learned that helping others makes me happy.  The management believe in their employees.  My co-workers do not believe in team work.  The hardest part of the job is talking to the managers, they do not care about the problems or concerns in ones life or on the job as long as the job gets done.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers."
good,"It was a great place for a first job. A typical day was taking orders from customers and giving them their meal as quickly as possible, while keeping a clean and happy environment.  I learned that sometimes i would have to work harder to make up for others who did not work as hard as i do. Management was adequate enough. My co-workers we great people,  who liked to work. The hardest part of the job was how hectic it could get if the store was short an employee on that shift. The part I enjoyed most about working at Wendy's was that it was a challenge, and I enjoy a good challenge."
good,"Working at Kroger's Company, I got a minimum of twenty hours a week, but never went above thirty. In order to be considered for Insurance you have to work an average of twenty-eight hours a week. My average hours was about twenty-one to twenty-three hours. Kroger needs to improve their works hours."
good,Daily goals and expectations were clearly laid out. Great lines of communication between management and staff.
good,A day at work is consistent with working in the public. You have the opportunity to meet people all day as well as make sure that people are satisfied with the service they receive. I enjoyed really being able to help people. The management was a pleasure to work with. management from all departments worked very well together in the store and the co-workers were very easy to work with. The hardest part of the day is dealing with people who just don't seem to have a good attitude. It is hard not knowing which one of your customers is having a bad day and may be difficult just because. The best part of the day is meeting people and smiling at them and just being able to make someone's day.
good,Kroger is a good company to work for if you have no plans of making a carrier out of it. the do everything based on seniority so its very hard to move up. but over all the people are great.
good,Busy always keeping me on my toes. Learned how to work in the deli. Management was okay. My co-workers was nice all the time. Hardest part was trying to remember all the numbers for every type of meat and cheese there was. Enjoyed working with the customers.
good,"Hard to change depts when full time."
good,this was my real first job. i started from the bottom and moved my way up withing the 5 years straight out of high school. I met a lot of people that i consider family that i still keep in touch with.
good,"I've learned a lot, middle management is not easy, I learned to lead as a example.keep clam, no mater what's going on,customers, make the friends, make them important, go out of your way to fix their concerns."

good,"I took a part job at Kroger's while I put my self through college. "
good,"Maintaining great store conditions, satisfying the customers needs, and ensuring health safety for employees and customers were a must every day working with Kroger. I learned so much with Kroger I think I could write a book about it. I learned what sanitation and health code violations were about. I learned how to read operating statements. I learned how to provide the best customer service every single day, and what customer service truly means to every business. There were so many co-workers involved with every day work, it was very exciting to see all the personality types. Hardest part of the job was satisfying every single customers needs every single day. Although that was nearly impossible, as there are so many customers that come through a grocery store, the ultimate goal was to make every single one happy. Success, sales, customer compliments, were of the most enjoyable parts of this job. I also loved to merchandise and build displays, so this was fun as well."
good,"Great company, great benefits. It has been a great learning experience for me.. Ive enjoyed working there for the past eleven years..."
good,"clock in, put belongings in locker, have shift meeting before shift, look to see what station working, have 1st break two hours into shift have 2nd break 4 hours and last break 6 hours into shift "
good,"Job has straightforward expectations of you, and you need to be a friendly people person to engage in conversation with customers."
good,"Kroger is a nice place to work, its just that I feel like I don't get paid enough for the job. I don't get as many hours as I would like."
good,I worked here for while I was pregnant and they worked with me with my appointments and pregnancy needs. I loved working there with my great co-workers.
good,"Honestly, the job doesn't seem demanding on paper, but as a jewelry sales associate, it is. You are helping people create memories--good or bad--that will last a lifetime. You're selling them a dream, and you're doing it all in dress clothes for 9 hours a day. You also have to make sure the store looks amazing, product is perfect and well-displayed, and have a gentle touch with everything."
good,U work at a fast pace and are not ever really bored. I learned to work a register and how to run the self checkout
good,Worked each day to process orders for customers refill of medication as well as new prescriptions. I enjoyed getting to know the customers. 
good,"I managed all the cashiers each day on the front end and helped all the customers that needed assistace. I also did the balancing of the books some mornings. In the 15 years I have learned a lot from Pick n Save. I have learned to order items print labels, manage employees, I also have great customer services skills. Hardest part of the job would have to be working when we were short staffed due to call ins. The most enjoyable part of the job were the customers and the employees. It felt like a family at times and it was great."
good,"Break down pallets from product delivered over night."
good,My typical day at work is great with my customers and strained with my management. I learned how to be even more patient with hard situations. My co workers are like family to me now. The hardest part of my job is getting management to notice my good work ethics. The most enjoyable part of my job is having my customers leave commendable notices on our feedback website.
good,"Always be nice and friendly to customers, putting them first and always trying to solve their needs, in turn hoping they come back to the store."
good,"In all the time I spent there was enjoyable. The ability to meet new people and to produce an enjoyable work environment, with hardly a dull moment. Management did their best to provide a safe and knowledgeable working environment. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the customers who could not be pleased, no matter what you did to make their experience a pleasant one."
good,"Panera Bread was a fun place to work at, but the hours weren't. "
good,"I really enjoyed working with customers.  To see the joy on there face when they purchased a new piece of jewelry was the best.  A typical day started with us setting up the store and putting merchandise out into the cases.  We also did inventory counts on certain merchandise every morning.  Everyone there got along great.  We were like a family.  The hardest part of the job was when we had to do our major inventory of the whole store.  The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to know my customers, and knowing that they were happy with there purchase. "
good,"- Steady Paced"
good,I liked working there and my supervisor was really cool. I also liked that when someone was in need of help the company would do a fundraiser to help raise money for them.
good,While I was working here I was responsible for making sure that the shelves were supplied with items sold and to assist customers with questions.
good,meeting new people everyday
good,I worked here as a teenager in high school. I would appreciate the job more as an adult then an adolecent. I loved getting paid every week!
good,Since I work in three different departments everyday is different.
good,"Never enough hours given to the employees.But, the environment was clean and pleasant."
good,"Overall my Fred Meyer Experience has been great. But, of course it depends on the location you work at and the management at each location. The company offers many ways to thank it's employee's for their hard work."
good,"I like my job , it is a fun fastpase place to work. I clock in and start work right away. We work as a team for the most part, I run from register to register to scan items that some people are not old enough to scan, gather carts and help the elderly."
good,The overall receiving I did for so long was good but mgmt can be improved in attitude to the main people who help the store run but are not credited in the proper way. Mgmt should have to attend employee relation classes. I think it would it improve morale. .
good,Good place to work most people were great to work with and management was flexible about your schedule and needing days off.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was encountering a grumpy customer and having them leave the deli with a smile on their face. I treated the customers as I would want to be treated and the customers appreciated it.
good,"A typical day at Kroger is providing the customers with all the resources they need to fulfill their shopping needs and provide a pleasant customer service experience. Working with the company for 2 years I've learned how to accommodate each and every customer and handle various situations. Management is outstanding they have provided each and every thing I need to be successful on the job, I enjoy working in the customer service field."
good,Operated cash register in Photo Electronics and Home Improvement
good,Customer Service
good,"Working at Kroger was my first real job, I have ever had. I started there when I was 16, it has been 3 years and I am still there. I have been moved up from a bagger to cashier. I wish I could say that pay was good, but hey its my first job and I have learned a lot about responsibility, teamwork and dedication. The hardest part of working at Kroger, is dealing with incompetent customers. But to me, the best part is when a customer tells me, ""Whenever I see you here, I always come through your line, you're the best cashier here."""
good,"They do not follow availability forms, Union dues are outrageous, non-communicative, and very little hours for part-time employees."
good,I'm currently a full time employee but only working 30 hours a week.
good,A variety of duties to perform. Got to know a lot about the grocery store warehouse food industry.
good,I learned how to run four areas of a store at one time. My co-workers are fun and willing to help in any way that they can. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting all the different types of people that come through the back door.
good,"Kroger's is a day of experience, fun that can boost creativity, productivity in a workplace, and employees work well with others. Give employee confidence in motivating each other in a working environment. Management can bring fun into workplace to stimulate sales by keep his or her employees happy. The coworker must understand they show leadership to improve standards to keep customer coming to Kroger to shop. The hardest part is working, as a team makes sure everyone is on the same level to see what the customer wants and needs are. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing customers walk away happy."
good,lifting heavy items by yourself and working a whole truck by yourself
good,"In the 2 years that I worked at Ralphs, I learned so many new thing that I never knew prior. Learning about all of the food in the entire market, where it all comes from, the expenses that need to be covered on a daily basis, and general supermarket needs was a tremendous learning that I am extremely thankful for."
good,"a typical day in the produce department was very demanding, you're on your feet most of the day satisfying the constant demand for fresh product"
good,Act as subject matter expert and decision maker over a multi-cultural and diverse workforce. Lead groups of people in obtaining short and long term goals and fostering growth of individuals in business acumen and personal ambitions.
good,"I learned to operate a cash register, Extensive customer service experience and Audit retail prices."
good,"We did payroll, accounts payable bank reconciliations for several grocery stores."
good,A typical day at Kroger involved bagging groceries and assisting customers with miscellaneous requests.
good,I learned customer service with this job. Cash registering daily and helping customers.
good,a typical day at work is ok on a great day i learnd be patshint my managers was ok sometimes coworkes cool hardest part is a busy holiday payday was enjoyable sometimes
good,"Great job. room for advancement ,learned accounting in about 2 weeks of being there. Co-workers were easy to get along with. Management had the open-door policy"
good,"A day at work is regular. I go to produce and I put out all the product to keep the place looking neat, I help cut fruit every now and then. I also help around the store where ever they need me. Whether its as a cashier, as a floral clerk, or they just need a creative mind to help with a new set up for selling products. I've learned so many different things going from OSHA standards to satisfying customer needs. My co-workers have to be my favorite part about the store. Everyone is open with eachother and just all together fun environment. The management is kind of crazy, we have 3 completely different personalities and it can make things hard, but we get by."
good,Very busy and a money making department! I come in to clean and wait on customers.
good,"A typical day at work would really depend on the shift you were given. Normally you sit inside a kiosk and help customers either buy gas or items. Assist customers with any questions or help them with the pumps. At the end of your shift you count down your drawer, and drop the money in the safe. Mostly the job was a customer service job with a small bit of retail. I learned to work alone without a manager telling me what I had to do next. I learned how to be better at customer service. All my co-workers and managers were great people. I enjoyed working for them all. One of the hardest parts was doing your whole shift alone. When I wasn't busy it was very easy to get bored. My most enjoyable part was being able to help the customers."
good,"In a typical day I would recieve a stock truck and replenish the sales floor where needed, write an order, schedule and interact with customers. the hardest part of my job would be time, trying to squeeze all my duties in one shift and adequately give each task and customers appropriate time. The most enjoyable part of my job would be interacting with customers and co-workers."
good,"The Kroger Company is a customer oriented company, that sells quality products for good prices."
good,"A day in the life of a Kroger carryout consists of groceries, groceries, and more groceries. Some days better than most but were does that not happen.. There is one manager, a woman, she is not very nice, she cuts you off the schedule completely if she does not like you. She's the reason I no longer reside at the Kroger company."
good,A good place to work if you just need part-time. I needed more money and hours.
good,"The store I work at is a great place with great people on my shift. However, the pay isn't that great, and the lack of communication between different levels of management and departments suffers greatly."
good,its a great place to work the compensation is nice but the advancement opportunities are few and far between. The days can be somewhat stressful due to the work load. Sometimes co-workers/management can be unreliable in a moment of dire need. I've learned to take initiative and not rely to much on the performance of other but to hone my own individual skills and make do.
good,My typical work day involved a lot of standing and greeting. I learned to speak loud and slowly. The employers were friendly and helpful. My co-workers were fun to be around. The hardest part was having to work a certain amount of hours to get a lunch break. I enjoyed joking around with co-workers.
good,Enjoyed the flexible hours while in college. The Mgmt. was a bit young and ran in clicks. Not paying as well these days.
good,"It was a very fast-paced environment that relied strongly on teamwork. Co-workers were like family. The hardest part was if we happened to be short-handed. The most enjoyable part was knowing my ""regular customers"" on a first name basis."
good,This is a good company for people looking to join the working force and to get a bit of working experience under there belt. management is ok but nothing to brag about many managers talk down to employees in a demening manner.
good,"Overall, had a good time. Loved the people. Learned quite a bit."
good,"A typical day at work includes helping customers find their groceries, putting to memory new locations of new/relocated items, stocking shelves (overnight shift), and checking customers through the register or assisting them through self-checkout. Our new management is better now and more concerned about the quality of our store and supporting fellow workers. My co-workers have become like a family to me and it's great to have fellow associates who have your back when an angry customer appears. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing cute children come through, smiling/waving at me as well customers who go out of their way to be friendly towards me. The hardest part of my job is dealing with angry customers when I know there's nothing else I can do and my supervisor either won't back me up or lectures me about a method I forgot."
good,"Fast paste days, there would be some very slow days, but usually a very busy and productive environment. I filled and took prescriptions daily. I primarily worked with a team, but there were also days, mainly weekends where I worked alone mostly. I enjoyed the job a lot, some days were stressful dealing with the public so directly, but it was not bad. I would say that was the most difficult part of the job."
good,started full time but the store started to cut my hours after 5 yeras of service.
good,everything is good.
good,I break down skids and stock the product on the shelves. Have to place orders and assist customers. I like the fact that ever day presents a different challange. Get called to the front end on a daily basis to run a cash register. I like that they have different activities for employees.
good,"A typical 8 hour work day is checking out customers, helping customers find products. I've learned good people skills from working here. The management is hard to deal with sometimes, but the co-workers are OK. The hardest part of the job is dealing with all the extra stuff you have to do other then your job title, but we all pinch in together and get it done. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you see everyday."
good,I worked for this company for 14 years with good preformance and had some problems in my personal life and they will not give me a chance.
good,"This was my first job, and it got my feet wet in the job world. I was there for almost three years and, never got the opportunity to grow within the company, despite me asking for advanced positions."
good,Kroger is a good place to work for the beginning employee such as high school or college. The first job is an important thing in ones life and Kroger will work with your schedule for school purposes.
good,Overall its a good place to work however you have to kee a cool head with irrational customers and thoroughly explain why they are in the wrong. Bottom Line...don't lose your cool or you could get written up and lose your job
good,"If you do a good job and don’t call off and/or goof off, you could go very far!  You must enjoy people and have patience.  You must not get frustrated by change."
good,The first few years were Good there but management has changed for the worst. Benefits are great and they are sort of flexible. Supervisors are very dependable
good,Kroger lets their customers know any issues that may arrive with products in any department. They do their best to take care of any questions that may arrive upon their visit.
good,Only problem I had was at the time I needed a full time job along with good pay I was only awarded a pay increase of $0.30 per six months. Not acceptable.
good,"Good benefits, lower than average pay but a decent bonus program and commission available to managers as well. Flexible schedule unless it's a major holiday. Company has tried to improve work life balance for employees over the years and there has been a huge improvement in company culture. Would have loved the job if my family life wasnt so demanding as well."
good,Good place to work if you're starting out or needing a job with good benefits and good managing. You learn something everyday that'll help in another career
good,I think this company offers good starter positions. they take there time with u and do great at training . The people are very nice that we worked for .
good,"I didn't work here for an extensive amount of time, but I got along well with coworkers and management. This can be a job for anyone, in general anyone who has worked customer service knows that it isn't always fun."
good,Working as a cashier at Kroger allows me to interact with people from our community in a positive way. I really enjoy being able to make somebody's day brighter when they come through my checkout lane.
good,"management is friendly, hardworking and will take time to talk to you if you have any problems, they will also help out around the store if any of the departments are low on staff."
good,"A day at Kroger is usually stressful but nothing you shouldn’t be able to handle. Coworkers and management are generally easygoing and helpful. Usual shifts range from 5 to 8 hours, with two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute unpaid lunch at the 8 hour shift mark."
good,"Most days will involve you picking anywhere from 4 to 8 orders, depending on the size and your speed. You'll interact with customers regularly and visit all parts of the store. Most enjoyable part of the job would be working in the backroom with other coworkers, as downtime between orders leads to a good relationship with other employees. Management seems to be a little lackluster as the scheduling is quite inconsistent. Your schedule is made 2 weeks in advance, but expect to be asked to come in early the day before your shift, or stay late just as you're leaving."
good,Very flexible schedule good team worked with great people needs better management lots of merchandise needs a bigger location parking lot cluttered everyone friendly
good,I needed a job that could work with my school hours. This was a great learning experience. This job can be fast paced so be prepared to deal with many customers.
good,"This is a busy working environment that can drain you quickly, any big food retailer like Kroger will have you working non stop from the start to finish. The problem with companies like these is normally management and other co workers. People gossip and don't actually do their work to their full potential. People slack off and avoid doing things and work end up on you. Most of my time there I did enjoy my employees and I did overwork myself due to other employees not actually working. Management says they want to grow their employees to become management one day, but there is a Seniority type of deal in the company where if someone was there longer they will probably pass it to them before someone else. Even if you are completely excelling at every job function. Management also put more work on the people that are good and don't make mistakes compared to those who don't care for their job in anyway which causes fatigue quickly. There are sometimes favorites, but if a person complains and don't care for their job management should really remove them and give their job to someone who actually needs it and willing to put out, because when someone does not care for their job they slack off and others have to do their work for them."
good,"This company is a great company to work for. Excelent benefits and if you are willing to put in the work and show interest in advancement, there are always oportunities for that. The work is hard and fast paced but definetly can be fulfilling work"
good,I loved working for Kroger. Due to some unforeseen circumstances I had to quit and move.  I would definitely go back fo work there.  The staff was friendly.
good,It was nice working there.I would love to work there again. I had alot fun it was easy and I talked to the customers like family...I always try to make people happy.
good,Super nice environment (in Appleton). The managers swap out a lot and it's a bit confusing but they're nice. They don't seem to care if you make complaints however. The coworkers are super nice and everyone stands up for each other if customers are being rude. Pay is not great though.
good,Kroger is an excellent company and great place to learn and find personal development. Long work days 12-13 hours and 6 days a week is the only drawback for working in this organization
good,I have been working for  them for a year going on two and i enjoy the work. It may not be complex and extrenuous all the time but it pays decently. Im content with what I make for the amount I work
good,"The people I worked with at Kroger were great and I enjoyed being around them. However, the management treated their employees, even the more experienced, terrible."
good,"they downsized, and are trying to break out of the mold of looking like everyone else. Depending on the store, you can have good, or bad morale and culture. "
good,Need better management. But other than that they are a great company to work for. Some managers just don't have great people skills and don't know how to manage properly.  But I love our head store manager.  He is great!
good,Good company good pay really fast paced hard work lot of overtime late nights very cold environment if you don't mind the cold good benefits in Union.
good,"Great place to work at "
good,I like kroger because of productive environment that has techs and pharmacist. Very flexible hours when you needs days off but the salary sucks for someone with 2 years plus
good,I liked being a clicklister if I were younger I could still do the job. The people I work with were awesome and the assistant manager was tremendously sweet. If Ohio didn't have such bipolar weather I would go back and work for them again.
good,There was a lot of little things that encouraged me to perform well as a customer service associate/ cashier such as gift card incentives for good performance. Problems working with the company was the inability to promote based on performance but only by seniority which promotions based solely on seniority did not guarantee great job performance from individuals advanced only because of their time spent with the company.
good,They aren’t as flexible but they gave good benefits. They are always hiring. I would recommend this job. The management was organized. I liked my do workers.
good,"I enjoyed working for the company, they took over the Roundy's division in Madison.  There were a lot of fast changes in the company, the management team in the Madison area was not prepared for them."
good,I enjoy working with this company. Good pay great benefits and great coworkers. An excellent work environment. Growth opportunities within the company
good,its a fun work pace i made friends with every one that works there the managers are really nice but i have been out of work for a week and 2 days becuase they messed up on my schedule
good,Kroger is a great place for a first job and offers jobs to any and everyone. They don’t show any hesitation to anyone who wants to apply. There are many positions that always need filled.
good,"Typical day did not change, learned about stocking shelves and facing products."
good,"My time at Kroger was wonderful, got to meet a lot of good people, learned a lot and Improved myself at the same time. The pay was not the best out there, but manageable."
good,Target really got me out of my bubble/ comfort zone. I was shy to answer the phones but I eventually got to where I wanted to answer every call. We had to use a walkie talkie to communicate with the team so I was shy about that at first but then I got used to it quickly.
good,"I have been stocking shelves at Kroger for about 9 months now and I have outlasted at least 5 other night crew staff that have been hired during that time. There are ways Kroger needs to learn how to cut costs, so they can more fairly compensate their associates. Higher pay = happier employees"
good,"As a deli manager  I was responsible for overseeing the daily task of the department. I learned a lot about the business from inventory, scheduling, training and team development. Overall it was a great place to work. They have a great culture and strong company values. They really invest in their employees through employee recognition huddles and company events"
good,It was good place I could start making friends! And you enjoy working there everyone is so Nice worked there for 3 years as my first job and I still miss it!
good,Management is understanding and quick to handle any situations that pop up. The hardest part of the job is dealing with irate customers but if any issue is explained properly then they typically leave happy. The best part of the job is when I can help a custmer find something they're looking for or helping to solve a stressful situation.
good,"Great people and environment helps with social skills and to learn how to count and keep up with money"
good,The staff was amazing but we all know that there are always a bad apple or two. Management always will pick and choose when it comes to productivity..
good,The job is really easy. If someone is looking to be a leader at any given time then this job would be the perfect fit. You have to be willing to come in a little earlier than expected if needed or stay after hours if needed. The best part about the job is the feeling of helping others.
good,"While it has it's issues with hiring people that have never worked in stores making decisions, it is not too terrible. It does provide the opportunity to move up in the company in different roles, but it will not be easy to move up in. It has also the issues in retaining employees and putting a crazy amount of workload on the employees because its strict in hours and overtime used, kind of strange for a company that makes a lot of money."
good,Productive work enviorment with challenging and interesting days. Meeting new people everyday both customers and associates. Paid vacation and employee discount available for part-time workers.
good,"The pharmacy is great, but the store was not. The store manager is great, but the assistant managers don’t do anything. Vacations wouldn’t be put in, pay got messed up, questions would go unanswered. You literally would have to stand with them to make sure hours were put in right. Regional management was no better. Always forcing less hours for full time employees by requiring us to hire more part time techs.9"
good,"I Worked At This Company For 5 Years, They Have Good Benefits But When They Give You More Hours,That's What I Don't Agree With, They Don't Give You Higher Raise On Your Check. But I Enjoy Working With The Kroger Company, I Love Speaking With Customers, I Respect Customers, I Even Greeted My Customers. I Love Working. I Just Want Better Pay And More Experience, Start Something Else New. Just Wanna See What Else Is Out There. :)"
good,"They are a great customer service/ food service company with plenty of on the job training.  They should let new comers know that if they need more hours, they are allowed to ask a different Fry's store manager to work in the same job assignment. I did not know that and it really hurt my paycheck .  Also the skills learned were easily transfered tea "
good,"Kroger is constantly applying fast paced change as the company moves into the future. Most of these changes are initially confusing but the company remains a top competitor for grocery chains nation wide, they must be making the decision they do based off of staying ahead in competition. Some of the decisions can make things more difficult on the employee, but it is still a fair workplace community."
good,"Kroger was involved in fast paced change as the company moves into the future. some of the changes initially did no make sense but as you look into the company remaining profitable, you could see the reasons that they were being made."
good,"I enjoyed my employment while there. Management and employees are amazing and helpful. Great work environment. Excellent team building, and hours are reasonable."
good,It was a stable job and really good about flexible hours. The only issue i had was that there was a lack of communication between management and the people on the floor.
good,It’s a great place to start out working while in high school and college but the management lacks in areas and some very rude supervisors other than that you have some of the best co workers you could have
good,"fast pace and busy work environment, learned customer service skills along with other skills, enjoy dealing with different type of people, Work with a very kind and hard working team."
good,"greta first job, with no entry level experience, I had to do multiple things unlike the other workers, who just stayed at the front end I had to clean the restroom, pick up the trash from all the store clean messes spills and anything that they asked for, help bag products, push the carts and take money to the gas service station"
good,While I liked my job and the people I worked with it was very stressful with not much manger support. You were expected to do your job and fill in for wherever the needed the extra help.
good,A typical day at work was always something to look forward to. I learned how to adapt to customers wants and needs. Management lead well and kept everything under control. The hardest part was the busy days were customers were in and out.
good,"Frys is a good place to work. A company who recognizes associates and takes the initiative to promote them. I have been with the company since 2015, and being my first job didn't expect to move up as quickly as I did."
good,"Not much to say. The name of the game is speed. Collect the digital orders as quickly and accurately as possible, load them on the trolley, and return the finished order to the loading area. On occasion you'll have to stop and point something out to a customer, so keeping a working memory of the product locations is a must."
good,I really enjoyed my job but at the time I had alot of health issues that had to be taking care of had a few surgeries to correct what needed to be fixed that's why I had to leave and was out of work for such a long period of time they changed store location and hired all new management I tried to return and do a new application but I was denied
good,It is an alright place to work but the management in my option wasn't the best. I talked to many coworkers that said the same so I eventually found a different job.
good,"the staff are nice and friendly, always staying  positive all the time & good at keeping clean area, weekends especially Sundays & holidays get really busy"
good,It's a job for someone who is living at home or needing a part time job to make ends meet. I wouldn't consider making a life long career out of it unless you have a degree and working in management.
good,"I had I position at the local Kroger when I was attending college. It's a good place to work, but they don't offer very good benefits (as far as I know; I only had a part-time position with little interest in a full-time one). I enjoyed working here and would recommend it for those looking for part-time work or are just starting out."
good,"I learned how to run an older cash register, and how to treat costumers with fairness, and complemented them  all the time. It was interesting at time, but the other co-workers were friendly."
good,it was fun for about 2 years but it was bad cause management wasn't always o the same page but I loved working there it was hard but it got fun I enjoyed it loved my co workers made friends with most of them.
good,"I had a great time working at Kroger. I made a lot of friends there ,and became more confident with myself about publicly speaking and interacting with strangers. I would say over all it gave me the right step to become a better and more effective employee."
good,It is a work place where rules are taken seriously and they are very welcoming. Mistakes are at a minimum but whe  they do happen they get handles very well.
good,"Good place to work. "
good,working in the service deli was very fast pace. work work work. fresh and ready service. we were a little short staff sometimes. inventory can be really stressful and hard to do when you have to help out customers.
good,"With the courtesy clerk position, there is easily plenty to do. From bagging groceries to working on the can/bottle machines. Decent amount of work. The managers were really friendly, the only issue with the location I had was the church owned the parking lot and had us section it off every Sunday morning, then had to deal with church goers who sometimes had their ego stroked for the day at the church. Sunday would be the more painful day as this position at this location is asked to stand guard in the parking lot to make sure customers do not use the wrong side. Easily the church is a key problem and expect customers to not like that rule."
good,"Kroger as a company was enjoyable to work for. The discounts are great, and the pay is decent. Most employees were nice, you do get the occasional unfriendly coworker. Pharmacy technology is a bit outdated, due to budget. Faced paced environment, customers are often impatient. Overall it was a nice job."
good,"Working for Kroger was very fun. A typical days work never varied and that is what I loved most about it. The tasks were the same, such as stocking, but the merchandise was different. That is the part that I enjoyed. The people that I had the fortune to work with are amazing. The management was very helicopter-like and a little disorganized; but never unmanageable. Hardest part of the job was having to fill in personnel needs at other areas of the store."
good,"I was blessed to work with a really great group of ppl during my time at Kroger."
good,"Depending on the day of the week, we are typically busy. There are times where we are understaffed, but manage to put in a little more work and get the job done. I learned more than what I already knew about customer service and customer care. At times the management was not the best, but is slowly recovering. The hardest part of the job would be picking the groceries when we are understaffed. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the environment when we have enough people and all the clicklist associates get along and get things done."
good,Kroger is a good place to work for if you are in college or high school or even a summer job. Everyone was amazing the supervisor and employees they will help you if you need any help.
good,Working at Kroger is fun. You get to get different idea and cooking  recipes from the guest is very exciting. I si feel like Kroger needs to paid their associates a little because of the work load.
good,"Stock shelves with Grocery products( dry goods,can goods, bags  & boxes too). Grocery truck gets delivered every other day on a rotation of different days over 2 week period then the schedule would begin to repeat. The crew at nights was running thin when I started. More people left for different reasons (hurt back,starting school). It seemed the replacements weren't coming. I don't mind working Hard. My supervisor knew it's not possible to get all the load out with only having 2 people on for that day . The super visor & lead-man seem to be given 2 consecutive days off in a row (scheduled each week). But anyone else your expected to live your life every other day. I believe that it's only fair to treat everyone the same when it comes to scheduling. This can be very physical some days & I think it's only fair that just like the others who are in charge, they would get a load night off at least once a week."
good,"Very friendly co workers, Compassionate bosses. Fast paced, but not stressful. Helps that they have a union you can join. Unions are great for workers."
good,"I have loved working at frys,but I think it's time for a new experience ,I need more more of a challenge.  I started working as a curiosity clerk, then cashier, deli worker,stocker and floral manager to my current job as a e commerce lead"
good,"Never a dull moment, alternates between busy and slow. Most of the management are wonderful and helpful. The hardest part, as with any customer service job, would be the different kinds of people you deal with. The best parts are the discounts and the co workers."
good,"They offer a lot of great benefits, pay is about average, no weekends, small raises, heavy workload. Overall I would work for them again. They treat their employees well."
good,"The atmosphere is nice but I worked in a location uphill where a lot of elderly people shop. Location, location, location. The store managers were a bit rude. It was a good job."
good,I enjoyed working here. It was a really great experience and I am willing to go back if possible. They really give a lot of Overtime which is great for me.
good,Depending on the department you worked in Kroger was not so bad m. The Fuel department was pretty chill. If you work in the back the most challenging thing is the tricks and sometimes the truck can be pretty hectic but other than that it’s not so bad.
good,A day at Kroger was fast past. I was able to learn how to communicate with others. It help with my social skills. The work place environment was clean. The hardest part of the job is collecting the shopping carts in the cold and rain. I did enjoy the other employees.
good,It’s not bad or fantastic. But it’s good for your first time job or if you just trying to get some experience under your belt real quick. I worked there and I felt it was okay kinda tiresome but it’s still a good decent job
good,"If you are willing to stick around for a while in one area, then this is a good place to work because eventually there is the opportunity for growth at the store level."
good,Overall the job pays well for a first job. It matters on where you go if you have a good management. However the people and job environment is nice. I have to say that the customers and my co-workers are the main reason I stay.
good,"Kroger is a very diverse workplace. One thing you can be proud of here is that they do not discriminate. Everyone has something to do and no one is “bored”. Working at Kroger keeps you busy. My typical work day involves store shopping as I would do on my own. You have to do things in a timely manner and it has to be done right. As for the managers, there are some that are helpful and some that are complete butt holes. I’ve met my share of lazy managers for the time I’ve worked here but it doesn’t stop you from doing what you’re suppose to do. With clicklist there is a lot of back and forth. You are on your feet the entire time you’re there because it involves doing for the customer and also assisting and meeting the customers needs when they come and pick up"
good,"As an associate, I got great experience in inventory, direct customer interaction, retail, stocking, sanitizing, food service and preparation, working with money and operating the cash register, answering phones, making schedules, and cleaning/organizing."
good,"Gets you into the world of retail and working the register. You'll come in contact with all kinds of people, all with different attitudes. No advancement due to senior workers."
good,"Kroger is a good company with good workers and a good work life balance. The management is okay but will denie a lot of requested days off when they r short handed cause they wont hire more people for the critical departments i.e. grocery, dairy and frozen. The management is okay there r good managers and bad managers who will ignore availability and not help you. And it is hard to get promoted or advance."
good,It was always a job I would look forward to going to. Majority of the time it was a constant pace with customers coming and going. Customers were always polite as were the people I worked with.
good,I would immediately have to call my boss when I clock in and he would usually call me to his office to discuss what needs to be done first. It was always different everyday because I was trained to work half the store so I always got pulled away from my job to help another department. Had to cashier a lot
good,This place can be trying at times but definitely workable if you can put up with back handed comments from your customer service staff who seems quite stuck up and unwilling to actually take time out of their day to help you.
good,A typical day at work is you are assigned to a register and you mostly are on that same register all day scanning customers food/ other items. There is a bagger at the end of your register! If you are short staffed you might not have a bagger and you need to bag your own items up for the customers.
good,"Pay is pretty good, depending on position. Can be stressful, especially around holidays. No real opinion on management, changes often. Hours vary from day to day and week to week."
good,At my location the breaks were terrible and half the time they would schedule courtesy clerks during their breaks. It wasn’t until someone complained that the water cooler for the courtesy clerks needs to be out after coming in from or going out in 100 degree plus weather that it happened.
good,"It’s is a good environment for people who like competition and weekly checks "
good,"work was typically busy, work mates were good people and I miss them. management did not seem to care, i learned how to deal with people better, the hardest part was dealing with angry customers"
good,If your looking to settle down on a job with a good retirement plan Kroger is a good place. I loved working there although the management wasn’t very good. And the pay wasn’t enough for all the many jobs I had to do.
good,The work place was nice and everyone was super cool and fun to be around. My only problems came with not being able to have weekends off so I couldn't spend time with family and friends like I wanted to.
good,I had a lot of friends working there and I made a lot of good friends. The people you see everyday through the lines will remember who you are if you are nice enough of course. It was a really good when u were there.
good,"Gained most my pharmacy knowledge working for Kroger. Learned most pharmacy systems: data entry, third party rejections, contact manager, Cardinal. First learned how to do inventory. It keeps you busy, but you feel so busy and rushed throughout the day that you don't feel like you are getting to take care of your customers/ members to the fullest at the end of the day even when you did."
good,The Kroger Company suck and some of the Kroger Company stores are not kept clean and if u show up e9 the company will not pay the workers and the staff early suck and i would not like any of my friends work with the company that can not keep any help at all and I was making the truck order and making sure that their deli department had everything that they needed to run on. I also did all of the work schedule making sure both day and night shift openers and the middle day shift and might shift closer had everything that was needed and everything was put up in the store and the deli department could not allowed to keep anything on them when CEO was there
good,"Great staff, and Great management"
good,I’ve been here for 5 years and I have the best bosses. I have great coworkers too they make it tolerable to work here. I can say I can’t cant complain.
good,You will have to learn how to multi task at kroger’s . In my opinion you have to most definitely be focused so you can get your customers out in time in a acceptable amount of time
good,"it was a good job to have while in school, not too stressful, the only hassle was the trash, trash bags would rip easily and the trash goes everywhere"
good,Most enjoyable part of the job is the customers. Making them smile & brightening their day is uplifting. Creativity is limitless. Structured environment.
good,"This was a job I took on while I was still trying to get my credits hours for school.  I was a bagger and had to go get carts for the customers if carts were needed.  I had lots of customers contact while bagging their groceries on a daily basis.  Some customers were polite but some were nasty acting.  We had to go out into the cold, no matter how cold it was to receive carts daily."
good,"Stressful a few days out of the week."
good,"Working for Freddie on a typical day is usually busy non stop customers from around 8 am to 9 pm, I assisted customers with paying their bills online and transferring money via Western Union while also providing general customer service desk help. While working here they taught me how to engage with customers regardless of how upset they are and provide customer service that would hopefully smooth out their day. I also learned while working at Freddies how to work a cash register, self check out robots, and close all 3 cck locations. My favorite part of working here was how you could form good friendships with the regulars, talking with them could improve my day. The hardest part for me working here was when unhappy customers would belittle and raise their voices to try and expedite  their experience."
good,Meeting new people like co-workers and customers. The group training was great and informative. We learned about everything about Kroger and our job duties.
good,What made it unbearable was getting 12 hours a week while other courtesy clerks received 24 or more. Also had me working 4 hour shifts only 3 days a week which was a waste of time. Most cashiers were friendly while courtesy clerks were not. Also a lot of gossiping. It was not a fun place to be at. It’s also not fun being outside in 90 degree weather and having to collect shopping carts and getting complained at that you’re going too slow. Most courtesy clerks don’t help out when you’re struggling but then you’re expected to help others.
good,"you're basically helping customers find products, stocking shelves, helping bag groceries, helping take groceries to customers cars, and cleaning up spills in the store"
good,it was ok there was too much drama for the amount I got paid and the higher managers do usually give a flying sh#t about you and want you to quit if they did not like you
good,"The pace was not over fast, but steady. If you were not sure what to do, there was always someone there you could ask and they would explain it for you. Learned several different jobs in the salad bar area that were new to me and they were explained well."
good,"Great job for kids in school (HS and College)."
good,"Typically we're always understaffed and unable to keep up with the amount of work required to meet customer satisfaction. Having employees that can adjust and quickly react is essential for Pharmacy. Managers and Co-workers are the better part of the job. There isn't really a hard part of the job for me personally, just too much work for the amount of people in the Pharmacy."
good,I loved working at Kroger. It was always fun. The employees are great people. My managers were always super nice. We had our stressful days but so does everybody.
good,Job is alright. scheduling can be a problem and management inst the best. Other than that its not a bad place to work at. The pay is pretty good and weekly.
good,I enjoy Kroger company and would love to stay but they don't promote when moving from division to division and I am not willing to put in another 2 years to prove myself at the same level in a different division.
good,Great place to work if you are a student. will work with your schoolschedule. You will learn a lot about the product they sale and will help you choose what is best for you.
good,"Departments themselves are run really easily and smoothly, the only issues that arise come in when upper management interfere in daily tasks, which they don't do very often."
good,"I had the opportunity to work in a total of 7 department areas within this company and each one is so different. You can do so much and never get bored with your job. Every day is different from the last,"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the people as they checked out of the store, hearing what advice they would give and such, but the hardest part was having to deal with the rush hours. A typical day would be just chatting with customers and other staff members as the cashiers do their jobs, baggers helping out whenever they could. I had learned that having patience was a great virtue, even when some situations had made it wear thin, but another important thing to remember is that teamwork can help solve a lot of problems."
good,I loved my time with Kroger.  I enjoyed my position. We were going through a transition in my area and I'm hopeful they have it worked through it by now as I have I moved to Florida.
good,For the work the job offer you should give a little more money the what you all starting people off with. But overall its a good job for people that's going to school.
good,Kroger is a nice and easy job but it does get annoying at times for example customers come to the store and complain about certain things you guys don’t have but you have no input on what comes in and comes out.
good,Works hreat for part time and just extra money. Not a great place for a career. I went salary and I was required to work too many hours and often worked over the requirements.
good,"When I worked in the Bistro area, the senior staff would always opt out of closing. This was okay, except for the fact that I was scheduled to work with a slacker. She always disappeared for periods of time during her shifts and made closing much more difficult. I was unable to take most of my breaks because I was sometimes the only person at the station. The management was shoddy. When they found the front empty as I was in the back washing dishes, I was reprimanded. All in all, it is an alright gig, but I do not recommend working night shifts in the Bistro department."
good,"Schedules are often flexible for cashiers, but there are rarely enough staff to cover breaks and meals. Front end supervisors frequently ""forget"" to give breaks, so you might work most of your shift before your first break is given and then be told that you won't get your other break because you don't have enough time left in your shift now. Even if you remind them of your needed breaks, they still often get forgotten about them. "
good,"It was very fun working at Kroger; with all of my coworkers. The job itself wasn't too difficult, but the pay wasn't so great with how much knowledge I had. I felt like I was worth more with the amount of experience I had in different departments. I've learned a lot. They wanted me to continue learning, but I couldn't stay with what I had."
good,"In my span of two and half years working with Kroger I was always happy with the people, and community, that I worked with. Managers and other employees were, for the most part, very friendly and the store as a whole worked together to solve issues that would arise. The hardest part of the job, in my opinion, would have to have been some of the unruly customers that would occasionally wonder into our store. The most enjoyable, however, would be hard to say because there was seldom a thing that I didn't enjoy about working there. I would definitely recommend a job at Kroger, in the Meat department specifically, to anyone else. Plenty of opportunity to advance."
good,"Felt very homely. Customers were never an issue. Work hours varied greatly, however. You would work a lot one week, but not much the next. Lots of opportunities to move around in the company."
good,The management could have been better. I wish they put up their workers hours in the work book on time and were more friendly to the workers. The co-workers are nice and they help you out when you need help. They are very kind to the costumers and make them feel welcomed.
good,"It's a fast-paced environment and it can be great to meet so many different types of customers. I started out at one location and transferred to another. At the first location there was bad management, so a lot of employees were unhappy with the work environment. Second location had better management, so it was somewhat easier to work in."
good,"This is not a bad place to start your career. The hours are good, but you will be working weekends.The company is streamlining and automating its back end. They have given radios to key personal to increase collaboration."
good,"It’s only my second job so I’m not expecting much. It’s just a lot to deal with, also I don’t get as many hours as I would like. It’s really fast paced and it often gets almost too busy to really function."
good,"It's a pretty good place to work, at least the store I was at. Coworkers - even managers and supervisors - are super friendly, and the customers are generally pleasant. A lot of customers are there at least once a week, so you get to know them. If they like you, they'll sometimes wait in line just to see you, rather than use the u-scan stations where there's no line. It's pretty satisfying when a customer calls you their ""new favorite cashier"" (a comment I've gotten more than once)."
good,Work with your schedule  allow you to build customer service   Able to transfer to various departments learn people skills able to have schedule sat around school work in home manage me is very understanding
good,"Kroger has a lot to work on and has made moves to work on them, however I think they need more improvement. It is a great place to work, but they have a major disconnect between lower end workers and upper end management."
good,Easy enough to push carts and bag but can get hard during the holidays or when the weekends arrive. You’ll find that working here will require long hours focus but it is not stressful or hard.
good,Pick n save is an enjoyable place to work. It has busy and slow times which make it stressful sometimes and boring the others but for the most part it balances out to be a nice easy job to have.
good,"Although the department was short staffed and the hours were low, everyone worked well together to get the job done in a timely manner. Management was helpful with our department started to fall behind schedule. The people I worked with were friendly and helpful as well."
good,It was a good place to work since i was attending college at the same time. they worked well with my schedule and it was easy to get along with my coworkers.
good,When I worked at Kroger I made friends and enjoyed my time working at times. Kroger has restructured and the benefits and work hours are now much different and I have heard from workers that it has gotten worse and would not be worth returning.
good,"As a store manager, I was always on call. Even on my days off, I had to be ready to answer calls or go into the store to handle a situation. Despite the lack of personal time, I was pretty happy with my position."
good,Worked here for years after graduating high school was promoted and paid was increased. Company likes to keep within themselves so it's a good job for someone looking to start from the bottom and work their way up
good,"I worked there in high school. It was just a part time job for spending cash to me. Didn't focus too much on career development or anything like that, but there is always opportunity for promotion if desired and earned."
good,"A typical day at work tends to consist of greeting fellow co-workers and working alongside them to assist customers with given tasks, ranging from helping them with checking out goods, and bagging, to helping them locate their selective goods around the store."
good,fun place to work at. managers are nice. the customers are friendly and know everyone. everything is low cost. lots of good deals. lots of coupons. free downloads almost every week.
good,"Kroger was an interesting place to work, but the duties were the same every day. There were very little challenging or rewarding daily duties that could make the job more interesting. The experience gained by working at Kroger has been very helpful in finding new jobs, but the compensation was insufficient to motivate staying on as a retail employee."
good,"Kroger is a great starter job, it teaches you a good sense of responsibility. Teaches you how to manage your time to be the most efficient at your job."
good,The mangers at Kroger are really nice and understanding I would say the most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the people you work with everyone is nice and are easy to talk to
good,Fast paced every day. Changes come very quickly and sometimes not enough time to get everything done that is expected of you.  Resources are kept very tight and expectations are usually very high.
good,Being a technician requires a lot of multitasking and prioritizing. You are appreciated by the ones that work close to you but that doesn't always pay the bills. The starting pay for what is asked of you and the workload don't necessarily correlate but it could be worse. At least you get some incentives.
good,I have enjoyed working at Kroger. I have worked at self check-out for almost two and a half years. I assist customers with their purchases and help them locate their items on the shelves.
good,The Kroger Meat Department is a face-paced enviorment where you have to wear many hats and juggle many things. The team at the Kroger Store in Hamilton is top notch. They work with each other to conquer tasks and have increased sales to Million dollars per week!
good,"Great place to work if you’re looking to move up in a decent company.  Decent benefits and mostly easy work at the entry level.  Always room for advancement, and with the right attitude could easily work your way into a comfortable living waged job."
good,The only thing that could push someone away from this job will have to be the customers. The managers that I worked with were very pushy on one to come in when people will call out.
good,Benefits are good long hours good people. Lots of learning and training experiences. Have been certified in pallet jack forklift scissor lift ...learned alot about sanitation maintenance
good,"Working at this company is OK and the work environment is super, I don't have a real openion about Kroger since they close down in North Carolina. Kroger is alright"
good,"Not a bad job for those who don’t have a lot of bills and don’t have many things they need to pay for, I’m here because I needed a job and they wanted to hire me above average pay but it’s still not enough"
good,"I found it to be very fun and enjoyable work. My expectation was that of laid-back, low-key shifts with little stress. It was very high paced, vigorous, moderate to heavy labor. You must be flexible in shift coverage and have a willingness to abide unexpected changes and on-call sratus. Must follow company policies and procedures according to maintain consistency throughout all stores. Little opportunity to implement individual ideas or improvements. It was a enjoyable position for a person who is looking for work that you can go home and not take the job with you. Great for students, people with disabilities as well as those seeking promotion in the grocery industry. Good training established for career growth."
good,"It’s always busy and a good paced work area . The schedules are very flexible and the managers are understanding and cooperative. I learned how to properly work a cash register, how to assist customers in every department of the store."
good,"Great company,  many responsibilities,  on the spot decision making, "
good,It was a fast paced job. And I did a lot in overtime and worked a lot. I loved the customers and I liked working at a faster pace. I just didn’t like the low pay scale. But just starting out a great first job.
good,the most enjoyable part of the job is working by myself for the first part of mine job the hardest part of the job is doing 50 different thing a night
good,"The average day there is very fast-paced, constantly on your feet and always moving, kneeling, squatting, and lifting. Sometimes we are so busy that there is no time for a break or lunch or we get behind orders. The people in clicklist are great people to work with and very personable."
good,With working here you have to interact with a lot of different people. Everything is fast moving and the days are pretty much the same when it comes to what you have to do.
good,"good place to work for people going to school or looking for something flexible to work with, offers different positions of work good to establish relationships"
good,"The managers, head-of-department, and HR do their best to make customers AND employees feel valued. If employees feel inadequately equipped to do their jobs effectively, the managers and heads-of-department work along-side them and provide mentor-ship and support."
good,"good company pay sucks, but if you can survive like 5 years with the company you eventually will make good money. mgmt. seems very clueless. favoritism is horrible"
good,"Kroger was a great company to work for, as I did for 5 years. They were fair on wages and offered on the spot bonuses for a job well done. Kroger cared for their employees but if you accidentally violated any rule or regulation, it was taken very seriously. For minor cleaning or organization issues, you had the risk of losing your job. Kroger loves their customers and employees, but demands perfection."
good,Lots of issues with supply chain and short of help. Long hours lots. Opportunities to advance are possible. Pay is good and no educational requirements past highschool
good,"Lots of moving."
good,"I loved getting to know my coworkers, both inside the store and those I spent more time with out in the kiosk. I made some great friendships that I'll not soon forget. Having people to chat with in the store made the job more enjoyable because I felt like I belonged. My supervisor was great at working with my schedule when it changed due to my college classes, and the managers were usually consistent when we needed assistance. The hardest part of the job was probably having inconsistent hours and dealing with difficult customers."
good,"Overall, not too bad. Sense of teamwork to get things done. Support from store management. Recognition for hard work. Opportunities to learn new skills"
good,"A work day was fast paced, stressful, and hard."
good,I enjoyed working here.  It was face paced and there was always something to do to stay busy with.  I was able to quickly move into management which I enjoyed.
good,"I taught myself how to open and close my department. Very little guidance, and when you do something wrong you get yelled at for them not teaching you how to do it their way."
good,"Your started your day with a clean mind set, fun people I encountered, you just have to be patient with all the customers and their demands. The names of the different hams and Cheese I learned and I will never forget. I like baking, assisting customers with their orders. The staff and workers are easy to work with. They respect different cultures. The hardest part of the job is when you don't meet the needs of the customers and when you feel you disappointed them. I enjoy a lot of things and responsibilities inside the store mostly at the Deli Dept."
good,"Kroger in general is a great place to work, but it’s really all luck and patience if you want to move up. Pay is horrible for how much work you have to do, but most of the time management is well trained. Great company for your first job but if you don’t see yourself moving up or getting promotions, you shouldn’t stay for long."
good,"working for Kroger is challenging in that your job is never done. There is always something to do and many times there are empty holes to fill on the shelves when I arrive for my shift. also many of my shifts were  helping to close the produce department at 10.  a good close requires that all shelves be filled , trash and cardboard removed and banana's uncapped. I have learned how to handle customer requests and questions while to continue to bring out more produce and also keep shelves organized and clean. In our department there are about 11 employees of which only 4 are full time. One must learn to work with different partners at different times"
good,"I currently feel that there is nowhere for me to advance. I do not feel that the management I currently have will help me achieve my goals. At this time, I feel that it is best to move on."
good,"A work night would start off with the night crew getting a palette jack, using that jack to take the tall pile of groceries on the floor and lay all of them out then begin stocking products onto the shelves.  For me, my role would be to lay out my palette of groceries and then sweep and speed scrub the entire store where ever it is needed."
good,A job is a job. I worked here for extra cash. It is a wonderful little side hustle but I have seen alot of people becoming very comfortable with the work. I left the job because I had a feeling it would lead me no where.
good,"A typical day of work for Utility: Clean up messes; clean and resupply bathrooms; collect trash and recycling; help the front end and the other departments when necessary."
good,"In my case, Kroger was not a laid back job. My position often consisted of plenty of physical labor and duties. My coworkers were kind but at the time I was a high school student and the long hours and hard work was tough for me to balance. Its not an ideal job, but it works for some people depending on what type of duties they enjoy having."
good,"I worked part-time in the Gift Card dept at the Corporate Headquarters office. It was a temp job, only during busy holiday season. The people I worked with were awesome and always helpful."
good,"Kroger used to be a wonderful place to work."
good,"You don’t not get benefits unless you’ve worked there for a certain amount of years and the pay was very unfair! I liked working where I was but the amount of stress I was put under and all I did, I should have been paid more."
good,"The typical day at Krogers will involve a very slow beginning phase in the early morning where you will need to find work to do yourself as often in the early morning there will not be any registers open for a while. The first big rush of people is late morning pre-noon where you will need to bag for a variety of different cashiers. The next low is just past noon where you could be tasked to do various tasks to keep the store looking nice for the customers. The Largest rush of the day is the pre-dinner rush, You will have to be able to bag quickly and efficiently to keep up. The last low is the night where the parking lot is often cleared and various upkeep tasks are done to help make the next day easier. The hardest part of the job is the amount of skill needed to be efficient in this job. This is not a job for people who cannot move quickly and can't find tasks to do on their own. The most enjoyable part of working for this company is the people you meet while working this job. You often interact with hundreds of people a week and everyone is different."
good,Empresa dedicada a valorar la calidad en el servicio y la satisfaccion de los empleados y los clientes.
good,"My out look on Kroger is very well. They are organized but can be hostile on some days, the customers are always right and is always first no matter what."
good,"I've been with the company for nearly 6 years, and I can honestly say it's a stable work environment that takes care of it's employees. It's been a staple in the retail world for over 50 years."
good,"No day is ""typical"" in retail and working in grocery retail is no different, each day is a challenge and new opportunity for growth.  While there are slower times than others in each store locations there is always work to be done, allowing tome to pass easily."
good,"Kroger is a very enjoyable company to work for. Every job has it's Cons, but the Pros by far outweigh them. You have alot of benefits and discounts that are easy to access on their easy to navigate employee website."
good,"Kroger is a great place for finding deals, meals, and just about anything. Working there has also taught me about hard work and enjoying diverse friendships. Kroger can be a job that demands a lot of you constantly; making it almost difficult to catch your breath."
good,"typically I would go in around 3 and stay until 10 and i'd usually be responsible for maintaining the shelves before I'd end up working behind the counter and he;ping out customers, During the 3rd shift position i found the job mush harder to stay motivated for due to the stressful workload, but ultimately it was a good job experience."
good,I liked working for the company. And Kroger prices can't be beat. Enter acting with the customers had to be the best part of my job. Great location and convenience for the customers and employees.
good,Grocery store job is not one that can be taken serious. Mostly because the pay is so low. It definitely does not compare to cost of living. Management for the most part is good. Sometime you get your evil managers that would rather get a bonus for keeping costs down instead of keeping the store well staffed and running right. The workplace culture is very family like. For the most part everyone gets along and helps one another. The most enjoyable part is the lack of responsibility. You know that no matter what you will get paid what your pay rate is.
good,This job was stressful at times when there wasn’t a lot of help around and the poor managers made the situations no better. Some customers were rude a lot.
good,My work experience at Kroger's was not good at first due to lack of hours that i had received. Just recently I realized that just taking time to consult these troubles with my manger will fix my problems. I waited until it was too late to get my benefits.
good,"kroger was an alright job you got the hours you wanted to work, but the pay was horrible for what you were doing, a typical day at my Kroger was clocking into an understaffed workplace to provide for needy customers who want more than two lanes open but you only have two cashiers. the hardest part of my job was learning PLUs and how to properly close at night. breaks where good 3 breaks in an 8-hour shift 2 in a 7, 1 in a 6,"
good,"During my typical workday, i am responsible for overseeing my teams as they progress on various advertising campaigns.I check in and help  them with any issues then may be having such as doing mock-ups or securing right to songs.I keep  in touch with clients ,update them on our progress and make sure they are satisfied   with the promotional materials."
good,"this is a very large corporate retailer with ;many stores so often local decisions come from an office many states away. The local culture is excellent, salaries are competitive but hard to earn a living on, but the benefit package is strong."
good,"I enjoyed working at Fred Meyers, I felt I was a key employee there. I did multi tasking and got along good with my coworkers, I kept busy with my accomplishments,  I was reliable and hardworking. I would recommend this job."
good,"great place to work. good pay, enough breaks, discount on merchandise. upper management is involved enough. flexible scheduling options for employees."
good,I would arrive at 5am. Once clocked in I would do inventory on produce product out on the floor for the customers. Once completed I would prepare my table and product to add to the sales floor. After the sales floor was competed I would prepare more cut product to be placed on the sales floor through out the day after I left. Lastly I would make sure my are is cleaned and prepare to end my shift. The thing i enjoyed the most about my job was working along side with the other employees.
good,Went to work 5-6 days a week and was happy working in multiple departments. I was originally hired on as a seasonal employee. A manager saw the potential was able to stay on for an additional 3 yrs+.I only left because I couldn't move to management at the time in the fuel center. I highly enjoyed working and enduring the responsibilities that came with Kroger.
good,Love the discounts. Flexible hours they will work with you if you have issues or need time off. I love the crew i work with.  We all get along and work together.
good,I don't know what really to say about Kroger was work it was a job wasn't the greatest but it wasn't the best either basically did what I told promoted once or twice but that's it.
good,I did thank that after my hospital treatment that I'm being treated unfairly. I'm a hard work and i came to work when I was supposed to plus other times when I wasn't .
good,"I worked here for 3 months and was quite happy with the work. Not terribly difficult, minimum wage is fair and helpful staff. Magagment was varied, some were great, some seemed overly strict, but overall pretty good."
good,"The best part about the job was the customers and regulars helping them find their needs."
good,"It's retail so the hours are going to be staggered but my hours stayed between 45-50 hours/wk plus travel time.  I commuted about 2 hours to work round trip 5 days/week."
good,"Great customer service from associates, no matter which location you work at. Health insurance is also great, however salary is not so great. Store managers get rotated around to different stores fairly often so you never really get to bond with them."
good,"Working in Fred Meyer stores is a positive experience!  The company provides quality training, and opportunities for advancement.  Great technology is employed.  My colleagues  are competent, outgoing, and fun to work with. My manager is exceptional.  He/She is hardworking, and understanding toward his/her associate's and customer's needs."
good,"In my store, management treated everyone well and I had understanding and great managers to work for.  It was a lot of hard work, which is worth more than minimum wage but it is a grocery store."
good,"Very good as a part time first job and decent full time. Over night is probably the best full time pay and hours you can get as a full timer, but for a person in high school or college it is excellent for part time due to the flexibility of work schedules."
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers."
good,I enjoyed working with my co-workers and staff. I loved the customer. Management show me more then what I Know. I apparently  everyone.i truly love work there.
good,Kroger is a great company to work for the managers are respectful and they are very hardworking and the associates are very helpful. All employees are treated equally and the benefits are good.
good,"Most of the times, the job was pretty chill and layback. The job wasn't too stressful, however the customers would have attitude occasionally. My co-workers were generally really cool and easy to work with. The management wasn't too bad, but it could've been better. And I didn't always receive much hours, they weren't bad hours, but i would've prefered more."
good,OK if you work for Kroger but Dillons is nothing like their parent company. Dillons doesn't focus on balancing your life. Beware and just keep pushing if you don't get hired. Dillons is desperate for people because their turn over rate is poor.
good,I really liked working with my friends but Kroger is a union job so getting promoted can be a little tricky. They do have weekly pay thats a plus!!!!!
good,"Kroger is a very busy place.  So put on your best shoes , you are constantly moving. They have a very diverse group of people that works at Kroger,  It makes a great part time job!"
good,"I like the fact that on at least one Saturday a month there's a free meal for the working staff. Also, every employ has a chance to win the on going Bingo game pot."
good,You will not get board.  Click list is very fast paced we are always moving. We learn the entire store and can help other customers find things.  If you shop at kroger you get fuel points.
good,"As a cashier, you ring customers and engage in brief friendly conversation to brighten their day and make their shopping experience pleasant. You make occasional product substitutions and do whatever it takes for the customer to leave satisfied."
good,"Kroger management is cutthroat about productivity. Management sets a high pace. Due to high product volume, the work can become exhausting. However, the company is fully supportive of it's full-time employees."
good,"A typical day here would be coming in early, checking tasks, greeting customers. I learned how to do nearly everything in the department, because my coworkers saw that I was able to learn quickly. The individual department manager saw this and made it his mission to train me up to new skills. My other coworkers varied depending on the season, and the most difficult times were when they were not as adept and the team relied more on me to finish tasks than on the others. The most rewarding part was being able to teach and learn, and seeing a customer's face light up during our conversation."
good,"A typical day at work for me in the Bakery Department began at 5:00am. I worked on donuts for the first part of the morning. While at Kroger, I had learned many managerial tasks, for when my manager was not present. I'd also been one of the employees that would train new hires. Management was one weakness at Kroger. The co-managers weren't understanding all of the time, but we did our best to get things done quickly. My bakery manager was extremely dedicated to making our customers satisfied. The hardest part of the job was time management. I say this because we had many tasks to complete, but only 8 hours to do so. I often would stay late or skip my last break to get everything done, and to clean up for the staff at night. The most enjoyable part of my job, was the creativity I was given. I'd create cakes for customers that were unique and to their liking."
good,"Management always sides with the customer. The more lies they told and the louder they got, the more stuff management would give them. I do not like lying customers."
good,Every month we had a pot luck dinner. There was often plenty of work to be done without having mandatory environment. The was an optional union to join. It often help give us raises and give us more available work hours. Our store had a manager that fought hard to keep our pay down but the union was a great help. As an employer I enjoyed Kroger most.
good,"Good co. to work for and had good benefits"
good,"I like working at Kroger, I get a long  with everyone I work with, I love the people that I come in contact with some are good some are great and some are not so great, but that comes with the working with the public"
good,My typical day included working a check out lanes and dealing with customer questions and resolving customer issues. I ran a cashier lane or managed a self checkout lane and occasionally stocked lanes. The hardest part was the inconsistent hours and dealing with rude customers.
good,"hard to get hours sometimes"
good,"I did end up learning quite a bit from my experiences at Kroger and I'm glad I ended up working in several departments so I got to change things up. The managers aren't the best but the people you're surrounded with are awesome! Plus, you get to meet a whole city of people with different backgrounds."
good,This place has been my home for 14 years. My co-workers are like family and everyone looks out for one another. Recently management has changed and the atmosphere has suffered because of it. More work added but less hours given. Overall I would recommend because the benefits are great but you definitely need some thick skin to last here.
good,"Kroger Pharmacy should pay their techs better to compete with independent pharmacies.  Apart from that, hours were flexible and most of the staff were very welcoming."
good,Everyone's really nice for the most part. Fast paced work environment. Continuous training for the first year. Great benefits after 1000+ hours worked.
good,"what you would expect from a LP job. multi uni stores, mangers cold care less about shrink until is a problem. Corporate is moving away from LP because of liability and moving to more contract security companies."
good,Kroger is a great place to work for someone who has just graduated in the culinary field and want to gain some experience. I like to think of it as a small stepping stone on your career path.
good,A day at work would be to just listen to orders from management and stock items from the truck deliveries. I learned how to complete tasks on my own without management supervision. My management always gave clear instructions on what to do. The workplace was just right for overnight stockers. The hardest part of the job is facing merchandise properly on shelves in the freezer section. The most enjoyable part of the day would be cleaning up the aisles and restocking items in the backroom for the next day.
good,It's a very slow paste job. Some rude customers. The enjoyable part about this job is meeting new customers. The hardest part about this job is learning all the codes.
good,"Overall working at Kroger was great, made lots of friends, and the job itself wasn't too bad. Sometimes rushes would cause extensive strain for periods of time, to get the area cleaned up again. Management was ok, some of them knew how to help and talk to employees to get the best work from them, others clearly did not."
good,I like working there everybody is friends with everybody and works together but is stressful because manager sucks at schedules and we dont get full time and are always overworked.
good,It was ok they just didn't want to give people hours because they didn't want to pay them for the benefits. The cashiers didn't always get their brakes because the management was terrible
good,I grew up working at Kroger so it was a lot of up's and downs. I expected more from them with me being there for 10 years but I never got what I thought i deserved.
good,"Management is kind. Hours are light, the work is easy. This job role you collect carts, bag groceries, and restock grocery shelves. The hardest part of the day would be collect shopping carts in the heat."
good,"I'll be honest, being stuck in the dairy cooler by myself for hours at end wasn't the best job I could imagine, but it was a summer job in between high school grade levels so I stomached it. "
good,"Working here is fun, yet some of the managers are not fit to be in charge. I cannot complain about the working environments, I would tell friends to apply if they needed a job."
good,"Working as a Sushi Chef was an amazing experience. However, when transferred, I washed pots and pans every day. It would have been more reassuring to be promoted rather than demoted."
good,"A typical day would be coming in and checking to see what is full around the department. Usually you need to keep an eye on the milk doors, cottage cheese/dips doors, eggs and juice. If those are full, then depending on what your co-workers had done that morning, I would run the remaining skid from the previous nights delivery. If that were finished then I would run the carts of product that is back stock, or stock that could not fit on the shelf when they ran it last. If that were done, I would clean the cooler floor, milk shelves or milk doors, if they needed. After one of those events were finished, I would check the department again if it needed to be filled. Once that had be done, a milk or perishable delivery would typically show up and I would need to help unload it and do the required paperwork. On a milk truck, the driver would unload the skids and take them to the cooler while I bring in empty skids for them to take back to their facility. For a perishable truck, one person from produce and meat department would help pull the skids off the truck and put them in their designated cooler/freezer. Once that is finished, it is nearing the end of the shift and I would condition/face the department to ensure it looks its best. The hardest part of the job is maintaining good customer service while working on the department as much as possible. Since I am working around the time people do their shopping during the work week, it can be difficult and stressful to constantly be productive for the department as well as customer oriented since most of my work is in the same spot"
good,"Courtesy clerks are basically the servers of the storer. We Bag the customers items, clean the store, clear the parking lot of all carts, and provide friendly help and customer service to all customers and employees."
good,"good company that for the most part treats you well"
good,Fair management that tried to work with employee schedules. Learned to handle cash register and self-checkout. Hardest part was dealing with dissatisfied customers. Had a scan speed requirement for checkouts.
good,"The job i worked at kroger was indeed interesting, it lacked in a couple departments. Such as, organization, communication and motivation. The workers were good people but lacked the want to work harder. The weak were forgotten under the wings of the strong. As long as i was doing my job no one else got in trouble. Unfair disiplinary actions, not saying i did nothing wrong but i expect anyone else that pulls the same actions to recieve the same discipline. I loved working there otherwise. It kept me busy, kept me active, now i have more knowledge on the work force and in better than before."
good,"The interview process was decent. They gave me a saliva drug test. Orientation is mostly a meeting and computer work. The weekly pay is nice, but it's very stressful. Don't expect to get Sundays off either. Also expect to get moved to different departments a lot."
good,"I enjoyed my job at Kroger, however we were just given about a little over a month notice that ALL Kroger would be closing in August. I enjoy the fast pace at my store 332 and was really heart broken when we found out along with the management team that ALL Kroger stores were closing in NC.  Our customers will miss us."
good,"When working at Kroger, especially the Kroger on Roosevelt it’s really a little challenging sometimes because the store isn’t big as the other kinds. We have lots of customers coming in and out so we have to be on our toes to make sure our customers leave as quickly as possible with good satisfaction. The harder part of the job is dealing with angry customers or shoplifting because we can’t do anything about except the manager."
good,I enjoyed my time at Kroger while I was there. I normally worked from 4 pm to 9 pm after school but as the work got harder after a car accident I was not accommodated for my hours decreased so I could heal. This did not seem to please those working at the front desk because I then became unfairly treated as a slacker. This is ultimately why I had to leave.
good,My time at Fry's was quite rewarding. I learned many new lessons about the grocery industry and I made lifetime friends similar to my experience in the military
good,I loved the job I did but the store manager was not very fair with some of the employees. He definitely has his favorites. My co-workers were helpful.
good,"What no one will tell you about working at kroger is that the management usually doesn't care about what you're busy doing, what you have to get done. If they want something else that has absolutely nothing to do with you done, they'll make you do it. My department was swamped and we only had two people working that day, and yet, the manager pulled me out to stock some TOILET PAPER. After working there for a year, I couldn't put up with it anymore."
good,Ruler Foods has a lot of growth potential and Kroger continues to invest heavily into the small format grocery store. A smaller division of Kroger gives it a tighter knit feel.
good,"This job was good for my first job, but as oppurtunities grow, the outlook for this job was somewhat bleak. If you are starting out, this job is great for you."
good,"It's a predictable job with consistent work.  If looking for excitement, wait until you're off.  The pay starts off well and improves with time allotted."
good,Very productive job but managers play favorites with their their employees. Scheduling is based off of seniority because of union. Flexible for anyone in school but don't expect full time hours.
good,As a Cashier at Kroger you will encounter all kinds of people. Employees and Customers. Kroger is a very fast paced environment with a Register accuracy and scanning level at 90% at least
good,"Employees are great to work with however, corporate is way out of touch with store level. The stress brought down makes the day to day job harder. I would recommend working here just don't take on a management job"
good,I've worked at Krogers for three years and it's a pretty easy place to work with great people who make work fun. The pay is minimum so that's not great but it's a pretty easy job in most departments
good,"management is not fair, but the overall place is alright. Im a cashier so i basically just greet customers, ring up items and deal with their money. sometimes i have to stock the shelves."
good,"On any typical day as a manager for Kroger we manage about 70 employees at a time.  We deal with all customer and associate complaints.  We deal with stock levels and inventory of assets. We are responsible for P&L statements for our store, shrink, hiring and firing.  We try to lead our people through positive reinforcement and intensive training. I am a lead by example type of manager so my days are very hands on."
good,"This was my first job that I started in High School. It taught me a lot about the work field, and handling customers, But I don't remember too much about it since it was so long ago."
good,"Pay a minium wage. Paid Weekly. Do not have to get relieved, when you are a courtesy clerk. Employee discount is awesome, raises and can transfer stores."
good,"Kroger was a great starting job. Great for teens, great for high school students and anyone who is just joining the work force. Definitely a great place."
good,Kroger provides equal opportunity employment for everyone that applies. Kroger gave me my start in Grocery retail in the early 90's. I applied myself as a leader and as a loyal person to the company.
good,"It's not hard to get along with co-workers, fights happen but r rare, breaks r decent in length, and customers r nice. Probably the ideal work environment. Holiday pay too."
good,"Love Kroger , great customers and co-workers. Pay is decent but the hours are crazy . Management is great at understanding and easy to talk too. The Union is a bonus"
good,"Working at Kroger was stressful at times, but I can say it was a good experience. The management could sometimes be a bit difficult, but were generally fair to their employees. The worst part of the job was lot duty, in which we had to go out into the parking lot and return the carts inside, up to ten at a time. It didn't help that it was the middle of summer. We were allowed to come in at any time for a break, but it couldn't be forever. In addition, lot duty could be scheduled as long as two hours. Luckily, this rarely happened, and courtesy clerks spent most of their time inside helping with bagging. This was the best part of the job, as you got to meet people and help them with their day. I can't count the number of interesting people I've met while bagging. Generally the workers didn't talk much; I never really had a non-work-related conversation with another employee. However, we still got along and respected each other. I enjoyed the job and I am glad to have had the opportunity, and would recommend it to any who are starting out and looking for a first job."
good,I really loved the job.   Love working with the public and assisting them with their purchases and any questions they would have.  I also worked in the Fuel Station and enjoyed the position there.  The worst part of that position was emptying the large trash cans because the younger people that worked during the day would not.   I had a very young manager in the store and he seemed to give me and the other older ladies a hard time.   Mostly I enjoyed the customers and my co-workers.
good,"Extremely fast paced, high volume, hundreds of customers per day. Managers are nice. Co-Workers are super helpful and friendly. Good place to learn a new career."
good,"Depending on individual managers, but company overall is pretty good. Have had to go above heads to get the right thing done sometimes."
good,The team that I work with tag crew or stockers are very helpful and my supervisor is very supportive and understanding. If I am unable to find a particular item everyone assist in trying to find the item for me or the tag crew we work together to try and finish the job before going home by seeing who has any work left or needs help. We are truly are a team. The hardest part of the job is resets meaning  the location of the item is wrong on the tag. Culture is diverse.
good,I enjoy the atmosphere the Kroger company has to offer. The work is enjoyable when I have my associates to help and guide me to better myself and each other.
good,My job was only difficult because this particular Kroger was severely understaffed and new employees hardly ever stick around. There are no set shift so each week my hours changed and difficult to form a routine.
good,"My time at Kroger was my first work experience but definitely my best. While sometimes I clashed with coworkers I genuinely had a great time working with the customers and getting to know regulars. It took some time to get to know the store and remember where things were but the office managers and Senior cashiers would always help and be friendly in interactions with me and the customer. Each employee got proper recognition for going above and beyond and every employee got friendly and helpful encouragement to hit goals or correct things that were done wrong. I was never scared to ask a question or ask for help and the senior employees were always more than happy to lend a helping hand. During my time working there I became very close to the other employees and the store felt like a second home. If I hadn't moved I can say I'd probably still be at that store or a Kroger in general, I would definitely reccomend it as a job."
good,"It was a very enjoyable job, that helped me develop as a person, and it was not too strenuous. Everybody that I worked around was very friendly, and was always willing to help out."
good,"Customer service praised highly. Co-workers vary in friendliness. Work environment varies due to store differences."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working here during my summers that I wasn't in school, They allowed me to go on a Leave of Absence to earn my college degree and come back home with a job waiting for me."
good,"Cashier- competitive "
good,"It was an okay place to wotk, mind you it was 20 some years ago when I worked there. i left because I needed bstter pay and benefits and there really wasn't room for advancement."
good,"A typical day at work consists of clocking in, and then assignments are usually either provided or told by a manager or a fellow employee who has been working already that day to me. The environment is pretty relaxing, never too intense or stressful. Management was very nice and helpful if I needed something. I was always very productive at work."
good,Great Job and flexible hours. Allows you to try working in other departments to help out when you're not busy. Easy going job busy days are usually the weekends.
good,Fast paced work environment with much effort and attention focused on providing your customer with excellent customer service. Kroger is a good company to work for.
good,"As a cashier, I was to memorize produce codes for a faster checking time to ensure the customer is not waiting for longer than expected while also allowing the customer the assure me that they found everything they needed with ease."
good,Over all working for them was good. I enjoyed work there. I just didn't enjoy the weekly scheduling and working 5 day a week and not getting over 20 hours was hard.
good,"payed vacation after a year, learn a great deal of new things, 401 K offered after one year, the management could use a lot of work and they don't know as much as the employees, but overall it is not a bad place to work."
good,Loved working with the customers and providing them customer service that  I would want for myself.  The job could be fast paced based on customer's demands.
good,approve schedule for staff and present training and rules and regulations. work well with coworkers and ensure state and federal regulations are upheld throughout the pharmacy.
good,Kroger is a decent place to work as far as the pharmacy goes. It is quick paced but not physically demanding. The customers are friendly and the staff is tolerable.
good,I enjoyed working for Kroger and learned everything from drug names to inventory management. The days typically go by quickly as the store I worked at filled several hundred prescriptions per day. The pharmacy manager I last worked for at Kroger went above and beyond for me during my time as an intern.
good,"On a typical work day, the store is busy and fast paced. I earned 8 dollars a hour and the pay Is weekly. The manager is good with assisting customers and making sure their employees are working in a safe and productive environment. The workplace culture is calm on most days. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people."
good,"The pay was good even though I worked part-time. The other employees were great and always eager to teach new employees how to better their work performance. However, lower management could be childish and lack training abilities."
good,"A typical work day was fast paced and sometimes a little slow depending on the time. I learned that Krogers is a well known company and has good advancement, plus the management was good and interactive. Workplace culture was diverse and a good atmosphere. Hardest part of the job was working in the weather (snow, rain). Most enjoyable was part was working outside and interacting with customers."
good,"Kroger was not a horrible place to work, it really just depended on the people. There were the people you do not really like to work with and then there are the ones that you really liked to work with. It could get busy, but it depended on the day of the the week and if there were any holidays happening. There were good and not so good managers, but you find that almost anywhere. You basically just have to know how to deal with people or the job is not for you."
good,I felt comfortable working around my co workers. The managers were on top of the employees. Rules and regulations were set in play and enforced but we were also able to feel like we had the opportunity to shine at our individual jobs.
good,The Company is made up of multi-cultured people which gives everyone the opportunity to learn new things from people from all walks of life. Its a team-work based company which ensures accuracy and productivity. Management is fair in all aspects of the company and the employees.
good,"Krogers was a good place to work except there was favoritism and if you were not in the ""in"" crowd it made it hard to work. This is a union store so if you are treated unfair they had your back. Overall the customers were the ones who made work better and enjoyable to be at work."
good,"If you need a part-time job to make quick and easy money then this is good job for that as long as you have good customer service skills. Not a job to try  and make a living off of, easy to get promoted, but only title promotions no raises."
good,"Every kroger varies but in general it was a good job, i actually enjoyed working there. The people were very friendly at my store and the customers were very polite."
good,"They don't really encourager you to move up in rank unless you start asking all the right questions. The breaks could be done better, but overall it s a nice easy job."
good,Working in the deli can be stressful. You learn how to stay out of the drama.  I enjoy the customers and socialization.  I work the morning shift and sometimes overnight..
good,"I worked at the fuel center part of Kroger, and for me it was pretty great. My team members were all collaborative. We all shared the same amount of work, and supported each other to cover shifts."
good,"I have worked for Fry's for the passed 12 years. I actually love working there, but since I am now a mother of two children it's becoming more difficult. The pay and benefits aren't too bad, but the scheduling is becoming a problem. The schedule is so sporadic and all over the place that every week I work is never the same. The pay isn't too bad, but it took working 7 years there to get over $13 a hour."
good,"Working for the less busy stores is not bad, and I would love to go back and work at my first one... Although when i got to the Suwanee Kroger, very shady management, and over worked/ took advantage of their hard working empolyee's and catered more towards the brown noser's"
good,"Very physical job, constantly on my feet. We wear safety hat and glasses. Safety is a top priority. Great insurance and pay. Love the people I have met. Run machines to make product and write down lot numbers for packaging that is used. 12 hour days."
good,"Kroger was a great first job during highschool. The hours could have been better, yet overall pay was okay. It was enough for me when I was the age I was working there."
good,"This was my first job, not a bad starter job for someone in highschool looking to make their own money. Management was cool. Breaks were good. Not a difficult job, can be fast paced during certain hours and certain holidays."
good,Make sure the management understand their job and cmmunicate with each other to allow store to function properly .more hours. Better training for all departments.
good,"Very good opportunity to expand on medical knowledge. Coming into the pharmacy from a restaurant background seemed scary, but training is provided and sets you up with the majority of what you need to know. The hardest part of the job is knowing which medications are for which symptoms/illnesses as well as which OTC is better or cheaper for the medications."
good,I enjoyed my time at Kroger with great coworkers and a positive atmosphere. My hours could have been better but I was pleased with my pay. I would recommend friends to apply.
good,"I enjoyed the work. I was a long time ago, so it is difficult to recalled certain details.  I loved picking orders using an electric pallet jack and headset."
good,"wonderful training program. Very poor communication as far as keeping me in the loop to get me scheduled. Though I was out very sick, no phone calls were made. It was completely up to me to get myself added to the work schedule."
good,"A typical day at work was mostly ringing up items and cleaning. I learned how to watch for fraudulent coupons and counterfeit bills. The management there was pretty good. They were usually willing to work with whatever you've got going on, within reason. Everyone there was really nice and great to work with too. I made a lot of friends there. I would say the hardest part of the job was the couponers. You had to really watch for them at the store that I worked at because some of them would find new and unusual ways to commit coupon fraud. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet some interesting people as they checked out."
good,Its and descent place to work except for when it comes to people calling in. There is never enough help to cover that kind of issue and they just expect people to work overtime all the time. They use the good workers all the time and that's how they lose them. The hardest part of the job is dealing with some rude customers that think its our fault that their card isn't working. The best part of the day is seeing some of my regular customers and being able to joke with them and not feel like I'm gonna get yelled at.
good,"Working at Kroger as a Courtesy Clerk is exactly as it sounds, hard working and a lot of multitasking. The company typically wants you to prove yourself as front end worker before you try any kind of advancement."
good,Sometimes third shift stockers have very little help putting things on the shelves and sometimes they do not follow certain union laws. Everyone there is friendly.
good,Working in the Kroger company has shown how much care they take in customers. They make sure thee customer is well taken care of. Management could be better.
good,Pharmacy is as good as any other retail grocery pharmacy.  They are obsessed with dress codes and gift cards and script numbers.  Pushing flushots and gift cards just like everyone else.
good,"Management sucked a bit of the time and was rather strict and you could easily feel you'd do a better job leading. They didn't give information very well where it counted like whether or not I could call out in the same day. But all in all it's a lot of work for small pay. A good place to start if you want discipline, but not if you want to be battered."
good,"A typical day of work included bagging, cleaning, and carts. I learned how to deal with different types of customers as well as coworkers. The hardest part of the job was balancing your hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people that I got to meet and work with."
good,I enjoyed working here as well as shopping here. I basically knew where everything was located by shopping here 3 times a week. Nice environment and great teamwork.
good,Overall experience was good. All positions were very challenging and each job was proved with hard and dedicated work. Benefits were good and appealing and honored to received.
good,"Working at Kroger was my very first jobv, they showed me what the basics were to customer service. How to service everyone fast, accurate and with a smile."
good,"I learned great customer service skills, how o use all of the equipment they have, breaking down pallets to bring product back to the department. keeping everything stocked."
good,Kroger works with your hours and availability. (If you have Children or attending school) The Company offers great Benefits and Compensation to Full Time Employees. Supervisors and other Management are there for questions and assistance if needed.
good,I moved up quickly to full time in the meat dept then to assistant meat manager.  I moved onto hourly relief manager which allowed me to gain so much more knowledge as i would work any department  when short handed. If you have the drive and work ethic you can suceed.
good,Had a good time working there. Made friends with the other employees working there great experience. Helping the customer's is what made my day it helped me get through my day.
good,This was my first job that I ever had and it was challenging at first but once you get adjusted to the place its not a bad environment to work at you just need to do your job well to the best of your ability.
good,"Variety of benefits offered to full time or part time employees: medical insurance (vision, dental, prescription); paid vacation/paid time off accrued based on tenure with company."
good,Assist customers by properly bagging groceries and loading if needed. Ensure customer satisfaction is achieved by answering any questions or helping customers with anything possibly needed
good,This job taught me how to be time managed. The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers I meet. Typical workday consist being Fresh and Friendly.
good,"It was not the best job in the world, but it was still a rather fun one to say the least. I enjoy helping people and that's what I did, I just did not enjoy the distance from work to home"
good,kroger was a great a place to work it was my first job and all they work with our scehdeule beacuse i am student at the time when i was working with kroger
good,Working at Kroger was a good experience for me. I enjoyed the customers and my co-workers. I was able to successfully train several cashiers and that was rewarding.
good,"When I was there, things were pretty nice, the only problem I had was the workers, some of them wouldn't do their end of the job. So I had to do theirs."
good,I did stocking at night with what came on the truck every night shift. When I worked there is an ok job but not many places for advancement or benefits was not that good at the time.
good,Kroger is a good place to work and meet a variety of people. The store management could definitely use some changing but other than that it's a fantastic job opportunity.
good,Worked as a pharmacy technician.  Kroger RX good company to work for.  Pay could have been better for workload.  Management was good.  Pharmacy was busy.
good,I worked as a cashier at Kroger and must admit there were quite a few friendly coworkers in which i formed a friendship as well as management was reasonably nice for the most part.
good,My time at Kroger I worked every department  they had because I could do it all. No matter the job I could fill in any spot from grunt work to management. The only real problem with the company is the head mangers of the store would be transferrd to another store so a new manager can get hired in the spot. They would cycle through about every 4 months
good,"It's a great place to work, but store management is key. If they're not on the same page as the employees, it's a difficult place to work. Expectations are high & the the stores are generally understaffed. It can get stressful very quickly ."
good,"I love doing the work for the event specialist, but the hours suck big time. I use to get about 6 to 20 hours a week, but then it dropped down to 12 hours a month."
good,"As someone who was reentering the workforce after a long break, I found Kroger had much to offer. All employees were offered benefits, flexible schedule, and the opportunity for advancement."
good,"There's always work to be done generally, so there's never a dull moment. The hardest and most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with the customers.  It's always fun interacting with most of the people that come in, although you do always have a few customers that are hard to deal with."
good,"We dispense over 150 prescriptions a day. I transfer over 50 medications from doctors offices and phone messages. The environment gets very hectic and busy but the fact that we work as a team and have meetings to improve our productivity makes it better. The management and pharmacist always assist in anyway that they can and they also make sure that we do not get too overwhelm. The pharmacist treat us like a family and we sometimes celebrate birthdays or thanks giving after work. The hardest part of the job is that it sometimes get busy but the most enjoyable part is that we work as a team and so no one person get too overwhelm because we help each other out. Through the years of working for Kroger i have learned that working in the pharmacy can be stressful but when all the co-workers have great communication between one another and we work as a team, we can overcome anything no matter how stressful the work environment may seem. We put our patient first and we understand their frustration and try our best to reason with them."
good,"Good Job if looking for extra money or a temporary job.  Doesn't pay very well, and most employees are part time. but it helps when needing extra money"
good,"they all have a good relationships with each other that create a nice family atmosphere, a trustable place to work at, a company with a lot of community service activity."
good,"Management was great, the company itself expects a lot for low pay. Over night stocking was amazing at the 24 hour stores. Was able to quickly stock & face the products on the aisle, as well as provide great customer service as well throughout the night."
good,"For the most part a lot of fun people to work with.  I would never go back to that type of business.  The training was really weak, but overall I enjoyed the job."
good,My feedback is based entirely on a part-time position. My part-time position did not offer any type of benefits. Overall Kroger is a good place to work.
good,I loved working with the public.  My co-workers were awesome to work with. I was always busy and the time went by pretty quickly. I did not care for the machines that liked to mess up at least once every other day.
good,"My job consisted of ordering milk, stalking the dairy department, and helping customers. Everyone working there was great. Managers didn't bother you if you got everything stocked."
good,I learned to be patient. I loved being able to help others. The hardest part was having to tell the elder people their insurance did not cover their RX.
good,"This was a short term job for me. I worked at the Starbucks counter. The pace of the job was usually fast during the mornings when everyone was coming by to get a coffee before work. This job can be stress at first, but once you remember how to make the drinks it's kind of relaxed."
good,"was on my feet all day, was timed on the items scanned per minute. learned a lot about the computers, helped customers with there needs. Management was great, had a great team to work with. hardest part was standing in one place for hours. Other employees was fun to work around."
good,Krogers is an okay workplace. If you can get managements to communicate with you. I had a good work place but I had to return to school and I could not get my hours changed to coincide with my school schedule.
good,"I've worked for Kroger three different times at two different locations and for the most part, it's been one of the better places I've worked. With many pro and cons, it's retail. However, it could be better benefits and training wise. While they do offer benefits, there is a lot of red tape in order to get them. If it's training you seek, it'll be infrequent and unorganized at best, but again it's retail."
good,I worked here while in school they were very flexible with my schedule so I could work. It would have been nice to know your pay would be better the more work history you list based on a point system.
good,"Being employed for Kroger has given me great opportunity to learn and grow in a high stressful fast paced world. I have worked with so many people employees and co workers, and have had many wonderful experiences with this company."
good,Good management but its a normal job in this industry. It doesn't pay well and customers can be very rude to you. But its a job and it could be much worse. The hardest part is the rude customers. Most employees are nice. A few aren't nd act like they are better than you but I think that's normal too. You have to learn to deal with stuff like that. Mostly its a decent place to work.
good,"Typically, the customer service desk is somewhat steady with an occasional ""interesting"" costumer. The management are fair and understanding, and its easy to build a relationship with them. The most enjoyable part is seeing the regular customers that always seems to brighten the day."
good,"I would always get 12 hours a week by the supervisors who made the schedule. I enjoyed that the let me pick the hours I could work each day. The management was great. There wasn't much room for advancement, however."
good,"Kroger is a great place to shop with many specials and a large variety of items to choose from. I worked here as a very young person so I can't really speak to the benefits, etc."
good,"Good place to work for a first job, easy, laid back, and good hours. flexible hours, easy to take time off, they are union based so that can be helpful for long time workers"
good,"Cart collection, Bottle return area machine cleaning, empting and troubleshooting. Trash collection. Bagging. Helping people carry groceries to their car. ETC."
good,I loved the job overall. It was fast paced and kept you really busy. I was a clicklist associate and my job was to take a trolley around the store taking product off the shelves that customers ordered online.
good,"I meet different people from different walk of life, it was a pleasant experience. I was responsible for taking customers grocery order and pick the items according to their specific needs."
good,"It was a nice enviroment. Clean place to work, nice people. Customers we're very friendly. Fast paced, paid every week. Days off u needed, u got them."
good,it was a fun place to work at overnight because you didn't have to deal with customers and you were able to play your own music while stocking the product.
good,"Great place to have a first job, work environment is friendly, they are in the union so you get brake time, overall not bad place to work, but they suck when it comes to hours being flexible"
good,"Always acknowledge and assisting customers, maintaining and clean the sales floors. seeking items that customers are looking for. marking down items.."
good,"Working at krogers is no different from other retail stores you are constantly dealing with customers everyday some are a nasty and some are nice, though thats not the tough part management is poor they do as much as they should to support the staff"
good,"There are times when the store is packed and it is stressful as well as times when you have a chance to relax and take your time to complete tasks. The people that I work with are enjoyable as well as the customers that I have met during my time here. This is definitely a great job for someone that is sociable. Of course not everyone will be pleasant but that comes with the territory as a customer service clerk. There are times when your patience will be tested but as long you have a great management team behind you, it will all be okay. If there is someone that would like to work their way up in the company to a more permanent position, it is definitely doable and may even be worthwhile but that is not something I am willing to do with this company."
good,"Good place to work. Management was ok. Customer service manager was wonderful."
good,"Working for Kroger is pressure filled.  It's extremely fast paced and you will never be ""caught up.""  But the leadership and management knows this, so they are very skilled at supporting the team to accomplish the work that's most urgent and to take care of eachother and the customers.  Kroger looks to be evolving the right way; so there is the possibility for roles to change or be eliminated, but it's growing overall so if you're a good worker and leader, there will always be room for you somewhere."
good,the environment here is great and so are the co--workers. everyone is really kind but if you're underage the management wouldn't really give you a chance. they'd think you're too young for the job and that would cloud their judgement.
good,Over all Kroger was a great place to work. The only reason i left was for a different job working on cars. I love working on cars and being a meat clerk just didn't feel like the right job for me at the time.
good,This is a good place to work overall if you are young. Advancement opportunities are limited but do come along every now and again. Lots of changes in the company
good,"Kroger's a good company to work for it has certain things that would distract you this warehouse It's a cold refrigerator, It's a fast paces, good earnings through company policies ."
good,"some shifts varied from 4-6 hours."
good,It is a good place of employment but the reason I quit is I got a better job offer that I got more hours.  In the job you get to deal with the public a lot.
good,"Had an awesome time working there, for the little time I spent! Co workers and managers were courteous, and friendly! Would love to go back someday, but with better position, salary, and hrs!"
good,Pay is decent with Full time status.  Some days have 10-12 hours of work that they expect for me to get done in my 7.5-8 hour shift and are not willing to give overtime.  Advancement feels more like who you know than how good of a worker you are for the company.  Currently work nights 10 pm - 6:30 am. Looking to come to days. Working nights is not all bad fewer customer and get more work done. Less management breathing down my neck making my job more difficult than it needs to be.  Kroger is a service industry and it feels like upper management is more worried about paper work than actually help the customer.
good,"i grew to enjoy the job, employees, customers and environment. I would have enjoyed staying with the company, there was a chance for advancement, healthcare for all employees regardless of hourly status."
good,Decent place to work  to start out could use annual raises for all positions make all positions full time and with benefits and paid time off better opportunities for advancement
good,"During the day, you can be faced with many different situations. Sometimes management is not always as present as it needs to be but overall it is a good place to work."
good,"People are good to work with, work is not to stressful,  pay is typical to retail.  Low and not much room for advancement!  Management is friendly and always thanks you for your work!"
good,"great place to work keeps you busy you deal with customers of all kinds, you cant get overtime unless they say so, you can easily get fired, make new friends"
good,"overall job was good, lack of management help, limited resources etc.. inconsistent hours during the week.  lack of family and work balance when it comes to needing time off."
good,The hardest part about this job was the pay. They start you off with such little pay. The job was rather easy. I enjoyed enteractin with the customers
good,"its been so long since I worked there."
good,"Great place to work as a teenager"
good,"Overall, I enjoyed going to work and there was the never the dreaded feeling of being forced to arrive.  The benefits definitely outweight the drawbacks,  I never felt apprehensive of continuing shopping at the same store as well."
good,"Very open to new to working individuals. You are taught what to do and everyone is helpful. As an overnight stocker, you have a peaceful environment as there are no customers at that time. It's a good place to work for someone who enjoys working independently."
good,I love Kroger company.  I Always help peoples to their car and make sure   they find what they need and alway welcome them back hope they keep shopping there i really miss kroger. i cut up fruits for them
good,"50+ hours a week, no consistent schedule. 1 weekend off a month. Pays good. And the opportunity for advancement is a strong possibility. district and division staff are annoying"
good,Not a bad company to work for. Only issue I have is pay. I have been with the company for 7 years and have 18 years experience but do not make 13 dollars a hour.
good,"A typical day is pretty fast past. Do to me working as cashier I learned certain coding, and customer service experience. It depends on the individual management on how you progress."
good,I worked at Kroger to get the experience of a bakery type atmosphere. Unfortunately my school did not at the time consider Kroger as a place to use for co-op. When my class schedule changed and I needed a co-op I had to leave.
good,I normally had a decent day. I would talk to customers fix problems. Cashier most of my time. I would help keep the front end going. Would clean messes.
good,"Depending on what time you have to work, you may encounter a lot of people or you may encounter a few. But you will always know the person you see because there are always 'regular' customers that come through. You are always learning something new either by a customer or a fellow co-workers. Management is ok, they get moved around every 1-2 years. But they all like to help and keep everybody happy. The culture is very diverse. And with help from management we engage in different from around the world. The hardest part would be remembering all of the different number codes of the fruits and vegetables. The most enjoyable part of working at Krogers is all the different people you get to meet and talk too."
good,"I enjoyed working for Kroger food company as a courtesy clerk, it was a nice place to work as a teenager with limited available time. The job was simple and low stress, if you were looking for an easy place to work part time, I recommend it."
good,"In my experience with working with Kroger is that they are very competitive with surveys and with fresh and friendly results and firm on set times for products. I feel with working in the bakery, there should be more than one baker at a time because of all of the product that needs baked and things that need to be set out by certain times. With management,  I feel like I can come to them about anything when I have an issue with something to do with work or about another coworker, and I feel that is important in a company."
good,"At the time, enjoy working for people with bagging and assisting customers in store.  Cleaning floors and returning items from grocery store. I do enjoy assisting customers with groceries during bagging groceries."
good,"Dillons is a decent place to work, giving plenty of opportunity. The management team works hard to help each individual. Most of the stress that comes with the job in my experience, comes in the form of coworkers. Most of them are not reliable during the shift and you should never expect a coworker to do something if you don't. To get out on time at night you have to stay on top of everything, even when your fellow workers aren't pulling there weight. All in all, the job moves fast and the management is great, just realize your coworkers tend to be base level, just as the job is."
good,"I never really had any kind of problems with working at King Soopers. It was fun, friendly, and I got paid well. The reason I left, was due to my hours being cut. Otherwise, it's a good place to work if you're more patient than not."
good,Was a fun fast paced work environment. Loved helpiing customers find what they needed and making the store pretty and organized. The customers were my favorite part though
good,Good company to work and get good experience from. I had the opportunity to travel as a relief floral manager which gave opportunities to learn different techniques from different stores. So my experience was good.
good,"The work here was easy, but if they get a good worker they tend to over use you. I started out bagging groceries for 7.50 an hour. They then trained me to run a cash register. They also trained me in 2 other departments of the store. No pay raise after being there a year."
good,"Working here has been fun but now I need to move on and find a career in mind. Weekly paychecks are really nice, but it doesn't change the fact it is still part time."
good,When everyone comes in to work it is a great environment. Sometimes managers try to cut the bottom line and save money by using you in multiple departments.
good,This was a good place to work when I was just getting out of high school and going to college. They will work around your school hours. Only downfall was seemed like there wasn't enough help when it was busy.
good,I enjoy working with all of the people in my department. It is a fast pace work environment and there is an overarching sense of accomplishment at the end of each work day. There are times that it slows down and there are times when it picks up which makes it hard to get one's job done efficiently.
good,Good place to work I love it and been there for years. But not a job that you stay at for the rest of your life. People can be a pain at times. But you will forever have good & bad days
good,"I learned more than I ever thought I would about produce working in the produce department. Training was information intensive and took about a whole 40 hour work week. Starting pay is low, but most higher positions are filled by existing employees."
good,"Retail is retail no matter where you are.  Kroger in comparison to other retailers did appear to have the upper hand in providing for their employees.  Had it not be for the unpredictable work hours, weekends, and holidays, I would go back to work for them in a part-time basis."
good,"Typical first job, expect much with little pay, great people no doubt, but very busy, stretched thin most of the time, and an over reliance on certain employees."
good,"Kroger work days vary depending on customer traffic. Well, rested days go smoothly, other wise they are lengthy and slow. The more traffic the better, in the customer service, focused environment. There's enough help but it is unlike comparable monster supermarket chains. There are the requests to stay over and to work the extra days. Short handed work can get very difficult as there is the constant call to customer service. People the are nice and the environment becomes familiar with time."
good,"Prepare to be flexible... most days will turn upside down if you don't have an A, B. and C plan for your day. Forget proper discipline for employees- multiple hoops to loose dead weight unless associates are within 60 days of employment."
good,"can advance, not enough time for real customer service; lots and lots of overtime available; good people to work with. management positions very stressful."
good,"The people I worked with were enjoyable to be around and if I needed assistance, they would gladly help me. I was always working efficiently and making sure things were tidy and done well. In the morning I would sometimes have to bake off bread, cookies, etc. and package them."
good,"Often times employee's would no-call/ no-show, leaving large amounts of work for other employee's. Often didn't order the right products and would over order on others."
good,"I thinking about reapplying. If Im considered for rehire, I will definitely be sure to inform them that I will be attending college full time. And by request, ask for a day time or evening schedule."
good,"While competitively I'd call the wages fair and on par, realistically they are asking a lot for very little reward. They have a habit of keeping employees that cause strife and resentment because they are reliable most of the time. Outside of those factors I would say that if you need a job to act as a safety net or to get you by they suffice, but staying here long term without a good Union contract will just not cut it for most people."
good,"This was one of my favorite jobs i had ever had. the problem was that my management team was not organized, unfortunately i left to early to realize they were all removed and now they have a good managable team"
good,"My experience working at Fred Meyers was short lived I actually wanted to pursue staying and working at reaching a good level of work ethic with the company, so don't let personal issues conflict with this job it will make your performance suffer big time. I learned a lot from working here how to fillet a fish-shuck crab etc. The management could work on being more of team players they will suck you dry of any good qualities that you have and expect you to put your best out there all the time when they aren't always there to back you up as they encourage to do. Workplace culture, everyone almost gets along with each other, the customers unfortunately can be the worst part of the job, no matter how rude we have to put them #1. The hardest part of the job I felt was customer satisfaction, and making sure you have super great time management skills which is required of course to complete tasks at any job, but the duties they lay at your feet sometimes doesn't match up to realistic expectations of the job itself such as the opening and closing procedures, and the sales quotas too can be a bit over the top. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing you made someone's day by helping them make a purchase or assist them on a order right on, and the whole day adding up to awesome perfection of giving the public what they want well, and representing what us hard working people do everyday on the job."
good,I worked at Kroger for 5 years as an associate manager. I would have stayed at Kroger if they would have paid more. They could have done much better than they did for wages.
good,met a lot of nice hardworking people interested in working for a company in which you could grow. Room for advancement great employee benefits and room for growth.
good,"A typical day at work shows up for me as working in my department is check morning emails, walk department to check for the missing product on shelves. Scan department to check for inventory on missing items. Replenish every hour on the hour for out of stocks as well as having presentable displays set up. communicate with managers on whats going on in the department... Scan department for product movement, secure items that need it that are priced 50.00 of more. attend our store daily huddle for any updates given by supervisors. Making sure department is well stock and order. Every day has different duties to be done and completed by the end of the day."
good,the hardest part of the job was standing on your feet.  I enjoyed working there.  Thoughtful and caring management team.  I would recommend this company to friends or family.
good,"Cutting Meat is a dangerous job, i worked for Kroger 2 times. the first time i was a cashier and the second time i was a meat wrapper /meat clerk. I liked the meat department better than the cashier position"
good,This company is okay but they take too much advantage of their employees but on the good hand they have really good insurance at really good benefits and you are good people there
good,My work is rewarding providing many challenging situations. My multitasking skills are challenged daily. I would like to see more possibilities for advancement to consider ClickList a long term position with a salary and benefits.
good,I loved having my job at Kroger. It was my first real job and taught me how to be more social. The managers are friendly to customers and just a delight to work with.
good,"Kroger was a good company to work for, flexible hours, start and end times were good, the people I worked with were awesome, fun job, loved coming to work, and learned a of valuable skills in the customer service world."
good,"I loved my job, loved most of my co-works, and adored all my customers. Unfortunately my manager made it to hostile of a work inviroment for me. She would ""stop by"" at 2am or 3am to see what I was doing (aka middle of my shift usually when I was eating lunch with no customers in the store) and always tore me down like I was worthless. I called in sick and she said if I was healthy enough to call I was healthy enough to work."
good,"Kroger is a great job to work at, starting off. The managers are friendly and very helpful. I loved customer service but decided to try out clicklist. I got very few hours in clicklist compared to customer service."
good,"Kroger is a good company to start with as a temporary job if you don't need too much money. They can work with you on hours and are generally flexible on the respect, but the pay just isn't enough unless you stay the for a few years and get a second job."
good,Kroger company is filled with a lot of great employees which in turn makes the buisiness a great place to work . The only bad that I ever noticed is that I had 3 bosses and they were never on the same page .
good,"Management can be good or bad, depending on who you get.  They mix it up quite a bit so you and other managers only stay at one store for about a year or two. The hardest part of the job is learning on the job and going with the flow.  The most enjoyable part of the job are the employees.  They are like family."
good,Really enjoyed working here. Productive workplace and the managers are really understanding. I wish they were more flexible with doctors notes and sick days.
good,"I come to work and bag a couple of groceries. Sometimes I use to cashier when they didn't have help."
good,"I have exhibited leadership skills that have not been tapped into at Kroger. I have not been compensated for my skills. This is a great company and I highly recommend it, but I need to stretch my legs and work for a company that is smaller and can recognize what their associates have to offer."
good,"A typical day at work would be to set up work station, assist customers to their liking ,and scan their groceries. I've learned to memorize a few codes for scanning on fruits and veggies. The management was always changing around and it was hard to have help.The workplace culture was very fast paced .The most enjoyable part of the job was more than likely lunchtime,because you had so much of a variety to chose from."
good,Pay is decent in the grocert dept. No work life balance tho. Cant write a schedule. Always have split days off. But for a grocery store its not bad. But ya
good,"Decent company to work, lots of career growth. I have learned he in's and out's of a grocery store. My communication and customer service skills have grown over the years thanks to Kroger!"
good,"When you work at King Soopers you do find a friendly work environment, but management is not as strong as you would expect to find. Overall is a good place to work."
good,Working at Kroger I have learned to work with others when situations get stressful. I would say that is my biggest take away. Days are pretty steady. I'm just ready to move forward in life.
good,"Great caring supervisor, bad pay but overall most co-workers are friendly and easy to get along with. I wish there was better opportunities for advancement. It would make life a lot easier"
good,Great job for beginner workers very easy tasks and learned how to adjust to people lifestyles management was fair to a certain extent and was never really hard enjoyed working with co workers
good,"Virtually every day is the same: fill/stock vegetables, check for freshness, assist customers. Management was tolerable, coworkers caused no significant problems."
good,"A new Kroger opened up in Athens, and we were hired and trained very diligently. The management would always make sure we know how to work the cashiers and any other things that would improve customer satisfaction. They are always ready to answer any question we had."
good,There was a well put together work plan. I learned to be more outgoing and friendly with customers and other employees. Had very little encounter with the management. The hardest part of working here were getting hours. The most enjoyable parts of this job were to meet a different person and be able to help them each and every day.
good,"Daily tasks are very simple and easy to complete. On busy days, work is usually up tempo. You are constantly working with a team and heavily relying on them to ensure that all of the tasks are completed before the store set time. The hardest part of the job is trying to catch up from being behind the previous day. However, the most enjoyable part of the job is that Kroger will hold different events to appreciate employees and their hard work."
good,it's a great place to work when you are just starting out and need a job but don't plan on moving up in any way because you can't nor can you get full time they only have part timers and only hire for part time.
good,I worked many areas in Fred Meyer before they were named Kroger. Advancement was easy for hard workers. Education was not necessary. Retail is not the best place for life balance.
good,Kroger isn't a bad place to work. The only downfall is the pay. It is good for younger people who don't have a family to support. Coworkers are typically nice and helpful. The schedule can be annoying at times though.
good,worked there  a week shy of 5 years.....management  was moody and didn't care about  workers wanting to be there.  the fellow works were amazing minus supervisors
good,As a manager there is a lot of metrics to keep up with.  Has a great diverse culture and the department managers are awesome and take pride in their work...which makes it a pleasure to work with them and do your job.
good,"I enjoyed working here, the work was somewhat fast paced but you could still keep up easily, the people I worked with were amazing but it took the managers awhile to do anything but overall id work here again."
good,"Kroger was a good job to work especially if someone is in school. the job is very flexible, the employees are great, and i really enjoyed serving the customers. There could be some improvements with choosing who should be management. I believe the hourly rate should increase."
good,"a typical day at work is very busy with filling scripts and taking care of the patients it is a interesting place to work but can be difficult at times. the most difficult part about the job is getting to the root cause of why some insurance companies will not pay for certain kinds of medications... The most enjoyable part of the job is the patients they are so wonderful, when you get to know them and can ask how certain people in their lives are doing and they tell you how their vacations were that is the most enjoyable part to gain their trust and ta relationship with them. We have some of the most caring friendly people that come to get their scripts from us and it is so rewarding."
good,Overall nice place to work if you enjoy very fast paced environment with virtually no work life balance. Management is always on the job even if they are not physically present. Lots of chances for advancement and very smart and dedicated top leadership.
good,"Great people, managers so so. no latest tools no life balance at home. some training is available, its mostly what you know already, it can be challenging."
good,"Fun environment to work in, other employees are extremely friendly and helpful, the pay is competitive and you get usually as many hours as you would like. Can be fast paced and very stressful at times when the store is busy though."
good,"Greeting customers and assist them finding what they are looking for"
good,"Kroger is a really good place to work part-time. They are very flexible with their scheduling and work really hard to to put their employees in areas where they can succeed. However, full-tie employees don't make much more than part-time employees."
good,"This is a great place for a first job, especially for younger students or kids in high school. "
good,"Had a lot of fun at Tom Thumb, hard to say anything bad about it other then the fact they would only scheduled me for 2 hours a day when it was really busy then let me go when the rush was over, I get that I have a higher scan rate then most of the other working at that time but I don't appreciate being used like that, if I'm being called in I want to work my full shift and even more."
good,I like working at Krogers I am just looking for more  opportunities . I have been working at Krogers for 6 months I don't want to give up my job but I just need more hours.
good,"If you're surrounded by people who don't want to work, of course you're going to have a bad time. Sadly, there's a lot of people here who are like that. There's also the people who aren't though."
good,"I have been in my current role as ASM, for the past 7 years and I have grown my skill set in operational management in a big box retail setting. The wealth of knowledge has prepared me to be marketable and a key assets for any company I choose to work for."
good,this place was very welcoming to all races or beliefs kept very clean & very professional when you arrive you will be greeted at the door with a smile
good,great customers and face paced. hardest part the job is making sure the customer is getting the right order. Making sure the food is cooked properly and has the right temp.
good,Working for Kroger taught me a lot of information. It is a great place to move up but eventually you start to realize things are always as good as they seem. A lot of betrayal and gossiping goes on here and i dont think it is a great enviroment to progress.
good,"I think many of their policies are arbitrary, which is ultimately why I left. "
good,This establishment is a very productive work environment the workers and staff are very professional and respectful. i have gained skill and learned no techniques
good,"a typical day at work would be attending the register at the liquor department. I would also stock the shelves, and deal with customer service. I maintained a safe and clean work environment."
good,"I thought the work life balance was very nice and enabled remote work opportunities.  Working in the office was enjoyable and fun, interacting with co-workers."
good,"Overall, Kroger is a good company to work for. I have been there for almost 4 years and am only at .90 above minimum wage. I don't feel there is enough recognition of hard working employee's or any merit increase options. There should be an employee of month or quarter to recognize Kroger's star employee's that contribute the most to the success of the company. Kroger does offer a discount program of Kroger brand items of 10% which is nice. The management staff and co workers have a good team player attitude and work hard to get things done. We have always struggled with getting all the things done by end of shift due to short staff for each shift. If there was enough staff to handle the work flow, the team attitude would greatly increase. This along with a better wage for the hard work that is needed to get things done, would boost morale. Happy employee's make happy customer's."
good,"horrible pay, liked my co workers, high turner over, learned a lot about inventory..had a good relationship with management, and customers service...."
good,It is the busiest company in the county. Constant work. Managers don't care too much about the employees under them. Hard to get fired unless you're really trying to be.
good,I worked there for a year and a half and I met a lot of new faces and customers and I got along with every single one of them. The employees worked as a team. The managers keep changing a lot of things around like do this and do that and we've all tried.
good,"Management, since day one, have been extremely friendly and helpful in anyway possible or necessary.  All employees get along very well together and make the work days go fast because you can actually enjoy yourself."
good,It was a very tough job to do. There were very long hours to work and you work very hard but the work was rewarding. If you are able to work long days then it pays off.
good,"It's a great place to begin your work life, there are many nice associates there. The atmosphere can get quite uneasy at times mostly because of location."
good,"There was always work to do if you are motivated.  On the job training was sufficient,  customer service was the priority.  Classes were available  for Certification provided by the company."
good,"Management is some what rude at Benton location. Its hard for them to understand a lot of things. Other than that, the store is neat, organized, and majority of the associates are friendly with good attitudes. Great place to shop."
good,Working on the front end is a very stressful place to work. The managers expect a lot from the front end supervisors and aren't always the nicest people about it.
good,"When i worked at Kroger's,it taught me how to be more confident with myself and how to deal with customer's bad moods. It also taught me to deal with harder situations than i had experienced in previous jobs."
good,"I loved the job itself. meeting new faces, seeing diversity, and awesome coworkers. sometimes I was treated unfairly, but something was always done about it."
good,"I find I my job actually stressful at times, but I love my fellow associates. Overall we respect each other and help in each in need. I feel like I can be myself and remain professional. It stressful when I get angry costumers or I make a mistake or the same mistake again. Sometimes it's also stressful when management does not respect or sometimes not appreciate other associates."
good,"A typical day at work will consist primarily of the basic bagging and cashiering services offered at Kroger. Occasionally, I will grab carts, do bathroom logs, watch self checkout and even supervise depending on what the schedule has me doing that day."
good,Kroger was a fun place to work and meet new people.I enjoyed the environment and the co workers. My hours allowed me to be at home with my children which I loved.
good,"store employed was amazing to work with, however management had poor attitude at times, but very good towards customers this store is more of a satisfied customer service type of retail store"
good,"Although it can heavily depend on who's working around you, it's honestly what you make it. The monetary benefits aren't that amazing but the work itself is actually pretty fun (at least in my own personal opinion)"
good,"Laid back environment"
good,Was very great expletive. Met lots of great people. the job came with great benefits. Wish they would've had better hours. Unfair pay for so much work.
good,I was six months pregnant and some managemnet wasn't abiding by doctors orders of what I could lift and pull. My doctor recommended for the safety of my baby I quit
good,Work is constant and makes day go by quickly.A lot of good happy people to work along side with. Willing to help any way they can and will stand by you when it is needed.
good,"I loved this location!!! The management was great! I enjoyed the friendly atmosphere and would recommend anyone to work for Kroger's, its was a pleasure working for this company. Did i mention they have a UNION!!!"
good,"Kroger is a great company for high school and college student who need a flexible schedule to suit their schooling and other activities.  The pay is as close to minimum wage as they can realistically offer, but you will likely be able to get enough hours in to cover food and some personal spending.  Managers can range from friendly and flexible to harsh and old-fashioned depending on where you work.  I would solely recommend working at Kroger if you need a part-time job immediately, and do not expect to be making much or fully enjoying your work."
good,Kroger's overall is a good place to work but after the first three weeks they barely gave me any hours and on top of that i was getting paid minimum wage so I wasn't making as much money as I would like especially with 4 hour shifts.
good,While working at Kroger there was never a dull day. I got to enjoy the company of the numerous customers that came in and out of the store. I had a great relationship with management and completed all assigned tasks of mine then helped pick up lack if there was any. Overall it was a productive and fulfilling job.
good,great people. positive environment.low pay. decent hours. great to start as a teen or good after retirement. management changed a lot that was frustrating.
good,At kroger my day would change from day to day. Sometimes i would just bag groceries for custermers other days i would stock shelves. I learned the proper way to stock the shelves while i was employed at Kroger.
good,"A typical day started with collecting the work that needed to be accomplished from the customer and then distributing work accordingly to employees. Daily spreadsheets were used to collect data and pay employees. The hardest part of the job is having to accomodate the needs of our client on the fly while still maintaining steady work flow of daily operations. The most enjoyable part about the was when the work was finished I was permitted to leave, so hard work paid off"
good,"Fast  past Oriented.  Kroger is a really good place for people just getting into the work force, or if you have been in customer service for a long period of time."
good,This was s boring job . I was in the apparel department all we did was clean and condition most of the time when we didn't have trucks to unload . I love dealing with new people everyday .
good,"I enjoy working at Kroger.  There is great customer interaction and you have a great opportunity to exceed the customer's expectations.  I appreciate the hard work these people put in to make a great experience for their customers.  Management is outgoing and usually lend a hand if needed.  The hardest part of the job for me is standing on my feet for 8 hours.  I have had too many desk jobs recently!  To me it is enjoyable to put in a good day's work, make the customers happy and make the management happy."
good,"The management team was horrible."
good,fast paced job. learned customer service and the management is nice. the culture depends on the people. the hardest part is where the inconsistent hours.
good,My customer service skills really blossomed here. My main goal in this job was to focus on the customers and making them happy. I learned how to balance many different tasks at once while maintaining a customer-friendly attitude.
good,"Straight forward; you clock in, work, get a break, and then leave. The only problems that arise are when upper management gets over-barring or is not helpful during influx of customers. But overall a good experience."
good,Very laid back place to work. You may have problems getting management to work with your school schedule. Pay is low but it is a easy job and doesnt require much thought.
good,"I enjoy working at Kroger because it is a great experience and everyone is extremely nice. "
good,You learn a lot about receiving freight and scanning to make sure balances are correct. Keep shelves stocked while helping customers. It can be stressful at times when people don't come in when they are scheduled. It is hard to have a set day off to care for personal matters. It can also be hard sometimes to get a specific day off to care for personal matters. It is also hard to get into a full time position.
good,Great opportunities to grow. You get to meet great people but salaries are low so rotate index is pretty hight. Low job culture because people don't seems to be happy
good,"Handling front desk, returns clearing draws, training new team members, occasional cashier. I appreciate this for being the first job I applied for. The hardest part of this job were disgruntled customers"
good,"I loved this job, and only left to continue my college education. Ot was enjoyable for me to serve customers and employees alike, and I was great at doing payroll, schedules, and sale price/tag changes as a lead file clerk."
good,"For my first job, I loved this place. Employees got along great and it was a fun environment, but some managers where rude and picked favorites and after awhile they started hiring too many people and hours where being cut."
good,"A typical day at work was like any day at a pharmacy, very chaotic at times also very satisfying. I was able to learn very fast and Pharmacist I had the pleasure to work with had been in the business for quite sometime which helped me learn how to deal with certain situations differently as opposed to working with Pharmacist who hadn't been in the business for long. It was a good, interesting thing. Management was very helpful as in all my other jobs always there when needed. Again behaviors and attitudes, values of each and every individual differ which made it an unforgettable experience and taught us a lot about each other and how to get along and work better side by side. The hardest part of the job was it was a very high volume pharmacy and it was only the pharmacist and I on duty which in all honesty gave us no time for not even a restroom break. Most enjoyable part of the job for me was helping people and the great people I got to work with."
good,"Stock: grocery department when needed"
good,i worked in the deli department. its a nice paced job. i personally wasn't the biggest fan just becaused being promoted in any way is 100% based off of seniority. it didn't matter how hard i worked i was in a long list of lower end seniority for a promotion. otherwise its an amazing job and eventually there's great opportunity to grow. great health coverage plans and 401K.
good,Started my work day in the fuel center.  I operated the fuel center by myself for the entire shift.  The hardest part of the job was to manage the customer's and the store at the same time due to being the only person there to have to take care of everything.
good,"A typical day at work includes data entry, product dispensing, customer interaction, and basic upkeep of store (cleaning, filing, etc)"
good,Very rewarding if you are a people person. Long days and very little work life balance. High stress and constant. Too many hands in the pot. Many mixed communications from the top down.
good,"I started with Kroger as a courtesy clerk in one location, then transferred to another location as a customer service specialist. It was a good first job and I'm grateful for the experience, but not something I would want to do long term. Co-workers were helpful and friendly, management was okay for the most part. Kroger as a company is not my favorite, with the opening of the second location I worked at they made a lot of promises to us all they were not able to keep. But as individual stores, it is not a bad experience at all and gives you lots of ways to boost your resume and practice your customer service skills. My largest problem was not being paid like the cashiers, even though I cashiered almost every shift. But overall, it was a good company. They gave me time off when needed, and were very kind about handling my sick days. I got every Sunday off and they really worked around my school schedule."
good,"Good place to work for part time job, managers were really nice, team work is shown. Managers work with scheduling and offer more hours if wanted."
good,I liked working there due to being around different people dad to day was different not a rut job(not repeating same task everyday). Made good money. Learned more about being employed by a big corporate company.
good,"Coworkers were friendly and helpful. Depending on the department, management would either be helpful and friendly, or uneducated on your jobs needs. The store is decently understaffed, so expect non-flexible hours."
good,Kroger is a great opportunity for entry-level workers looking to gain experience because they are opportunities for advancement.
good,Love it.... need more hours and employees.   Enjoy the customers..... I enjoy cooking....they love my chicken.   Kroger is very strict on some things but I like it
good,Great place for high school and college students to work.  Very flexible hours that work around your school schedule.  This would be a great part time job as well
good,I enjoyed the job.  The only reason that I left was because I had a second job and I couldn't manage both jobs and needs of my Diabetic Daughter.
good,is a great first job! great people to work with and they are pretty flexible with your schedule! the managers make sure your schedule fits what is going on in your life and makes sure your satisfied!
good,"Meet a lot of new people, make a lot of friends. You have to stand up for long periods of time and have very short breaks. Discounts on food and store items is very useful and schedules are flexible"
good,The Job was great for a starter in highschool or as a part time job. Low pay and weird hours kind of put me off. Especially the fact you have to have been there 7 years to gain full time employment.
good,It was a great job to start doing just to get started and get some experience and to get a ok paycheck for the time being. Management was good but sometimes the customers could be a little rude.
good,"Oversee the deli department and make sure day to day operations run smooth."
good,"I liked my coworkers and managers, although the process for some things was ridiculous. Hours and days off were unpredictable, but flexible when time off was needed."
good,Job was straight forward and the expectations for each employee were made very clear. The most enjoyable part of the job was the independence and the fact that each shift was accompanied with a set goal for each employee.
good,I have grown a relationship with other employees at the Company that it is an enjoyable place to walk in and see faces. I enjoyed going to work there.
good,great place to work if you don't mind the hours. Employees can have a nice career at Kroger if you work hard. must be willing to relocate.
good,"Kroger is great for people who do not need hours or money. However, if one desperately needs money or hours to pay big bills, do not work here. The work is good, easy, and fast-paced. "
good,"The CEO needs to get a new HR President. He's the first one to tell you that you matter and he cares, but when asked to increase the pay of supervisors to more than what he pays new associates, he refused."
good,"The staff is really nice and fun , and the customers are to , it just that management are disorganized , and that the hours are bad and  pay also. But overall the store is a good place to work at."
good,I enjoyed working with my customers and making there shopping an easy one. I enjoyed seeing the same customers return to the store again. The co-workers were very friendly and helpful my first week.
good,"I am a cashier and it's a good job of you are a people person, you get to acknowledge customers and talk to them, only thing I could say the company needs to work on is giving employees more break times and more pay, I like the job so far, but with only 15 minute break for 6 hours, sometimes it can get overwhelming, which I work at a busy store, and think we should get paid more for all the hard work we do there. But good company to work for a benefits after 8 months of employment and advancement opportunities"
good,"I usually would clock in 7 minutes early and begin working before my shift technically started and would usually clock out 7 minutes after my shift ended.  I worked with customers on insurance issues and also worked the register when a customer needed to pick up a prescription."
good,Overall I was trying to move forward with my career. Company was going in opposite directions. Wanted to grow within company. Didn't see that happening.also needed to better myself for the upcoming years.I wasn't excelling forward. Standing still after 20 years of dedicated service.
good,"The company itself is not a bad company to work for. Your opinion will most likely depend on, if you like the people you work with and based on how its managed."
good,"Kroger is a work place that you will a lot of things you may have not known before. When i started working there i wasn't sure if i would like working there but it turned out o be an okay working environment. Kroger can be entertaining because of the all of my co-workers. We have this saying ""no matter how boring and how much you don't want to be here you have to make it fun"". with that saying it makes coming to work no so bad."
good,"It started off being a great place to work, but as time went on upper management has gone down hill in a bad way. I have always loved working with food, it is all I know. But the wrong place/places will tear that passion down."
good,A typical day is just me putting object into the self and sorting things off the truck. The problem is that the truck is huge and out of the 8 workers only 3 are being productive. But if you need job security with benefits and and minimal wage with no change of advancing this is the place for you.
good,"Working at Kroger was an extremely new and also flexible job for me during my tenure. Juggling being a full time student, and playing baseball Kroger was exactly what i needed to maintain funds while both being a student and athlete."
good,Enjoyed working there. Was given autonomy in the dispatch of my duties. Very typical office environment. The drive was too far given the salary for me.
good,"Kroger pays minimum wage, but it is a low- key environment. It is flexible with schedules. The only problem is management and the intensity of customers in the store which can correlate."
good,"I've worked there a good while and loved it, I had great coworkers and our customers were always highly satisfied. I never missed a day of work they always depended on me to get the job done I guess I was they go to guy but I enjoyed it"
good,I would recommend working at kroger as a cashier or front end emplyee. Depending on the store you could have the same management team for your career there or have a different manager every month. Though that tends to be the only down side or complaint.
good,Worked with great co-workers had some good management but also had terrible management has well. Pay wasn't great job was easy but tiring when short handed.
good,"Horrible hours and very strenuous work. No time at home and when you are off you are to tired to do anything. Plus mandated days, you have to go into work instead of having your weekend."
good,"I enjoy the work, stay busy and learning from someone who has been there for many years.  The people are nice. I have only been there for a few days, the job is demanding, being on your feet all the time, but I just need to get use to that kind of physical issue."
good,Kroger is a good company to work for.  Management always willing to work with their employees with different situations.  Management is always understanding.
good,"A typical day includes completing reports, attending to questions and situations which arise, managing time and tasks in accordance with calendar."
good,"I worked anywhere between 30-35 hours per week and the hours were very unpredictable, though i usually worked as the closing shift cashier from 3pm-11pm. I learned a great deal about stocking and arranging shelves and displays, as well as excellent customer service skills. The managers at this job were always very kind and understanding and they did a great job of integrating me into the team. The hardest part of the job was learning all of the different tobacco products, but the most enjopyable part was the friendly staff and management."
good,"Awesome work environment, although that is not true for every pharmacy you go to I got lucky. In my experience supervisors will acknowledge the extra work you do for them and will work with you if you need a special request. Pay is competitive considering the position. Average workday was face paced and you spent all day on your feet."
good,I work with Kroger and enjoyed helping people get the products they want with care.  A job here is a fine way to learn about customer service.
good,"I enjoyed working with the customers and helping them when needed. Even though most days were steady paced, the majority of the other employees were great team players. So although I was pretty tired most days after work I was not in too bad of a mood thanks to my fellow co-workers."
good,"A typical day here was slow, When i would get into work half of my duties where already done leaving me to try to find other things that needed to be done."
good,Kroger is a great place to work as long as you don't need full-time.  Your co-workers are great and the hours are flexible.
good,Kroger always provided time for all part time associatesd to spend with their families and adjust schedules for school and other activities
good,"Everyday is great. The people i work with are great. The job its self is not hard. The wage that i get paid is what i think a high school kid should be paid, not a mother of 6 kids."
good,I was to make sure the sales floor was fresh and full for the customers. Also to help anyone who needed assistance in a timely matter.
good,"Working at Kroger was relatively easy however when working as a barista, at least in my experience it did not provide ample training in order to accurately perform the job."
good,"If you can handle it. Customer service skills necessary and the customers themselves made that very easy. All in all just listen to their needs and the job does itself. Must be flexible and fast paced. The only problem I and many others had was the management. They have goals to take care of the associates, but in every store the case has always been the same. They were more focused on the production of the store rather than the employees well being, many were also gossipers and talked badly about associates to other associates, making morale levels plummet. There were favorites getting special treatment in all areas of the store. Very unbalanced, and very tough to go on about your day if your goal every day was to go to work and avoid getting drug through drama."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is my coworkers, it is not easy to keep pace with the company requirements, but when you are part of a great team it makes anything possible.  The expectations from division staff are frequently unreasonable, but when these goals are failed to achieve, the manager may or may not understand depending on what level they work at.  Middle management seems to understand what goes on at the store level, but the pressure from above leads them to not really care."
good,"A typical day at work would be considerably busy. It would include a store that makes a lot of money in sales caused by a large amount of customers. The management as a whole is great. The majority of my coworkers are great team players, but there are always some that do not do their job. The most enjoyable part of work is dealing with the happy to be here customers that always have a smile upon their faces."
good,"Typical day was always interacting with customer's and co-workers."
good,"I think kroger is one of the better grocery stores you can work for if you want to get into the meat and seafood trade. Good health insurance. I've had some issues with some of the people i've worked with at more than one location, but never an entire staff. I got transferred and told i was being trained as a seafood lead, but no one ever showed me all of the tasks even after asking each day. That was my biggest issue i had with them. Other than that fair company overall."
good,"I enjoyed working for Kroger. Coworkers were always enjoyable to work with, a nice work environment. As a customer service oriented person I enjoyed talking with the customers, interacting with them to ensure they got the service they needed."
good,"Typical grocery job with customer service required. Great team at my store in Springfield, OH. Not fast paced unless store is busy, you feel a sense of accomplishment at the end of the day."
good,Working at a grocery store is generally fast paced. I started as a cashier and was quickly promoted over my time there. I went from cashier to self-checkout attendant to service desk coordinator and trainer to a shift leader by the time I had to leave. If it wasn't for the promotion my husband received causing our family to move out of state I am positive I would still be there.
good,"as long as you're a good hard worker and dedicated to completing tasks, this job is easy. fun atmosphere to be around very polite and friends employees"
good,overall good place to work.  Management lacking but improving.  Recently went through Lean Manufacturing transistion
good,"Management was good, but lacking at times when needed most, typical day at work required me to operate a cash register all day"
good,Fast paced work environment with a very diverse clientele that provide challenges every day to make each day interesting.
good,Good first job hired on the spot. Employed by job for several years an still employed till this day. learned leadership an how to take over my ow postion.
good,I learned how to block out complaining from other co-workers. Learned skills for co-worker relationships. I feel I'm underpaid for the work I do. And should be compensated for it.
good,A typical day at work was busy and fast paced but my coworkers and the customers were fun to be around. I learned how to handle customers in all situations and how to balance having a good time  but getting my work done. The management was very strict but we got along well and my coworkers and I were like a family I dont work there anymore and I'm still in contact with them. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers getting to meet them and putting a smile on their face.
good,"Typical day incudes baking bread, cookies, pastries, and decorating cake. I learned how to make some great desserts and bread products. My management was subpar, but my co workers made coming to work worth it. Nothing was too hard and most parts of my day were enjoyable."
good,"Typical day was cleaning"
good,Management does not know how to make you feel good about your job or progress; co-workers are great.  Most enjoyable part of job is going home.
good,Awesome place to work for they help shape you into hard working employees. You come to work ready for the day and enjoying the day as it goes by.
good,Nice  place to work good wage with a lot of employee benefits the most enjoyable thing about publix is probably the co-workers and customers. Looking to make a career in the company and move up probably the best  place to do so. Though i cant say this for every store management was lacking and many co-worker ended up  leaving because  of it
good,I have spent the 3 years with Krogers and put in a lot of time with the customers. That was the best part of this job. and sad to say its time for me retire. Time to enjoy life.
good,When i started working for the kroger company it was one of my favorite experiences. the work environment is friendly and safe. the pay wasn't to bad from the start. I would recommend anyone to work there. they are a very respectable company.
good,"normal grocery store environment"
good,"The typical day at kroger can vary. On certain times it can be slow but later on the day it can be pick up usually on the evening, the weekends mainly Sunday can be the most busiest as well for the holidays. Some customers can be polite some can be disrespectful depending on their mood, attitude, and the service. What I learn is be more responsible, greet customers and listen to their needs, keep the store and products and great condition, assist customers or co-workers if need, and stay focus even if the day is not going well. The management is doing a good job some are fair to the workers and customers. The management expects to see everyone with great results with their work ethnic and skills to keep the customers to come back with open arms. Although their are some rules in the management i disagree with but i continue to complete my duties and and assist. Some of my co-workers are friendly, responsible, hard working, disciplined, and caring. I develop good relationships with some of my co workers on and off work and some are a good pleasure to work with. There are some co-workers that don't follow the rules and don't get along with some of the staff but i won't let it distract me from my duties.The hardest part of kroger is dealing with some of the customers some may be nice some may not be depending on their mood, gathering carts while the there are small amount of carts in the store depending on the busy hour or some of the co-workers not putting an effort to bring the carts inside, finding some of the items that are discontinue from the store or the changing of the price"
good,"I always arrive at work at least fifteen to thirty minutes early which gives me time go around say hello to fellow co-workers and help customers. Once it's time to clock in I clock in promptly five minutes early and when I do i get straight to work ringing out customers with a smile on my face a pep in my step. I like to get to know my customers and make them feel comfortable which is what I do not only to make them feel good but myself as well. After three to four hours i get a fifteen minute brake. Then when my break is over it's back to work until it is time to go, and that's my typical day at Kroger!"
good,"This job is pretty laid back, but it does involve a lot of walking, standing, and bending over. Usually your in super early, but the quicker you finish placing the products on the shift that day your good to go. Sometimes if your super fast and finish all your sets for the week in like the first two days, you get the rest of the week off. Great supervisors and it helps if you have one other person to share the load with sometimes."
good,"From the time you clock in until the time you clock out, you are always on your feet and the fun part is meeting new people everyday."
good,"Kroger is very busy in the pharmacy, It can sometimes be overwhelming and you really have to be mentally prepared to work as soon as you walk in the door."
good,"Alot of training and growth opportunities"
good,"My typical day was first and foremost customer service and sales.  Although I enjoyed that very much my responsibilities as manager included inventory control, recruiting of staff, balancing P&L statements, scheduling, performance reviews, etc.  My staff would consider me as positive yet consistent with my expectations.  As manager the buck always stopped with me.  I was always the one who had to ultimately handle all end result issues with in the store, whether it be customers, employees, or maintenance.  I learned to delegate with all of those responsibilities.  My biggest difficulties were employees who would bicker amongst themselves because they did things differently from one another.  Also difficult was the fact that the company kept sending me to manage stores many miles away from my home in Sun Prairie.  Success in achieving all goals that were set by the company was probably the most enjoyable part.  Everyone likes to succeed!"
good,"The culture is much better than most other call centers. As far as call center work goes, this is probably as good as it gets."
good,"A day at Kroger's was first  clocking in and getting instructions from floor supervisor. Second checking the workstations making sure they were clean ,empting out the trash ,restocking bags, and also making sure they had cleaning products under the counter.Third  clearing and taking putting items left at a station in a cart for go backs . Fourth fixing shelves by cashiers . If customers came stopping and attended to the customers needs. Such as bagging items ,getting an item or changing an item or price checks. If they need help do a carryout to their car. While I was out bring in carts and continue to help customers to the end of my day. The mangers was helpful and friendly .My co-workers were nice and helpful people. The hardest part of the job the weather being out on cloud rainy days or very hot days. .The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers."
good,You have to wear many hats working for this company. Most of the time it is a good atmosphere but everywhere has its days. Upper management is not always on the same page which causes confusion for the rest of the associates.
good,"*I learned so much, from this company, about how a business operates and how to interact with people.  I didn't just learn aspects of the job, I learned about people and what drives them."
good,My days at work involve preparing for the night rush. Getting the things i need to make and serve the customers. After the night rush i have to shut my area down for cleaning and prepare to close. at close i clean and sanitize the area i used and restock what will be needed for the morning shift.
good,"Fun place to work, but have to work weekend and holidays. There's not a set schedule it's different every week. Everyone is so friendly and its like a big family."
good,"At Kroger, be prepared to get your feet wet in many different positions. I started as a cashier, but sometimes had to also be a bagger, customer service agent, etc. I later received a promotion as a Supervisor of the front end. That was nice. The hardest part of the job was when the store got crowded and no breaks could be taken. The most enjoyable part was talking to the customers and showing them great customer service."
good,"Being a stocker is an easy job, provided your willing to learn very basic skills needed to complete the days work. You show up work, unload pallets off of a truck, organize pallets into aisles if needed, then put stock on the shelf - extremely easy."
good,"Good experience but no room for advancement "
good,I began my work career with Kroger.  I accelerated quickly and really loved my job here.  Kroger had great benefits and over all really great management structure
good,"A typical day as a general merchandising assistant manager involves constant engagement with co-workers and customers.  Key-retailing is a crucial component that drives overall success of the company.  I have to order, process, organize, and display our inventory in an organized and timely manner."
good,"I shop at the Kroger store in North Myrtle Beach. As a retiree with a great pedigree I work for expensive dog food for my babies 2 Poms."
good,As I started working here(kroger) I had to get addjusted to their way of operrating things. Store goods to the management was always a busy operation. From filling one area to answering some ones question. I found out that the back end of the store wasnt the same as the front. Collectively tho it all was a sucsess(sp). I started out as a clerk then was moved to being a bagger. This gave me front and back end of the store reconition.
good,"Working at Kroger is relatively easy. The management is decent and they are very good at working around a schedule. Overall, a nice place to work at but it isn't what I'm interested in a career path for."
good,Fun environment. Management was great to talk too. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to customers. My co workers we're very helpful.
good,"Just like any other day you go in trying to make sure the customer leaves pleased. I did appreciate the people, when I first started people were extremely friendly and welcoming. Over time we got different management and they liked to play favorites at times. Which, of course, happens wherever you go. It was just a tab bit surprising there because the previous supervisors and managers were strictly professional. They would look at your work ethic not how much both of you had in common"
good,"Kroger is great to work for. The only thing is, they start you off part time and it's hard advancing to full time even if you know how to do everything."
good,"When I began work with the Kroger company in 1987, much of the daily operations of the corporate data center was a manual process.  Through advancements in technology and communications, they were able to eventually utilize robotics for the mundane operations tasks.  They also were using satellite communications to communicate in real time to the many stores and marketing areas across the nation.  "
good,"typically a good place to work, great environment and usually good co-workers.paid breaks, really understanding with school and family issues."
good,The people that we worked with were very helpful and always looking out for everyone else. The training was always very detailed no matter what the position was.
good,"The job was not very stressful. I worked produce which I believe to be the easiest job there. The benefits and pay were not very good but the responsibility and stress were very low. Overall, I was satisfied with working here, but I also went to school at the same time. Management was very understanding about the importance of school."
good,"Working for Krogers company taught me a lot about responsibility. A typical day there was of course making sure all customers were satisfied, but also how to maintain an enjoyable and well organized store. I learned how to be more attentive especially when handling customers money. I also new and efficient ways when approaching customers as well as making them feel appreciated. Management wasn't always as organized as should be, However, I did enjoy the relationships I built with most of the co-workers. I must say that the hardest of the job was pushing carts in the winter time so really being an emboli there isn't bad at all. The most enjoyable part of the job is that your voice matters, and everyone is appreciated."
good,"Ok place to work if just starting a job, for it opens up other doors for you starting at Kroger. You can advance to Mgt positions when they become open. Their is much standing working at Kroger but it can be an ok place to work."
good,At my Kroger my staff there is awesome! we all have each others backs and we stick up for each other. that's what I love about my job
good,Each shift is pretty steady. Kroger is a good place to for. Good Management team. Good Co-workers that are willing to help. Hardest part of the job advancing to the next level. The most enjoyable part of the job is the gaining of new knowledge every shift.
good,"This was a part time job to earn money between classes that really involved strength over knowledge. I would carry boxes of merchandise for co workers who could not lift certain amounts of weight. The contribution to SKU understandings and spot count regulations, made it clear that retail can be controlled freely while still being run in a smooth, clock like fashion. The amount of resources gained from working there would help me later in other retail and customer service jobs."
good,"krogers was a good place to work, the co-workers was welcoming, i learned stocking skills, nothing was hard about the job, the most enjoyable part of the job was the amazing co-workers i worked with."
good,It is an okay place to work if you're looking for a job. Since most people are eligible for benefits when you are full time they try to keep most people's hours under 32/week. This is a very busy place so you don't have to worry about standing too long with nothing to do. They do accommodate for different schedule changes if you tell them early enough. Your schedule changes a lot too so you have to be flexible unless you have a very good reason why.
good,"Clock in around 4am, unload truck, set produce department, keep customers happy. Loved my co-workers. Very laid back."
good,"Assist and greet customers with any questions, check- out groceries for customers and receive various forms of payments."
good,"sliced meats and cheese per order, made and prepped salads for the day, took care of inventory, dated the meats and cheese, customer service and rang up special orders."
good,"Kroger usually seems to let its pharmacists run the pharmacies, unlike some retail pharmacy chains. It usually leads to better streamlining of work, so while it's always busy and rush hour is still rush hour, it's not terribly chaotic."
good,Over all a great company to work for. I've never had any problems. Other workers are very helpful and very polite. Normally the least I will work is three nights a week. They are very understanding.
good,Good company to work for but pay is low.  Lots of part time employees - little room to grow or develop skills or move into management.
good,"A typical day at work includes management being jerks but that's the worst part, in my opinion. In addition, it is difficult to advance your way up the ladder because management plays favorites to butt kissers. Co-workers are not bad."
good,"A typical day of work involved stocking and prepping produce, marking down items, and helping costumers with any questions they have.  I learned ways to improve on helping customers as well as some of the technology involved in the grocery business.  Management was good about letting the workers know what they wanted and were good about listening to anything workers had to say.  My co-workers were usually helpful with a few that didn't seem to care that much.  The hardest part of the job was moving the product from the loading dock to the produce cooler and prep room.  This was because of the amount of product on the pallets that we would move as well as the distance from the loading dock in the back of the store to the produce cooler which was in the front of the store.  The most enjoyable part of the job was probably stocking because it was nice to see the department filled up after it started as empty.  Seeing the end product of that was always very nice."
good,"Great associates that will follow the leadership of management. At times direction can be difficult, with continued focus each month and directives."
good,I learned my cashier skills. and primary job duties from organizing shelves to sweeping. the hardest part about the job is going outside and try to get the carts. the most enjoyable part of the job is the customers and getting to know them they always seem to make me smile.
good,since i been working for Kroger i have found the company to be a positive environment.i have learned hands on how the company is ran and operate to ensure that customers are satisfied throughout the store.
good,"I learned many things working at Kroger. As a cashier i learned grocery store transactions, tendering a sale, rain checks, and how to keep a register clean. As a Deli clerk i learned how to clean a slicer, service deli customers, pack and seal meats, organize a meat cooler, and product inventory. As a Bakery clerk i learned how to organize a sales floor, check dates, do mark downs, and baking bakery products. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers."
good,"I had an enjoyable time at Kroger.  There was constant advancement within the departments"
good,I enjoyed daily interactions with customers in a professional yet personal environment with wonderful management and and coworkers.
good,The company is great but if you are in an understaffed store plan to work a lot. The company as a whole is wonderful. I did enjoy the time I spent with them.
good,Kroger is a great place to work at. My co-workers are very nice and fun to be around. The management is also very helpful. The best part of the job is the people.
good,I learned almmost every position in the baker only after working there a few months. I am a quick learner and can pick up most tasks fairly easily with basic guidance. I was always on time and helped out every customer I could. I had to lift heavy boxes as well as manage my time since I would alone for most hours at night.
good,"Some of this company's stores take too long to be properly trained, as the computer based learning is not the same as working the actual sales floor. "
good,"A typical day at work is checking customers out and taking payment."
good,"I liked working overtime and I liked the benefits and I liked some of the co workers however I was going through a rough time with some of the co workers that were stealing and trying to pin it on me because I was new, and the manager was not to understanding when I was sick and going through a rough patch in my life at the time."
good,"As a cashier, my typical day was to greet the customers and to process their orders in a friendly and timely manner. It was also critical to ensure the monetary transactions was done correctly."
good,"Every day that I entered the building I was able to learn something new weather it was my boss or our guests."
good,Cross training of all employees is critical to successful operation. Store managers who excel are personality driven and recognized by moving up multiple levels.
good,great place to work with great people focused on the customer is always right. outgoing and great co-workers always willing to help you out when needed.
good,"Excellent for working with my unpredictable college schedule."
good,"Overall the business teaches an abundance of skills ranging from customer service on the front to learning the skills to cooking a crispy chicken. Being a produce clerk I have seen the importance of ""Freshness"" around the whole department to from cleanliness to having freshly cut lettuce. Best times are midday to around 6pm, thats when the typical rushes start (from retirement homes for senior day to people getting off of work to grab dinner for their children). Later on it gets slower and you focus more on cleaning."
good,"I believe its a great place to work, but I would like to be with my family more in the afternoons. I understand working in retail it is that way. I just feel that because I have two kids I should not be the one to work the midnight shifts."
good,Sometimes I have good day and sometimes I do not have good day at work sometimes the working  days make from our customers.
good,My day usually starts off with me greeting customers as i walk in the door. I spend most of my time at a cash register providing fast check outs.I didn't really learn anything working at Kroger the job doesn't have much to offer if someone hasn't been working there for 2+ years. The management was pretty horrible they wouldn't help employees unless it benefits them in someway. The co-workers on the other hand some where extremely friendly and some were not so kind the mean ones spend of the day making other co-workers feel bad about them selves. Nothing about the job was to difficult to the point when I couldn't handle it. The most enjoyable part I will have to say would be meeting all the different types of customers and having a positive impact on their life.
good,"Good place to start off, first time I have ever encountered grumpy customers. My co-workers were always asking questions and learning new things, and so did I."
good,job comes with a lot but not much that i coudnt handle but it was a good job like the way the pay schedule was set up and you meet new people daily great work expience
good,"The company does not pay enough or give enough hours for a person to provide a living for their family. I was hired in as full time as a meat cutter. When I went to work, they put me as a stocker, at first I got 30+ hours a week and then I started getting less and less hours but I had to stay to get at least some money to help provide for my family.  I feel that the company is unfair. If they hired you as a full time employee, you should work full time and be able to provide for your family."
good,"You come into a very social work environment, where your peers and management alike both take pride in how efficiently a job is done. Also time was a big factor."
good,"Decent benefits after 9 months of employment for part timers."
good,Meeting and greeting customers.  Helping customers.  Enjoy talking with my weekly customers.  Learned how to run cash register and enjoy working with co-workers.
good,"Great work environment loving co workers. Awesome customer service, always willing to reward a good employee. Always clean and up to par."
good,"Managing different personalities and placing them where they can best serve the need our our customer is challenging , but rewarding. Words can not express the emotion granted when you place someone in the environment where they where meant to be."
good,The job was an interactive job with people because I would have to address every person that came within a distance of me or of the meat counter.  I learned some skills in cleanliness and food prep.  It was enjoyable to interact with people everyday.
good,I worked the 6a.m.-2:30 shift and would clean and straighten the front end every morning that I worked and made sure the registers were equipped with items the cashiers would need for the day. I had a good relationship with most of the other employee's and enjoyed working and helping to train them. I also enjoyed learning new things and being able to suggest things to help with sales.
good,Spent a year working there while in high school as a bagger. Got paid minimum wage and worked very hard. I was often rewarded for that through verbal praise and non-monetary compensation. Best management I've ever worked under. Store manager regularly on the floor assisting with everything.
good,The store gave great hour but for very little pay. I enjoyed all my co-workers but I do not think this job was meant for me completely.
good,"I come to work and try my hardest to do my job, which sometimes is conveluted by coworkers. It really is a team job, and I have learned that you really are as strong as your weakest link. Management can be good, but because of the union grasp on the high up supervisors, the work quality severely suffers. Coworkers are generally nice, although there are bad seeds and sub par workers here. The hardest part of the job is listening to the pop music of past generations(10 years ago). I really enjoy how nice everyone is. Overall, 4/5."
good,"It's like any other retail job.  The benefits are great.  Managers, however, are as great."
good,"A typical day at work involves not only making coffee and cleaning, but engaging customers and trying to help them navigate the menu in order to find out what they would most enjoy. I have learned how to deal with difficult customers and how to ensure that their experience will be well worth it. My manager and other co-workers are all very easy to get along with, which makes the work day much more enjoyable. However, one of the most enjoyable parts of the job is connecting with customers and getting to know them. If you are personable with the people that you are serving, their overall experience will end up being a lot better."
good,"I learned how to operate a cash register. A typical day at work included greeting customers, answering customer questions, and scanning groceries. My co-workers were nice to me. Also, the management gave me thorough training. The hardest part of the job was working at a fast pace. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people."
good,"Kroger was my first job.  It was for cash in high school, then college, and eventually became my career as I was promoted to assistant manager out of college.  I learned a great deal about being in the professional job force, and there were experiences I obtained there that cannot be replaced."
good,"Really nice company, very profitable, however they don't pay very much"
good,I worked for Kroger as a summer job when I was 16. I usually bagged groceries and talked with people as I did it. I also helped people take groceries to their cars. Another part of my job was to make sure the bottle return machines were working correctly and to change out the can holding boxes. I loved seeing the people and helping them and there really was no bad or hard part of this job.
good,Kroger is a wonderful place to work and make new friends. The co-workers are very friendly and happy people. Management knows what they are doing and takes care in helping with the customers.
good,The days are filled with constant employee interaction and multiple email request from a myriad of different coordinators for your market ensuring operational needs are followed up on. The management for the company is very passionate about what they do but do not promote within individual locations the companies work/ life balance mantra. The hardest part of the job is getting conflicting direction from market coordinators who do not communicate with each other before they send communication out to the stores. The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with the employees who genuinely strive to do their  level best everyday to make their customers satisfied
good,"I have worked for Kroger for many years. I know there is a lot of advancement with Kroger. That has always been my driving force until I became a mother. I have missed her first holidays and many other firsts because of my work life balance. Many weeks I work 6 (9) hour days plus travel time. "
good,"I only worked here for a little bit, but in that time I had seen a lot. I worked the night shift and the only issue was that the store managers were on the day shift and never really stepped in to do anything with the other shift. We had a person there that was more of an ""acting"" manager for the night shift, and they did nothing to train or help the new members of the team except for yelling at them when they didn't know how to do something. I personally watched them yell at a new person for not knowing how to work the cardboard bailer-which you need to be certified to use and this person was never told a thing about the machine-and then proceeded to fire them over it. Other than that there isn't really anything wrong. The co-workers were really nice and helpful and everyone always pitched in to get the job done right and in time."
good,Working for Kroger  can be great at times and other times it not so great.  I have work at several Kroger location and each has been like working at a different company.
good,"opening salad bar for the day"
good,Money transactions gust requests Stoked shelves cart pusher
good,"Kroger is a great company to work for, with competitive pay and good benefits. However management typically does not value their employees."
good,"Working at Kroger was great,my co-wokers are easy to work with my managers were understanding in most situation. The hardest part about the job is making the customer happy. The most enjoyable part of the job is putting a smile on the customer's face. the only thing i didn't agree with is scheduling."
good,"I enjoyed this job very much, a typical day consisted of greeting customers preparing and serving food, handling customer complaints, inputting orders, answering phones, basic cleaning. Management was great and helped maintain a healthy work environment. There was never any part of this job that I actually considered hard. I learned a lot more about personalities and ethnic differences."
good,"The job was fun for the most part, I loved all of the customers."
good,"Most of the shift is spent bagging groceries. Each front end worker would spend an hour in the parking lot collecting carts, on days it was too cold or hot it would only be in half hour intervals. At the end of the day, front end workers would return ""orphans"", or unwanted groceries. Working at Kroger teaches employees to work fast while still managing to smile and talk to the customers. It is a great place for a teenager to apply for a first job."
good,"good environment and always meeting new customer, I enjoy working for this company."
good,"Typical day was In and Out. Satisfy appreciative guests and very satisfied when the shift was over. Very organized and learned how to work cash register. Management was very organized and professional , Co-workers were all understanding of picking up each others shifts, willing to sacrifice hours for another employee and worked as a unit. Hardest part of the Job was bagging with paper or plastic. Not hard job at all. Everything was enjoyable the people there were very respectful and made many connections with staff and customers."
good,"Long hours, standing in one position. Hours changed weekly. Difficult to maintain family life with schedule"
good,It was a nice place to work. I learned how to deal with different kind of people. The management and co-workers were nice understanding people to work with.
good,"A typical day starts off with lots of prep work to do, cleaning and handling orders and transactions. As the day goes on its continuous cleaning and dealing with customer orders. The hardest part, is always being put down no matter what you seem to do. The most enjoyable is meeting some of the customers who enjoy talking to you, that makes the day better and goes by faster!"
good,"Constantly learning, building new professional relationships and meeting new people."
good,"A typical day of work had me bagging groceries while the customers where checking out. We had to do so with care and consideration with the customers' needs and we had to be sure to treat them kindly so that they will want to come back. I learned to keep my opinions about others to myself in order to not offend anyone and/or get into serious trouble. The management's decisions sometimes irritated me, but I made sure not to let them know that. The hardest part of my job was having to work with coworkers who at times were not always as friendly to their fellow employees as they were to the customers. The most enjoyable part was having to help bring in carts, which didn't involve as much interaction with people as bagging groceries."
good,"Kroger is a very good company to work for. They have many positions that you can try. You are given the chance to work in different departments, so you're not stuck doing the same thing all the time. Most of the employees are friendly and management will work with you if you have home life situations."
good,interacting with customers. Management is hard to work with depending on the management staff. Co-workers are fantastic at this location for the most art. The hardest is dealing with upset customers. the most enjoyable part is having fun with our customers.
good,they were really flexible with with school when i was in high school and when you needed off for something the worked it out with you. very good place to work
good,"i learned how to deal with customers, mad customers at that. i learned how to handle situations right away to satisfy the customers. most enjoyable part was interacting with the customers throughout the day an giving my opinion on certain products that they purchased through our store."
good,"I enjoyed working here. Eventually with new management there was a lot of confusion, and dishonesty."
good,"Overall Very nice Establisment to work for, everyone is kind and helpful"
good,"learned to work with others effectively advancing my existing skills, learned record keeping for food safety and other protocols."
good,I enjoyed working at Kroger simply because I love the interaction with the public. It is a great company to work for but unfortunately it doesn't pay very well.
good,My typical day consisted of greeting and assisting customers with any questions or concerns they had as well as checked customers out as they were ready to leave.  I learned how to communicate with a diverse population and how to give astounding service in an efficient way. The hardest part of the job was when customers were very impatient however this allowed me to increase my communication skills. By becoming aware of these situations it allowed me to assess and handle them.  My most enjoyable part of my job was the relationships I built with my fellow coworkers.
good,It's a good secure job. Once you are n the union it is really hard to get fired from Kroger.
good,"Your work day was never the same twice!"
good,Not much to it. Just do what your told and you will be just fine
good,"A typical day at work would consist of bagging groceries, gathering bascarts, and returning items back to the correct aisles."
good,need to get there schedualing together.but loved the enviroment
good,enjoyed time working there very unique environment as well
good,"The employees at the Kroger Co. are generally well-meaning, intelligent, and hardworking people who are looked-over by management and made to feel as though their best is not good enough. Despite this, however, the employees continue to feel relatively happy, and though they could run the store better than many of their college-educated management counterparts, they perform their day-to-day duties with a lack of disgruntlement that is truly astounding. "
good,"Overall, Kroger is a great place to work from high school into your college life. On a typical day, you devote your time to make sure each customer has what she/ he needs with a smile. This is simply showing a ""Customer 1st"" attitude. The management does what it takes to work around your school schedule so that you can work and attend school without any complications."
good,All in all it is a very good place to work. The people are great to work with as well. Mangers are usually ones that do not stay for a long period of time. My co-workers are mostly hard workers but still not mature enough to step up in the work place. The hardest part about the job is being yelled at by customers. I love the people I work with which makes it very enjoyable. Through this job i learned that team work will make daily tasks much more relaxed.
good,"My job is too make sure our department is stocked, organized and presentable. I have learned to manage my time much more efficiently thanks to this job. The management is very busy but kind and respectful to their associates. My coworkers know what is expected of them and they do there job well. The most difficult part of the job is just the repetitive physical work. The most enjoyable part of this job is the coworkers you meet that have a positive attitude and are going to encourage you to do your best."
good,Working here has been well. Ive learned alot and feel I can go any where else and be able to do great things. The managment isnt bad either because they are understandly and comperhending with the customers and the co-workers. The hardest part of my job would probably be the time crunch. The most enjoyable part of the job would most likey be to work with the co-workers and to help the costumers.
good,"Kroger is a good place to work if you want to gain customer service skills. During my time at Kroger I've learned how to react to different customers from both positive and negative experiences. Overall, the management at Kroger looks out for the best interest of their employees, and all of my co-workers are friendly and easy to get along with. Once again, the hardest part of my job was dealing with rude customers, but after tons of experience at Kroger I knew how to act accordingly. The most enjoyable part of my job was the satisfaction from the customer after doing my job efficiently."
good,"I worked at Pick'N'Save through High School and my Undergraduate Degree, For this time it worked great as the store could easily schedule around my availability. The scheduling was great when I was in school, however, I would never be scheduled 40 hours even when I was able to work that much. My hours would go from 35 hours one wees down to 12 the next and back up in the 20s the following week, very unstable which is why I left. Management is totally dependent on what store you're at. Roundy's will move around managers to different stores giving them a few days notice, In 7 years at my store went through 6 Store Directors. Turnover at Pick'N""Save is normally high because of the amount of students working there, but having that many managers in this short amount of time is a bit excessive. My hourly wage was above average, but I was working there for 7 years."
good,"I mostly did night stocking. I would unload a truck full of groceries, cut open boxes of food then price all product, then stack product on l-carts to be stocked by myself and other employees. Management was very helpful in scheduling enough people to do the job without stress. My coworkers were great helpers if you needed it. The hardest part of the job was working 3rd shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers."
good,"As a national compnay with over 2000 stores under 24 banner names, the Kroger Company is a good company to work for. However like all large compnanies there will be differences from region to region and Manager to Manager."
good,"Good place to work if you are in school.  Company works with your school schedule.  The hardest part is working with angry customers, but it will teach you to deal with conflict."
good,The general public can make or break your day.  Very flexible with my schedule.  Requires you to work late nights so no free time during most days.
good,"Bag groceries, get carts from lot, clean bottle return room. Not a bad place to see what the working world is like."
good,"Help customer at sevice desk. Help customer with va lottery, western union, money order, va power and comcast."
good,"The pay was okay, but the I loved working for Kroger. Diverse company and loved my coworkers. The only reason I left Kroger was because I left for College. I would definitely consider going back to work there if push came to shove."
good,working as a cashier and u-scan and courtesy clerk. helping the customer when every needed. scanning groceries as fast as possible.
good,"Workload for myself was alright, not so much for others. Other clerks are friendly. Never too much downtime, there was always something to do. Training wasn't that great, nothing is really in writing and everything has to be explained to you by someone else, how may not know everything."
good,My first job and I learned a lot. There were great days and there was horrible days. But overall I wouldn't be the person I am without the knowledge I attained while being employed there.
good,Drove to locations to deliver produce to customers and return in a timely manner
good,"I performed the routine duties of a night stocker, such as working as a team to break down and stock loads of varying sizes in multiple departments. Other tasks included facing, replenishment of displays, and the collection and organization of overstock and partials. Management was always helpful and organized. This position expanded my knowledge of the warehouse trade with an emphasis on retail"
good,"A typical day was very organized, everyday was filled with happy guest. I learned how to work in a fast pace and learn more about products. All the coworkers were nice and we all got along just great.  Most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that the guest git everything they needed all in one place."
good,This is a union company therefore it is extremely difficult to advance in the company. A good place to work because there is always work to do but not a career choice.
good,"In the deli I cook, clean, make salads, make cold to go, cut meat and cheese, make vegetables and fruit trays.  I learned how to make fruit and vegetables trays, cut meat and cheese, and learned how to work at the cash register. Good management will work with you if u need help. Co-workers good to work with, very friendly. The  hardest put was when I first started my feet hurt but I got used to it then everything became easy for me. The most enjoyable part was working with my co-workers, they was friendly, we laugh and worked at the same time, we worked together which made the job easy for me."
good,The company itself always is trying to improve themselves and job security is great but the pay is a little low compared to most. The culture itself was always positive for me.
good,Smiths is a good opportunity for others to get to know what the world is like as an employee. The staff there was amazing but the hours were very low and when they were available it was almost always last minute as someone would call in sick or not show at all.
good,"Great place to work, team work and nice people.Management team ok. I learned how to stock items in grocery store. The hardest part of the job was working during the rush of bad weather. The most enjoyable part of the job was, helping customers and making them feel at home."
good,"The only con to working at a Kroger Fuel Center would be dealing with some of the customers on their bad days. Other than that, I loved my coworkers and feeling like I was part of the community. I learned how to manage money, clean up around the gas pumps and change the prices for gas."
good,"Decent training, wages and benefits. The opportunity to progress is there and management is more approachable than other similar wage jobs."
good,This job was a pretty good job. They provided a great work place and they made sure i washappy working there everytime i came in. My favorite part was getting discounts and evenbetter discounts on holidays. They also worked around my schedule which was great. The pay was the only thing that bothered me.
good,Working at the Kroger here was a completely different experience than what I have at the Kroger in Clarksville. The management was very friendly and helpful with anything an employee needed. There were good hours for everyone. Had a steady schedule that was reliable and maintained every week.
good,"I love working at Kroger Pharmacy because we do 2 hour rotations which give us a chance to work in each section of the pharmacy.  The first thing you do is customer service at the pickup counter inside the store.  After customer service you then move to data entry which also has some interaction with customers which I love. I also love product dispensing which comes next, then drive through all of which make the day fly by.  "
good,"I started loving my work place with open people, high authority to equal co-workers. The work place was a fun comfortable place to look forward to go to everyday, We celebrated all holidays with excitement and fun, dressing up, small snacks, and parties. We also had cookouts at least three times every summer. Neighborhood kids  and school having fundraisers, including school teams such as band, girl scout, sailing  cookies etc...."
good,"A typical day consisted of counting thousands of dollars on a consistent basis.  Provide support for all departmental functions within the store process.  Manage all customer requests on a proficient level.  Monitor all checkers and loaders to make sure all quality is getting done in a timely manner.  Participate in all regional, store meetings and manage and monitor all cash drawers while counting them down.  Coordinate with customers and get back with the appropriate person."
good,"Kroger is a nice place to work for a young person going to school, it has good cheap medical benefits due to being a union job. Compensation is low but expected for the type of work you are doing."
good,"Fast paced"
good,My 5 years at this employer was the greastest 5 years of my life so far. My co-workers at the time were always friendly and made the long day go by fast. The hardest part of the job was that i worked the customer service desk by myself at times an its hard to handle 5 people at the same time.
good,"My days were long and hard on my knees and feet but fun."
good,"o	Conducted a market research on the grocery market condition in Chicago, IL to aid Roundy’s entry into the market including inventory and strategic analysis of potential competitors."
good,I enjoy the crew I work aside and the friendly  customers that come shop and leave satisfied.
good,"build arm muscles running the slicers. got to make salads and other deli items. my co workers were great to get alone with. i was working here and going to school, they worked around my school."
good,"Easy job for people who are trying to find their first job. Management sucks because all they care about is impressing corporate, who are just a bunch of people who think they know what it's like to work customer service. Nonetheless, it's a really good job for students too because they are always flexible with their ever-changing schedule to fit school in for you."
good,Enjoyed helping customers and some of the management. There was a changeover in management and things went down from there
good,"A typical day at work started when you walked on the lot. You were required to check vin numbers and put the keys in the cars. If any paperwork had to be filed you did it before you got your coffee. The management were very knowledgeable, and I enjoyed working for them. I learned how to be better with money and how to read credit lines. The hardest part of the job was trying to figure out how we could make the price fit in with the buyers budget. The most enjoyable part of the job was traveling."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Food 4 Less, I like staying busy and meeting new people every day. My co-workers are fun and we can all rely on each other and we treat each other like family. The hardest part of the job for me at the beginning was memorizing all the codes for the produce, but it has been a fun experience."
good,"A corporation that strives on growing to be the best food chain.  Enjoyed the employees that I worked with, we had a very strong team and promoted teamwork.  I miss working there."
good,"I loved the fact that you get paid every week. You also received discounts on items and ant certain banks. The company has advancement opportunities but you really have to ""know someone""."
good,"I love the work that I do I always get to interact with customers, I get to be the first person they see when they come in and the last person they see when they leave I enjoy all the work I do for Kroger including the not so glamorous duties like cleaning the restrooms the bottle rooms and bringing in the carts but its something that I love to do and wouldn't change a thing, other then the pay but as a courtesy clerk I know that there are no raises or bonuses, its not a bad place to work even with the occasional disgruntled customers and employees I do enjoy what I do and I cant wait to move forward and try to better myself and the store"
good,My job was pretty simple and ordinary but fast paced. I loved the progression that Ralphs has to offer. I learned a lot from my coworkers and got most of my customer service skills from the experiences at Ralphs.
good,"working there helped me gain more friends, showed me what real leadership was all about, and made me a extremely hard worker. Everyday that I worked was a different experience for me and I never knew how the day was going to go. one day it may be super slow, calm/relaxed, or beyond fast and frustrating. the people that I worked me always kept me entertained whether it was in a good way or a bad way, lets just say I was never bored with this job. I also, loved the fact they actually worked with me and my schedule. But I did hate the fact that we always were getting new staff and cashiers."
good,"Walk into to work and they was always back up from not enough staff members, if we did have enough staff, they were doing they're own thing not helping fellow co-workers. The Layout of the store was also unorganized"
good,Help customers get their medications filled correctly and in a timely mannor while making sure the doctors wrote the prescriptions correctly. Working as a team and keeping everyone on the right track is crucial for the day to go well. The hardest part of my job is trying to make sure everyone gets what they need/want. I very much enjoy working with the public and my co-workers.
good,"I worked graveyard shift. I would order wine and liquor, then I would work the order from the previous day. I would aslo do backstock,price changes,change schematics(ifneeded) and do inventory.I really enjoyed being busy at all times, time really flys when your working hard. I learned so much about the managment side of the grocery businness."
good,Kroger is a great place to work. I enjoy the people I work with and the customers at our pharmacy
good,"*Stock shelves run back stock "
good,"Kroger offers an amazing benefits package to compliment the average pay scale.  The company is so large that there are branches in almost every area of the country. The mid-south area (where I worked) is unionized, which has it's advantages and disadvantages. The management structure for the stores tends to be top-heavy and turnover in the clerk positions can be high depending on the location. Overall, if you can find a department that you enjoy, Kroger can be a great company to work your way up into higher levels of management."
good,a good experience in customer service. good store overall to work
good,Kroger was not the job for me. i felt like i was very uncomfortable most of the time. i had learn different thing about how to cut meat and fish and how to make it loook great for a display.
good,"A typical day at work, I would clock-in head too see the floor manager for that day and ask which register I was assigned too that day. Then walk to which ever register they wanted me on, log on the machine and open the lane up so customers could start getting checked out. My coworkers were a lot of fun they were nice and funny an were always friendly to me. Hardest part of the job was the fact that I had to stand in one place through my whole shift only time I got to walk around or move was on break or going to the restroom. the most enjoyable part of my job was meeting the other employees that worked there."
good,"Ordering inventory keeping track of profits. "
good,"A typical day at work is removing product from the trailer it is delivered on. Then breaking the skids down to wheels and moving on to restocking the shelves with the merchandise. I myself love the type of job, but sometimes you run out of things to do if you move too fast. Management is a little slow at getting things done, and relaying messages. The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers. They are fun and nice, also a blast to work with."
good,The co-workers were great and the work kept me busy. The part of the job I didn't care for was the fact I was stuck at minimum wage with no chance for a raise.
good,"Each day consisted of new challenges and priorities, which kept me motivated and excited for new experiences.  I first walked the salesfloor and spoke with each of my associates, especially Dept. Managers, to assess the day's opportunities and sucesses.  Once I evaluated the conditions of the store and adjusted my labor for the day to accomplish the changes that I saw fit, I checked my email for direction/new priorities from corporate."
good,Overall a great company to work for they just tend to change their minds on certain policies and procedures and that leads to confusion in the lower ranks. At times management can be very suffocating in their attempts to assist in departments. The hiring policy tends to aim to keep everyone as a part time associate if they're able to avoid paying for benefits too much. Union reps are very pushy and can be irritating.
good,"clean store and check inventory bake cookies , customer service"
good,Love working with my team and producing fresh and quality products for our customers.
good,I stocked and faced produce and home goods items. learned about produce and how things help you. management over all was good. no problems with co workers and hardest part was learning all the nutrition about the produce. most enjoyable was helping others
good,"Kroger is a great place to have a first job or an entry level position. Certain positions are more sales oriented than other and are usually more rewarding. If you enjoy having several bosses on staff everyday this is the perfect company for you. The most rewarding and fun aspect of my time with this company has been my co-workers, almost 100% of my interactions with fellow employees are enjoyable and rewarding. The compensation is a bit low for the amount of work and responsibility that a member of the retail staff has to deal with."
good,Get to met people from all different countries. always something to do.work with people of all ages
good,"8hours + shifts"
good,great people and productive environment to work in. a place that always keeps you on your toes. Learned a lot of great new skills as far a cutting techniques and different cultures of food
good,"Prep baked goods for morning bake."
good,A typical day at work required me to make sure that product was put out in a timely manner for customers to purchase. I was also responsible to make sure that any cake orders were done by the requested time of the customer. This often required me to multi-task and work with small time frames. With this job I have learned time management and great customer service.   
good,"Loved working with friends and meeting new people, me and my family had just moved here from Georgia."
good,"it was my first job when i moved to texas people were okay not really helpful when it came to personal matters,like family emerg. ect.it was had to get hour with kroger but other that that okay company to work for."
good,I recieved alot of on the job training involving customer service. The job kept me busy and involved. I enjoyed the staff company and the pace of my work. 
good,"A typical day at work involves learning and applying good customer service at the best. I learned how to condition produce, stock groceries, make company orders and even manage two departments from time to time. The hardest part of the job was trying to maintain a steady full and fresh produce as a few of my co-workers slack off sometimes."
good,"Kroger was a typical grocery to work for nothing to special. I did my job and went home. The people there was nice they helped out when I had a problem with the cash register or an customer. The work was the same clocked into work, signed into the register and started ringing up customers groceries."
good,I started each day by either bagging groceries or checking people out on register depending on what i was assigned for that day. I learned how to operate a cash register. My co-workers were helpful and made my job easier. the hardest part of the job was when someone came through the line that was rude and the most enjoyable part was being able to work with the public. 
good,"I've work for Kroger for going on 5 years to date. I've grown as a lot thanks to this company through the different opportunities given to me. I've learned things such as customer service, accounting, supervising and much more. This company even gave me my first job at age 16. Throughout the years though I've seen a lot of people come and go. Through my own experiences though, management could use a little fixing. I don't mean that in any negative way what so ever, I just believe that things could be changed. "
good,"Data entry"
good,Typical day consists of me waiting on customers and taking care of my given jobs for my shift. I've learned better social interactions with many different people from all walks of life. Management is sound at times there is occasional break up in communication. Co-worker are good friends who always helping each other out. Hardest part is having a customer whose been having a bad of sorts. Most enjoyable is meeting people and learning little things about them.
good,"I worked with Kroger for a good amount of time, and there were definitely ups and downs. The biggest selling factor with this job was definitely the health benefits, which are wonderful. Unfortunately, like many other large corporations, Kroger is prone to getting very power-hungry people in as managers and in an effort to make themselves look better, they crush the people below them. I did not like the favoritism that was shown, and yes, at times I was favored, and it just is not fair to the rest of the hard workers trying to make a buck. Yes, I do think I would work at Kroger again, but only part time. They expect perfection out of any new full-time employees but the full-time employees who have been there for years don't have to ""play by the same rules""."
good,not enough help. people dont work walk around. the customer the enjoyable part of the job
good,"A typical day at work for me includes a range of things from supervising, cashiering, working behind the customer service desk and/or working on self-checkout. From working at Kroger, I have learned about setting goals and how to go about achieving those goals. My co-workers are a joy to be around. Everyone is always smiling and always willing to help in whatever way they can; unfortunately, I can not express the same sentiment about the management team. There seems to be a lack of communication as well as a lack of appreciation for other employees. The hardest part of the job is being responsible for 20 or more people at one time. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that just by saying hello or asking someone how they are doing makes a big difference."
good,Kroger helped me become the person I am today. I was shy before working there they helped me coming out of my shell. 
good,Great place to work if you enjoy the public.  Very fast pace environment and never the same thing day in and day out.  Each day is different according to the customers you serve.
good,Well I have not work for them in almost 10 years so there is not much i remember. Sorry!
good,"Depending on position it could entail anything from stocking shelves, running a cash register, bagging, bringing in carts, and cleaning various areas in and around the store."
good,"i learn to have good customers with the customer.kroger is a very good job to work at,benefits are great"
good,"Great shopping experience - good looking store. Always fast paced management has little time to spend with individual employees unless there is trouble brewing. My co-workers were people a lot like me, I called it the MFM family. Hardest part: constant fast pace/physical work. Great relationships build with co-workers was the most enjoyable part."
good,Assisting customer with sales service in the Computer and software department
good,"I go get the key to unlock the shopping carts from the rack that is outside the store.I then go inside and see if there are any shopping carts that need to pushed outside.I also put down any mats for the cashiers to stand on,in the checkstands. I also make sure all the checkstands are clear of items that need to be put back.I get a shopping carts,put those items that need to be put back,in the shopping cart so when there is time,a person can put those items back where they belong.The rest of the time,I'm getting shopping carts from outside,bagging groceries for customers,sweeping the store."
good,I worked in a few different departments. Learned how to make floral arrangements. They were flexible with school and schedule
good,I really enjoy working for Mariano's. This grocery store is a new chain of stores that offers a fun and friendly environment. I enjoy working with my other employee's and with the customer's. The staff at the store and the customer's are always upbeat and nice. Everyone works well with other's. We like to make sure that our customers are having the best experience they possibly can have at our store.
good,"co-workers were very friendly and fun to work with,"
good,"Great place to work, easy to get days off if you're at the top of the ladder and great co-workers."
good,Pharmacy staff is great to work with. Lots of energy and willingness to help whenever asked. Everyone enjoys the company of the others in the department and it makes each shift a pleasure.
good,"Come in the morning around 6, push in all the carts in the parking lot, get all the registers ready for the day, do carts about half my shift then bag groceries and help with anything else till i have to go home."
good,"I enjoyed working there not only because of the work change, it was not the same thing everyday, one day you could spend the whole day filing. The next day taking calls and some days were just very relaxed and the day went smoothly. I loved my co-workers and company. I would love to work for the company again."
good,"Came in and prepared my assigned lane for the next customer. Maintained my lanes clean and tidy, I also made sure there was no hazards around my lane that could cause an accident. I learned to work a cash register, I learned to fix certain problems without having to call for the supervisers. I learned to work with difficult customers. My supervisers and Manager were very helpful they were always there when I needed them. My co-workers were the best to work with, they were friendly and very helpful. Hardest part of the job is to keep up to Krogers motto, to get all customers out as fast as possible. I most enjoyed working with my co-workers and interacting with new people."
good,The people is what really made the environment and as hectic as it would get sometimes they were always there to calm you down. They had fun events from time to time and knew how to talk care of there associates.
good,"I managed the floral department; I did weekly fresh flower ordering, as well as arrangement and planter ordering. I made arrangements for every day use as well as formal dances, funerals and weddings."
good,"*receiving and breaking down of merchandise coming in, processing"
good,"Everyday I would come to work with a great attitude ,because i knew I was about to have a wonderful day. I learned to manage the front end and to balance out to money, train employees, learn codes from produce to overrides,and operate a cash register. The hardest part of my job was having lazy co-workers to pick up their slack. The management was excellent. The most enjoyable part of the job was working as a team to satisfy our customers."
good,Interacting with customers
good,"This uses to be a nice stable place to work. Now, since the merger, there has been a lot of uncertainty. There have been layoffs at other sites, and no one is sure that we will have a job a year from now. The benefits were great before the merger. But now our premiums have gone up and our coverage has been decreased."
good,Being my first job It was a great place to start. It taught me how to work with others and how to utilize my time.
good,When I get to work I get started right away stocking product or cleaning. Its always the same routine product that is empty or low needs to be filled and the area cleaned. Different shifts focus on different products. I learned teamwork. We all rely on each other to do our work. If there is a weak link the whole department suffers so we all must work together to complete our goals. Management is good about things most of the time. They always come around and see how we are all doing and ask if we need anything. My coworkers are great for the most part. Often it gets stressful is someone is not pulling their weight and trying to take shortcuts but it does not happen often. Also around the holidays when we are extremely busy and the company does not give out the hours necessary to do the job it makes it difficult to meet the time constraints. That would be the hardest part is meeting the time constraints sometimes because the company keeps cutting our hours more and more but we still have the same amount of work to do. Also there is not a lot of room for advancement either no full-time positions are ever given. I love my coworkers it is like a big family. I enjoy helping our customers with their shopping and other needs. I love being around people and helping them it makes me feel like I am doing something worthwhile.
good,Ran your own department.
good,Get to help people on a daly basis. Willing to let you of when need to if put in a head of time.
good,bagging groceries getting the carts outside enjoyed the supervisors no hard part of work
good,"Good managment and recognized talent. Coworkers were like family and were great to work with,"
good,Loved meeting people from different cultures and had to stay vigilant of shoplifters during third shift.
good,"a typical day at work is stressful, but fun because as long as wortk gets done then everybody there actually has a fun experience. The things i have learned is teamwork. The management at my old job was strange because there we had bosses who were really chill and didnt mind what we did. My co-workers were always excited to be at work and always made fun out of the day. the hardest part od the job was trying the best to satisfy every customer's need."
good,"I left my job because we moved, but I would go back in a heart beat!"
good,It was a fun work environment with young adults and laid back managers the only setback is when they had to cut hours back to 4 hours a week.
good,overall a nice place to work the only complaint is that promotions are based off of hire date not preformance
good,I really didnt work with management because my hours were all over the place from 10pm and my shift ending at 6 or 7am. I got along with all my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was that I didnt have a consistent time schedule which finally caught up to me. I enjoyed meeting people and getting to know are regular customers that came in once a week.
good,I enjoyed working with the public and being trusted and treated well with the company i worked for three and a half years.
good,"I call on 8 different stores and I manage a part-time representative in each store which does updates to sections in the stores to pull out deleted items and works new ones into sections on a scheduled program from Kroger. I make sure all planned displays are up on private label products and that the store is in compliance with the sales plan for each week. I do store mapping of sections for the analyst in the corporate office when needed. I do reports on INS"" Items Not Selling"" to let the company know why items aren't selling. Ex. Like slow mover, stocking issues, product unavailable, etc. I communicate with store manager's my findings and department manager's as well so they can be in compliance in case they've missed something on the sales plan that needs to be out on display. I am able to obtain extra displays with shipper sales to department manager's which goes up faster than open stock items. I have learned how to manage people by doing online classes from the HR Dept. since we manage part-time help. I have a very good working relationship with all my manager's and part-time associates. The hardest part of my job is doing resets of sections. My favorite part of my job is calling on my stores and helping them reach their sales goals,etc."
good,"Bagging customers groceries,pushing carts outside,stocking items to shelves,maintaining stock wit handheld device"
good,"A day at work always started off gathering the prescriptions that were not filled from the previous shift. Then, I would finish filling the previous shifts' prescriptions then move on to mine. I would add all my prescriptions to the computer, fill the prescriptions in my bin then send them to the pharmascist to go over them. After he would double check the scripts then I'd send them to the cart where I would file them in order according to the bin number."
good,"Lets say that I was going into work at 2pm getting off at 6pm. I would be getting myself ready for the day such as: preparing my pay stickers for other co-workers. Making sure that I had money in my till. Cleaning the U-Scans, filling the bags for the U-Scans, Filling paper, so that customers has prof of there order. Then, I would be interacting with the customers making sure all needs are and where meet. Before my shift was over I would have everything cleaned for the next worker to take over."
good,"I have a great review of the team i worked with in front. It was a great job to have during high school, got advancement with hard work. Unfortunately my store mgr retired, which meant new management. I felt bullied and chose to leave for a more customer friendly work place, somewhere I could grow. But the friends i made there working in the four years i still talk to."
good,relationships between management and employees are great.
good,The employees are friendly and management was also very friendly and handled work criteria.
good,good benifits and pay. lot of overtime employess where nice
good,You always have a very produtive workday and your always busy. The people are good to work with. Love the energy and customers.
good,A typical day was assisting customers in day to day activites..The management was helpful and determine to make sure that the Kroger company is a success. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers..
good,"A typical day in the Kroger company is very busy. There's never a dull moment with tight deadlines and an array of people and personalities to work with. As with any job in the print industry things are constantly changing, but it gives me a chance to learn new skills and adapt as the workload and requirements change. Kroger as a whole is a good company to work for. As a full-time employee you are eligible for a range of benefits plus an in-store discount. The hardest part of the job is the unpredictable hours. Some days you go in expecting to be done by a certain time only to be told there is more work to be done. There are also days that you walk in expecting a desk full of work and there isn't much waiting.The most enjoyable part of my day is being able to participate on committees that help to build morale of the employees within the department. It's very rewarding to see smiles on my co-workers faces."
good,"*My typical day at work is to scanned groceries in exchange for payments such as processing credit and debit cards, processing checks, W.I.C., food stamps and gift cards."
good,This job is great for someone who needs longterm stability in their career. What you put into this job you will get back plus some.
good,"Learned many positions, made friends and had good managers. There were no benifits for me because i was part-time. overal great first job."
good,"Great place to work, love the hours. I learn how product good service to customers and others. The management could have been more productive, co-workers was great to work around. There was not to much at the job that i could not do. love going into work early and getting early and working around all kinds of people."
good,I started working at Kroger as a Cashier. During my three years with the company I was able to eventually become an assistant manager of a department. This company offers great stability.
good,I cant really say to much because i was younger at the time but krogers was an ok job. nice co workers smooth job
good,"I was in charge of assisting with the operation of the front end. I assurred all breaks, lunches, and deposits were made. I also assisted with assurring that the lines were running smoothly."
good,"A typical day at work included one on one time with customers, cleaning and putting up returns during slow times. I learned how to count money efficiently, and how to talk to people properly, and how to provide excellent customer service. Most of my co-workers were easy to get along with as well as my managers and head managers. I would have to say the hardest part of the job was dealing with an impossible cutsomer and the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to see our weekly customers who were really nice and never dissatisfied."
good,"hard work, can be very stressful, the peolpe i work with are great, ive learned a lot about pharmacy since working there"
good,"Worked night schedule and then mornings on weekends. Management worked around my schedule and gave me flexible hours. Co-workers were excellent, its like a family atmosphere."
good,the job is okay. I want more hours and they aren't letting us get the hours. I am tired of working in the cold and I would like to go to day shift or work from 3 to 11.
good,Enjoyed working with other employees
good,Company focus on new and great ways to enhance customers business and to stay on top of business trends.
good,"Good place to work, especially for high school students, flexible work hours, friendly customers and employees."
good,If you are interested in being in the Culinary industry its a good place to get you started. Its lets you get used to producing a mass amount of food at one time.
good,Ralph's is as good a company to work for as the managers and coworkers employed there. Good managers hire good workers and make happy employees and guests. Management was constantly changing consequently so did employee attitudes and customer service.
good,"I enjoyed working there, coworkers and customers.   I just wish they hadn't changed everyone's hours after Christmas.   I went from about 40 to 16.  I was at 16 for 3 weeks then it was 26.  This was very difficult for me financially."
good,"I was 16 when I started working there and it always felt like high school drama everywhere I went, even though they were adults. I was also sexually harassed as a minor and management did nothing about it. Hours were cut so working full time was very difficult."
good,It has been a good place to work until recently when the started cutting hours but expecting the same results and has made the job stressful and the morale is down
good,I am a very hard worker and finish any task I am giving. I enjoy always having something to do because the more I do the faster time goes. I like helping customers as well and pleasing them.
good,"The Co-workers there are very supportive and helpful. It has flexible scheduling, and can accommodate schedule changes. Has good employee benefits in store and out."
good,Kroger has great benefits and flexible hours. I love being able to train other and give them the skills they will need to become successful. I love seeing people I have trained move up within the company.
good,You are expected to meet the call goals as far as time on a call and reducing the amount of calls that are abandoned. Management is always around and if you are needing to talk to them they are readily available.
good,I never had any problems with kroger except for the fact that they didn't give me as many hours that I needed to be able to afford bills. I did enjoy working there though.
good,"It is like the same routine everyday, different people. We all work as a time to give the customers a great experience and make them want to shop again with Kroger!"
good,Really like my job. Fun group of people. Management is very down to earth and are willing to listen to my concerns. Advancement is available. Many different jobs to chose from
good,The hours are great and they are very family oriented. A very fast pace working environment & they really put my skills to test. Training that’ll stick with me for the rest of my life.
good,Kroger team is pretty good and management fights fir you alot. Kroger store 360 is the best location ever. My managers trained and help me achieve things i never thought were possible. Good environment.
good,"Working at Kroger pickup was very easy and flexible, the management was very helpful on giving me times that benefited me as a college student. The people were respectful, always trying to help one another."
good,the store managers were good people and were helpful but some employees were lazy due to union protection making work more difficult than needed and slowing down the daily progress
good,it was another great opportunity to develop my cashier skills and learn to get better counting money . the paying rate is pretty low . but it was great working for the company
good,"Rapid turnover and a lack of social and quality control causes many issues. Food inventory continues to cause employee overwork, simply due to small quantities being ordered."
good,"Workplace can be very busy but can also be very slow, depending on the time of day.  Respectful of different ethnic backgrounds; community atmosphere."
good,"Overall good working environment. However can be very stressful, low pay for the amount of work asked of you to perform along with  not enough team members showing up to work. You are pulled in all different directions. You become skilled in many areas of the store."
good,You meet all kinds of new people everyday and you can expect the same tasks with no variance. Very typical work environment with management that prioritizes customer satisfaction above all else. Everyone working there is typically very mellow.
good,The store is an amazing place to start for anyone looking for a job that is part-time. Hours are flexible. The benefits are amazing. The 401k plan is auto started after a certain amount of years. Health and dental are really good!!
good,This company does give you a chance to advance they have great benefits. Great career opportunities.I have learned so much here and thankful they gave me a chance to prove myself that I would be good for Krogers. They will hire people and give them a chance. They give good discounts from time to time to their associates.
good,"fast pace,multi-tasking,constant merchandising,friendly atmosphere,lots of things can happen,hardest part when we have multiple call outs and have to find replacements,most enjoyable part is when i am able to help a customer who is having a bad day leave my store feeling better about their shopping experience and leave my store with a smile."
good,"I've been working at Kroger for five and a half years now, and in many ways it really has been a decent job. It was my first job, and I've been there since I was 15. I felt no reason to move up from a courtesy clerk as the small raise wasn't worth the extra hassle as I went through college. This came with downsides as well. For instance, when you actually show that you are willing to do the work, unlike some of the other courtesy clerks there, the managers will not hesitate to ask you to do lots of tricky and sometimes gross work. That's not necessarily a bad thing all the time, but it does sometimes seem unfair as you get paid so little for dealing with a lot. The main reason I stayed after I graduated college was they have a super flexible schedule (As a bagger, as long as you work 12 hours minimum, you can take the rest of the week off if you need. It's great if you work at another job on top of it) and the people there are nice. Overall it has been a pretty pleasant experience."
good,Kroger was a great place to work the are people friendly and they love the customers and employees. You have to be people person in order to work there because you have to be involved with customers but working there is live being with family and friends that wanna reach they same goal witch Customer satisfactory
good,Working at Kroger is mostly a friendly environment. Co-workers are mostly happy to help and there is almost always something spontaneous happening. When I was working at Kroger I had co-workers that made it feel like it wasn't work. Holidays at Kroger were great to look forward to. Kroger is a good company to work for.
good,"Kroger was my first real work experience, and all told it was a good one. Job experience was not needed, as they will teach you everything you need to know. management was not overbearing, or overly demanding of my work speed. If I ever needed clarification on a subject they were always willing to help. And to me the most important factor is they will be understanding of real mistakes."
good,"Great customers"
good,"I’ve learned a lot about Kroger bookkeeping, and I’m still learning new things. I believe this company has a hard time with how things are done. You do something one way and then it’s changed with no real explanation of why or if this way is better, and we just end up going back to the original way things where done"
good,"I personally do not enjoy being a customer first clerk. I’m not reaching my full potential here. The job isn’t too hard, hardest part is lot service. Location is okay most customers are nice, some are rude and don’t act appropriately towards employees."
good,"I very much enjoyed working for Kroger's it was a very inclusive work environment. The job itself was amazing and fun I always enjoyed the customer interactions, but the pay was low."
good,they do have a variety of hours you can work the only bad thing is that your days off are always different you never have a set schedule so you always have to pay attention to see which days are you going to have off
good,"It's like a treasure hunt, and you are being timed.  I do think they should pay a higher wage, but like most companies like this, they haven't caught on to paying livable wages.  The hours are NOT going to be the same all year.  They are very unreliable, I would take this job more as a 'making extra cash' than, 'I need this to live' money.  Unless you are willing to stay over, come in early, and hand your life over to them in general you will not get the hours you want."
good,i love the company because of the fact i can make sure product is stock for the customers. working in the Kroger stores as helped me in my experience in the grocery.
good,"In my time at Fry's, I've developed a lot of great skills and have learned a lot from my superiors. People who have been with the company 30+ years helped tutor me, and lead me to success. Fry's does a good job promoting an environment where people like to work, everything from remembering birthdays to hosting holiday events."
good,Overall I think roger can be a good place to work for one they have a union and you get a raise every 6 months but they do have some downsides they have a no overtime policy
good,Working in the Denver Regional Print Center (DRPC) was very fast paced and very deadline driven. We produced the artwork for the nationwide weekly print ads in which we were focused on accuracy and aesthetics. The DRPC was not a store environment but a general office environment.
good,Great opportunity Amazing staff caring for others love to see there Employees happy   hours are good they listen supervisor do a amazing job at teaching us
good,"Kroger was one of the best work places I have worked in, it’s like working with a giant family, associates as well as management were always there if you needed help, management take time to actually listen to new ideas in the store."
good,"The management team has had it's struggles but you're going to encounter that wherever you go. Although Kroger is notorious for underpaying their manufacturing staff, where this company shines is the diversity of the workforce and caliber of associates hired onto the team. Most hourly employees have been part of the team for upwards of ten years (forty years in the most extreme) with extensive process knowledge. Flexible hours for management personnel as well as frequent training opportunities make this place an excellent growth opportunity for budding leaders. Be weary of unclear expectations, derailed conversations over semantics and overall lack of business strategy. Kroger may not be your last stop, but it is definitely a worthy stop."
good,It’s a good job to start off with. Pay wasn’t the best but they did give good hours. They really care about there workers and some the employees where very friendly.
good,"It was nice to work there; paid training and the people there are very kind and family friendly."
good,Worked with them when I moved to Kansas.  Drove trucks for them until a spot opened up in a store for management.  They taught me a good bit on managing my time as well as approaching situations that popped up with professionalism and courtesy to others.  Sadly we were bought out by another company and I was not able to work for them anymore.
good,"The store itself is ok, but lack of employees and no consistency in hours can make it rough on those that need to work a second job, or has a family.The benefits are great and most the people whom do work there are great."
good,"Courtesy Clerk makes you have the option of bagging or gathering carts. I highly recommend gathering carts if you don't want to deal with people. Outside, you can work at your own pace (unless your closing). Managers RARELY go outside to check on you. so you can chill and be on your phone. At times, I would finish my work and go to cicis and eat and still have time. That's how laid back it was"
good,The job is easy and rewarding but the management can be a little harsh and not very supportive. Coworkers are always helpful and the customers are easy going.
good,"A typical day at my job starts at 6 am, I go in and start balancing the registers and self-checkouts. There is usually something different everyday, weather it is mistakes to fix or customer issues to resolve. I work with a wonderful bunch of people, we are like a family. The hardest part of my day is if we don't balance and finding what went wrong so I can fix it. The most enjoyable part of my day is working with happy coworkers and making a customer truly happy with our company."
good,I think it was a good place to work i started working there at 15 1/2 I loved it and the managers and staff were nice. people started to make drama which is part of the reason why I left if I could I would go back
good,"The landscape of retail pharmacy has changed completely and a typical day at Kroger is very demanding. I have learned that corporate has goals and expectations that are not in line with the physical and time constraints placed upon the pharmacist and technicians. The bridge to complete clinical tasks such as MTM's, star ratings, biometric screenings and vaccine administration is poorly balanced with the dispensing role. Kroger has not been able to successfully implement  strategies to assist in technology and workload and the pharmacist is still a glorified cashier, drive-thru attendant, insurance billing agent and phone receptionist. As always the most rewarding aspect of the job is assisting patients to provide professional care and a sense of well-being."
good,This business was well balanced for the most part. There were times when we were understaffed and the management would not come down to help. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting and meeting interesting and new people.
good,Although Kroger was great when I first started over time it felt like management was giving unreasonable demands. It has great benefits and that's more than enough a reason to keep working there.
good,"The front end is a great place to work within Kroger. The level of interaction with customers is high, so customer service skills are needed. The coworkers become your family."
good,"Working for Kroger wasn't terrible at all, in fact, if I didn't have more responsibilities and more bills to pay, I would go back and work there. It isn't stressful a stressful job, management is super friendly and considerate depending on the location. Great job if you need gas money or extra cash."
good,Working at the Kroger locates in FORNEY was an experience. They are pretty flexible when it comes to work/life balance and offer some pretty good benefits after being an employee for a year. The only problem I had was feeling like management was nit on their employees’ side. They are all about customer satisfaction and I feel as if customers take too much of an advantage. Other than that Keoger is a great environment to work in.
good,"I have worked for Kroger for almost 19 years, and I have seen many fluctuations in how stores operate with different managers, as one would expect. However, management are not the only element that one has to consider, when labeling their experience with Kroger. The main experience killer or booster, depends more on the customer base, which all depends on what type of area the store is located. It is not a bad company to get a job, the benefits are pretty decent, but I don't see it as a place to make a career, for myself that is."
good,It was very simple and straight forward. I worked a flexible schedule and I got paid fairly. Easily manageable jobs and routines. Very easy going and overall relaxed
good,"I loved working for Kroger and would still work there now if I could. A typical workday depended on the shift, if you worked an early weekday shift it was easy and laid back. But if you had an afternoon or weekend shift it was practically nonstop. I learned everything I did from working at Kroger, it was my second job and I helped open the store. Management was great, with opening the store we got to connect with them different than just working with them. The hardest part of the job was the whole store management change we had like 7 or so months after the store opened, and learning the new ways they wanted us to run the store or just do correctly. The most enjoyable part was the friends I made working there."
good,Great place to work if you are in High School and need a first job. Be willing to be on your feet for long periods of time each day. The turn over rate is extremely high.
good,"It's an alright start for someone new, but the system is painful for anyone who is a Front End Courtesy Clerk. You have to do all the grunt work. Thankfully I am a Cashier, but recently I've had to pick up slack as less and less Courtesy Clerks are working there anymore."
good,"The employees and management have your back if an incident occurs with a customer, which is nice.  "
good,Kroger is a great place to work! Customer Service is our #1 priority. I have learned multiple departments and help out when I am needed. The Management staff is great and we all work together as a team! The best part of my job is definitely the customers! The hardest part of my job is that I can not fix everything. Associates come to me with their issues and I can only fix a few.
good,The pay sounds good however the hours you work kind of screws you over on the pay.  One week you would work 28 hours in the following week you would work 32 hours. So consistently you would like the 40 hours a week.
good,It was a decent good work environment. Friendly atmoshpere. But had a hard time getting by with living expenses and paying for child support. I would recommend this job to anyone and kroger will always have a place in my heart.
good,I enjoyed working there and most of the employees are good workers and friendly. Management helps with employee concerns which is a big plus. There’s room for advancement.
good,"One must have good interpersonal skills to deal with your peers and customers alike.  Hard work will be noticed.  A good business understanding will help you understand the ""why things are done this way."""
good,"It’s a really nice place. Great work environment for a college student. The employees are nice. The customers are nice! Just keep a smile, and everything will go smoothly. Leave everything else at the door."
good,"Overall, Kroger Stores is a great first job, but I personally think it does not provide any real benefits towards a career. That is how I feel, but I was eternally grateful for the opportunity to have been an employee."
good,Amazing staff. It is easy to obtain good relationships with customers where you earn their trust with their jewelry. Management does a great job working with you on hours and family circumstances. Valuing you as a person and not just an employee.
good,I have learned how to manage my time and be the CEO of my business. I have learned to be self motivated and also ask for help when needed. Managers are always available to assist when needed.
good,"clean my work area, setup myself for a successful working day, show the customer you care, check on my fellow coworkers, and give all my attention to the customers"
good,It’s an ok job not a career. It could be better as far as organization and the roles management plays. But overall it’s great as a part time or second job
good,I went in baked and decorated cakes and any other miscellaneous things asked of me. I was an average work day when working in the department it is very team oriented
good,"Kroger Marketplace is one of the bigger stores, so it is a lot more productive then a smaller store. With so many customers my coworkers and I have to work in sync to make sure that the job gets done right."
good,"customer service, busy atmosphere, fast past work, flexible scheduling, must work evenings, weekends, and holidays, many department openings, mix of full time and part time employment."
good,Employed through the union. If employed with them you get insurance and full time. Great discounts. In-house kitchen. Very easy work. Centrally located.
good,"Kroger was a nice experience. They hired me with no experience and I learned everything quickly. Even on the hectic days, I managed to get things done."
good,Routine day-to-day operations. Most challenges arose due to miscommunications with the supply warehouse or the inability of the supply warehouse to meet requests.
good,"There's a pretty healthy mash-up of ridiculous customers and ones who praise you for the service,  and I liked that I never had to work past 8 pm.  The hours weren't long because it was part-time, but I also need something that is full-time or at least a higher salary for part-time. Overall,  it was nowhere near the worse job I've ever had. worst"
good,"5$ medical etc, paid vacation and plenty more if you can earn a full time position.  This is an easy place to waste your time if that's your goal.  Getting ahead requires a real work ethic and a sense of ownership and responsibility that doesn't come naturally to everyone."
good,"My time at Kroger was fairly enjoyable. Department management was very understanding and easy to talk to, although store management was quite the opposite. Breaks were lenient and fairly lengthy. The work load always kept you busy, but never overworked you. I recommend working at Kroger."
good,It wouldn't hurt to have better management and more employment communication and teamwork.  Kroger can be a very fun and enjoyable place to work and they have different sales going on throughout the year.
good,Kroger is a very good place to work I have worked for Kroger for 13 years and been a manager for 11 of those years over 2 departments. But over the years they have added more work load and less hours to complete.  It has become very stressful and has taken away from my home life and I am ready to move on to something a little less stressful and more of a regular schedule.
good,Working for Kroger I checked and packed customer online orders. I made sure all the orders were correct and packed very nice and neatly before shipping them out.
good,"Easy environment to work in with an organized management and employees that were fun and easy to get along with, very flexible in scheduling, and gives you the tools and platform necessary to advance your skills and career."
good,"As stated in my summary, Kroger was a great place to gain entry into the workforce. They provide decent benefits and even though to pay wasn't great it, hour were flexible enough to balance life and work."
good,As long as you're getting your correct pay for you job description and is doing your job everything should be fine. Sometimes things seem a bit out of control but as long as everyone is focused and doing their part things will work out just fine.
good,"As a retail employee, please remember that your position with the company requires you to deal with both customers and fellow employees.  Both customers and fellow employees can and will have different opinions than you and you must manage how you deal with those differences and people.  You cannot expect everyone to always agree with you.   While this may seem difficult, it can also prove to be a very rewarding experience"
good,Loved interacting with the customers on a daily basis. Getting to know what the customer wants & needs before they come to you.  Treating the customers with respect.
good,"Working here was a great experience, especially since this was my first job. My coworkers were friendly and I loved my kroger family. I would definitely recommend working at kroger to anyone."
good,"I pretty much enjoyed working at Kroger's.  Pay wasn't bad, but the inner workings of mgnt in each dept is different.  2 15 minute breaks and a half hour lunch.  Would be better if it were an hour.  1/2 hr not enough time to get food, go to break room to eat."
good,"Solid company to work for that emphasizes on the job experience and training over education and intelligence. "
good,"Not much to say other than its a good place to work and there's good money to be made, most of the time they do their best to work with you to make sure you have everything you need to the job. The training is paid and very hands on. If you don't mind long hours, heavy lifting and being on your feet all day then this could be a good job for you. I was there temporarily and I do intend on going back."
good,"I enjoyed working for the company. They were very flexible and willing to work with me. Very engaging and a nice place to work. The work day usually involved meeting with a lot of customers and making sure that their needs were met. It was extremely rewarding to learn accountability and how to sociably interact with everyone on a day to day basis. The hardest part of the job would be the inability at times to meet the needs of those around you during the evenings or a busy day. However, the social aspects of the job kept it light and interesting."
good,"Genuinely enjoyable experience, only issue was how busy it was. Customers were nice, but there were also many rude ones. Basically would clock in, and either work at the front desk or fill prescriptions. Most of the time would be backed up due to volume of scripts received and how little people working at the time(that was mostly due to management). Coworkers are great, pharmacists are great, and helping patients was enjoyable. The hardest part was working long shifts with little to no breaks, and receiving constant calls."
good,Great place to work your way up the ladder. I started as a cashier and within 2 years I was a department head. Every department head in my store was a woman which was really cool. But lack of staffing due to low hourly wage made things extremely stressful.
good,Kroger is your typical grocery store job. Nothing special or exciting. I was task to be a stocker and i did the same job everyday and worked for a minimum wage.
good,"Kroger needs to raise their salary range, especially based on the amount of work."
good,Opening and closing shifts where usually the same but would sometimes be different. Opening shifts where more work then closing but the produce department was fun to work in.
good,"It’s a great place to work, all of the people are friendly even the managers. If you were complaining about something it’s the fact that the building needing an update or new equipment not the employees. The pay could be better and I think they should start people out on full-time but I understand why they don’t. I wish the would open up stores in Florida."
good,Heavy lifting fast passed long hours. Good workers good supervisor bad management. Paid breaks not lunch 30 min lunch. For the most part your left alone to do your own thing
good,Kroger's gave me my first opportunity working with the public. The customer service skills were enhanced with diversity. The hours were flexible with competition with other employees for hours.
good,"Employees are not paid enough for the work that they do"
good,"My primary job was cleaning bathrooms. I also cleaned spills and did some sweeping but it was mostly bathrooms. It would have probably been much more tolerable if I didn't have to fill out a training form with questions like (and I quote), ""How have you fed the spirits of our customers today?"" for the first 3 whole months of the job."
good,Great part-time job that was close to home.  The pay was not  great but average for the type of work i did.  Managers were nice enough but not always visible.
good,"Many challenges and opportunities for any motivated individual. Can learn how to manage workload and crew, great teamwork approach to manage work and staff to accomplish work."
good,"Just do as told and if looking to advance there is a great chance to.. It is what you make it..i had a good experience working for kroger, but sometimes you can feel very belittled and very unappreciated at times, but as i stated it is what you make it"
good,Very fast paced environment needing great customer service and employee skills.  Multi-task and able to assign tasks to different associates on a immediate need basis is required.
good,Great work environment . Fun place to work you get to meet great people and work with some great pet. Really fast paced you have a lot of different job task so you will never get bored.
good,I enjoy working at Kroger. I have met a lot of great people within my time at the company. Is it a fulfilling career? Yes and no. I enjoy the aspect of helping customers and performing for my bosses. It is a competitive field which helps fuel promotion and recognition.
good,I had a good experience. Would love to be taken back but I understand that I made the circumstances hard and I take responsibility for that. I loved the people that I worked with and wish everyone well.
good,It was a fun place to work at first. The new management that took over has made it a little bit difficult to work there. No support and no clean environment.
good,"They try you out at different things to see how flexible you are and your willingness to learn and I love it. I just wish that they could give more and better hours. The environment is a bit challenging at times as far as the customers are concerned, but it's a wonderful place."
good,This company is a good place to work at because you have some of your friends families come through once in a while and when your friends work with you it id always fun.
good,"When I worked at Kroger i didn't know what fun that would be ""in-Store""and i enjoyed my time there. Meeting diffrent people and everyday was the same yet diffrent. I started out as a Courtesy Clerk and moved to Dairy Asssociate within my first three months there. from there i learned to run and maintan a department. very helpful yet understanding managment. the hardest part was the evenings when school and work let out. you deal with a cast of characters. From crying kids to people on phones. and everything between. But after the dust settle it goes to slowing down again. I always liked the interaction with people. Depends on what your loaction is.. it can be fun and rewarding job."
good,"The Kroger co truly does its due diligence to take care of their employees as there are numerous benefits. I truly loved my job and the opportunity to be creative in the kitchen, hosting special events and engaging with customers on a personal level. "
good,"From what I remember, working for Albertsons was an enjoyable experience. This was my first job out of college and I learned a lot about retail pharmacy"
good,Motivated company they have multiple responsibilities and exceptional service.
good,Great place to work. Work days can be fast paced around holidays and the associates are nice and kind. New management. People are kind and nice. Suitable hours
good,"The way an average day would go, you either open or close same job different times. You would of course bag for customers, check bathrooms, on slow days get shopping carts or do 'take backs'. Which means taking back misplaced or non purchased items (highly prioritized is meats and produce). Anything and everything is based around the type of day and the amount of people. With closing shift, I'd do all that and then end on a checklist. Carts, bathrooms, restock the registers, clean dining area, break room, office and back office. Make sure the parking lot is cleared and I'd get off at 1 O' clock. ""Fun Days"" are usually, nice-ok meals for Thanksgiving or a nice cake for a birthday/anniversary. My co-workers are nice people, honest people. A day where we all do our part and get through a day is a nice day. Holidays though, that would catch anyone off."
good,The pay isn’t that great if you are a courtesy clerk. You’re paid minimum wage and aren’t guaranteed 40 hours a week. Personally I need more hours in order to move out on my own. They also have decent health insurance so that’s good. But generally it’s a great place to work.
good,"Kroger is a good starting job. Retail can be tiring. If the environment was more enjoyable I may have stayed longer. The union makes the good and bad workers equal so why work hard if you don't get promoted based on that? You show up to work but do nothing for 10 years, you're next to be promoted."
good,"Good place to work at first, then they keep adding more to your already busy work day or change something about how certain things are done without giving you a heads up. And because there is a union, advancement in the company is very difficult because you have to put in a ""bid"" for a higher position and other people can do the same from different stores. So the position goes to the person with more time with the company."
good,"I loved Kroger, i started there when I was 15. The people at my first location always wanted to be sure that I knew how to progress in my job and make the best of it. I will always be grateful to my very first supervisor that showed me how to be kind and yet reach goals at the same time. My job was fantastic until I decided to transfer stores, at my second store management wasn't actual management they always wanted the customer service reps to be management for them. I loved everyone I worked with, however our Manager was never a friendly face to see, she was always either angry or looked it. I wasn't paid to be a manager and i believe that if customers could come and yell at me for their problems after asking for a manager and me being told that i needed to handle the upset customer i should get paid to be screamed at."
good,The typical day was slicing meat and cheese then wrapping them up and making home made tortillas. I learned how to work with others as a team and individually. The management was good and helped when needed. The hard part was handling several orders at once. The enjoyable was seeing customers happy with their order.
good,Krogers is a cool job and you can grow very fast in there. At the time they are just slow on hours and I can't survive on the hours I'm getting I would recommend this job to anybody
good,"I work 9p-5a in the grocery department, handling freight. I come in an hour earlier than the rest of my shift to help my manager unload pallets off the truck. Then another guy and I sort the pallets onto U-boats for each aisle - a LOT of walking, bending, and lifting. After we're done on the dock, I grab my backstock cart and put as much of it out as will fit on the shelves in my aisle. Then I take my U-boat and open each case, fill the shelf, and make it look pretty. Next step is to pickup my backstock and put it on my cart before I put it back into it's ""parking space."" Then I pickup all the packaging and put cardboard into the compactor, plastic into a trash bag.  Most nights it's OK (because I like hard work better than hardly working), but when it's slammed, it's a pain because the Union rules state that that I have to stay over if my work isn't completed."
good,"I started at Kroger's as a bagger but in a few months i was promoted to a Utility Clerk, which i greatly enjoyed the work. I would definitely recommend Kroger's as a starting point for work to others."
good,The pay is incredibly low until you get to a position of management. The benefits are solid but don’t make up for how low the pay is. Made a great temporary job because of easy schedule work arounds.
good,Great job. Great benefits. But only for a transitioning high school Student to college. I enjoyed it but got tired of the job as a cashier. Not my thing. Definitely outgrew it.
good,"Working there was great, of course had lots of opportunities. Management need some work, meaning not have any favorites. People who worked there longer barely had a raise, and workers are kept in positions longer than needed. No training was required when asked or was prohibited. After a"
good,"Managing grocery store by planning, scheduling, inventory etc..I started as a courtesy clerk and moved through the ranks until i became a store director. Had several positions along the way which helped in understanding all positions."
good,"it was an excellent workplace in most respects. the people were nice, and the environment was fun and friendly. it simply did not meet my financial needs."
good,"Had great time working for Fry's store #11, the only problem was after one of the managers suddenly left."
good,"A typical day at work would start with me saying a “Hello” and “Good morning” to my coworkers and on my way to clock in. I would then speak to my supervisor to make sure there wasn’t any specific task that he/she would like me to complete. I would then continue on with my work until it was my lunch break. After lunch, I would continue working until my shift ended."
good,The job definitely had its ups and downs but there are times when I regret leaving Kroger for another job. They were very flexible with my hours. They worked around my school schedule with no hesitation and I actually worked more during the semester than during breaks.
good,Kroger gives internal employees an opportunity to advance and grow.  It has the same downsides as all retail company's.  They have many avenues of advancement you can take and succeed in.
good,Good place to work good atmosphere if you are willing to put in the time advancement is a possibility in a few years for a full time position but I am looking for a management role and not sure if that's a possibility to move forward
good,The job was very fun once you built a relationship with co-workers. Once you get used to it the job becomes fun because every week we have a competition of who has the fastest check out times.
good,"Mornings would come in 5am and go over list of what need to be put out, for the cold side. Slice the meat and cheese that we would package fresh everyday to put out. Our Manager would come by and great us, letting us know the specials of the day. "
good,there would be some customers who'd come to the store just to converse with the workers and not even shop. customers were always happy or satisfied with their experience at Kroger.
good,Holidays seasons were hectic but very enjoyable to work through. Learning how to balance several different tasks simultaneously throughout a entire work shift took some getting used to. Wide range of opportunities if you like to learn new things
good,overall a great company to work for i enjoy the customers  and learning to make different drinks and making everybody happy management do a good job by answering any questions that customers may have is very helpful.
good,"Tasks to do daily and customer service is the #1 priorty. We are managed on our floor performance. Break rooms and offices kept clean, but lofts need organizing. Customers are tough in that area based off of clientele, but regulars are known in every department. Friendly staff and striving to stay busy. Tasks and cleaning is daily. Management appears on/off during the day, needs to have a better understanding on what they are contributing to the daily operation. Generally, a great starting spot for anyone seeking an opportunity."
good,"Very nice coworkers, professional . Always made sure their employees were treated nicely . Did not like that you could not work overtime though, which made it hard at times when we were short staffed"
good,"There was always something to do, so it kept you busy and made the day go by quicker. The management was decent. The higher up you went the less personable they got. The co-workers were fun to work with most of the time, but they aren't very flexible with school hours."
good,Good people and co-workers who knew their jobs.  Management had good people but corporate had them doing so much busy work and on calls all the time it made it difficult to actually manage store effectively.
good,"good place to work."
good,A typical day at work is relatively stressful but fun. I love when it gets super busy because I get to interact with so many different costumers in such a short period of time. I must challenge myself to get people out as soon as possible and I love challenges.
good,"Fine. It is an ok place to work. There are never enough people on the schedule though, which makes the job much more stressful than it needs to be. Good pay."
good,"My feet often hurt from the floors, standing for 8 hours is painful. However, it's rewarding work and keeps you busy. Good pay, amazing hours. Would go back to."
good,"A typical work day at Kroger involves a lot of customer service and cash handling. I've learned a lot of trades working for Kroger. I've learned how to understand people of different ethnicity and work with them to learn some of their language. The hardest part about working at Kroger is there is no set schedule, it varies from week to week. the most enjoyable part of Kroger is being around people all day and not only helping people, but also making friends."
good,"Always something to do. Overall, employees and managers are kind and helpful. The longer you are there, the more you learn. Plenty of customer interaction."
good,Its a fast place to work if you really want something that gives challenge. Deli department needs people constantly but pays little and baggers do not get a annual raise. They stay at minimum.
good,Great benefits for you family. Management could used a little help in respect but other wise it not a bad place to work movement upon company but you got to work very hard for that
good,It a fun place to work. It can get extremely business. The place can become stressful. You get to see a lot of different types of costumer. Some days are long and Some days goes by quick.
good,"gets competitive due to lack of employers and how every day a new load comes by and are put into shelves on the same day can be challenging. however, it does give everyone an idea that hard work pays off"
good,This is definitely a good place to start for someone who doesn't have any previous job history or for someone who wants something to keep them busy. It's not too crazy or chaotic but you do learn a lot.
good,"people i worked with where awesome im happy an proud to say I've meet most of them on a personal level. Some weren't so good at customer car or service didn't interact or would personally try not to make any kind of contact. Benefits where great retirement plan 401k. Certain manager would over step there boundry's an make personal affairs with work affairs an somehow get them fired or suspended. But kroger pays attention an believes in equal oppertunity. An would figure out each person story which added up an would either fire so called manager, or the associate or they would relocate to different store"
good,working in the dairy department can be allot at first but once i was there for a few weeks i would easily get all the things i needed to get done and still have plenty of downtime. Most of the people i worked with were very friendly and helpful with questions about the job.
good,I woyld reccomend Kroger for anyone lookinf to join the work force. After a year they provide reasonable insurance which is a huge benefit. Advancement is more based on who tou know than acutual work performance
good,I work as an order selector and the work that needs to be done is labor intensive. This job is good if you have the right mind set once you come to work everyday.
good,A typical work day was assisting customers find items in the store. Ring up customers and bag their groceries. Management appeared to be working toward good communication with staff.
good,ive worked in retail for over twenty years total. my job is a fast paced job. I work in the produce and im rolling from time I clock in to the time I clock out but I love working in the produce section..
good,Hardest thing is working on sunday and holidays. huge rush of customers all wanting their special order of ham or chicken even sandwiches. Your typical day is just standing waiting for a customers and completing their orders.
good,the job is very straight forward and easy to preform however they do not give much opportunity for advancement in position and they do not work with you in terms of transfer or department switch they did cut hours as well
good,"There is no typical day at work. Many different things can happen, so you have to be flexible. I have learned much from working here, but it is never too late to keep learning. For the most part, management doesn't seem too bad and most times easy to get along with. The work place culture varies from location to location. The hardest part about the job is that it can get stressful at times and it takes a while for advancement, but the hourly pay is good for those who stick around and good benefits/time off etc. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with our customers."
good,It was fun I enjoyed I. However due to working at a smaller one I had to do multiple jobs at the store as well a work almost full-time hours at a part-time job.
good,Everyday you go up and clock in and come down stairs and ask if your going to be bagging or outside collecting carts so you always had something to cause it was always busy after 5 oclock
good,Kroger's has a great company culture and a family oriented atmosphere.  If you looking to get out of the rat-race of retail then Kroger is the place for you.
good,Store manager was good hours were great work load a bit too much pay could have been better  pace of business fast and busy clientele okay business good
good,"Loved working here! Everyone was very nice and cooperative. The only problem I noticed while there was that; on the floor, there were favorites. Certain people didn't have to do much when busy, but instead followed a superior around and left everyone else to fend for themselves. If one person mentioned it, they would get hateful. Also, if you're nicer than other people, you're superiors will assign hard tasks to you that no one else is willing to do. Feels great getting to expose that, but other than that, overall a great job."
good,"A fast pace working environment"
good,"Primary focus of the pharmacy is now MTM. A lot of clinical initiatives, and pushing for numbers. There have been pay buts but they still expect the same amount of work or more. Not something that motivates or gives us any incentive to try harder."
good,It's a good place to begin the working part of life and it pays reasonably fair. The people who shop there are mostly nice and most of the associates are pleasant to be around.
good,This was my first job. I was 16 and still in high school. It’s a good opportunity to make money while still being in school. Nothing I could live off of unless I was a manager or something.
good,I Learned plenty customer service skills and how to deal with disgruntled customers in stressful situations. I also learned how to get along with all my coworkers and work as a team. They were like my second family away from home.
good,It was a okay place but in the  Delhi they work you hard because people can get sick off the food if it’s not made right or if a dirty surface touch the food
good,It was a great job and if I hadn't relocated to get married I would probably still be working there today.  I recommend it to anyone wanting to have a nice place to work.
good,"Customer assistance with bagging groceries, shopping, and checking out. Also helping customers to their cars if needed. "
good,I like working there. I am a friendly and a people person so I was able to meet new people. I would recommend this job to anyone. Working there was great.
good,Work environment was friendly and you are able to learn for whatever Dept was hiring they encourage you to find your fit. It does get stressful until you know your Dept like the back of your hand then there’s really never an issue because you know what to look for
good,Its a busy job and goes well unless uper management comes in . Hardest part of the job like most jobs is Management telling you one thing and then changing it 5 mins later. Do as I say not as I do .
good,"The work itself was good. Stocking, baking cookies, taking cake orders. Make sure you're comfortable going in the freezer for long periods of time. Truck was my enemy. Doing CAP was most of the job. I left because of my manager."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of handling customer orders, decorating cakes, working with managment to meet department goals, and enjoying a hr lunch break. Benefits start on the first day even for part timers, plus its a union company with a pension- like who does that anymore?"
good,"Working at Kroger can be very enjoyable, 30 minute lunches and/or two 15 minute breaks. I have great coworkers and bosses, after one year you get a week paid vacation."
good,"Many departments to find your best fit. Can be a great job if you have the right manager. Discounts and being able to shop after work is a plus."
good,Im fortunate. I have one of the best managers. She works with you on your hours and if you need help she is willing to step in. You have co-workers who are nice but others want a pay check for doing nothing. Other managers in the store dont bother you and dont expect to get overtime.
good,"Team work! That's  what it takes to be successive in businesses. I worked every job at one time or the other. And it always took a team effort to get the job done in the bakery., all the jobs are connected to each other."
good,I worked part time in high school. It was a very relaxed job and thus paid minimum wage. I can't imagine that anyone who would have my job as a bagger would be viewing this review online.
good,Kroger tells you when you start to be kind and make sure the people know they want you there. People that i worked with were always really nice and understanding. I definitely would work there again
good,I worked there my early high school years the pay wasnt that great but i was good at what i did the peaople i worked with were not the easiest to get along with but there were some nice people
good,"Nice place to work, learned leadership skills there, was placed over a 5 man working crew who got the job done on the night shift restocking the store.  The customers sometimes were the hardest part of the job.  the work culture was laid back as long as you did your job.  Management was ok as long as you did your job.  The most enjoyable part was winding down from a long night."
good,"Enjoyed the company while I worked with them through high school. Worked in various capacities on the sales floor, backroom, as well as working up at the front end."
good,I enjoyed Interacting with the customers. You get welcomed to the team. The management is always looking for individuals to grow with in the company..
good,in all honesty if it wasnt for school i would still have my job there. the pay was fair and you get raises i think every six months. the work flow wasnt bad either.
good,"A typical day at work consists of taking care of customers, running a register, cleaning, stocking, filing paperwork, and taking inventory. From working here I have learned that patience is the key to a happy working environment. The skills that I have acquired from work translates into my everyday life. It is very refreshing to see a smile on a manager's face even when it isn't a good day at the store. The atmosphere of the store is calm but the job can become stressful, especially during rush hour. The hardest part of the job is trying to juggle all of our daily tasks, but that becomes much easier once we create our own routine. Despite that single struggle, the most enjoyable part of the job is easily seeing the smile on a customer's face when they see all of the discounts the receive just for shopping at Kroger."
good,"Stocking shelves and bagging groceries."
good,"I really enjoyed Frys as a Kroger company and one the best jobs I've had. I do think that there was some poor management when I was there, but I visit my store every now and then and it seems to be under control."
good,"Working as a team fun people Lean all about cheese. A typical day at work was about helping customer get in and out of the store as fast as possible, selling item for charity"
good,its really hard to work at big stores while being zone in my bosses and waiting for a mess up so they can feel go about them self. will i ever work here again who ones. they dont pay alot
good,"I really enjoyed working for Fry's, they had a lot to offer. What I did find upsetting is Corporate and the way the handle management. Several times when a manager or someone that has a higher position get's in trouble or does something wrong, they don't punish them they just move they."
good,"You typically had a partner throughout your shift to help you keep the department up. Management would occasionally walk by the department to see how things look and would tell you if a certain area could use some improvements. The hardest part would be taking care of the department alone if your coworker had to leave early or prepare some of the product or if you had to work the entire shift alone due to lack of employees to help. "
good,Worked produce section as well as in receiving. Very detailed in the training process. Can ask any associate a question and they'll help you with any task.
good,Decent starter job but I need something more. I was getting training to be a meat cutter but all of a sudden I was told that they were no longer training for cutters because they were switching to press packaged meat next year
good,A typical day at work has many shoppers and almost enough workers on the front end. The management is fair with us and will take care of concerns that we have. The hardest part of the job is being able to effectively keep up with bagging for customers at each open lane. The most enjoyable part is taking care of anyone's concerns that makes their day right.
good,I worked in the produce department where he was very code we had to wear a snowsuit to keep her body is warm there is a lot of save the airport because someone will get hurt easy so it is very important that you worry about other safety it requires a lot of teamwork awesome do you have to be very positive and stay motivated
good,Fast Paced and can be stressful but is about average for retail work. Depending on management they can sometimes make it more frustrating to get your departments work done. Good people overall and I would continue working if more advancement were possible.
good,"Working at Kroger was very rewarding in the sense that I was able to improve my management skills.  It was very hands on and gave me so much experience.  The balance between work and home was very difficult.  Being a newer manager, I worked almost all evenings and late nights.  It was very hard to do with school aged children."
good,"Always opportunity for advancements within the company if desired.  Each day was motivation to excell. Be professional at all times and available to work nights, weekends and holidays"
good,"It's not a bad place to work but it's not the best either. If you work front-end (cashiering) good luck, because it very poor timing management and management it's self. They never have enough people because they run everybody off. You also get paid like dirt."
good,"It was a great experience and chance for me to get on the job, hands on training in the field that I went to school for, it helped me learn how to solve problems that may arise in a pharmacy setting work environment as well as obtain the data entry skills and educated me in the different medications"
good,great first job for people right out of high school or that are still in school. They do offer some areas to move up and grow your career or to further your education.
good,"Limited opportunities for advancement"
good,"When I started at Kroger, I started as a cashier, then i was offered a front end management position, not knowing all the tedious tasks that were given to me. I met alot of regular customers who loved my attitude and i met alot of employees that were very friendly and helpful. The bad part about the job was that i was doing management task but receiving cashier pay. Also, it became VERY overwhelming with the tasks that were provided to me that was not discussed when i agreed to the management position."
good,"As a Kroger employee, I always had extra discounts or coupons for my weekly groceries. So that's nice. Dealing with customers is the worst part of the job."
good,friendly people and got to interact with different people on a daily basis ran register hardest part was gathering carts i learned cash register skills
good,"if you like working by yourself and quickly this is a good place to work. Its the only shift that has to get everything done before you leave. Because 2nd shift doesn't do anything, you have to tie a bail every day"
good,"Busy job from the time you punch in till the time you clock out, every day i felt like something did not get done, wish there were more employees at the time."
good,"I worked here for 4 years, I made good work friends and the job was good. It was easy enough and the money was good to me. I would recommend working here."
good,Working for Kroger is a great way to hone the skills you need to get a job in your desired career. most employees are supportive of one another so that is a benefit of working there. I've learned what it takes to be a successful manager.
good,"Worked there for almost 15yrs. learned so much about so many things, Had some really great Managers, and not so great Managers, learned that as long as you work hard 9 out of 10 times you will have room for advancement. I was able to do many outside of the box activities for example: life size poster in all of Southern California, make training videos for entire Company, Train New Hire Orientation, Cashier Trainer for entire District, Advance into many levels of management, etc.."
good,Kroger isn't a bad place to work at. They are ever-changing just like any other retail environment and they are about to go through some major changes.
good,"Everyone is hardworking understanding and helps you learn the ropes. I would work here again if I needed to. Good job for part time, not a full time career unless management side."
good,"Overall fun work environment , meeting new and exciting people. Great associates regular tuff tasks.often greeting and engaging in customer/associate conversation."
good,Some days were harder then others depending on the day it was. Lack of coworkers so struggling to get shifts covered every week. Definitely not the worst place to work but lacks in growth.
good,For a minor it was a pretty good job. Though cost of living is well above pay grade as a bagger. I would advise to be good with people and have a good work ethic.
good,"I loved my coworkers, and most of the management. It is a good job, I liked it for what I needed, as I was in college whilst working there. I enjoyed it here, but I moved states."
good,The manager at the time was a great manager and was very understanding to my needs. Other employees were sometimes rude or talked about behind your back.  Overall good place but not so great coworkers.
good,"I loved it, the only big downside was the inconsistency of hours. The management said if I opened up my availability, I would get full time, my first week of open availability was scheduled 8 hours."
good,A typical day at work would be prepping and making sure the customers are satisfied with the work that has been done. Also helping other departments when needed.
good,"Kroger is fast paced, high stressful job, but if  you work hard and aren't afraid to give up your social life, you can make it far. I started off as a bagger and moved my way up to department manager in about 4 years."
good,"It was a good job. They were flexible when time off was needed, the work was not hard at all, the employees were all fairly easy to get along with, they also had stock options available."
good,They were very fixed on positions honoring their respective duties. Sometimes excessive efforts were not always viewed as a means for promotions.  Everyone was required to do bathroom duty which was a plus.
good,"As part of the management team, you are expected to work minimum 50 hours per week. Most weeks you end up working 60 to 70 hours per week. Pay was very good for management."
good,"Management relies heavily on employees for tasks that are clearly meant for management while not giving proper compensation or upward mobility. This may have just been the particular store; I am unsure about other stores. Coworkers were great, we relied on each other and that created a camaraderie. The one thing I learned was how to take on responsibility, whether it is yours or not, and get it done."
good,"It is a decent place to work, but to excel you need to have open availability.  If you are looking for part-time, I do recommend it, but as main employment, you would be better off some where else if you have a family."
good,"I like the managers that work here, it feels like the store management really cares about the community. It is a fast paced job that is tough on your body because you are moving in repetitive motions and standing in one spot all day."
good,I worked for Krogers for a few years. I enjoyed my time there for the most part. I made friends and met some wonderful and interesting people during my time there. The only down side was management. If you werent a favorite... You got no where. Sad but true. If you're just starting out in looki g for jobs.. Its a great place to start out in. It really will open more job opportunities for you to go elsewhere.
good,"Processing prescription labels. Dispense medication into vials for approval of a licensed Pharmacist. Communicating with healthcare professional regarding patient care. Assist patients with updating their insurance billing information. Release medication to patients. Cash handling."
good,Now nothing of it was perfect i'd say. I've definitely had some awkward experiences there. But overall as a first job i have to say it was pretty good. I got paid weekly with at least 20 hours a week and started at 8.25 to 9.00 (wage bump for minimum at that store).
good,"Floral duties"
good,"Work was often fast-paced, store seemed under staffed. Management was workable but was difficult to call out of work. Tips were acceptable. Had to manually clear the lot, no electronic cart pusher."
good,"Kroger is a good place to work at. Management is very nice and the job isnt that hard. Most days consist of taking carts from parking lots, bagging groceries, stocking shelves and cleaning bathrooms. I learned to do many things like being more adaptable and how to communicate more efficiently. The hardest part of the job for me was lifting heavy objects because i am a small person (5'0 and 130 pounds). The most enjoyable part of the job was the benefits."
good,"I was given many responsibilities at Kroger due to the fact that I have good work ethics, was taught this at a young age. I made donuts, baked bread, pastry's, cookies and decorated cakes. I also helped in the deli when it was needed. The management was great and very helpful to me, and its all due to communication. I was rarely stressed on the job and had a good working atmosphere.I had room to be creative in the displays and how I presented the products."
good,Not all managers are strict some are very understanding. Flexible hours until you become dept head! Learned alot from kroger in retail customer service.
good,"Sometimes there will be a mandate on having to stay an extra hour, which is a little annoying because the scheduling is inconsistent. Also, the department I work in, Clicklist, does not seem to get much attention from the upper management, considering they cut our scheduling hours by a bit."
good,"I learned time management, i also learned how to be patient with people. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to interact with the customers, and make sure there needs are met."
good,"I worked at Kroger's for 6 years. After a 3 they topped out my pay and that was good because it helped me and my family live comfortably.But after the long nights , miscommunication with my bosses and time I was missing out with my kids I made the decision to leave to find something better."
good,Can be a great place to work with the right leadership and leadership who cares. Great Co workers. Fast pace environment. There is cross training available in multiple departments.
good,I was hired on as a grocery clerk (part-time) but they had me work full time hours and the pay checks are lack luster. However the work environment is nice you make great friends quickly. Once you get your job done for the day you just hurt for things to do and you usually do the same thing everyday.
good,"It was a pretty great place to work. The people were nice and understanding. I usually bagged groceries or put away carts, and cleaned the bathrooms. The biggest thing that bugged me was the schedule. I was sometimes scheduled for days I couldn't work."
good,"A typical day consists of processing Nursing claims, Pharmacy claims for infusion medications, faxing and scanning of claims and reports.  The office is quiet enough to work smoothly with minimal interruptions."
good,During a the time of working for this company there was never any problem switching shifts with anyone or requesting certain days off when needed.  You were treated like you were family from the very beginning as well.
good,I worked at the Greenwood store and the Lebanon store. The two places were very different. I really enjoyed my employment at the Greenwood store. Lebanon.. Eh.. not so much.
good,"it was a good first job.Very friendly work environment and co-workers. Learned the basics if handling money at a register as well s handling food and keeping the store clean and efficient. may have to deal with rowdy and misunderstandings with customers and suspicions or criminal activities(drinks,food,etc)"
good,working at Kroger definitely showed me that things can change. Within a blink of an eye but there is balance. I learned that working in the deli area isn't as easy as it looks.
good,Management was nice to work with and hours were flexible. Coworkers and customers were friendly. Shifts go by slow but fast when busy. Managers were understanding of sick days.
good,"It's a great place to work they just don't pay enough to live in more expensive cities , if you live in a small town or someplace where the standard cost of living is lower then you will be very happy ."
good,"I started when ClickList was brand new.  High stress job, because they didn't have enough staff to handle the workload.  Often times we had angry demanding bosses because we had angry demanding customers."
good,"Typical day-Stocking shelves, ordering product, Receiving trucks"
good,I would help customers check out items and also stock items in the back and on the shelves. Helped with customers if they had any questions about anything in the store as well.
good,"Fred Meyers is a business with positive employees. The managers are nice and the coworkers eager to please. The work culture is friendly, and even the part-time benifits are snazzy. The issue is that it can feel as though you were shoved into a tornado when it gets busy. It can back up quickly, and it can feel as though you aren't interacting with the customers enough at times while you are trying to go fast, and when you interact with the customer you can start to slow down. One of the hardest jobs in Fred Meyers, for sure, but it can feel very fulfilling at times. The standing can be rough at times, but it is more of an annoyance than anything."
good,Employees are friendly and helpful.  Workload alternates from heavy to moderate.Management is encouraging and helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job is customer service. The hardest part of the job is ad change wednesday
good,"I learned how to operate a scan style register along with multiple self- checkouts. The hardest part of the job was being scheduled anytime 7 days a week, but that's just retail like healthcare is 7 days a week.  I mostly enjoyed some of my co-workers and the regular customers along with learning a few things in other departments."
good,I worked here during my first semester of college and it was an overall pleasant experience. The people were pleasant to be around and management was very involved. The Hardest part of the job was not getting many hours to work.
good,"Great place for first tome workers , the teams collaborate smoothly and get along like family . The pay raises .50cents every 6 months and the job advancement is pretty good for a grocery store ."
good,"Going to Kroger everyday was A great place to work. THere were many people that had been there for years. Thats what I loved about working at Kroger. The management was also great. The hardest part was pushing in buggies in the freezing cold. That wasnt even that hard, unless it snowed."
good,"Knowing what your job is going to be the next day prepares you for it. If we're not prepared, we aren't going to start off with the best foot forward, and that can set the tone for the whole day. A little more coordination would go a long way."
good,"The job is pretty intense there are days that you feel like it will never come to the end while some days are a little better than other. Not all mangers care about you here the store manager only care about herself. The pharmacy is a family and sometimes we don't agree, but one thing we can agree on is the changes being made there is unthinkable."
good,"Sometimes, I would be working and they would ask me to do overtime everyday or they would call my house and phone everyday asking me to come in everyday when everybody keep calling out."
good,"Expects one person to do a million things all within an 8hr shift and not have any overtime. Also, they need to create a potion in the dairy department for a back up so that while the department head is on vacation or sick leave, that person gets paid for the work that they are doing!"
good,"Good people, friendly management. Interesting helping people find and choose their food items. Checkout can be hectic especially at busy times and before holidays."
good,I was 15 going on to 16 when I first started and I didnt find it so much of a challenge for the work. The real problem was more so your coworkers and if they will actually work or will you have to pick up after them.
good,"The distribution center is fully automated and you will follow instructions to complete store orders to be sent out. Easy to follow instructions, and great training."
good,Krogers is a fun place to work at sometimes and other times it's not. The staff is amazing they treat u with so much love and care. There are so many staff members that I think should be manager
good,This is a good plays to get some work experience but I would not recommend it to be a lifetime job. I would recommend that you use this job as a way to fan experience
good,"In general, a friendly and communicative work environment, fostered a good community, good relations with the customers. Management was generally quite friendly and capable. Duties were straightforward and simply put."
good,I think Kroger is a nice place to work because the people have positive attitudes but the pay rate is too low for the jobs. I think if the pay was raised a little high it would be a great place to work overall.
good,"kroger was a great way to see how retail jobs work. the schedule was inconsistent, therefore, youre really unable to plan ahead for anything personal. the pay was great."
good,"Worked here during summer breaks when I was in college.  Mainly stocked shelves and updated order forecasts for when product was delivered.  Stocking shelves was pretty nice, you're on your own for most of the shift which I enjoyed.  Occasionally you'll need to help customers which I didn't mind at all.  Worked with a diverse group of people which I thought was good, there wasn't really an overarching culture, everyone was different."
good,"i worked over night, and most of the poeple that worked with me were super friendly and nice over all is a good temporary job since they dont offer benefits."
good,"Nice relaxed atmosphere, great co-workers, the work isn't anything difficult, management is engaged and proactive in listening and enacting on their word"
good,Bosses have good days and bad days but expect way too much of you a lot of the time. The daytime clientele is vastly different than the night shift. Night shift deals with a load of theft
good,The work environment is nice. Management is cool. Kroger is flexible. My only con is the pay. Do get paid vacation after so many hours or years. Personal days also plus benefits
good,It was a fine job and the people i work with are fin and great but the lack of foresight from the company makes it sometimes hard to deal with the issues on a daily basis. there was an extreme lack of hours in our department for roughly 15 people who worked there making it a bit of a fight to get the needed hours a week. as well the company changed the system we needed to work with almost constantly making it a nightmare to get things done for our job.
good,"The workday can be hectic and random at times, but you are treated generally fairly. They provide varying degrees of training depending on where you are trained. Management can be good or bad depending on the individual, its not something you can pin down as either way. Workplace culture can feel stressed at times but you probably will have someone to watch your back there. The hardest part about the job is the rushes, whether you are a courtesy clerk or utility clerk a rush of customers can be really taxing. The most enjoyable aspect of the job are the slow periods, the proximity to the product, and the paid vacations. Slow periods give you ample time to catch your breath and grab something quick if you need it."
good,"Working at Kroger provided me my first on-the-job workplace experience. I was able to learn basic skills that I feel will be essential for future jobs, including being friendly to customers on a regular basis, and effectively managing and completing tasks assigned to me by the management staff, and either meeting or succeeding their expectations while doing so."
good,Started as 17 yr old clerk and spent last 4 years of my 20 in Management.  Compensation was better than industry avg. for Clerks and Management.  Ever-constant changes since 2001 render this evaluation to marginal usefulness.  In summation I would say I was treated fairly by Kroger.
good,"I worked as a Courtesy Clerk at Krogers for about twelve years. The customers were very nice, as was the management. I appreciate them working to accommodate my needs."
good,"The work isn't bad, there is just very little variety when it comes to he work given. So if you were hoping fora job with a variety of duties to keep things interesting, it may be a good idea to look somewhere else. It's a job in a grocery store, you really don't get to have a lot of variety in your work unless you are management."
good,"My typical day includes meeting with cross functional teams, managing multiple project loads, overseeing restaurant and new culinary business development. Working with vendor and category partners around the world to bring the best customer experience to our guest."
good,"Fast paced atmosphere, training leaves some something to be desired. There are lots of opportunities to move up in the management and the managers are there to help you succeed."
good,Kroger was a fun and friendly environment. It was quick paced and sometimes stressful but it was good. The managers were friendly and available to talk with. The crew was always willing to help you out if you had questions.
good,"It is a great environment, managers are great, but pay is okay for people who has no bills to pay. It is a weekly pay, high turn over rate. It is a good start for high schoolers."
good,"Kroger isn't a bad place to work at all, I'm just now coming out of high schools and am preparing for my future so I am looking to work full time with them in hopes they can pay me the amount I am needing per hour to live on my own. The days working there are very simple and can be fun. I've learned a lot about unloading trucks with product on it. The management there is pretty good, a very enthusiastic group of managers at my store and hard workers. The hardest part of my job is when I am working 2nd shift and the people from 1st shift don't do all their work so I have to play catch up and get their work done and my own. The most enjoyable part of my job is that it's a pretty relaxed job with the pace they need the work done and I feel accomplished after my shifts with how much work I put in."
good,"Kroger should work on management skills , lack of cleanliness in the store . Better management and how they handle things, But overall a good place of work"
good,The Store Manager let me do my Job because he knew that I was an experienced and self reliable worker.  My department manager and I would collaborate on certain problems.  Everyone in the Meat Department felt as though they were a part of a team.
good,"This job was very flexible for students or adults working multiple jobs.  With coworkers who are willing to switch shifts or cover your shift if you need off, it was easy to balance this job and school."
good,great place to work. everyone is friendly. flexible work hours. workers welcomed the new hires like they were family. It was a great first job for me. I'd definitely work there again
good,It was a good job. The customers were the best part of the job. There were so many happy customers. I loved to see the smile on their faces leaving my register.
good,"A typical day at work would consists of either being at the register, bagging or both if there were not enough baggers. I learned good customer service, patience, and communication skills. The hardest part of the job is trying to remember the codes for certain produce. The most enjoyable is the customers (sometimes) and the people you work with."
good,On a busy day you would be standing in one place until your shift was over to get the lines down and get the people out faster. Every so oftener you were asked to do something else about it wasn't often.
good,Kroger is a great place to grocery shop and most people you meet there greet you warmly. Most Kroger employees i know work as fast as they can and try and meet all the customers needs.
good,This is a place with many job options. You can let them know your availablilit and they will try their best to work with you. You must pay Union dues.
good,"Kroger is a great place for the new or seasoned technology pro. You will be challenged and you will have to work, but the rewarding projects and satisfaction are worth it. The people are great. I made more friends at Kroger than any other employer. If you feel you have drive and determination then Kroger Technolgy may be the place for you."
good,I enjoyed working at Kroger for the 7 years I did. It was unfortunate that my time with them ended in 2015 but I have no complaints about company procedures or policies. It allowed me to support my family. I made great wages and had spectacular benefits and insurance.
good,"When working there the managers were amazing but the people who I worked with not so much, they acted like children. I honestly did like working at Kroger but I didn’t want to get stuck there so I had to leave."
good,Kroger offered a great working environment. It was nice to be paid weekly. You also receive  discounts on store brand items as well as insurance options .
good,It was a ok place to work at under one condition they use to get rob some times before they got and new management.And the bank they had inside the kroger got rob alot before new management.
good,"Hours vary.  If you are motivated, you can learn and advance as opportunities arise while proving your abilities.  The most enjoyable part of working there is your role in the customer's shopping experience and making it enjoyable for them also."
good,Been with the company for 6 months now and the structure is handled well.  I don't care for all of the lake hours.  Management works with you regarding payroll problems of time off requests.  Basically a good job for retail.
good,its a grocery store so you know how that goes angry customers and very rude people but for the most part everything and everyone is ok and friendly great place to work
good,"Kroger is a good place to work if you're at a store where the manager appreciates you. Ive worked at several that I did not like and one where i liked working there the majority of the time due to the appreciated received from management. The pay is low starting out and they don't always give you your experience pay but that is more on the system they go through than them. it took me 5 years to top out, and that was because I received a merit raise from a store manager who believed I deserved it. The culture can be great and it can be like a second family, but due to most stores having a bunch of teenagers, cause lets face it- its a grocery store, there is a lot of drama usually. Especially on the front end. I worked very hard to get out of that department because of the amount of drama and childish stuff that happened up front. I suggest working in a side department where you make more, set your own breaks and have more general freedom."
good,"I enjoyed working for Kroger. The people I worked with were easy to get along with and I loved helping the customer. I have had customers request I assist them. But when it came to the way they terminated me I resent that very much, but never took it out on the customers or my co-workers. They lost a good, reliable, hard worker. I still have a good work ethic and would like a second chance."
good,"Working at Kroger is a good starting role, but very hard to make a career.You learn alot with the basics of leader ship, money management, and flexibility. However job progression is slow and sometimes just never comes. A good job but you need another job to pay the bills."
good,"Kroger was a good first job experience, it reached me how to be more responsible and productive. Some of the employees I worked with were friends and made for a good time."
good,Typical day would include multitasking and baking things. I learned a lot of skills including customer service and multitasking. Management was very helped. Workplace culture was quick paced and stressful most times. Hardest part of the job was the serval things to be done at the same time. Most enjoyable part of the job was baking for me
good,Good place to work for extra cash flow or a first job.  Not really a job that could support a family alone unless you were able to start young and stay 20 years.  Advancement is a possibility in time.  Job security seems fairly stable.  They rarely hire full time.
good,"The teams are great, but I do not enjoy work/life balance retail management requires. "
good,"I was a Chef assistant, I prepared hot lunch and dinner bars alongside the Head Chef. I also, took care of a salad. Ensuring that food was consistently prepped for it even if I wasn't there."
good,"Good Place to work with flexible schedules.  Allows you to inertact with customers and perform valuable service.  Pay is weekly, and able to cash check on site."
good,"Typical days at kroger involved making sure that customers are able to checkout quickly, cleaning the store during down time, and taking care of any other special requests. Management spends a lot of time working in the back of the store to make sure that items are being put out and generally take care of the store fairly well. The hardest part of the job is working during peak hours/days (superbowl sunday/thanksgiving) with what my seem like endless customers coming through or the rough nights with shopping carts all over the lot and piles of returns needing to be restocked. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to meet so many wonderful people, both customers and coworkers."
good,The environment was very friendly and fast paced the coworkers were nice and the costumer service was ideal. The hardest part about the job was maintaing good costumer service around stressful situations.
good,A typical day at work is running USCAN and helping customers with scanning their groceries and interacting with them and showing them excellent customer service.
good,"I showed up, I got paid. my manager was cool, but some in other departments were not cool (since i cant use inappropriate language on this review.), but that's pretty much every job so whatever. "
good,very people oriented.  The leadership took care of its associates and made the working environment a great place to be.  They listened and took suggestions from the people and implemented new processes to help make the job better.
good,"I enjoy the job and I love the people I work with but I need a more challenging atmosphere. It has become more about chasing numbers than actually serving your customers."
good,"My typical day at work is, an order gets called in, we get that order number together and put in on the trolleys, we have tablets to do payment and one person takes it out while another one does payment, You take theo rder out to the right person be respectful and load their car, and tell them to have a nice day/night and cash them out. If the customer is unhappy with anything you do anything you can to help them leave with everything they ordered and happy."
good,"As a deli clerk, the work is very fast paced, stressful, and unpredictable. You have to be ready for all mistakes. As a whole, it's a great place to work."
good,"It's a good job for a short time during college or on your way to something better--such as hospital pharmacy technician work. Unless you're a pharmacist, there's no real advancement past lead tech and a few dollar-an-hour raises; if you're going to stick with Kroger, you're best bet is to stick with the grocery store side of management where our current CEO started as a clerk. There's unlimited advancement there; in the pharmacy, no so much."
good,"Kroger was a great place to work."
good,"Overtime its just not enough, too many cut hours, sometimes understaffed. Overall not a bad place to start a career. But if you see the long time picture you will get out as soon as possible"
good,It is a easy job as long as you get along with the customer and greet them with a nice smile and say have a great day or welcome to Kroger. It is easy to get along with the workers as long as they see that you are a hard worker. Then you will be liked at your job
good,"Overall, the job was very good. I learned how to use a cash register, I used my ability to be bilingual, and I got along with my customers very well. The environment was really nice. However, management was probably the least favorite part of the job because they were very biased individuals. I worked at Ruler Foods, a branch of Kroger."
good,I have had some amazing pharmacist I worked with through Kroger. The co-workers were always fun. The only downfall was certain location where there were some favoritism. This shouldn't be allowed in the workforce.
good,this was my 1st job and only worked here for a year. it was hard to get more than a week off even though I was part time and in school. was told by management i could not have a week off because it was not my vacation.
good,"Typical day I dealt with angry customers ready to receive their medication"
good,"Challenging "
good,You will develop great lasting relationships with your coworkers. The ability to receive extra hours is easy. There is always more work than workers. P
good,"Slicing meat and cheese to peoples requirements ,keeping slicers clean, stocking the display case when needed ,kind of fast pace at times mainly on Sundays"
good,"I worked in the IT department for Kroger Company.  My work time was split between maintaining software, supporting requests, and developing new monitoring solutions.  "
good,"has great people that work there but management is a mess. "
good,I worked in the meat department of Kroger and gained experience with customers and with processed foods. the hardest part of the job was finding something to do after all my stuff was done.
good,"A typical day at work is fast paste, dealing with multiple customers and employees. During the day I correct time clock errors, assist with bookkeeping, western union transactions, customer service and refunds. The hardest part of the job is keeping everyone on the same page with how customer service should be provided. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing new faces and continuous interaction with people."
good,"My typical day at work was pretty relaxed. I had to learn a lot of things like operating the cash register, operating the self checkout machines, and stocking the shelves. Management and staff were always nice and respectful. The hardest part of the job was sometimes the customers were'nt the nicest. The most enjoyable part was knowing I was helping make a lot of peoples day a little easier."
good,"I was not there long enough to learn every thing I needed to learn. I prefer hands on training. The atmosphere was nice. I made friend quickly and we all worked together as a team."
good,Kroger was a great company to work for. Associates were very friendly and willing to help each other. It required lots of physical work (epically in the garden center). I learned a lot of valuable skills that will help me with life and future careers.
good,A typical day working for Kroger was fun and exciting. I leaned more people skills while working there. I also learned to manage time and muiltitask better. The workplace culture was very friendly to people’s culture no matter what their beliefs were. The hardest part of the job was lefting heavy objects. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting a new face everyday.
good,"Great work environment, I just did not receive enough hours. I was highly unsatisfied with the allowance of the bumping of hours. I had a coworker switching our hours every week, which is why my hours were always low. I complained to the supervisor and then to the managers. My complaints went unnoticed until I put my two weeks notice in."
good,"typical day was never too busy unless it was a holiday or nearing,"
good,"Work days were typically 8 hours, co-workers were always nice and helpful, but management had severe respect and rule following issue. It was not uncommon to see a member of management bending rules to punish an underling."
good,"During my time at Kroger, I learned the benefits of teamwork. The work itself was rather enjoyable.The one thing i would say is a downer is you don't know who you'll be working with. Overall, its a decent place to work."
good,A typical day at work includes helping customers out in the deli and making sure everything is clean. During closing time making sure everything that has to get trashed is accounted for. The most enjoyable part is having customers come back and tell you how much they like your services and the products you offer.
good,again it has to be my customers its all about putting a smile on my customers. i enjoy helping them whatever they needed from me. even helping them out to their cars
good,its an okay job though if you don't speak your mind you wont be heard.  Don't get on the wrong side of someone.  once you do the entire store knows and makes you look like the bad person in any case.
good,"Kroger Pharmacy is always changing. They do really try to make the experience better for the patient, but that also means a lot more work behind the scenes.  I worked a lot. The pharmacy was understaffed and under budgeted. Interns are pretty much worthless...they pretty much all come in with a terrible attitude and think they walk on water. I enjoyed most of the patients and had good coworkers overall."
good,"Laid back management and very cooperative with vacation time and acknowledgment of days requested off. "
good,Working at Kroger started off great but as time progressed I started to see some problems. My store had a problem with holding on to employees who were a waste of air. So it ends up being one to maybe two people doing the work of four. Other than that working there was ok and they had great benefits.
good,A typical day for me was acknowledging every customer that came within my area and usually would ask around 100-200 customers a day if they are finding everything okay and letting them know I am here to help them in any way. I also had to communicate with my co-workers all the time to make sure we were all stocking different parts of Produce. The managers were always there to help and listened to me if I ever had questions. The hardest part of my job was when I went into the cold cooler and organize everything onto the walls in the right spots and with all the older products on top. This was called down stacking. Then when I finished organizing I would write the dates on everything and clean up the cooler. But I also didn't mind because I was allowed to listen to music while I was down stacking. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I was called over to help customers in Floral. There I would help customers find the right flowers and air up any balloons they pick out.
good,The hardest part of the job was dealing with disrespectful customers. I also had to deal with people who didn't do there job. I had to go behind them and get the job done.
good,I hated my bosses and i didnt get any hours so i left. the managers are terrible and if you love sucking up to you boss you will do great there. have fun and good luck.
good,"The kroger deli is a good place to work, very friendly coworkers, it has its busy and slow days. You can try the meats and cheeses so if a costumer askes you to describe something, and they dont wanna try it, you can. But no matter how slow it was in the store, you will always be kept busy."
good,"if this was my first job i would of not stayed so long. poor management, was happy with pay and time off. loved the people i worked with besides managers."
good,"Not all Kroger are dysfunctional but I've had a couple of bad experiences at one that I worked at. I feel as though some managers take advantage of their position and their employees. Kroger is a amazing company to work for as a whole though, and the benefits are amazing as well."
good,"Pretty standard as a corporate retail goes. Not a lot of wiggle room, always clear boundaries and expectations, which is nice.  Ample benefits, undesirable retail schedule of hours, which is standard."
good,"I learned how to interact with customers better and became more acquainted with the customers of the store. However, some of my colleagues would procrastinate work and cause others to have to work twice as much. Typically, I would bag groceries for customers and go out to our parking lot when assigned. The spot-cleaning of bathrooms was also an assigned task, which I enjoyed doing. I often enjoyed bagging the groceries, as it allowed a more personal connection with customers when a conversation would occur. The hardest part, however, was perhaps picking up the slack of other's."
good,"Kroger is a great place for a first job and for experience. Also, if you stick with it long enough it can also be a great place to work your way up the ranks."
good,Nice job and company. They could pay a little more than 7.25 in the deli. I don't really much more to say in this review so this is just me using character.
good,Not an overly demanding job but definitely not for the lazy. Pay was a bit low as a primary job yet the atmosphere was fun. People are friendly and willing to get to know you.
good,"This is a very cool job. Working for kroger deli was ok work, I cooked and prepared food for daily menu. Take call in orders over phone for meat trays and get them ready for pick up"
good,"They always work with your schedule no matter what. For instance, I am a CCP student still in highschool but already starting to persue the career i want, they work with my schedule when i need a day or whatever to do studying for a test. They are very flexible as well as understanding."
good,"The work isn't too stressful, but you will need comfortable shoes or your feet will become incredibly sore from standing all day. Being friendly with people is a must."
good,It allowed me a flexible schedule when I needed it.  I was able to work the night shift so that I could still be there for my children.  The work environment was friendly and everyone pitched in to do their part.
good,It was a fun team to work with. The jobs consisted of assisting customers with their groceries. (bagging and loading vehicle) Nice job for part-time work.
good,"Kroger's a decent place to work, the managers and people up top are always willing to help address any grievances and the general work culture promotes teamwork and a positive attitude when assisting shoppers."
good,"A typical day would be medium pace, not too many customers. The other employees were super nice along with few of the managers. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to help the customers and learning about all the neat things they cook in the kitchen. The only thing I did not enjoy was the fact they told me something and it wasn't true."
good,A great first job. For a student or a person who needs employment with good benefits and well scheduled hours. Good coworkers very flexible support well-structured work environment.
good,"Working as an overnight grocer was overall very stressful and tiring. There is a lot of heavy lifting and fast movement involved in order to meet deadlines (e.g. when customers start coming in the morning). There was a lot of miscommunication between the daytime stockers and the night stockers, so the night crew often had a lot of mess to clean up that was left for us. I enjoyed being able to listen to headphones as I worked, and having a lot of fun with my coworkers due to not having many customers. We often had pizza parties and celebrated birthdays with cake."
good,"it was a great place to work, very friendly, little competitive with the older aged staff but nothing too serious. Mainly everyone treated one another like family."
good,Typical day was clocking in and going to an assigned register and interact with customers. I learned how to deal with people and interact with them on a daily basis in a friendly manner. Management was great when you have questions and concerns. Hardest part of the job were the long hours and how slow time passed. The culture was a young group of people either going through high school or college trying to learn a new job. Most enjoyable part was the people I worked with.
good,Didn't like working in this place so wouldn't really recommend it to anyone but teenagers. Flexible with hours but can be very slow paced. Low pay and not rewarding
good,Kroger is a great place to work if you are working for a summer job. That is all I used it for but according to some it was a very hard place to move up.
good,Work is fast paced.  Holiday weeks are very intense. You are always striving to be better and to better yourself.  Advancement is there for those who can prove themselves.
good,"I felt that during the seasonal holidays, there was too much work for one person to accomplish. I also found myself being pulled to different departments to help others even though I already had a lot of work myself, so they're a bit short-sighted when hiring enough people to get the job done."
good,"I enjoy working here and I enjoy the people but I cannot afford to work where I get paid basically nothing. If the pay were at least starting at $10/hour, I would stay."
good,Good place to work. Good place to work to get your foot in the door to grow. if you like to try the busy like of a great store shop on the weekends and see if u like that.
good,Good job with great benefits was a great and very community based job only wished I was trained more from a professional stand point. Had to learn a bit on my own all in all good work.
good,Each day was something different. Lots of different customers some good some bad and the same of employees. I recommend getting all the training you can.
good,"Kroger was a great place to work. Everyone is super friendly, Co-worker and management alike with the exception of maybe one or two people."
good,"My major at first was Pre-pharmacy. Lets just say pharmacy isn't for everyone. If this is your career path, it is perfect because you learn A LOT! It definitely prepares you for the field which is great. It can be very fast paced at times, customers will get unhappy with you, and you must pay attention to detail"
good,"Kroger is a good company to work for and the work environment is clean and professional. However, I don't feel the pay is very competitive and in the Pharmacy I had to work very long hours (sometimes) 10 hr days.  I am looking to gain employment in same field (Pharmacy Technician) but with hopefully more compensation and better hours.  90% of my hours are late in the evening and every weekend."
good,"The Typical day at Fred Meyers Jewelers, Including Cleaning and much more. It was a very competitive work space and on some days you might or might not be able to meet your sales goals. the commission pay was a little low for what you sold. It was a great place to work but management could use a little work."
good,I enjoyed making customers drinks. I work at Starbucks in Kroger. Making sure that everything is clean and organized. Having those drinks made in a timely manner.
good,"The management was friendly, helpful, and productive. Advancement opportunites were great and applied from within the company. I enjoyed working there and would return!"
good,Everyday was very busy. You had to be prepared to be on your toes ready for anything. Your task was not the same daily. You would be moved around constantly. You do not get to decide where you stay for the day. You have many bosses that will move you around or ask of your help. You need customer service experience to able to communicate with customers.
good,"This is an okay job for a person who is in school and who needs a little income. They are do not give you a lot if work hours but, if you ask they will give you more. Some managers are very understanding."
good,"Very high paced production facility."
good,"Nice management, good supervisor, nice pharmacidt, good organization, clean well kept pharmacy, good coworkers , fair work environment,  convent to grocery store,"
good,A typical day at Kroger would consist of me clocking in and immediate going to help at the counter to serve costumers. I learned how to slice meats and cheeses using the slicer machines. I also learned how to take orders off the phone and in the store.
good,"I have a great time working for Kroger. Sometime their expectations are to high, but I have had some great managers. Their biggest lack is since they are competing with Amazon they are squeezing everything they can get from their employees and in turn the turnover is high."
good,Good place to work a lot of chances of advancement. They work around school schedules and other things. They don't give you enough time to get everything done but wont give help to finish the job.
good,"I learned how to work with customers in difficult situations. I loved my front end managers, they were very helpful and easy to get along with, my only problem with working here was the scheduling manager never gave me more 20 hours a week, I only averaged between 11-14 hours a week."
good,Management in the meat department was great. Kroger employees were very friendly. Warm atmosphere. Customers were great. I enjoyed working with the customers. Unloading trucks in the morning was a great job. My supervisor in the meat department was a people person and very easy to work with. He appreciated everything his worker did.
good,"Kroger is a great store to work for. I want to advance my career by exploring other opportunities. A typical day at work consisted of getting tills ready, balancing the tills, ordering money, and most of all help customers that needs help."
good,"I had a temp job here and the people I first met were so nice. "
good,Good place for a temporary job. Someone who is in college and needs a part time or full time job to pay bills. Other than that doesn't pay well enough to keep the job long term.
good,the job is basically unloading the trucks and getting the products ready for it to be taken to the sales floor and sometimes help the customer with their merchandise like furniture and finally cleaning the store
good,"Last I worked there it was enjoyable. Mostly the job was revolved around customer relation and keeping your work area neat. I would have enjoyed to work there a full 40 hours and perhaps overtime. They might offer full time now, its been a few years"
good,"Most shifts were constantly busy, but management was rarely on anyone's case about how fast they completed a task. Management was also fair when it came to requesting time off."
good,I really enjoy working in a department that is like family.  All of my co-workers are willing to help everyone with issues they might have and work through them together to come to a solution.
good,"kroger Corp is a good place to work.  Good pay, but no advancement opportunities.  Insurance is good for single and married.  Union environment but overall its good"
good,"Kroger is a good place to work, but its a temporary job for me till I get something in my career field. The most enjoyable part of my job would be getting to know my coworkers, they are cool and funny at times."
good,"Several things will be going down at anytime.  You will have bosses always in, audits, customer needs, stocking, staying in stock,  with a lot of deadlines."
good,"It's a nice place to work and the people that work there are friendly, but it feels like it is not very easy to move to a different position that might be better."
good,I enjoy the fast pace and friendly environment of associates and customers.  There is also a diverse amount of duties for everyone. Whethere you are management or associate there are always opportunity.
good,working here was fine i just needed a little more money and more hours but i loved the people and the customs where greatly i love talking to poeple so this was a good job for me
good,Good people work here hello pay weekly work well with schedules and good advancement opportunities! Parent worked here when it was m and m groceries long time wish they paid better though
good,"overall, Kroger is not a bad place to work at. Management will work with you on your schedule, so you can take days off when needed. the only issue is they do not hire full time unless you are in some part of management."
good,"The workload is fairly unbalanced, you can be painstakingly slow one day and breaking your back the next. On the slow days, usually you're helping other departments and that teaches you some new things. "
good,"The workplace is very relaxing, but depending on who you are working with it can be a little bit stressful & unpleasing. I loved the majority of my fellow employees."
good,"it was a sort of relaxed job, although did have to be fast. started off as a bagger then in a week moved up to a dept. produce, people were great, no hard job."
good,"Usually busy, always moving, got to be alert and attentive. I learned how to interact more with customers, Multitask , and some stocking responsibilities"
good,"Kroger is a unionized workplace with job security. there are opportunities for advancement. The overall work/life balance is fair. Full time employees usually have higher pay but do not have flexible hours and less of a work/life balance. Department managers have a higher level of stress associated with the job, minimal work/life balance, less appreciation from store managers for the job they do. advancement in to management comes with a different set of challenges. almost no work/life balance, pay does not equal the amount of work done, and relocation within the city is done without any notice."
good,"Working here is a decent place to work, you learn new things every day, and management is good. Working at the self checkout section, you get to move around a bit while helping customers."
good,"typical day face pace get in and out. management is good just depends what store your at. but its laid back easy job just work fast, good memory and get dirty when need be"
good,Working at Kroger's is great for it being your first job. The pay is good depending on which department your apply for. Kroger's is a really good friendly job.
good,"Kroger is a great place to work if you want part time. it is very hard to get hired on as full time, and it goes by seniority. the pay is not too bad and is weekly."
good,This was my first job and i loved it! Everyone was so nice and accepting. Made so many friends that i have kept over the years and we still talk. Loved the job and made friends with returning customers. I didnt mind waking up every morning to go to work. We showed up to put in the hours while also having fun throughout the day!
good,"I was a cashier. It is what I expected, being courteous, helpful, and engaging with customers while checking them out. You also had to show signs of improving at faster checkout. Was not hard, but mainly busy work. Some older members were chatty at the store I worked in, but I avoided the drama and always made sure my till was accounted for."
good,It was a very good place to work for the experience. The only problem is they did not pay well and not much room for advancement. They did have really good benefits.
good,"Working there was very fun until they switched hiring managers. I didn't like how all of a sudden we had to stand at the entrance of our lanes, and the hiring manager at the time was always looking to fire people. The atmosphere changed a lot after that."
good,"The only issue I had was lack of help for the shift I worked. It takes more than four or five people to stock 20+ aisles AND clean and buff the floors overnight. Management was unhelpful in the matter and most others as well, but management for one store cannot and should not speak for a company as a whole. I love Kroger stores and I enjoyed working for the company, just not the immediate managers I worked under because they turned a blind eye to the night crew issues. This is a good place to work if you enjoy working hard. You work hard no matter what position you have and I find that it's satisfying when the job is complete."
good,"Being there is very fun."
good,"A typical day started with clocking in and asking the floor manager what register needed opened. In this job I learned how to handle money, do wic forms and coupon discounts. "
good,"I have worked for two different locations of Kroger stores. The first location provided a good schedule. I did have issues with the department manger at both locations to be honest. "
good,I could work overtime if I wanted to go to other stores. The work was great because I love working with the public. The supervisors kept me busy which I also like. I enjoyed working as a cashier.
good,"Past pace environment, decent hours with decent pay, Kroger offers good benefits, whether full-time or part-time. I would recommend to teenagers looking for a part-time job"
good,Decent place to work if its your first job or a in between job flexible hours nice staff and most customers are friendly pay come be better but not to bad .
good,"I basically lived there but for the most part, they treated me fairly well. I learned more at Freddies then any other job to this day. Management fluctuated so often, it is hard to pinpoint success. Lots of customer service. The hardest part was probably the repetition and the fact that the finished job never lasted more then a day. Was hard to see satisfaction out of your own work. Best part was the pay and benefits by far."
good,I really enjoyed my time working for Kroger and i definitly would recommend anyone to work there. Its a very good place to start working if you need summer jobs or something.
good,Great people great customers the pay could be better as well as the hours shouldn't have to find a second job especially since I love my job some managers are great
good,"Great company with good pay and benefits, but you trade your life to receive them. It's retail, and as such you will be required to work a minimum of 50 hours per week, all holidays and weekends."
good,"Not too much to say, i loved the people there. Working with people is amazing, i love it. I liked the discounts that we received. what i did not like was how poor all of the scheduling was handled."
good,I took a temporary holiday job that continued after the holidays were over. Our local Kroger has great management and the employees really felt like a good team to work together to provide the best experience for our customers. I would recommend this to someone just starting out or needing flexible hours. They are great to work with and there are opportunities to move up in management.
good,"Some store managers can be quite negative and give critique in front of others, then some store managers were great but got promoted out of the stores. Which was sad for us."
good,Kroger could be a great place to work if we follow the training provided.  The work/life balance is not in place.  We need to address issues as they happen.
good,It was a relaxed steady job. We did the same routine everyday and got the job done by the end of our shift. I like having a job where I do them same routine everyday.
good,Typically when arriving at the store an cashier will clock in and go to the register that they are on for the day. Their job is to keep customers happy while also keeping their scan times up.
good,"Kroger is a good company to work for, but if you want weekends or Sundays off for family or church , don't count on it. It's hard to get it off because the work and life balance is messed up. Good benefits, raises every 6 months, but the balance isn't fair. Be prepared to to get reprimanded for others in your department not doing their job."
good,"As my first job, I had a lot of fun with this job. The way I see it though. It is what you make it. You can concentrate on the negatives, or you can look at the positives. Meeting all kinds of people, great work environment, experience in retail, etc."
good,Nice place to work. Need to hire more qualified associates. Need more competitive pay. I have worked all over the store more recent night shift lead & it has proven to be a bit difficult. I have also worked floral & produce. Worked directly with vendors. I have to manage a group & been held responsible for them
good,This was my first job and I loved it. The managers and the people there were amazing. They were flexible and I would go back in a heartbeat if I could.
good,i enjoyed working at krogerers. being able to see all my childhood teachers and neighboors and being able to help them with their groceris and find certain things was a cool expierence for me.
good,"I liked Kroger's because it was very interesting to learn about different products in house, especially, the produce section where I worked everyday.."
good,"The benefits are very good for a grocery store job, which helps balance out the decent hourly wage. Management has been an obstacle, as they seem to make your everyday routine more difficult with little consideration of your time. They try to cram 10 hours of work into an 8 hour day. The hardest part of the job is how management expects perfection under far-from-perfect circumstances."
good,"the work isn't hard, the scheduling is reasonable, but you compensate with the pay. when they say minimum wage, they mean it. 30 min lunches. ideal if you don't like working with customers."
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with in the pharmacy, and they would give their shirt off their back for any of the employees. It was like a family atmosphere, the only issue we ran into was that because of the union we couldn't negotiate pay/benefits. Even though the pharmacist knew we deserved to get paid more there wasn't anything they could do to improve our situation."
good,"everyday can be something different, some days are busier than others. managers are great. well the store managers some department managers do take the power to their head. but overall it is a good work experience."
good,Fun once you get into the groove. Works with my schedule perfectly. I enjoy working here. It's not far from home so the commute is perfect. I am currently trying to get full time.
good,"A typical day at work is busy and productive, Ive learned how to work with insurance companies, dealing with insurance copay's and eligibility based on insurance enrollment. Working with people of all ages and ethnicity with the right communication skills. Hardest part is making sure everyone leaves with the best services. I enjoy the social interactions with our customers!"
good,"The co managers were mostly good but they never really took much action when they really should have. The big problem is the Lead for my department, doing nothing but telling me to fix everything she does wrong throughout the day yet going outside to smoke for way longer than allowed to anyone."
good,"This is a large company that tries hard to care. I appriciated working here, they are largely good people and i liked my boss. I advanced quickly with hard work and was shown appriciation regularly."
good,"I brought a lot of experience into the store and I think that they would offer more training for advancement other than basic Cashiers/Fuel Clerk.   An asset my mine is I am honest and detailed, when questioned in an unprofessional manner I stand up for myself and that is really frowned on by mid-mgmt."
good,"Mostly worked as an apparel clerk. I learned that everybody that works there is only there for themselves. Management is good. When the day is busy, the day goes by fast. The hardest thing in my opinion was if everything was completed earlier in the day; the day seemed to pass much slower."
good,"It's an unusual workplace, with many wonderful people working there. Even though sometimes we would get an unexpected rush everyone met to meet our customer's needs.  Some management wasn't good, but I'm not going to let that rot my view of the workplace. Overall I was pretty satisfied working there. Except there isn't any opportunity for moving up and getting a good raise while moving up, pretty pleased with the diversity."
good,in my opinion I have learned a lot from this job it was my first job and this place is where I learned how to value customers first very upbeat place to work. pay on the other hand was very minimum.
good,Great people to work with except for the management. Always changing rules on how to stock. Great hours but not enough pay. 40+ hrs full time but overtime is frowned upon. Cashier's barely get brakes. Never want to promote more cashier's.  Constant problems with union and the store.
good,"very friendly environment, I learned patience and perseverance when it came to handling many different personalities. management tried to help as much as possible to make the day go smoothly"
good,"I enjoyed my short time with this company.They were lenient with arriving late ,which was minimal.The breaks are fair ,giving you enough time to shop in store for your lunch.The restrooms are tended to periodically to ensure cleanliness and functionality."
good,"Depending on department, age range and personality of coworkers changes drastically. Front end (cashiers, baggers, etc.) typically college- age or younger. Great for a first job or for a job while attending college."
good,I loved working for Kroger. The management is very understanding and they're always willing to work with you. The company seems to genuinely care about their employees.
good,"I worked with a fun team and had a good experience. It can take quite a while to gain significant advancements, it ended up being dead-end for me. But there is terrific job security and work-life balance. You can get off pretty much any days you want (paid or unpaid)."
good,"Working at krogers for being an cart attendant I would not recommend to anyone because you have to go outside in the hot, cold, snow, rain, storm, or anything to push carts in they do not care what the circumstances are. The managers there are also easily irritated and rude, they start off at minimum wage payment but the job you do is worth the little pay they offer you because it's an easy tasked job, it's more for teenagers I'll say."
good,Management is great! I got injured out side of work and it had me on restrictions most of management worked with me and wanted to keep me going work wise but store manager did not want that kind of liability (understandable) There is not enough work hours given to lower end workers.
good,The Kroger call center is an awesome laid back work environment with a lot of growth opportunity. If you can get past the low pay this is a great place to work.
good,It is a great place to work and I would recommend working there to a friend. I planning on still working there if I have an opportunity to receive another job in my field in which I attended school for.
good,Working at Kroger's taught me how to deal with different people on a everyday bases. Different employees taught me new things like faster ways to work while getting the job done right . I never doing produce could be so fun.
good,it is a very fast paced enviorment the are the best at assisting customers with what ever the customers are looking for and if one employee is not able to assist them in some way they will find someone else that can help the customer.
good,I had a grate team that I worked with. Management was excellent it was the perfect after high school job. allowed me to get a variety of experience. It was very easy to move up.
good,A typical work day is face paced. I learn something new every day. Whether its in store with a new program or another way to help a customer. Management is up to par. Hardest part of the job is the hours. And the most enjoyable part is assisting customers.
good,Very organized workplace. A lot of cross work. Not paid enough. You will do the work of several people but the pay is not increased when you have experience.
good,The people who worked here were mostly awesome.  The only pitfall was working for minimum wage.  They were willing to give me hours that I needed and were always looking for advancement opportunities for me.
good,"This is a very good job if you are in high school or just need a summer job. They are very willing to work with your schedule and school is very important to them. As far as a forever job, it is hard to get a full time position there and get benefits at all. You would work full time without the benefits of full time and also be doing minimum wage. Management isn't always the greatest."
good,I really enjoyed working here you had some good days and bad days but what store doesn't I started off a bagger then went to a cashier my transition was pretty fast
good,A typical day involves showing up at your assigned start time. You input data into the computer systems and pull orders. You then spend the rest of the day routing orders out of each of Kroger's distribution centers.
good,"work days were pretty simple, repetitive most the time"
good,Working for Kroger was a great experience for me. It was my first job working in a union and I really loved how we had the union to stand up for the employees.
good,"Kroger is a good company to work at if you are someone who likes to keep busy, which I was. "
good,"I learned how to communicate with people better and how to handle the worse situation the best way. It was a very active job and were on your feet 8 hours a day. The management was great, if you had a question do not hesitate on asking because they were always there to help you with anything;."
good,"Day involved stocking merchandise, assisting customers, providing customer service for other customers. Hardest part is the lunch rush on weekdays and the Sunday rush throughout the day. Co-workers are fun to work with."
good,"Great place to start as a technician and learn basics. Very easy to use computer system, Work the you schedule and have good benefits. Liked that you can work in different stores if hours need."
good,I submitted a Kroger review prior to this one that describes how i feel about the company which should be reviewed instead of another duplicate one as this.
good,The main manager was a hard working individual who is a nice guy. You can move up to a higher position. You can earn a higher wage. A downside is the fact that you are on your feet a lot.
good,"Enjoyed my time there. The company highly encourages that management & employees provide positive feedback to other employees which makes working there very nice."
good,I spent three and a half years working for King Soopers. I learned that I enjoy meeting coworkers and building relationships with them and I do not like customer service.
good,Worked at a bagger at the grocery store and the job was pretty much fast paced but I didn't work there long enough to properly rate them but the company was alright for example they had a union but they never mentioned how one could move up or advance in the company and since I only worked part-time I wasn't eligible for benefits.
good,It's a fast pace job with bare minimum crew. With a small crew it's easy to find work to do but can be difficult to keep shelves stocked at times. Most of the crew had been there since open so everyone was always aware of what was needed to be done.
good,Kroger has Starbucks' inside so lots of awesome drinks and pastries to sample.   Other than that its your typical grocery store.  Busy and functional but could be fun.
good,What I've learned from Kroger's is great commutation skills.. and great friendly management  the people there are very nice its not a hard job at all.
good,"The job was enjoyable, I liked interacting with and being able to assist the customers, especially the elderly. Things changed when I got a new department supervisor. Our store had special requirements from corporate because of our location. She refused to follow them, which made my job much harder to perform."
good,"The people are great and the work is fine. It's a lot of physical work not brain work which I don't mind. The work can get repetitive but that's just how retail is.The main problem I have is that there is no set schedule, every week is different and there are never set days off unless you request them."
good,Great place to work at most managers are very helpful and Caring.i will recommend the Kroger company to anyone looking for a part time or full time job.
good,Kroger's was a good place to work but my time has come to a end because I'm tired of  getting paid 8.50 I do too much for the store for them to only pay me that. There fore my time has come to a end
good,"I was only there for a little of a year but there were plenty of opportunities for advancement. I'm sure if I wanted too, I could have moved up the ladder to be a store manager but I didn't want to smell like coffee all day long."
good,"Company is in a very competitive segment.  "
good,The work was not difficult but I was not getting enough hours to pay my travel expenses to and from work. I got along with my co-workers and management just could not afford working there.
good,I'm assuming this is a great place to work. I've worked in the photo lab and loved it. People always seem to be in a great mood which in turn puts me in a great mood.
good,I enjoy working at Turkey hill. Most of the customers are pleasant and come in on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people and having a relationship with the  regulars. The workplace culture is very pleasant. There is really nothing really hard about this job. Sometimes you will get a customer who is having a bad day and they are not pleasant but it all comes with the job.
good,"Very nice company to work for.  they work with you on flexible hours. fun atmosphere but still very productive. Very busy environment, must be ready to work fast paced."
good,I enjoyed my experience till the policies changed and they changed direction of the company. Not a fan of them going to prepackaged meat. It has a family atmosphere that I enjoyed.
good,"Working here was fine. I can't use them as a reference anymore due to having to quit short notice for a job opportunity I couldn't pass up. It was hard working with a bunch of highschoolers, but it paid the bills. It was fine."
good,I feel the managers are overworked and underpaid. Other employees are usually very nice with a mix of nice and mean supervisors. I think as a first job for a teen this is a fine place to start.
good,I learned a lot about the workplace and how to manage subordinates.  I enjoyed the people I worked with but struggled with managing workers older than I am because they did not listen to my instructions well because of my age.
good,"meeting new people and making friends "
good,kroger was a very fun place to work for me. i love interacting with people and i'm always willing to offer assistance. being able to help people is rewarding.
good,"I don't remember much about working here because it was so long ago. To summarize, I did get treated well by everyone. Management in my department was stellar, but outside was hit and miss."
good,The Kroger influence is critical to keep all banners consistent.   Food 4 Less improved as Kroger policies became more prevalent.  My most satisfying part of my day was interacting with my customers.  Learning their needs and wants and trying to fulfill each one of them.   I developed most of my skills as a Store Director with Food 4 Less.  The hardest part of my day to day operations was truly getting the team to understand the value of many of the new programs.   Many of them were very short lived.
good,"Days were usually not too bad, mostly just bagging groceries and getting carts. Had to clean occasional spills from time to time. Management was okay for the most part besides one or two managers"
good,I enjoyed my time running the toy dept at Fred Meyers for 9 years and now i am ready to focus on my dream and work in the forest or in a park that as forest theme to it.
good,The scheduling was really flexible. I was able to talk to the management about my class schedule and work my job scheduling around that. It was easy to catch on and overall a nice place to work.
good,"The work wasn't bad but they didn't always respect you're allowed hours. Other than that it wasn't a bad job, simply just working the register, pushing carts, bagging groceries, and restocking shelves."
good,"Typical day make pallets, load 18 wheelers, sweat a lot, work like a mexican. Also take into account that your production has to meet a certain criteria until your back gives out."
good,like most retail food stores it all depends on which department you work in.  there is opportunities to move up and they pay based on previous employment
good,"Great customer service, but could use a better pre employment screening. I would recommend anyone to work for this company. Plenty of room for advancement."
good,"I was cross trained in every department, and all the jobs are fairly easy. I personally liked stocking the shelves the best because time went by fast."
good,"Fantastic managers, 10% employee discount, typical deli counter. Requires proper handling of raw and cooked meats and side dishes. Hardest part for me was the cooking. Most enjoyable part was co-worker and management work relationships."
good,My experience at Kroger is that it's not the best job but it could be worse.  Management is really the only thing that I can really complain about. And the breaks we're to short.
good,"Kroger typical day is busy and has a lot of customers.I learned a lot about management, inventory and stocking products. The hardest part of my job is keeping every customer happy."
good,"I learned that joining a union can be good but also bad at the same time. I believe that when your assigned a task you should do it and do it the right way, however everyone is different and some people think that because joining the union they don't have to do their job."
good,"After working here for a year and a half I am proud to have moved up and through positions and responsibilities I had. The management was great, except when we would get new managers and they wouldn't know how the store actually ran, they just needed help, but made it more stressful than it was."
good,"They work you really hard and pay you bare minimum and take forever to promote you when they know you deserve it."
good,They will train you well and give you plenty of work to do but the amount of work you do vs how much you get paid is ridiculous. Dealing with customers and doing bookkeeping in the morning but only receiving minimum wage is insane. I could be washing dishes at a restaurant for more money and be less stressful. You'll learn great people skills and money counting but the pay is so low.
good,"Kroger is a great place to work. They provide great opportunities for people that are willing to work hard and commit to the company.  If you are looking for a long term career Kroger is a good place for that, good benefits, and stable income."
good,cut the meat up and a right size for the customer or measure the salede in the cup....work also in the freezing part of the store also working with the hot meals ..we cook chicken mac n cheese and more
good,Being able to help provide people with medication they needed was an honor and pleasure. I had a chance to learn about the oversight and care needed for our customers so they could get the medication they needed and further expanded my social interaction with others.
good,"As a full-time college student trying to balance work and school is hard, but they work around my schedule very well. The training process is long but you are fully prepared for the first day you step into the pharmacy."
good,"When I worked at Kroger I worked in the Deli area.  I enjoyed the people whom I worked with-I liked the way they treated me but, to my surprise the person in charge of the department did not like me.  I know that there are times when people do not get along but this was uncalled for.  For some reason she did not want me trained.  I had taken 4 bad falls in the deli area due to the fact that one of the ovens leaked on to the floor.  I loved working with the customers and making them happy.  I did quit due to the person in charge of the department.  I had given my 2 week and I was asked to stay.  So I did.  But, she would not have me trained??? I wanted to be trained so that I could give the customer the best.  Management knew about the confect. At time I would LOVE to go back to but due to the manner in which I quit I cannot.  I made sure that management knew want was going on.  I did receive a lot of rewards and a merit award due to my Good Customer Service."
good,This is a great job for someone who loves interacting with others on a daily basis. There's always something to do if you're the type who likes to keep busy. The customers are friendly and so are the staff members. Even if you are part time you average 27-32 hours while working 5-6 days a week. Most companies start you at the state minimum wage even with experience; but Kroger offers experience pay which can be $2-$5 more than the minimum wage.
good,The mangers and employees at the store I worked at got along well. We worked together to make sure the customers had the products and services they needed. They put family first as well. This made it easy for me with my son if he got sick or the babysitter had to leave.
good,"Constantly moving around, problem solving, and interacting with customers. Strong team building and a very cooperative work place. Long and hard days of heavy lifting and walking the store."
good,A typical day a work was very fast-paced. Everything was fair is terms of pay wage and how everyone was treated as employees. I would recommend Kroger for at least a first job (like mine).
good,"A typical day at King Soopers started around 5:30 a.m. were I started reviewing back stock and working all required stocking procedures and then analyzing the shelves, and condition the product on the shelves (pulling Forward). Waiting for the daily load to show up, in which it usually showed up around 9a.m. in the morning I then broke the load down into product sections."
good,"Kroger is an okay place to work at, they have great benefits and you get a raise every six months. The hardest part of the job is when customers get angry with you over little mistakes."
good,The days were busy and quick paced. The people I worked with were fun and very sweet to work with.  We were always busy but that meant the days we by quickly. I would spend most of my days counting medications out or releasing medications to patients. Many of the patients were in the store several times a week so you really got to know and build relationships with the people in the community. The pay was a little below the competition and the raises were all on a schedule.
good,I enjoy a day at work because there is always something to do at work. Every employee is happy and always willing to help the customers find what they're looking for or an alternative. My favorite part of the job is being able to do my job and management trusts me to do my job in a quick and reasonable time.
good,"Kroger was my first union job, going into it I had to idea what to expect. But surprisingly everyone was very polite & easy to work with. It was also my first over night job & seeing as I had another job at the time (part time at subway) 3rd shift wasn't a option anymore."
good,"A typical day at work include; getting my job done making sure product got to the shelves, while multitasking and maintaining outstanding customer service.  Ensuring customers were acknowledged and helped. For me personally working at Kroger, was very fast pace environment which I liked. I worked with planograms that involved putting shelves and product together to build a displayed that would stand out to customers.  "
good,Kroger is a good place to work for if you're a student looking for income to supplement your living expenses. Management is involved and responsive to the day-to day happenings of the company.
good,"-Fast pace environment "
good,The hours are fair and allow for students to hold a job while they pursue their desired education.  There are career advancement and transfer opportunities when available.
good,This store is well organize and take time and care to help their employees and customers. They ask you do you want to be train in a certain position instead of forcing you to do something that you did not sign up for.
good,"The workers at Kroger openly talk about recreational drug use with the management and half the time don't even do their job. Also, they don't give you breaks."
good,typical day at work i was solo. learned how to operate a few machines. management was good. enjoyed the trust in the workplace. hardest part is enduring the cold for long periods in the refrigerator.
good,"Decent company for which to work, but shabby benefits. The contract raises/benefits, which are voted upon, usually never meet all expectations. Staffs are friendly and management is helpful."
good,"It was a very good first job. Management was great, followed your schedule. The only down side was the pay was low and even after working for a year no raise was given."
good,"As a Kroger employee, I have found joy in working for some of the best supervisors, ever. I? I have been treated with great respect from all aspects of the work force and will highly recommend working in the Loss Prevention field."
good,Kroger helped put me through college as my first real job. The skills I learned there were ones I continued to build on and use through each subsequent job. A great place to start out as a first job.
good,Kroger is a very good place to work. I loved working there and with my coworkers. Management is very good. I would recommend anyone to shop there. Its a great place to shop. Prices a very reasonable.
good,As a barista I was a little separate from the rest of the store and typically the baristas were to police themselves with little interaction from a management figure. I learned to prioritize jobs and how to interact with customers while preforming tasks. Overall the job was simple and not difficult to preform well. My coworkers were very supportive and helpful as well as being fun and friendly. At the time I worked there we were understaffed and became almost full time employees even though only the supervisor was full time. As far as bad experiences none come to mind. I left for a more sustainable income.
good,Very good worker. Always early for work. Work holidays. Would prefer 40 hr week. Trained in just about any type of work. Fast food restaurants grocery stores old people homes
good,"Its fun to work there since ,"
good,"clean the rest rooms empty the trash get buggies out of the parking lot.I learned to be more of a people person,how to use a cash regeister.good works"
good,"Fun place to work with good people and managers, sometimes late and long hours required to complete daily work, which is the most difficult part of the workdays.  Overall good place to work and good people to work with, which is the most enjoyable part of the workdays.  Good management, and workplace culture, and I learned that it takes hard work and lifting to work in the deli."
good,"Kroger was the fisrt company to hire me, when I needed a job it has been job to me for the most part but i cant not live on what I make. and my start off was lower than that and I have worked for them for two years now."
good,It was ok and I provided customer service to all customers and gather carts from the parking lot and some customers was nice and some of them was impatient.
good,"Over all working at McDonald's for my first job was easy. My coworkers were helping and always willing to help. Closing always went smooth, great beginning job."
good,"I enjoy working for Kroger due to coworkers and some customers. A typical day at work is spent engaging with regulars and meeting new interesting people. However, there are a few negatives (in no particular order). 1. Management - It seems most managers are always...scatter-brained. Every time a competent manager comes in, he disappears months later without warning. 2. Pay-rate - As a courtesy clerk, I can honestly say that I don't get paid well enough to do my job. Bagging groceries, getting carts and helping customers? Yeah no problem. But basically being a janitor for most of the time at $7.25 an hour and never achieving 40 hours a week? I question my sanity. 3. Jukebox - To put it bluntly, our music selection is terrible at the best of times."
good,"Kroger reached a point in their stratagem where changes needed to made to reduce Administrative costs.  A One-time Voluntary Retirement Offer was extended to 2000 employees at the Management level.  The offer was generous and provides me an opportunity to seek employment that will be fresh, challenging, and  where I can provide value added in Senior level capacity as a leader, mentor and ""bridge skills"" for companies working to move into more current technologies, but need to maintain legacy systems until such time they may be sunset. "
good,was family oriented and had a way of always helping the community and was willing to work with your appointments and other life unexpectancy.  was a great starter job.
good,"I have only ever been employed by Kroger, so my review has limited insight. Kroger forced frequent interactions with customers, which helped me develop great customer service abilities. Culture depends on location and managers. Working in the meat and seafood department included many duties such as cleaning, stocking, packing meat, weighing meat, and grinding meats. At the end of every shift you need to take down the displays, which can be tedious. The work is hard, but anyone can do it. The work is rewarding, but the payout only makes sense if you're looking for a start or seeking health care/retirement benefits. Some managers micromanage while others leave you to the wolves. You're likely to encounter many management styles and meet a diverse background of people. I enjoyed it, and would return if there was more financial incentive."
good,Good place to work for the summer very nice people always there to help. Always worked around my school scheduled when needed.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time working for Kroger. The management is comprised of some very loving and caring people. Their pay is just a little less than I could accept and found no way of increasing my pay. Also, they wouldn't offer me full time."
good,Customers were always nice and I never had a problem helping them when asked a question. My co-workers were always helpful. If I needed their help they would help with no trouble. I liked working there a lot.
good,Kroger is typically a face paced workplace with many great people to interact with.  The retail world is an ever changing environment which makes for an exciting experience. Kroger's emphasis on customer satisfaction holds true through all levels of the organization.
good,"I have not work at this company for already about 5 years at pharmacy so I do not have much to say. Coming, taking bottles, scanning, putting in bag, bag in a tote which belong to store number. After that lunch. Then same over again and going home. I liked to work at Home care because I like to help people. Same as Kroger. It was very fast job and day went by so fast. plus you can always read some information about medications."
good,It was an alright place to work. The pay could have been much better. My advice to anyone looking to work for them is to work overnight. More money and hours.
good,"We process and fill 300+ prescriptions daily at a very fast pace. "
good,Krogers is a great place to work the people are great I think it's just time for a change in my life wood like to try something different.
good,"Get to work clock in. Get Started on my custodial duties. Next, clear the parking lot of shopping carts and trash. Next, help cashiers bag customers groceries and sometimes escort customer to car."
good,Kroger is a great place to work. They are very flexible and are able to work with your schedule. The work is very simple anyone can catch on quickly.
good,"Nice people, good place to work. Just cant really advance if your not cool with management. Didnt like that. Customers are friendly. Too much is asked of you."
good,Kroger is a great place to work if you do not have kids.  It is hard to put your family on hold to work the odd shifts.  The customer service is a key factor driven by all management and makes doing your job fun.
good,Fast pased environment. Always busy. Covered for employees who were out. Overall a good company to work for. Had great people to work with.
good,The management was a little unorganized. The most enjoyable part of working at Kroger was the interaction with customers.
good,Rulers has great pay and benefits.. it's a great company for our customers. It's a hard job never no down time. I love the fast pace. Meeting customers everyday.
good,I've been working at Kroger for 2 and a half years. I've been in the same position for those 2 years and aim at getting a better position. I really want to start making more money than what I'm already making.
good,"This job sucks makes me feel like im not improving at all, it helped me realize tht i can do better for myself and find a better job to support myself"
good,"A lot of the fellow employees, including myself, did not get the proper training needed and where left alone clueless. I even know a manager there who told me that Krogers put in a new employee and he was left alone entirely, without training, for a whole week. I only got a single day of training before I worked alone four to five nights. It wasn't a good experience for me, and instead of telling me about the things I was doing wrong or properly training me, they fired me and then told me what I was doing wrong. These errors could have been fixed a lot earlier with a confrontation."
good,A regular day at work consists of just helping people get what they need as fast as possible. The coworkers are friendly to say the least and it was fairly clam and easy. Just dealing with people who are angry for no reason seemed to be the most difficult.Lunch time was high pace and time just went by quickly was what i liked the most.
good,"Good employees, management had problems with communication, learned how to be a better person towards other people. Best part of the day was being able to help customers solve problems. Thee hardest part was dealing with customers screaming at you from time to time."
good,"Great benefits and salary for a first job.  I moved up quickly because I conform to the status quo.  Once in a management position, you have great pay and benefits."
good,I have learned so much with Kroger's and the people their were so nice and patient ..I would always go out of my way to help anyone even employees . the hardest part of the job was making sure everything was stocked and perfect for the next day
good,"a typical day is all work no play."
good,"Usually the work days are slow in the morning and then they get busy in the afternoon during the hours between 12pm and 6pm. I learned a lot about my first job. I leaned how to get a job, I learned how to work in a fast, moderate, and slow environment. I learned how to satisfy guest, and i also learned to listen to guest and understand their needs and wants more. The management at this job was okay because managers use to move around from store to store and i never knew the reason why but adapting to it was probably the hardest part about it because once i was use to doing what one manager told me, then another manager would come around and have a different concept on how to do certain things. Most of the co workers that were there were friends that i went to high school with which made the job a little bit better but this also had a downfall about it too because they would like to play when things get serious and that made things go downhill."
good,Kroger is a great company to grow in. There are many opportunities move up within the company if you are willing to put in the time and dedication.
good,"I love this job. I really felt accepted here by my co-workers. I have experience in ordering supplies, products, working with customers  to meet their needs. The front end (which is where I worked was very cold. I felt pleased when I satisfied a customer. Our management staff was always accessible. I also worked in different departments such as deli, bakery, inventory, and grocery."
good,"Kroger is a great place to work. Although they are part of the Union, you don't get paid as much as what you should, and that is also coming from the Dept. Managers. The management was really good until they hired a couple, and since then it's gone down hill really bad. They are now super strict and you don't have as much fun working as what you use to. They do have a thing now where they pay you so much per hour you work in one quarter that can go up to $1 for every hour you worked there in that quarter. But it all depends on how many customers took the Kroger survey. They did provide free lunches occasionally, and there were free drinks in the conference room. Though there were people higher up than you who yelled at you for not doing your job when they obviously didn't do their job themselves, and everyone is really cliquey, it's a pretty decent place to work at. Sometimes it wasn't a professional place to work at. the fact that everyone gossiped about you while you weren't there, but was best friends with you to your face...this was mainly the Dept Managers and Assistant Managers. The hardest part of my job was dealing with people when they were upset that their medicine wasn't ready, or was to high of a copay and it shouldn't have been that high. I loved the majority of my coworkers, my regulars at work were the most enjoyable."
good,This place teaches you great customer service and will meet new people and be treated with common courtesy they also give you good benefits. But start you off with low pay and cut your hours if you are part time.
good,fun work place family like environment good pay good benefits but management could be better good job security abut split off days throws of your personal life a bit.
good,Okay company to work for. Health care isn't very good. Plenty of room for advancement. They promote from within. Better to work for non unionize stores
good,"even though it was busy most days everything went along well, co workers were nice except some of the older ones. I did not like going outside for an hour to gather up carts"
good,"I learned to communicate and be social with employees, the most enjoyable part was making friends, my co-workers were helpful and friendly and fun to work with, and the hardest part is leaving them."
good,"This store is a very busy place. All of our departments are typically working consistently and attending to customers almost endlessly. There is rarely ever a slow day. Customers can be quite harsh. Compared to a lot of places I've seen, this place has the most unruly customers and they are arguably the hardest part about this job. Even other Mariano's I've been to going closer to Chicago have a greater amount of pleasant customers. The work environment can be tough, but great coworkers make a busy day manageable. I've grown a lot with the company and learned a lot about customer service, my various experiences in several departments, and how to improve myself in ways I never would have guessed. That's what I enjoy about working there, we are always challenged and given plenty of room to grow across the whole store."
good,I enjoyed working with my co-workers. They were friendly and helpful. I felt like my work was contributing to the company. My supervisors were happy to help me and other co-workers.
good,Great opportunity to advance in the company. A lot of hard physical work. My main issue is not being able to make plans because of the random schedule every week.
good,It's a good place to start when looking for a job. If you want to get somewhere in that company however you must be aware that you can't appease everyone aND you have to work hard for what you want.
good,wanted to go back to Kroger but they would leave me by myself to run the office run a register and self checkout after 10:30 till close.
good,Kroger is a good place to start your career specially if you have completed your high school and trying to reach out to your bachelors. Exposure is the main benefit you can get from people and colleagues  if you want to.otherwise people stay at the same stage for years who don't strive hard to move up.
good,Kroger provided an awesome work environment. Taught alot of skills with working with costumers on an daily basis. Brought out the costumer service skills that i had previously from my other jobs.
good,"Mariano's is one of the best grocery stores in the state of Illinois. In almost every store you'll see bright smiles, amazing prices and deals and most importantly, happy customers."
good,The pay starts off low but if you stay to about 5 years the pay goes significantly. Its very stable job. It is a lot of work tho.
good,"Based on your schedule it would tell you what department you will be working. In any department you will be stocking product to make sure the shelves are full for customers. I have learned time management, a lot of customer service and people skills when talking to customers. Management made sure we worked as a team  and told us how good we were working together. I loved every co-worker I worked with regardless of the department I went in. When were a big family that had each others backs. I think the hardest part of the job was having to pick up other peoples slack. When you come into work your kind of picking up after someone else like where they left off. Also when your in the middle of trying to get things done and your pulled to a different department. I don't like leaving a job unfinished. But the enjoyable thing is the bonds you that you make with the people you work with is what made it great to come to work everyday knowing you had people to help you out in some way."
good,"Great first time job that offers flexible hours especially for students, the environment is fantastic! Most fun at a job, however the pay is severely low compared to other jobs in similar places."
good,"Good manager and co-workers. Worked part time during school. Very accommodating to a students schedule. I was able to gain a lot of pharmacy knowledge, which helped with future careers."
good,"I enjoyed working at the gas station for as long as i did. My fuel lead helped me a lot when i needed days off or coming in late or needing to leave early. The job isn't that difficult to do. The only problem was pay raises, fours years working their and only went up a dollar."
good,"Packed grocery items in paper or plastic bags.  Arranged heavy and bulky items at bottom of bags. Verified price of grocery items on stock shelf, upon request. Carried packed bags, in grocery cart, and pushed cart to customer's vehicle. I learned how to manage time and work in a fast pace environment. Management was good and co-workers were helpful. The hardest part of the job was retrieving store carts from parking lot. The most enjoyable part of the job was visiting with customers while helping with their groceries."
good,"Krogers is a great place to start a retail career. Is teaches you a lot customers, co workers and a busy retail environment."
good,i loved working there. the employees are always there when you have a problem they are there to solve it.
good,"A typical day involves cooking all the food and keeping the food up to time.  Cleaning all the dishes from making the food, keeping the kitchen clean, restocking all the product.  Co workers help when I get so busy I have a hard time keeping up by taking the food out when I have many orders."
good,A typical day at work included being able to work at a high energy pace as well as maintaining cleanliness and balancing stations. I learned that one must be responsible for their actions as well as the duties that they are given at hand. Management was friendly and easy to communicate while still making sure that you are kept in line. My co-workers were interactive and friendly. The hardest part of the job is being able to keep up a certain pace and balance other responsibilities as well. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to achieve newer skills and working as a team with others.
good,"12 hour days were tough 5-6 days a week.  I loved my job because they listened to my ideas and used many.  Also, shortly after going to Roundy's they used my store as a Show and tell store for the company/districts because of my day to day store conditions."
good,Great Place to work. Good atmosphere great people. They make you enjoy coming to work. Great relationships. Good attitudes at this place.
good,"Kroger was a nice place to work while I was in high school. They were able to balance my high school schedule, my college schedule, and my work schedule all at the same time. The management wasn't always the nicest, but really when are they? The people who shop at Kroger grocery stores, or at least the one I worked at, were very friendly people who loved talking to the cashiers and other employees. I moved up from a courtesy clerk to a cashier rather quickly, which made me very happy. Kroger is a good place to work, and the union isn't so bad either."
good,"Its was a great experience. I bagged groceries and met new people, but i did have some rough edges, people are rude, but i still kept a smile on my face and kept it pushing."
good,I feel that the top level management doesn't appreciate the hourly associates. We use to get a lot of discounts on product especially around holidays and now we don't. At store level it depends on who your immediate supervisors are. Hear at the Logan store in WV I have  a great Supervisor. She is a wonderful lady. They are always changing the policies at Kroger. As soon as you get use to it they change it again.
good,"Lots of customer service work. Coworkers were great. The work wasn't hard, but it was busy. The company cares about their employees and their customers."
good,"Good company to work for if you love working with people. Management that i worked with very friendly and easy to talk to. Co-workers for the most part is good, of course you will run into negative people but  thats life."
good,"I enjoyed being employed with this company. Every area of concern was addressed in a professional manner with great support and successful outcomes. The management team as well as the associates were a pleasure to work with. The clientele had it's challenges, however with the great training that the company provided, it was always a doable fix to make the customer feel comfortable as well as other teammates involved. The most enjoyable part of my job was just being there Period"
good,"A typical day at Kroger is slow but business pick up later on in the evening. I learned how to supervise and run a front end. Management could be better depends on who you have as well as coworkers. There really isn't a hard part for working at Kroger, you just have to make the best of it."
good,"Very Consistent, You clock in, take care of customers, and do your daily shift duties. On truck days, you help check in to see if the store got all the product they ordered and promptly put it away. Its a team effort and my co-workers and managers all kick in to get everything done."
good,"I do like working at Mariano's, but I wish the pay was higher. There is a lot expected of you and it's hard to watch others not do their fair share."
good,I have grown so much since starting at Kroger. I quickly began to learn my strengthens and weaknesses and how to improve. I advanced quickly and I gained a lot of experience in a short time. Great place to work.
good,"i enjoyed working at Krogers actually, had a lot of great times and they worked with the hours. the manager was very weird and not likable at all. great starting job with poor pay, just as you'd expect at a grocery store."
good,Very good company great standing in the community. Pay isnt as well as you would like but its a great ob start a management career.
good,"I enjoyed working for this company being that I was always kept busy and on the move doing things. I would say that although I more so worked independently, I always had a good team to count on."
good,"At Kroger, days and nights generally vary in business. Particularly weekends and holidays are the busiest, and the stores always close on Christmas. However, typical job duties include bagging groceries, returning shopping carts to the store, returning unwanted items and damaged product to their respective departments, along with cleaning of restrooms and (in some states) bottle rooms. It is recommended to have decent customer service according to some ""secret shopper"" events. It should be noted that labor unions take part in processing employee's rights, but such coverage can vary between regions. Advancement is granted to those who work hard and provide great customer service."
good,"i go in run the register then mop the floor, stock the cooler, and run the register while doing it all. taking out the trash, and doing whatever needs to be done."
good,Kroger has been a very stable employer with plenty of advancment opportunities.  There have been a lot of positive changes and a few that I feel have impacted the associates in a negative manner.  I enjoy multitasking and learning new things.  I am very organized and have been told that by all of the manager's that I have worked for.  I am a postive associate who gives my best every day.
good,"Co-workers are easy to get along with. "
good,i worked four to five hour shifts and it was never the same days each week. The management wasn't that great. i enjoyed working with most of my fellow employees.
good,"great coworkers, great department managers, great customers. Only thing that makes Kroger less than perfect is the constant cuts on hours, the snail pace of raises and the near non existent opportunities to advance which are all very important and can make it not worth it to some even though everything else in the equation is great. You'll make great friends with your coworkers and managers and you'll all suffer together."
good,"Courtesy clerks are at the bottom of the totem pole. We bag groceries, bring in shopping carts, clean spills, and other miscellaneous jobs around the store. You can really see the bad side of people in any customer service job, but people tend to treat you lower than everyone else. My co-workers are great; most are high school students, but it's easy to get along with them. Advancement is done by superiority before actual ability, so may people that are over me are younger than me. Many started their job in high school and are pushed up with time, though many newer people would do a lot better in the position."
good,"A typical day at work:  getting the customers through the line quickly"
good,"I was at Kroger for four years and it was very fun! The scheduling was very flexible and worked well with my schooling. However, the job was very hard to move up in and there was no benefits unless you reached a certain amount of hours per week for several weeks in a row which was very hard to do. The people there were very nice and fun to be around and they always made the work load fun."
good,This another great company to work for that has all the requirements. The Managers very understandable and clear when speaking  and showing a job to the employee. I liked working here because its has great benefits and advancement with the company.
good,"Every day was the same yet different at the same time. I learned how important timely deliveries are to local and regional stores. The hardest part of the job was getting used to the physicality of the job. The most enjoyable part was seeing all the good that was being done at the plant...( community involvement, feeding the needy, giving to charity)."
good,"I like working in the Deli at Kroger but there are some disadvantages and advantages. Some days can be insane and other days can be slow, they are really short-staffed and it can take a toll on people. A regular day at work consist of manning the slicers, taking care of the hot bar, cooking food and making trays for customers. Management can be nit-picky or very nice. It really depends on how busy the day is. Co-workers are good, they work hard and diligently but there are some who slack off. The hardest part of the job is when you feel rushed because you are doing three peoples job at once. I enjoy all the people that work in the deli for who they are and when we all start to have fun with the job it can become fun."
good,"Fred Meyer Jewelers is a wonderful establishment and is loaded with perks and plenty or drive. The company offers courses to further your knowledge of the products and procedures. Its really something to be able to build such a close bond with the customers and people that you work with."
good,"Weighing, wrapping, and pricing meat for customers. Keeping the meat counter and work area clean, and maintain all food safety standards. I worked there part time. Very straight forward position. friendly environment. Lots of interaction with customers. Management was good."
good,"it wasn't a bad job it was easy to do the, people were nice there, and the discounts were cool, I would do a little bit of everything like stock, bag groceries, and I would push carts in, but other than that it was a minimum wage job that was good for when I was going to school."
good,"Kroger is a great entry-level job for people with no work experience. A typical day at work would be sweeping the stores, restocking shelves, pushing carts, and bagging groceries. Management was well executed, and every manager was friendly and stern. My co-workers were always were always doing something productive, and that motivated me to do the same. The most difficult part of the job was pushing carts in extreme heat. The most enjoyable part of the job was sweeping the store because I was able to move around, instead of standing in one place, bagging groceries."
good,"While I'm grateful for Kroger giving me experience when I needed it, I can't say that I was too impressed with them. They were very strict and only knew how to try to make a sale, no real love for the customers or the little guys. Of course being that they're no nonsense, everything was efficient and quickly done. While the pay didn't always reflect the work,a paycheck is a paycheck."
good,"The two years I spent working in the pharmacy were a satisfying and rewarding experience. I gained extensive knowledge in critical data entry of patients personal and medical information. I honed my skills a prescription filler, including C2 through C5 controlled and over the counter medications. I became very well versed in clarifying insurance claim issues, working directly with the insurance companies, as well as trouble shooting issues to get medications qualified for coverage under specific insurance requirements. I was tasked with stocking, filing, and ordering inventory to keep the pharmacy running in the manner that my in-line supervisors required. The pharmaceutical management entailed two direct in-line supervisors and a regional manager. My day to day contact with management consisted of working side by side with them to create a streamline working environment resulting in reduced wait times for customers and increasing the volume of transactions with satisfied customers. The relationships that I developed with my co-workers and a large number of recurring customers are some of the best memories I will take from my time there at the pharmacy."
good,"very easy internship. a couple weeks working in the store. spent the last couple weeks in the office in novi working on a group project on how to improve customer satisfaction. they basically wanted us to fix the impossible, but it wasn't awful. definitely an easy summer job to put on your resume"
good,"On a typical day at Kroger I would work around customers all day and this store was very busy. my main responsibility would be bagging groceries,returning carts and helping customers with there groceries . I need be I would clean"
good,"I am proud to work for Kroger, who is a solid company and a very diverse culture.  I believe in the direction of the company; and look forward to their continued growth."
good,"Union provides some decent benefits such as a guaranteed minimum of 15 hours even if you should work part time however full time is difficult to obtain without extensive time invested into the job which may not be ideal for some potential Kroger Co. employees. The job of courtesy clerk is not overly difficult and really demands the most from you when you begin the position and are in need of learning the locations of work materials that may not always be as organized as they should be, Co-workers were generally normal and relatively easy to work with. The job of courtesy clerk does however rarely leave you with nothing to do as when one task is finished there is almost always something else that needs to be done due to the relatively broad range of tasks."
good,Typical day was get the register ready take inventory of all product clean pumps for the customers then clean the inside of the shop while attending to the needs of the customers.
good,Kroger is a great place to work at. While working there I learned a lot about customer service and how to efficiently provide an enjoyable experience in the retail business.
good,"It was a have work place to work just didn't provide enough hours, we worked as a team never had a problem with a customer cause I understand great customer service"
good,Typical day at Kroger is fast-paced to say the least.  Great job if you enjoy being on your feet all day.  Expectations are very high but this also acts as motivation.  Management is good for the most part.
good,"If Mariano's wasn't already the ""groceraurant"" of the present, it would surely be of the future! This is a great place to work!"
good,"I would recommend working there for a starting job. The only issue is they don't really work with school. They give you a discount at for all purchases at the stores. The workers are extremely friendly, however management isnt easy to work with."
good,"Heaving lifting workforce"
good,"I loved working here but the managers werent easy to convince when you needed a day off or you couldnt come into work. Fun coworkers, but the customers were always very rude."
good,its aright but not much chance to go any further and just was no help to go up in this co.They put to much work on you without more money.
good,This job allowed me to complete school and was very accommodating. The team here was also very good and worked really well together.
good,"depending upon what department you work in there is always plenty to do,the staff they hire are all kind in general and seem to get along on some level.sometimes its not ideal work but generally they pay good,and there are opertunities to advance or switch departments .the only thing i found hard was sometimes doing change over shifts ex work til 9 pm be back at 5 am but thats on very rare if ever occasions."
good,"i basically worked as a regular team member. i worked inside the store often too. i really enjoyed it there. i left on good terms and i have applied there 3 years later, but i havent heard from them"
good,- A typical day would be coming in and assisting the day-shift staff with their duties and transitioning over to the night-shift tasks. The night-shift consists of providing customer service at the deli and kitchen counters while cleaning the kitchen and closing down the machines.
good,Great place to work if your in school and just need money in your pocket. Willing to work around your school hours so  you work and go to school.
good,Management can be very helpful you get paid weekly  and you get great hours. You do get the chance to move up with in the company
good,"I really enjoy my job and the people I work with. I am usually doing three different jobs a day, including; running register, working behind the customer service desk, and supervising the front-end team. Management at Kroger is known to run a tight ship. The co-managers are very friendly and easy to get along with. I like all of my co-workers. We call it ""The Kroger Family"". We all support each other and I have made many friends during my time there. I think the hardest part of my job is probably getting yelled at by angry customers but it also makes me better at my job because it allows me to learn how to respond to different situations and how to fix the problem. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing repeat customers that have been coming to Kroger for years. I know a lot of customers by name and they have become my friends."
good,"I loved the job i just didn't like working EVERY weekend plus i worked night shift which was not ideal.I would go in at 12 am and leave at 6am,"
good,Kroger has provided me with a wonderful experience and allowed me to grow and mature in ways no other company would allow. I am very appreciative of the opportunities Kroger has provided me.
good,"Great company, but lacks work life balance. Salary means you can work 6/7 days and 10-12 hour shifts. People are nice, benefits are good."
good,Come in and clean up. Make sure the store is clean and everything is in place for the day. Clean the store and bathroom every two hours. Make sure all the customers and cashiers are happy. Make sure the property and trashcans are clean. Didn't take lunch breaks due to the low pay.
good,"Marianos is a great place to learn many things. Every department in the store is ran wit a crew of the best people. Hardest part of the job is to make sure your customer leaves happy and is willing to return to the store. i enjoy this job because everyday is a new adventure with my co workers or new customers coming into the store for the first time. if a person set they mind to working real hard for what you want , then i do not see why a person could not be a manager in little to no time."
good,"Great benefits for employees. Ability for advancement within the corporate structure, also with salary benefits as well."
good,I believe that King Sooper is an awesome place for a young person to start their career. Because it will get you grounded for any other job you are willing to get in the near future.
good,"The bakery is a fast-paced, task-oriented, customer service job. Management is supportive and friendly. I like my co-workers, but gossip and backbiting can sometimes occur. "
good,"Overall its a friendly and fun environment but it was a lot of work for the wages they give out and the breaks were short, but they give opportunities for moving up and flexible wage hours."
good,It was an OK first job! Involved a lot of bust work. I learned how to deal with different personality. The hardest part was getting 25 hours spread out in the week but the check wasn't much but it seemed like you worked everyday. The management kept the building running well.
good,Great company with great merchandise. You don't have to fight the mall to get all your jewelry needs. Open 7 days a week for your convenience.
good,"Fred Meyer Jewelers is an excellent company to work for. They offer very high quality jewelry for very low prices compared to the competition (Kay, Jared, Zales - which are all owned by the same company, by the way)."
good,"Excellent employee culture and efforts to improve employee job satisfaction and effectiveness, Great efforts by corporate leaders to focus on employees."
good,It is a very repetitive job. We do the same thing everyday. But i get great time to communicate with customers. All of the people i work with are very friendly.
good,"A typical day at work would be customer service, balancing cash drawer, bagging groceries, stocking the shelves. Management was great, they really worked around my school schedule. For the most part my co-workers were easy to get along with. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing our customers save money and getting friendly, helpful customer service."
good,"It's all about the people you work with, and the people who work here are fantastic. Management is really fantastic, very friendly, and always willing to help employees with personal issues."
good,"The company as a whole is pleasant and enjoyable to work for. The vision I personally see is one of growth.  I learned how to work as a team and developed good customer service skills. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers, but at the same time that also became the most challenging aspect at times."
good,"Good place for a student to work due to flexible hours. All the co-workers had fun together, was a fast paced place to work"
good,"My most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new customers and working with some interesting co-workers. I had some difficulty going to school and not working late hours until midnight, but over all I enjoyed working for Kroger. They gave decent breaks and I enjoyed gaining experience in customer service. The co-workers definitely made it the most enjoyable."
good,"Great place to work, great management! Enjoyed helping customers make good chooses and promoting good deals, and products.Everyone worked together to get the job done."
good,I love this job but physically it is the hardest job I have ever had. The management team is amazingly supportive. The company is great.
good,"Kroger has always been a great place to work, shop, and meet new people.  I have enjoyed my job duties as well as meet customers, usually from different countries!"
good,"A typical day is fast-paced and unpredictable, and I have learned quite a bit (both good and bad).  Our management team is committed and friendly, as are the co-workers.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the seemingly endless amounts of union-related interference.  The most enjoyable part is helping/seeing regular customers, many of whom I see on a daily basis."
good,"Kroger is a very friendly place to work, as long as you keep a good attitude. "
good,"Typical days consist of verifying Pass\Fail rate of automated test suite, then working through any tests that need updates. Second I usually check the bug report to see what may effect our next script runs."
good,Working at Kroger was always very exciting. Each day was different and kept you on your toes.  I learned to think and act quickly as well as gaining superior customer service skills.
good,"Working at Kroger is always a great and meaningful experience. The customers are very friendly and you can't help but know everyone by name. I really love this job the only difficult part is the pay, I don't get that many hours, but most of all trying to deal with shoplifters."
good,Very nice people/ high paced environment. not greatest in movement in the company wish was more opportunity overall pleasant work environment.
good,This job had great management who were always helpful. They made sure I was never working alone and made sure I learned how to be useful. A great way to become a social person. Also a nice way to meet people along with educating myself on what goes on in grocery stores.
good,Good place to work with management that is decent. Some managers are better than others. Pay raises are every six months and are very little. Advancement is not the easiest and may not be worth it. If wanting to be a manager expect to work very long hours.
good,I loved the store and working for the company.The work environment was smooth as there were no customers in the store during our shift.
good,"Great place and people to work with but advancing opportunities are limited and it would take a long time to move up. However, they are very flexible and work around your schedule."
good,It was a very short experience due to relocating out of state but I would have to say that it was an overall great experience and learning opportunity.
good,come in and start on my work and then helping customers out cuting meats and cheeses for them and then i would have to go to the chicken area and do chicken up for the day and at the end of the night clean up everything and go home
good,Busy always changing duties . customer service is  first priority ever day . Always  learning and  growing . large focus on  the  numbers  and  growing  the  customers satisfaction . Good  support team .

good,Great and fast paced workplace. Friendly customers and coworkers who strive for greatness. The job pays very well and the company is set on always making sure they are meeting all expectations.
good,Flexible hours. Training is very good. I learned how to scan groceries and bag items properly. I work in Michigan.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers with anything they need any questions they have as well as helping my co workers with price checks.
good,"Workplace was fine, and good for keeping busy. Management was knowledgeable about workplace orientation, but not about limits placed on workers. Amount of workers was spread thin, with management still focusing on going above and beyond, when it was hardly possible to get core tasks done."
good,"While the Kroger company itself seemed very top-down oriented, the local employees I had the pleasure of working with were largely very professional and invested in assisting their customers in any way they were able to on a daily basis.  The pharmacy in particular had a commitment to excellence that is rarely seen on a corporate, large company wholesaler's level."
good,"Fast paced and busy. I enjoyed being on my feet, but hated the retail work hours. I actually liked the culture and the people I worked with. Like most management positions in retail, it was glorified babysitting."
good,"I enjoy my job working here, but I feel under compensated for the work that is done. All of my co-workers are friendly. The management is friendly as well. The worst part is the wages."
good,it was my pleasure working the company I liked waiting on our customers and working as a team most of the time management also nice
good,"Was a good place to work, great people as well as benefits."
good,"My typical day at work would start off with opening up the store and setting out inventory that we pulled the night before, shortly after we would then conduct an inventory on all pieces that were taken out the night before. Usually we would try and work with as many customers as possible while proposing a credit line we offer through our store, if its not a busy day with customers I liked to handle any restocking or adding any new inventory to our computer system, and file it according to its place in the inventory system. If I ended up having to close the store I was in charge of the nightly deposit summary and doing a progress summary of that days work before pulling inventory and putting it in the safe. "
good,"Kroger has flexible schedules, great management, great customers, great organizational culture that really instills values of the company into the employees. A typical day at work is I come into warehouse, set up/program walk man, I go to the rows it tells me to, select products to be processed for shipping, restock shelves in store, greet customers, assist with shopping, check out, and problem solving. My co-workers were very helpful and nice, but also helped you to be independent in the job. The hardest part about the job is late notice of mandatory OT. Overall, it was a very enjoyable experience."
good,"Moderate work environment with a hot but reasonable work climate. They had Christmas dinners, Family Fun Day and other seasonal events that included our families."
good,While working here everyone was fairly nice and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers. The best part was you get breaks even if its busy. This job helped me learn patients with customers and keep a smile and be nice no matter how rude people are to me.
good,"Typically at work, I would clock in, enter the deli and start separating and bagging the loaves of bread to be put on display. With customers woven in between wanting to place cake orders and have meats and cheeses sliced. There are scheduled chicken fryings, which other than cleaning, wraps up the responsibilities. "
good,Nice working environment and flexible working hours. Easy to transfer to different departments and learn more about the job.
good,Kroger is a good job to start off with the mangers are very nice gets to know their employers always helps you if needed. My co-workers was very fun loved talking if needed help anyone would help no one is selfish. its always something different to do at Kroger you can always learn a lot of different things to do.
good,Being a decision maker and handling customers/employees issues and concerns. Always willing to make the right decisions to take care of the cutomers and protect the company assets..
good,"Working at Kroger brings about some fond memories. Customers began to develop their trust in you regardings their needs, and more so, you establish a relationship with them to suit their needs and that's what made it worth the while. I learned to how to be efficient with customer service as well as different tools and ways to go about making the customer's experience being worthwhile and memorable. It would have made for a more efficient store had management worked alongside their staff instead of against their staff. In short, staff rallied together to ensure that the job got done in order to deliever excellent customer service. I never experienced a difficult moment working at Kroger. The most enjoyable moments of working at the store that I worked at was just to see all the customers come and get to know them and familiarize myself with their needs so when they did visit the store, we'd be set to better service them."
good,A great job for someone in school or wanting to work part time. Coworkers are great. Have to work evenings and weekends. The managers do a great job.
good,"I worked as a cashier for Kroger for about a year, dabbling a little in the floral and produce department. Typically my shifts were in the mornings, from 7am-3pm or later, depending on how busy it can get. I got there at the crack of morning and spent the first couple hours organizing go-back items until customers started coming in.Then I would spend the rest of my shift ringing up groceries all day, with a half hour break in between. Starting off was really the hardest part of the job, but once that had passed, it was not a very hard job at all. However, customers can be a handful too, depending on the location you worked at. The best part of working there, personally, was making new friends, getting comfortable enough with the management where I could help make some decisions and venture out into different departments, and being able to have a set, routine work day everyday."
good,"hark working environment, mostly for kids who are just starting out. To go to another department in the store is not worth it unless they tell you where they want you to go, to go to any other department you have to be 18 years or older"
good,I really enjoyed my time at Kroger. It was like working with a family. Everyone was close but also could manage to be professional at the same time.
good,"Working for smiths was a lot of fun. Had I not moved out of state I would most likely still be working for them. The pay was great, the ours were ok... and I liked my co workers a lot. I even built a relationship with several of the frequent shoppers. I would say that the hardest part of this job was standing in a check stand all day. Even though standing was bad sitting is just as bad."
good,"If you are looking for a job to pay the bills Fred Meyer is a great place. However, if you are looking for a place to spend the rest of your career, Fred's is not it. They have a great culture and are very responsive to the employees needs. The story that I worked in is always busy."
good,Enjoyable and fast pace. Enjoy meeting new people and customer service means a lot to me. I want the customer to feel important and recognized.I am a team player and enjoyed my coworkers.
good,"Kroger's is a lively job. A good job but unorganized depending on your store and the management. Your co-workers will become your second family and friends. Kroger's will probably be the last retail company to bump up their minimum wage unlike their competitors, because of this their is a high turn over rate and employment rate at this company."
good,"This was a good job to begin with, I was 16 and stuck around until I turned 22. Unfortunately they werent able to work with my schedule when I was in school and my daughter was born."
good,"I enjoyed working at Kroger. Meeting new people, having short even long conversations about the customers day and giving some a smile. Some days it was slow and some days it wasn't but it was still a decent job overall. If they would've worked around my schedule it would've been perfect , but it didnt go that way."
good,"At Kroger I stayed Busy!!!! But never to busy to help others and have a good time. Management backed me on everything so I felt very confident!!!! The hardest part of the job for me, was unloading the boxes of chicken and stacking them in the walk in freezer!! The most ENJOYABLE part of the job would be the customers!"
good,Day consists of a lot of cooking in a hot kitchen.  Focused also on customer needs and wants.  Helping customers the best I can with everything they desire on their shopping trip.
good,stocked the cooler and cashiered everyday friendly service enjoyed helping the customers got along with every body never had any problems
good,"the management was really good about having enough workers on a day so that the store felt as little rushed as possible. Co-workers were really nice and worked together. the job never felt hard, and it was nice to see people i knew come back and i recognized them."
good,"It's a good place to work at; but, I could earn more money if I just had more hours. The pay rate is $8.50 an hr which is not enough to live on. But, the benefits are OK."
good,"As the title says, it was a very generic grocery store experience. the management at this particular store seemed unorganized and short-tempered."
good,Productive. Like to see results. Learned pretty much everything I know about retail being employed with Kwik Shop. Need to put the gossip out and provide the best customer service possible.
good,"I love meeting and helping new people. I have been a team player and will go above and beyond to get the job done. I have managed up to 20 people in a C store, there is a lot of benefits of working in retail but there are long hours to make your store successful."
good,This has been a great part time job for me as I have gone through high school and college. A typical day involves quickly and accurately completing customer transactions with a friendly and positive attitude.  Management is very friendly and has been willing to work around my schedule numerous times. The hardest part of this job is handling customers who feel that they have been mistreated either by our employees or that we have falsely advertised a price to them.
good,My duties were to record customer’s feedback and answer product and pricing inquiries. I am also responsible to provide the best customer services to the individuals that come inside the store.
good,I liked my co-workers. we helped each other out. fun place to be at times and long hours. it thought me a lot. like how to do OSHA paper work.
good,Primary focus of company is providing a great customer experience.  Excellent customer service is key.  Great growth potential.  Work life balance is pretty good and will accommodate most schedules.  Working weekends is a must.
good,"A work day includes shifting around the pharmacy ensuring every script received is entered into our system, necessary documentations are lawfully taken care of, accuracy is met, claims are passed through insurance adjudication, medications are properly dispensed//compounded, customers pick up appropriate medications and receive a genuine interaction that develops trust, inventory levels are on target, and that various duties are executed on time, with care and precision. The pharmacists are great and foster a great team dynamic. A good pharmacy requires a team dedicated to nailing the details and exceeding expectations. If there is friction within the group it impedes on production and quality of service. I've learned patience largely from the retail portion of this position. You get to interact with a plethora of personalities; Every one visiting a pharmacy has their own ailment or trial that requires sensitivity and understanding. It's great working with the same families month to month, feeling like you are impacting their health in a positive way, watching them grow and developing a relationship."
good,"A typical day at Kroger Central Fill included dispensing, verifying, scanning, packing and checking out patients prescriptions."
good,"9 hour shifts that include demoing products to customers, managing bistro staff, ordering and overseeing production."
good,This job is great if you like working alone! you have a lot of responsibility and you have to work fast. a lot of memorizing required. If you love baking its a place for you!
good,"busy yet can be boring if you like to be constantly doing something.  However some employees are paid well to get the job done, and it happens, unlike the underpaid clerks"
good,Daily pre-shift meeting with supervisors.  Lay out expectations for the day and week.  Review productivity from day and week before.   Life work balance was a difficult challenge.  There were many enjoyable parts of my most of them were people related.  Helping people over come or support them in there life challenges.
good,Great place to work with a great management team. The hardest part of the job was standing for hours.
good,After being trained in produce you are on your own which is awesome because you don't have to worry about someone monitoring you at all times. You do get popped up on at times which is understandable. They do want to make sure you are on the right track and going at a steady pace.
good,it was a learning experience i didnt like it but it was work it was busy and the customers were rude
good,"with union jobs you get a 10 cent raise every 6 months and I just wasn't going to sit around for that, my paychecks were miniscule because i had just started there, max is 20 hours starting. people were nice, employer and coworkers were nice aswell."
good,"I learned how to operate in a fast paced environment while maintaining safe food temperatures and excellent customer service."
good,Constantly striving for freshness and less shrink. I have learned to keep a clean and full work environment. Management helps with not only to put the customer first but also taking care of the employees. My coworkers are the back bone when it comes to produce. We would not be what we are if we didnt work as a team. The hardest part of my job is making sure we have enough product from the orders to fill and keep fresh.
good,"The day starts with checking last nights inventory and maintenance of kitchen. Assisting customers according to their needs and desires. The work environment wasn't always busy a constant  flow of business. This position required multi-tasking and customer interactions on a daily, allowing me to adapt to each individual needs. I also learned to keep inventory of in and out going product, along with stocking and display set-up. Management was a well tuned team that ensured that the store was kept cleaned and all workers performed their duties to best of our abilities. Management also worked together to withhold company policies and rules among workers, they were firm but fair. Working with persons from all different backgrounds made times interesting, due to the many personalities all around the work place! The toughest part of this position was maintaining inventory for such a large grocery store."
good,The work enviroment is fun but doesnt allow for individuals to excel to high postitions in a timely manner. Management team is very prompt on resloving issues with customers and employees.
good,The Kroger Co. is a great place to work. The company strives to be number one in customer service and tries to give the employees a good work-life balance.
good,"Busy schedule that always kept you on your toes"
good,"A typical day at work consist of cooking chicken, slicing meat for customers, cleaning, stocking, and also taking orders. The management was fair as well as the co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking to the customers and fixing them the things that they order."
good,"As a meat clerk and being low on the seniority list, I often worked nights. This was actually a good thing, because I prefer to work nights. Shifts ranged from six to ten hours a day, which I felt was wonderful, you could still get the things needed at home done. I learned about a variety of things. How to distinguish between different types of fish, beef cuts, pork cuts, grinds and the restaurant names that went with them. I also learned about chemical/cleaning agent handling, sanitation, cross contamination, different allergens, proper cooking techniques, how to complete grinder logs, temperature logs and work with a PDA. When I would first come in about one or two in the afternoon, the order from the previous day would have arrived and I would spend about an hour maybe two, if the order was large, breaking down the pallets, arranging lunch meat on carts, separating beef from pork and chicken, as well as which section of beef it was. Soon after, I would shrink wrap the various cuts that would be on the line, as well as dating, pricing and putting pre-done grinds onto the shelves. Frozen product would be worked in at a later time, though properly stored in between. Stocking lunch meat, frozen chicken, beef and beef offal, pork and pork offal. Management was always willing to work with you and give you great advice or help with whatever questions you asked. The co-workers were fun to talk with and almost all of them had a serious work ethic to back it. It was definitely one of the friendliest places I have worked to date. The hardest part of the job was probably dealing with"
good,"The Kroger stores are a fantastic way to work while going to college.  While it may not provide the experience you need in your future career, and it may not pay as well as you'd like, it does provide very flexible scheduling and management that is second to none in both efficiency and caring.  On many occasions the management has been able and willing to work with me to schedule my work hours around my life events.  I have tremendous respect for the Kroger company for treating me like a valued employee and allowing me to work without scheduling conflicts."
good,"made sure everyone was on task, had a particular dept. to cover and make sure item is stocked. great environment to work love the managers and co workers."
good,a typical day is normally a busy day at fast food or as a manager exercising my leadership skills and confidence at taking charge threw out the day the focus is neat accuracy and customer always first at the end of each visit should be a welcoming back
good,"As a part time employee it was a good place to learn.  Pay wasn't bad for a part time job you could do as a student.  However, any time you work with the public can be very frustrating.  The management was good, but when I worked there a long time some of the assistant PICs threatened to get me fired for offering suggestions.  They no longer work there however, but they were the final push for me to quit."
good,"Ralph's believes in great service, we set goals everyday and try to better our business in every way. Were open for comments and suggestions and we build relationships with our customer so that they will wanna come back again in the future."
good,"I have worked for The Kroger Company for over eight years in the State Liquor Store. I have plenty of experience in customer service, cash-handling, completing daily transmittal reports, and knowledge of products throughout the store. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers that don't understand or like to follow the Laws of buying alcohol which can be frustrating at times but it comes with the job. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to build relationships with my customers. Being employed for so long with Kroger has allowed me to meet and communicate with a variety of people."
good,"Kroger as a business entity has good vision and values, but I was placed in a store with a manager who wasn't as fair and honest as he could have been.  Had I been in a different environment I would still be working for them."
good,"all of the managers are very helpful and are willing to work with your schedule."
good,"Learning how to use a meat slicer, meeting new people in a new city, interacting with customers, Learning how to date dot products."
good,A typical day at work was a breeze. I learned how to communicate efficiently and food prep and sanitation guidelines. The most enjoyable part of the job was communicating with the customers to better serve their needs. The most diffucult part was juggling multitasking while ensuring the best possible service for my customers. My coworkers and staff managers were all amazing when it came down to helping with customers during a rush and teaching me to multitask more efficiently.
good,Kroger worked around my ever changing student schedule still giving me a decent amount of hours each week. The environment overall is a good one with helpful managers and friendly co workers.
good,"check new movies in computer, check out movies to customers and return movies in the computer. rotate the new releases from the older ones. Clean the area put up old movies for sale."
good,"To say the least Kroger was an interesting place to work.  The first couple of years were kind of shaky with management, but after January of the fourth year, things started to go more smoothly"
good,"* A typical day is very fast pace."
good,"Kroger can be a wonderful company to work for, but it also has its faults. If you are an educated individual, and start out in an entry level position, you may never move up the ranks."
good,routine work very intense multitude of problems dealing with customer service some days better than other but always finished with a good close
good,"when working at Kroger i soon realized word travels fast, whether its good, bad, or even made up. If you only have a four to maybe six hour shift you were only given a fifteen minute break, which in my opinion wasn't enough time to sit and eat your lunch or enjoy your drink. My co-workers for the most part were kind and and helpful, on the other hand there were some that would tend to try and get into your personal business, hear one thing you say and tell others the complete opposite of what you said, and some even stole from the company."
good,"Decent hours, and pay that was comparable to what I was doing there."
good,"great starter job, holidays and weekends are the hardest part of the job as well as dealing with the public."
good,"My management team is unbelievable. They are very understanding and try to write the work schedule for a better job work/life balance. My co-workers are very helpful and are always ready to learn new things. I am a swing shift PIC (person-in-charge), so my typical day is processing freight in either clothes or shoes and then putting it out on the floor, with the correction sign. Then we clean up and recover the apparel departments, while attending customers and processing money drops for our apparel register."
good,"assist customers cashing them "
good,I usually slice meats and cheeses. I am good at what I do. I help people with what is needed. I also clean and make sure everything is in order
good,"I had no cons about working for Kroger, that is a true cmpany, and i loved working them them."
good,Its a really good place to work for teenagers. Management is sometimes their for you when you need to talk about problems but some of them are just not approachable. Sometimes your replacements not their on time
good,"I did the exact responsibilities as listed on my resume."
good,"Constantly moving around, management is very helpful and nice, co-workers are easy to get along with"
good,"A day at Kroger store is every professional and fun. I learn how to help customers, properly handle food items while been an a efficient team worker. My co-workers where very supportive on my first day all the way in tell I was re-leaved of my job."
good,I go in at 4am and stock and condition the shelves. Then I go to the dairy department and help there and I help up from on the cash register when needed. I learned how to be patient and customer care. Management is good I like working with all of them and my co-workers are fun and easy to get along with and work with. The hardest part about my job is having to be there at 4am.
good,Manage overall store departments daily to ensure all standards are being met.  Maximize profits while maintaining appropriate loss levels.  Strong group of dedicated employees that would benefit from betterupper management guidance.  Great starting block for a career in retail.
good,"I worked at Kroger in the meat department for three years and enjoyed my time there. They offered good pay, but not a lot of vacation time. At the time the company paid for your health insurance."
good,"great place to work productive and fun place to work"
good,"Fun workplace, great job to have during college, works great with your schedule and great people. Work isn't very rewarding, involves standing on feet for 8 hours. It has taught me a lot about customer service, how to handle customers, how to be respectful to even the difficult people. Management is good, a bit too involved, which creates a feeling if distrust. Hardest part of the job is being yelled at by customers for the things you have no control over day after day. The most enjoyable part is definitely the people, they make the work shift enjoyable."
good,As the job was walking distance from home it was relatively easy for me to balance work and personal life.
good,"stocked the dairy wall , also stocked the freezer sections. Helped the cashiers when they needed extra cashiers up front. learned how to stock the frozen and dairy products. the management was okay towards the end. most of the co workers were easy to get along with. the hardest part was the frozen sections have a short time limit. the enjoyable part is can get along with the workers"
good,"Busy,Productive , I LEARN something new everyday,  the  most enjoyable part of my job  is meeting new people and helping people."
good,"Typical routine work. Learned how to deal with alot of cultures. From my experience, managers were always under pressure, so their moods would randomly be hot and cold. I loved my co-workers, every location ive been too, i made family. Dealing with rude customers was my worst part of the job. Working as team to get things done was the best."
good,"A typical day at work requires fast and friendly service to customers, and doing the best I can to make each customer's experience unique and important. I have learned a great many things regarding customer service, checkout, bill pay, and other money services. Management does the best they can to keep a good balance between happy customers and happy employees. As for co-workers, there are some that are accepting of others, and others that tend to be more abrasive. The hardest part of the job is definitely having to deal with people that come in already in a bad mood and take that anger out on us. The best part, however, is definitely being able to talk to and help the customers daily."
good,"Great job, and teaches you a lot about yourself. Lots of things to keep you busy, and its great to interact with the customers."
good,"As a overnight stocker, we tend to help each other unloading trucks and putting them in the proper shelves. and maintain neatness throughout the whole store. greeting customers, helping them get the things that they want be able to leave the store happy."
good,Best part of the day was driving the pallet jacks.  Management was very nice and never distracted you from your work.  Co-workers were very nice and fun to work with
good,needs to communicate more with employees.to offer more hours
good,"For the most part busy every night from start to finish, which I loved. My immediate supervisor could have used more training in how to deal with his subordinates. The hardest part of the job is that they expected you to do 50 hours in 40.The people were nice to work with. But for the most part didn't mind the work."
good,"I love the people i work with and enjoy my job, however, the pay rate as well as job opportunities don't live up to my standards and needs."
good,Doing constant inventory and stocking of shelves with products for customers.  I learned how to operate a forklift.  My management team was very good.  My co-workers were very helpful and easy to work with.  The hardest part of my job was working the grave yard shift.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people.
good,"We stayed pretty busy with keeping our products up to date and organized. I learned a good bit about Health and Safety Regulations with working in the Deli. I loved my management. They were fun, yet professional. The most enjoyable part of my job were my returning customers."
good,I learned a lot of useful job skills an knowledge that has propelled me to even greater careers.
good,this place was surgical supply warehouse. hospitals ordered all the supply's and what ever thy used during the course of a day.
good,A typical work day was greeting and checking out customer's orders. I learned how to deal with all types of different personalities. I really liked manager I worked for. I liked the co-workers I worked with. There was not a hard part of this job. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to talk to all types of different people.
good,"a typical day consisted of bagging groceries, giving carry-outs, and gathering shopping carts. This job mainly taught me customer service and dealing with various people."
good,I would come in at 7 a.m. and help finish setting up tills for registers and have other departments sign out their tills for the day. I would then work on the cashier/ courtesy clerk  cleaning list as well as break and lunch times. during this time I would be waiting on customers and answering phones. In my down time I would be managing the floor so that we don't have customers waiting or bagging their own groceries. When management comes in we give them the sales for the previous day and let them know of any call ins or disciplinary issues we had. throughout the day I pick 3 cashiers or courtesy clerks that are newer to have a huddle with and discuss what we can do to perform better at our jobs. I learned to work well as a team with a very diversified team. I also learned that while I cannot please everyone I can try my hardest. I loved my customers that would come in everyday. The hardest part of the job was working with very headstrong employees and angry customers.
good,"Customers are my first priority everyday I get pulled into differnet directions all day because of my experience with every part of the front end."
good,"Engaging with customers while providing customer service was a typical day at Kroger. I quickly realized that customers and employees within the  facility was very cheerful. Staff were willing to go far and beyond for customers. The management team at Kroger were great. "
good,"-Enjoy working in the supermarket setting"
good,The Managers treat you like kids and they are always playing favorites in the store. Gotta watch your back while at work and make sure that your only interest is the customers
good,"Everyday was an excellent day when I started working there for 3rd shift. I learned how to run a scrubber, buffer and used the inventory gun to count products on the shelves, cleaned the oil out on the buffer and cleaned oil changed buffer pads on the buffer. Worked well with night leader, co-workers and management. There wasn't anything hard about the job on what I did. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I liked what I did and did a well job at what I did."
good,Kroger was a great company to work for.  Co-workers are there to help when you need it. The job does take a lot of attention to detail.
good,The Kroger company knows how to work with customers and treat their employees accordingly. Customer service was an important quality to have at that job and I learned a great deal on tending to others needs as best as you can with policy. The management knew how to work with the employees and they knew how to listen to the headaches to help the flow of the work place continue on a steady pace. The hardest part of the job was the customer satisfaction goals they set due to the common notion of you can not make everyone happy. The most enjoyable part is the customers and tending to their needs gave me a satisfaction about my job.
good,"I really have enjoyed working here, it is just time for me to start a new career where my unique skill set and educational background can be effectively utilized."
good,"good employer, just wouldn't give the hours needed and was starting college"
good,"Educational and a productive place to work for."
good,Great place to work. I have been given many opportunities and enjoy the coaching and training aspect of the job.
good,"taking the inbound calls, you don't always get happy people but to connect with the customer, helps and usually they are more than willing to laugh with you. The management are sometimes unpredictable. If they are having a bad day, they do take it out on the workers. and they do pick your favorites. but as long as you show up and do your job, they leave you alone. The people I work with are like my family."
good,Good company to work for.  Benefits are really good and start right away for management.  Balance for work life and personal is ok
good,"Never know what time u getting let of people call off, the money is good and benefits"
good,"Busy days, lots of hard work.  Physically demanding. Got to meet lots of people."
good,"King Soopers is a well put together company. "
good,"Being an associate/assistant store manager at Kroger was a great position that started as early as 7am and as late as 2pm. Your workday could finish at 6pm or as late as 1am. "
good,You will have 8 hours of work and you are always busy. I learned that if you put the time in the rewards are good. Management was strict but after time they will  work with your goals. Co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job was when you start is that its demanding but after you learn the ropes you get conditioned where theres nothing to it. The camaradie with your fellow co-workers is the most enjoyable part of the job and the pride in your job.
good,"Very active and moving IT organization. Some great leaders at different levels and departments. Lots of opportunities to work on different problems and technology platforms."
good,"Attending to customers, answering phone calls, transferring prescriptions to and from other pharmacy. I learned to have more patience and show compassion towards other people. My management and coworkers were all great. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the joy and satisfaction on my patients face"
good,"quick process of scanning groceries and household products."
good,A typical day at work is an enjoyable experience. I appreciate the challenging atmosphere that working with the public provides. The reward by ensuring that people leave knowing that they had a pleasurable experience gives me great pride. The hardest part of my job is getting my peers to take the same pride and professionalism that is expected at the work place.
good,Very fast paced and challenging being the biggest store on the west coast.
good,"Enjoyed interacting with customers. Learned valuable skills, gained experience in various areas."
good,"I have learnt so much in the past year that I  have worked at Kroger/Starbucks. I have worked in many different departments including the Deli, Produce, Floral, and of course Starbucks, which is where I am working now.  "
good,"friendly atmosphere, good company to work for, works around your schedule, clean, good pay and holiday pay."
good,I felt that Kroger was a more productive work environment for me.I stayed busy all day. I liked this job a lot only it waspart time.
good,My job was to have customers in and out at a good pace and making sure they were satisfied with their findings in the store for the day.
good,"Its productive and a fun, friendly place to work at. Customers always comes first. I learn how to multi-task more and how to interact with customers more. The management can be a little better than what it is. Co-workers are nice and friendly."
good,"I get to set up, manage and close down the events that occur. I represent the house and assist those clients renting out the venue."
good,It was.great working with the customers just the employees seemed to makd it a tough job.
good,One day I was bagging this lady's grocery and she was so nice and talkative and she ask for a carry out  and I helped her. When I got done putting her food in her car she turn around and said god bless you then handed me a 20 dollar bill. I told her that was ok cause it was my job to help her and she told me nonsense and put the 20 in my hand and got in her car and drove away
good,"Putting a store back together after a good day of sales is not as easy as most would think, "
good,This was a good job for me while I worked there in high school but advancement is kind of lacking. In my opinion a lot of the people have been working there for a long time so advancement is slow.
good,Good place to work! I really enjoy working for Kroger. I love to help my customers and give them the products they want and need. Kroger has very good  customer service goals. They give you all the tools to succeed! But  Kroger is on the lower end of the pay scale compared to similar jobs with other companies!
good,"I liked working for Kroger, because I gained a lot of skills while I was there.  Some of the people there were not so great to work with. I know that this person is still working there, but she has had enough complaints now, that she was finally demoted, but it took about 5 years after I lef,t for this to come about."
good,"My co-workers were great to work with we always tried to work as a team for the betterment of the company. We knew that the public was very important to the success of the company and to give us enough hours each month to allow us a good paycheck. Sales equaled hours. Loyal and happy customers equal company success. Management did its best to keep employees happy and productive with positive feedback and opportunity for advancement. There is a lot of pressure from the company to strive for excellence. They expect 120% from every employee keeping up with their demands was the hardest part, but also rewarding for us when it could b accomplished."
good,picking items and building pullets was the daily job. they work you like a dog but have great pay. its like a non-family person cause you have no life. you work 16 hr days and six days a week a lot
good,"Could of been more organized. But great work environment. A typical day at work would be first to punch in, wash hands, say hello and greet my fellow co-workers, start stocking or bagging. The hardest part of my job was lifting al the heavy weight."
good,"Kroger is a Great place to work if you are in good with management. Most of the hard working people who take pride in their jobs, are usually the ones over looked. You get stuck doing everything if they know you are a hard worker. The ones that are lazy normally are the ones in good with the management. Really it's my only flaw with the company. They hire managers fresh out of school whom have never worked a job in their lives and expect them to come in and run the show. Even if they are good with the paperwork part of business they lack the experience with everything about the grocery industry."
good,"I have learned to work with the public over 20 years, worked hard on building friendly rapport with customers."
good,"They have very flexible hours and are typically willing to work with you. However, it is difficult to get a Full Time position."
good,"I thank Kroger for giving me a job while I was still in High School, I have learned a lot and I love the company and management."
good,Looking for a better job and trying to work non-union setting.
good,I enjoy my coworkers and they have good benefits the only down side is management.
good,It;s was a nice job but not not co-workers.Poor work ethics and bad management
good,"Kroger is a decent job like any other retail job, and one of the few remaining jobs who still have a union."
good,"Long days, short staff, great repute with co-workers, each department is different as well as each location. Long hours in the freezer."
good,"I had this job in high school, and I remember the days I worked were always fun. The customers were people in our community. and most of them were kind. If you were a courtesy clerk, the customers would give you tips, but you were paid less than cashiers."
good,"Great C-Level Management, A company to watch. Will miss Dave Dillon."
good,"Worked in a fast pace environment, interacting with many different types of customers. I was always more than willing to help with anything that was needed and tried to make the customer have the best experience possible."
good,One other Chef and myself set up and incorporated the prepared product for the meat department. classes for cooking were set up on a weekly basis for our interested customers. We hired and trained all the chefs that were placed in the higher volume stores to produce the product and give classes. the management staff up to the president of the company was extremely supportive in everything we did.
good,i liked driving the pallet jacks pullin orders an loadin the trucks
good,"Loved the closeness of Kroger. However, management and the cons of the union prevent good pay regardless of education or experience."
good,Typical day of work would be to stand upfront to assist customers in the check-out lines. As long as you were active with the customers and your duties as a cashier any day of work would be a easy & fun day. Management was on top of their duties as well and was always there when they were needed. Co-workers were co-workers some worked others didnt. Hardest part of the job I really didnt  have any hard parts. All around I enjoyed interacting with the customers and helping them.
good,I loved my job at Kroger. I got along really well with all of my fellow co-workers and managers.
good,"I worked here for nearly 5 years. I was 18 when I started, and it definitely gives you experience with dealing with the public for the good, bad, and ugly."
good,"store was great place to work your's always on the move "
good,"Answering phone calls for orders on prescriptions, refills, questions about pricing. Preparing customer prescription under guidance of registered pharmacist. I learned many medical terminologies and how they interact and affect patients. Most enjoyable part of the job is helping our customers in need for better health."
good,"Kroger is where I learned about work.  A typical day includes looking at every aspect of the store.  Details, details, details.  There are wonderful people there, but there are definitely people in the upper levels who enjoy making life hard on the little guys.  There is opportunity for advancement, but many times it is based on who you know more than the quality of your work.  The hardest part of the job was when upper management would come in and accuse you of not doing something appropriately when you just walked in the door for the day."
good,"deli and bakery, nothing bad, works with scheduling, and nice co-workers."
good,I love the flexible schedule.Very face pace and diverse enviroment.Good associates to work with.
good,Very High Paced. Must know the retail industry and be highly motivated with strong customer service skills.
good,Kroger was a decent job. They dont overwork you. The customers are fairly friendly and receptive.
good,"I am a progressive chef with over 20 years of experience in the culinary art field. I am highly skilled at cost control effectiveness, menu development, organization, staff development (coaching) and problem identification."
good,"I have been with the company now for almost 7 years, and I enjoy my job!  Although I have not moved up in the company yet, it is my ultimate goal to achieve full time status and benefits, but I have not yet been given the opportunity to do so.  I have asked, and written a letter for such advancement, and have been declined a great advancement.  The job is very strenuous, but rewarding!!"
good,"Fry's was my first job. I started out as a carry out and made my way to an assistant front end manager. The job was a great learning experience, Supervising employees, making sure the store was kept up to par, and providing excellent customer service was just a few tasks on our daily lists. I had a lot of fun and enjoyed working with my staff."
good,"Greet customer"
good,"Worked with department heads to make sure task was complete.  Customer service, team engagement, inventory, Discipline of employees"
good,"A typical day at work includes me trying to keep everything undercontrol includidng employees and customers, by making sure every customer leaves satisfied by engaging with them and helping them find exactly what they were looking for. Its also involves working well with my co-workers and giving each one a break, helping them out when they have any questions or need help. The most enjoyable part of working at kroger is its a calm environment and prettty relaxing with wonderful employees"
good,I did learn A LOT of the codes. I got to work with people and meet some really nice people
good,"The last five years with the company have for the most part been very good. A typical day would be steady business and simply be working to keep the customer's happy and meet their needs. I've learned more than I can sit here and talk about. Dealing with the general public is not always an easy thing, and with that I learned to take the good with the bad, and keep on smiling even if the disgruntled customer was continuing to gripe about all the things they hate about our store. I work with some wonderful people, and I work with some people who don't want to work at all. The younger kids don't always appreciate that Kroger is a much better job than fast food and the pay and benefits, as well as the flexible schedule, are a hard thing to find in this economy. The hardest part of the job has been working under a department head who is not happy with your work, regardless of how perfect it is or how much effort you put into it. The most enjoyable part is definitely that most of my co-workers and I are like family, and we all work very well together."
good,"busy, friendliy customers "
good,"A typical day at work is basic retail management, in stock conditions, proper scheduling, cleanliness, ready for the customer, quality of product especially in the fresh areas, cash control, proper invoicing and receiving procedures, speed and service at checkout. All aspects of total store operations. Smiths was a ver family orientated company and I loved that. The hardest part of the job at times was when the economy took a hit and our labor budget kept getting cut but the same standards were expected-it happens everywhere but that was a tough bout. The most enjoyable part of the job is the employees and customers loved being there, happy employees, happy customers-customers would know my name make it a point to come and say hello and that IS job satisfaction."
good,Kroger was a great company to work for when I was still attending school and then after graduation. I only left because I was in need of full time.
good,"I worked at a Tom Thumb convenience store for 3 years, turnover time is relatively quick for those without any actual serious desires for a job. The only real draw backs are minimum wage and lack of breaks or lunches. The hardest part of the job is the customers... People want way too much from a gas station."
good,i enjoy working for Kroger but I would like to spread my culinary wings a bit more.
good,This was my first job which i was thrilled about. It was a great environment to work in. My first child was born and it was to difficult for me to work and go to school at that time. I would have stayed longer but school was most important at the time.
good,"Primarily responsible for investigation and apprehending shoplifters in 20 stores building awareness with the management staff."
good,"1.I come to work and every body is very  happy, helpful, and productive."
good,Management was a bit shaky in the beginning but not to bad. not very good on communication between transition of shifts.
good,I made myself as versatile as possible so I could work in almost any department. The company was more than willing to take me and train me as well as listen to new ideas I had on helping make our team more efficient. The management team I worked with was truly the best I have ever had the privilege to work with to this day. My co-workers were friendly and took pride in a job well done. The hardest aspect of this job was the amount of hours I would have to work to make ends meet as well as the lowered hours available during non peak times. The best aspect of working for this company was the wide array of skills I learned and how enjoyable it was to work with each different group of people.
good,"I learned at the kroger company the importance of taking ownership and pride in everything you do. My co workers and I dealt with hundreds of customers daily and we would always promote customer service. Management was always striving to further educate and promote completion of tasks to the best of our abilities. The hardest part of my job was low hours and room for advancement, the ceiling for success was only raised so high, and the unpredictability of schedule changes. The best part of my job was the learning experience. I gained many tools and tips to further my career while helping others achieve mutual success as well. Overall I would 100% promote the Kroger Co. as a great place to get your start and learn how to achieve goals set out for oneself."
good,Kroger will always provide a stable job but with less than competitive compensation and little room to advance due to their union that puts more emphasis on seniority rather than work ethic.
good,"Work was always something I looked forward to. I liked to see the customers, and my coworkers were friendly. "
good,"Strong Employer, wages need improvement and aren't realistic for someone supporting a family. Strong research and development and incorporates methods of listening to each employee. Constant contact with upper management and corporate. Receive training and support from every level of management. Difficult days were the slow days, cleanest of all jewelry stores in and around their class. Best days were the days you could positively change someone's life."
good,"I worked in a friendly customer filled environment.  I helped customers, who came in with any questions and requested needs.  I learned how to manage time and work effectively in multi-task situations. Management were friendly and always willing to help out.  Co-workers were the same as managers, friendly and reliable. The hardest part of the job were certain hours I worked, unable to enjoy days off and the mediocre pay for somebody who has family to depend on them.  Most enjoyable is the all around environment and experience.  "
good,for the most part it was a okay job a lot to do and never boring management was not very nice but the job made it better
good,"Typical day requires a lot of work from stocking, cooking, cleaning, monitoring kysor case temperatures for food safety, frequent weighing of goods, continuous sales transactions and a lot of self-control, learning everything there is to know about grocery and retail. I learned a lot of customer service here as well, co-workers are very well mannered however management shows no confidentiallity to employees, the entire staff will find out incidents that take place in the store between employees and management or co-workers. The best part of the work enviornment are the children that come in with their parents to ask for a cookie."
good,First job and taught me to be self reliant. How to treat customers and other employees. Many of my old co workers are still friend to rely on to this day.
good,Kroger is an okay job for someone in college or high school who plans to be there short term. Not for someone holding a degree with real world problems and bills.
good,Given opportunity to try different areas of front end management.
good,Kroger is a great place to work. The people that work here are friendly and knowledgeable.
good,"I did enjoy the usual customers and getting to know them, I was able to show how patient i am with people and what a hard worker I can be. The hardest part is having a worker help you."
good,"did not like the flex schedule . co workers were great,management was good."
good,pick-n-pull
good,"Typical day at work was always very productive and fast paced. I learned more on great customer service working at Fry's. I learn to come out of my shell and not be shy when working with customers directly. Learn to slice meats the right way. Also, how to prepare subs and trays for parties or orders. Using the register as well. The management was good, but not THAT good. Depending on who was working that day work was able to very enjoyable. Not all the co-workers were the best ones to work with, but I still enjoyed working with them. The hardest part was having to learn and memorize all the PLU codes."
good,Working with The Kroger Company felt a lot like being around family. The learning experience I gain was vauable in customer service daily enteractions... You treat people how you would like to be treated... I took ownership in store duties and applied that to how I would like to recieve service(s) when I encounter such needs...
good,Start at 11 PM worked till 7 AM. Three trucks a week for stock. Learned to take inventory in a grocery store. Organize displays. Change out price tags. Management was great and so was the team. The hardest part was working so late. The most enjoyable was being able to work independently at times with just my music.
good,"was a very typical kind of job, laid back and very relaxed, i worked overnight which had no management , so you didnt have to worry about no one telling you to do this and tha, you just made sure you did the right thing"
good,"co-workers were great, management was good, enjoyed serving the customers and them leaving feeling satisfied. The hardest part of the job was standing"
good,It's a great work place and atmosphere to work in.
good,I loved this job. There were a few things that could change but nothing major
good,"I had a lot to do working in the deli, which was wonderful. My manager heather was great. I miss my coworkers. I wish I hadn't left to go work for convergence."
good,"always making positive changes, management and great employees. great cross training available, hardest part was maybe the transition of new training but challenges were always good in the long run"
good,"Chaotic catch up was a day to day basis while managing to keep the dairy department clean, organized, and stocked during store hours. Not much interaction with co-workers occurred unless the Person In Charge needed help in the grocery department. Keeping everyone satisfied was by far the most difficult thing to do because everyone had different standards and every customer that entered that premises became the boss. Achieving customer and manager happiness was the most rewarding part of the job."
good,"I enjoyed working with all of them. The manager was always giving me a hard time, which she brought me out of my ""shy"" shell working with people."
good,"A typical day at work starts with counting my drawer making sure I have the current amount of money in my drawer. I then deal with my customers as they come to me. I work closely with all of my co-workers. We all get along as a team. I learn something new every day. I enjoy my joy and every thing about it. I enjoy working with people, I am a people person."
good,"Kroger was a great place to work fresh out of high school .I learned many things (time management, customer services and operations) that I use in my current job."
good,The job itself was an excellent job however the management at the company was very lacking. The opportunity for advancement was not exactly the best to get into a better position took longer than expected if you ever heard back from anybody about your application. The best part of the job was however the camaraderie with your fellow employees and the benefits were fairly good. A typical day included helping customers with various purchases and then doing the various cleaning activities involved with your job.
good,"A typical day would be socializing with customers and co-workers. I cashier, bag and run self-checkout, which is working with six different stations at once. I learned how to be more social with stranger. My co-workers are easy to get along with and very helpful. The hardest part of the job is when it is super busy and customers get impatient, you have to try to keep the customer patient but when they yell at you or rush you, to keep calm. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with amazing co-workers and putting things back in their right place when people decide they don't want the products they have."
good,"Mariano's has been a great company to work for. I have been fortunate enough to have been given some great opportunities for advancement and growth, but this is not necessarily the case for all qualified individuals. As the company expands, a great deal of time is being put in to behind the scenes planning and seemingly not much action. The employees are great to work with, but upper management can be temperamental. The hardest part is that there really is no work/life balance, and as a manager, you can spend 12-18 hours a day at work (on a scheduled 10) and not truly be appreciated for it."
good,"Typically the day begins with me opening up the pharmacy with the pharmacist I work with that day. The mood is usually calm first thing in the morning but as time passes we get busier and busier. We have just hired a lot of new techs, so we are in the process of training them. I feel like the few good techs we have are moving on to different pharmacies, and honestly I see why."
good,Overall a company with room for advancement and great coworkers.
good,"Bag grocery, Help customer to there car if they asked, place items back on self and push shopping carts back in the store for customer. I learned how to work fast and to be patient. My co-worker were fun and friendly the hardest part of the job was dealing with anger customer the most enjoyable part of the job was working in different areas."
good,Co workers are really helpful
good,"The shift starts before the store closes. Trucks need downloaded and isles prepared for stocking. Floor is usually quiet because it is nearly to to lock the doors. The group of third shift employees is small. Maybe four or five. The experience gain was much similiar to that of what was experienced in th military when taking inventory and preparing for movements or deployment. Detail oriented, time specific, labor demanding and at times stressful. Management was reasonable. Co-workers were mostly compatibale. The hardest of the job was the physical labor requirement. The most enjoyable part of the experience were the co-workers. Just wouldn't have been the same without them."
good,Kroger the one that is located in Dallas Georgia. Is a nice well organized store I had a good experience there. The people that I worked with became very close to me. Were there if I needed some help or anything else we worked as a team. And made work much easier for everyone.
good,"Stocking, sorting and displaying new and current product."
good,"A typical day of work consisted of helping customers find what they need inside the grocery store, and the helping them check out. I learned a great deal of customer service and how to use the cash register. Managment helped when needed but were not always available to found. They were rarely on the floor and available within a moments notice. The co-workers made it a fun work place. There were alot of them of the same age as myself. The hardest part of the job had to be having to make a difficult decision conserning the customer's groceries when there weren't managers avaiable. I enjoyed working the closing shift with my more favorable co-workers."
good,typical day at work is going to work help customers make sure work area is clean and running smoothly.You do
good,I worked for kroger in the bakery and deli for a total of about 3 years in a small store. It was very difficult to advance in small stores. There were some people that had been there 14 years and were still part-time. Pay was not the best but having a union gives you job security.
good,I enjoyed my time at Ralphs. It kept me in shape and gave me insurance when I needed it the most.
good,great job learned alot while employed here how to drive forklift and other useful skills
good,"Good workplace, great management, work hard get more hours, hard work does not go unrecognized"
good,This is a great company to work for if you are looking to move up the ranks. Still many stores opening in the Midwest so your chances are high. Benefits for both part/full time employees and pay starts off ok but with time you're making great pay. Co-workers vary from store to store but for the most part everyone works pretty hard. Hardest part of the job is customer service. You need to have great patience with your customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is being reconized for your hard work and weekly pay checks.
good,"The work atmosphere within the Capital Management division was great and very light-hearted. Welcoming and helpful group, and really wanted everyone to better themselves. Half-day fridays were just great too!"
good,"Challenging, everyone was competition with one another in different departments of the store especially during peak season, learnt how to go from a counter clerk to a Supervisor position, hardest part of the job was to keep my friends from friends status as I became their boss but I learnt and they respected me so it made it enjoyale to come to work with a crew that cared and was willing to work for you."
good,"A great place to work for, easy to learn, warm enviroment, team and customer oriented"
good,"Great job, but not enough hours. I learned a lot and the people are great."
good,Its one of the best companys to work for cause of their love for the business and there employees.
good,Typical day at work involve being able to assist my customers and work in-depth with my co-workers at providing a great atmosphere for our customers. I learned that if you work with an open mind and are able to get along with everyone than your day will run smoothly. I also learned that work cattiness can cause problems if they persist. Management is pretty fair and is willing to work with you especially if they see you trying hard and putting your best effort forward. I learned that my co-workers have their good days and their bad days but want respect at the end of the day so I always tried to show them just that. The hardest part of working for this job is not alway being able to keep up with the flow and sometimes rowdy customers . The best part is being able to come to a job everything that's fun and for the most part easy-going. I also enjoyed the customer interaction because it was truly insightful.
good,"Good hours, never board, fast place work. good benefits"
good,I push carts and bag groceries. Work with fellow employees. I learned how to have better people skills and work better in teams. The management is good and the people are friendly.
good,"Great friendly environment. Ages range from teenagers to senior citizens. Great interactions with customers. Great, friendly management."
good,I enjoy the work. projects can be large multi year capital projects to helping a site solve an ongoing issue.
good,"A typical day of work consist in waking up around 5am, get ready and be there by 6am. As soon as i clock in i make sure what are my duties of the day, since this tend to change every day or so. Once i am aware of my main responsibilities i make sure, that all oven, stoves, are in full function, in case sometimes is wrong i contact my supervisor immediately. My co-workers are great people,we get along very well and help each other whenever it is needed. I have learned at Ralphs,that a happy customer will always come back, to be grateful for there business, but above all treat people t he way u want to be treated. The thing i enjoy most about working here, is the fact that you get to meet great people."
good,Great entry position. Not to much advancement but nice job.
good,It was a fast pace job on holidays. Sometimes work got in the way of school due to schedual. The work place was interesting. I was a courtesy clerk so I cleaned got carts and I also did such a good job I would help in the frozen department time to time.
good,"On a typical day at work my top priority is helping the customers. Every day is different, but still pretty much the same. We take turns counting, working the register, and working at data entry where we input the new prescriptions and take refills. I have learned a lot about different medicines, prescription and over the counter, and how and what they help with. My co-workers are friendly and helpful and fun to be around, even on stressful and bad days. The hardest part of the job, even though I am told I excel at it, is working the cash register. While simple in its operating, I am opened up to being yelled at by customers for problems that cannot be helped - such as insurance or problems with doctors not returning calls for refills, and other such things. I have even had medicine literally thrown back at me while I was being yelled at for something I was not at fault for! The most enjoyable part of this job is our regular, friendly, customers who joke around and are very patient with us. Another enjoyable part is my co-workers. I do not think I would still be with this company if not for them."
good,"Great place to work with flexible hours, and employee discounts on Kroger products. The hardest part of the job is only getting a 15 minute break."
good,Kroger is a good place to work. i miss working with all of my friends. the management was pretty good.
good,"Good crew and management. Pay is low,but they will work with your schedule if you are in school or have a second job."
good,Get to see new people every day and have many returning customers
good,It's refreshing and sometimes fun to interact with the customers and associates. Sometimes were moving fast and to me that's always fun because you don't have time to be bored because you can always work on something in the store. The hardest part of the job would be; when it's not busy the standing in one place by your register gets tiring. The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers!
good,The management and staff were always helpful. I liked working with customers to have an enjoyable shopping experience.
good,"Get to work with great people with team work attitudes. Company has courses through out the year for employees to learn new ways to better their jobs. They also offer employees opportunities to take their management classes, so you advance into other positions for the company. Department manager try to the best of their abilities to give employees flexible schedules."
good,"After working in the Dairy and Drug GM and Cashiering, I have come to learn that Kroger is an OK company. They are not very competitve with their pay wages but they make up for in employee discounts. The managers I have found out there don't really know what they are doing. The most enjoyable part about this job was the lessons I learned and the friends I made."
good,Job really works well with personal or family life. Work days are good. There is always something new to learn at Kroger because the company is constantly changing. There is nothing too hard about the job.
good,Kroger is a great company to work for. I am just looking to broaden my horizons with a new career.
good,Smith's was a great place to work you were treated like family when you worked there you could always count on something to make you more motivated to work harder wheather it be a bonus check or just a snickers bar anything was good to anyone everyone was polite and served customers with respect
good,"Productive day at work, everyday is different, my co-workers are very hard workers, helping others"
good,I was set to work for this company until my retirement but I was
good,"My experience from working at Kroger was quite interesting. Taught me that there are many different kinds of people in the world. The people that care, and the people that don't care. You will always have those people on any job you work at. The work environment was above average, but things were becoming challenging and no matter the task it has to get done. I made sure it was done whether I wanted to do it or not."
good,Kroger is a great place to see a very diverse group of people.
good,Solid profitable company that continues strive. Good training and a excellent company to start a career with.
good,"My experience working at this Kroger store was alright overall. The work environment was very easy going, yet no slack was tolerated. I can honestly say that the team work within this establishment is the foundation of Kroger's success. It was their main policy. Quality customer service was indeed provided, which put myself and the customers at a place of peace and ease."
good,great pay.....great people....but work life balance isnt the best
good,I enjoyed working with everyone at kroger. AThey were all very helpful and friendly. breaks were given on time and I was treated with respect by everyone from baggers to general manager. Overall this job was a great first job
good,Managers are flexible depending on what situation you have. They make sure that you stay busy and active on your work schedule.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of clocking in and out, setting up till, and maintaining a clean work station. Management is challenging at times however they try their best to work with employees."
good,"As a pharmacy student/intern, Kroger provided flexible work hours and a range of prescription fill averages per week, based on various locations. It did not pay quite as much as was reported from other pharmacies, but the environment was much more friendly to employees than others."
good,"During my three years at Pick N Save, it was quite a rollercoaster. You had your good moments and the bad. Every day was always the same. You go in and work, maybe talk to a couple people as you work, but, you don't interact much when it comes to the night shift."
good,"Union company, which us great. Get the ability to train in other departments and help when needed. Hard to move up without a good support team. And getting a full time position can be hard"
good,"Kroger is a really huge company. Great benefits, great pay, but the don’t give you all the necessary information before hiring you. Lots of last minute mandatory overtime given. They force you to switch departments after completing probation and some departments have completely different orders and schedules."
good,"Good place to work, good benefits. Not to much overtime, and decent pay. Challenging work, always fun. Plenty of learning opportunities and a good place to get experience."
good,"worked for Kroger Co for 6 years, moved up into management. Management in all stores worked with my school schedule, was hoping to move further into management, but took just 1 manager that didn't like me and got me fired for something that was out of my control and the Union didn't fight for me even though I was a member. One of the best companies overall I've worked for, despite the way I left"
good,"This is my first job and I don't know what makes this job stand out from the others. Hopefully, when I get another job I'll get to see what stands out from Kroger."
good,"Great place"
good,"Kroger makes me feel like a family member. I had fun working there. I received fair schedule, I got my hours with no problems. I never complained to anyone about this company. I always enjoyed coming to work and coming to work on time."
good,Basically I am looking for a job that's similar to my previous job position at Kroger. Basically as a stocking associate and helping unload the trucks.
good,"Worked hard, a lot more than others. Never really credited for my work but i still did what i had to do. Just wish the altercation never happened because i really loved the job."
good,"Overall, Kroger has been a good place to work.  My one complaint is that the managers are not open to suggestions or requests of employees.  If you do a job well, they are reluctant to allow to to try a different position in the store."
good,"Union is decent, only issue is they don’t just protect you, they also protect the jobs of those who come to work to cause issues or not work as hard as the next person!"
good,"Great people to work with but company as a whole does not value you unless you leave and come back. The flexibility for lower staff such as support or ASP is not offered. Either you are at work you are not , there is no option to work form home even though the job could be done from home."
good,"My days at work are bagging usually then going outside for an hour getting carts and within that hour we clock out time we cleaned the bathrooms and sign off and or do a store sweep. I do the trash around the store, go backs, spills. Helping customers find something or help to the car. I do the bottle bins and glass bins by hands! Picking up one by one glass bottle!"
good,i like being at kroger because its a big warehouse facility and i get to drive the pallets jack or and forklift to do my job sometimes it do get a little boring but dont mind it we also have only the stand up forklift so after about 8-10hrs i cant even walk lol
good,I liked it and the people are nice. The thing I liked the most is getting along wit the people and getting along w iddij t some customers. Somewhat good pay.
good,Friendly and energetic with significant landscaping experience. Teamwork-oriented and reliable. Practiced babysitter able to adapt to working with people of all ages.
good,"I had already done the same work for over 13 yrs, at Kroger was very easy like ALL of the other companies in the past 30 yrs!  I Needed A change, why not Maryland?"
good,"This is a great job for a Pharmacy Technician.  However, if you have higher aspirations, you can find yourself being stuck in a position forever.  For the most part management helps you to succeed, but there are constant changes daily.    It's hard to know protocol on certain things because they change at least twice each week."
good,"I enjoyed the work at Pick n’ Save it was very diverse. Overall they are a very great company as a whole, also I enjoyed that Pick n’ Save has weekly pay."
good,"Depending on what position that your are in and which specific Kroger that you are employed at, your experience will vary wildly. Not all Kroger's are the same."
good,"Kroger isn't a bad company to work with. They provide good hours, they can be flexible, and is a great way to start. Management can be a issue sometimes although. I have had bad experiences with management not doing their job well, caring for employees, being unfair to many employees. It can sometimes be like they are drowned in power over their employees. This isn't all mangers but i have had that issue with many."
good,"It’s a good place tp work pay wise and hours are flexible. Great coworkers and environment. I have a great lead in my department. He is a hard worker, a good trainer, and enjoyable to work with."
good,"Kroger was a good place to work. I just needed a full time job. When I started working there they promised me at least 30 hours a week. They began cutting my hours, I was down to 24 hours. If I could have gotten more hours I would have stayed."
good,"Working for this company came with good benefits and learning experiences. I enjoyed my time working for this company from a learning objective, but the mannerisms of some management was unsatisfactory."
good,My job was to return any items to their right location. I would help customers carry their bags to their cars. I would help customers find their items.
good,It's a good job it's nice fun people. You can have earbuds from 12-5:45 am it's not a hard job but a good workout. Most of the keep on task keep in touch with you for the most part
good,"I’ve also learned the importance of working with a group instead of working alone. Management weren’t so manageable. I felt like they were just doing jobs just to have the management title. The hardest part of the job was trying to get everything done within a small amount of time, and the enjoyable part of the job was seeing the smiles on customers faces after you’ve assisted them."
good,Great place to work good environment and friendly employees they will teach you everything you need to know and help you advance in their company very fun atmosphere
good,Need to make more employees full time. We deserve it. For the work we do. Need to post our work schedule more than one week at a time. Hard to plan other things to do. We do have a private life.
good,"Enjoyed my time with the company. Not your typical 9-5, fast paced detail oriented workplace. Started as a Produce clerk and worked my way up to Store Manager"
good,"Overall I’d go back to the company, but for right Kroger is not for me. The management that comes in gets worst than the previous crew, and Leads coming in from smaller stores have no idea what is going on."
good,"It was okay  everything about the job was pretty fun to do it was a good experience to work there you meet a lot of people working there, also it’s a good easy quick job for somebody"
good,A typical day at work was fun always busy I always learned something new every day management wasn’t always the  greatest everyone is very welcoming and helpful the most enjoyable part was the people I worked with
good,Friendly came caring understanding works with you helps u in any way they can they respect you just a good place to work if u want to be treated right
good,The thing about working for kroger when  needing hours is harder to get at this time. The company is changing for more online shopping and self check out.
good,Excellent team work. The companies main focus is on the customer which is great to make money. The company focuses on accountability across the board which keeps everything fair.
good,"A fairly decent place to work, if it payed more i would stock there again and if you dont mind productive and fast paced work then krogers is a excellent place."
good,The Kroger's company is a very good company to work for. Friendly environment to be in. Shifts are flexible if needed. Paid every Thursday morning. Store discounts is amazing and actually beneficial.
good,Hard part of the company was parting ways the company is change as years go on I didnt like the change of the company so I felt it was time for me to leave
good,There’s a lot of stress to get things done last minute but it’s worth it if you can do it . Most of the people are okay but the good ones make it better and worth while
good,"I worked at Kroger for almost 2 years. During my time there, I constantly got the chance to move up. I went from starting out as a bagger, to a cashier, to a U-as an operator, to a dairy clerk, and lastly to a meat clerk. Management was great. You would see the store managers themselves helping out in every department, which gave me huge respect for them. Very flexible with time off, and one full week of vacation pay. A year.i would definitely recommend this job to anyone who is in high school and wants to make some extra cash."
good,"I have read good and bad about Kroger. Take both with a grain of salt. Be your own judge.  I am still in the honeymoon stage. So far the corporate culture seems above average in terms of expectations and professionalism. The people and training so far are again above average. There are career possibilities here but you can also find great first job opportunities. Also great ""second income"" possibilities here."
good,Who I’d work with treat each other with respect. Mostly Everyone that I work with always treated each other as they liked to be treated by being kind and caring to one another. If there was a chance some employees try to help each other if they can. This is how I learned how teamwork is supposed to be done. It didn’t matter which department they were in they still showed teamwork.
good,I really enjoyed working at Kroger for all the experiences I gained in bookkeeping and payroll. The management team there were great. The hours were flexible as well.
good,The communication between workers is very critical when it comes to creating a comfortable workplace. It is very easy as long as you pay attention and listen to your instructors.
good,I've been known to be a great worker. Always happy and always getting people to come back. The managements are super happy that I work there and loves how I am with people.
good,"I'm pretty sure the hardest job us lifting things lime boxes"
good,Krogers was a very good work environment the other employs were always friendly and treated me fairly although at times management wouldnt help out very stable place to work
good,I became full time within one year after my hire date. I was also promoted to Assistant customer service manager. I was asked shortly after to become the cultural council lead for my store which is a positive leader to raise store morale for the employees. I was also asked to go on special assignments which consists of training new updates for the front end.
good,Kroger is a good place to work for a young high school or college student.. ive been working for them for 3 years and love it. Kroger environment is responsible and hard working. like everywhere you works their only small minor problems.
good,it was a great atmosphere. if you ever needed help a manager was always there to assist you in whatever you needed. They provide great training so there is nothing to worry about.
good,"they gave alot of opportunities to advance, and balance work hours. Great environment majority of the employees were nice some were okay. The customer experience was great but every now and then you'd get a rude one but everyone was mostly great."
good,The Front End Manager position oversees different associated depending on the location and oversees the largest group of associates as a department head.  It is a salaried position the works a minimum of 10 hours a day and at least 50 hours a week. There are metric goals that need to be met while trying to achieve the best customer service available with sometimes challenging obstacles.  Some of the FE managers have human resourcing duties such as hiring and discipline.  Most of the time is spent coaching and mentoring employees to meet company expectations.
good,"Overall, it’s a great job! But it’s retail. Weekends are super busy but the discounts are nice & I love the store management here! It’s a good place to work if you are willing to work!"
good,I started this job as a freshman in high school and it was the perfect job for me to still be involved in sports. They were always flexible with my schedule and understood I was in school.
good,Kroger itself is a nice place to work.  My own experience is I felt there was no more room for advancement within the company that would challenge an employee at store level.
good,I enjoyed meeting all the customers and seeing the regulars come in. Was pretty good place to work.. Only thing was store manager favoured some people more than others
good,"Good staff, friendly, work together, family culture environment, equal pay for men and women with raises frequently. Training was a little hectic on the till but it just depends on who you get. Management my first go round was horrible, the next year I came back it was a little better. No it's alot better I hear. There are lots of chances for advancement, just ask."
good,I clock in at 6am start filling in the sales floor. I also filled in the display cases and made salads for the day sales. Then I would go in the cooler and order lunchmeat and cheese and chicken  for the next two days sales. I also did markdowns and made out production sheets for things that needed to be made for the day.
good,"The job was easy, you mostly just had to know your way around the store because I often got asked for directions from customers. My managers were super nice and remembered my name before I even remembered theirs."
good,I've honestly enjoyed my more than 4 years with Kroger overall to the point that I would not be willing to leave for just any job that may come along.
good,Core values is great but some Management needs reminders that new staff brings in new vision and a new outlook into the future. Some good team spirit but convincing tenured management is lacking. Great break room and plenty of refrigeration for lunch. Needs privacy rooms for employees to make calls at lunch or break. Taking breaks of 10 min and clocking out is a tad ridiculous even though u get it back. Don’t punish everyone for a few employees taking advantage of the system not everyone is to blame. Hold them accountable. Process system needs improvement and it is being worked on.
good,"The people there is great to work with. Everyone had a positive attitude while working. That make it fun to work their but, they didn't give a lot of work hours."
good,You have to have great customer service and be quik at doing multiple things. It’s a team effort to get everything done at the end of your shift. It’s a tough job.
good,The hardest part of the job is getting everything done within your 8 hour shift. The best part of the job is making the customers happy. I feel like my experience and skills just weren't used to their full potential.
good,"Awesome company I had an understanding manger I was also cross trained so I was able to cover for the people that went on vacation because at the time we were short staffed, the benefits were good and the programs for college were good. I enjoyed working overnight but I had a hard time staying awake."
good,Company has it's good and bad point need better managers and workers but every store not perfect. Need better communication and better health insurance.
good,"I recommend Bakers; especially if you never had a job before , it’s easy and not hard to figure out . You get paid every week !! Also, you get to help chose your days off"
good,"it was your typical cashier job. Get there, clock on, go to your register, you are there till lunch, go to lunch,go to a new register, and you're there till close. workplace was fun, I enjoyed my coworkers. Hardest part of the job was probably the customers sometimes."
good,Kroger has a great management program that teaches everything needed to be a successful manager. You are paired with top management at the regional office to ensure you receive the information needed to succeed.
good,"I loved my job at Kroger. The people were great, the scheduling was flexible, and the customers are generally genuinely so nice. It’s a great starter job or job for retirees. But you have to be very strategic if you want to move up in the company. Be willing to really dig in your heels and possibly change locations. Only because job security is a huge bonus with Kroger. Plus side you’ll never be fired unless you do something off book. Downside, once someone gets an awesome promotion they don’t leave it until they retire."
good,Its not bad . cant complain too much. Decent hours . benefits and such . i dont like my coworkers but yours maybe cool . sometimes they let you get overtime .
good,got to know a lot of people learned a lot of things good for a first time job and for students they try to work around school and other work schedules
good,"I was only part time, but when I was there I loved it. Great company to work for. I loved the employees they made you feel welcomed. All the customers was polite."
good,"Was a great place to work while I was in the deli. I was getting 40 hours a week with every other weekend off. The only downside is, was limited to how many people we could have per shift in the deli."
good,Starting pay has improved greatly since signing of new contract. Full time people receive many perks that part time employees do not receive which is the main complaint
good,"Working at Kroger was a pretty enjoyable. I have learned many things in retail because of the environment that was at the job. I've learned how to operate a handheld device for inventory and orders, how to use a pallet jack, and how to grow as a person communicating with coworkers and customers. Honestly, the hardest part of the job was getting used to waking up for the early shifts, and helping other departments.It wasn't too hard to where I couldn't do it and I've learned how to easily adapt to changes. I really enjoyed meeting new people every day and getting to know fellow coworkers"
good,Very good company. Many excellent benefits as well as flexible schedules and adequate compensation. Management can leave a little to be desired dependent on the location of your store.
good,"I enjoyed working the graveyard shift with kroger mainly because of the pay increase that came with it, I did miss being able to communicate with a bigger crowd of people like you see during the daytime,  but with that being said i was able to gain a peace while working and not having many distractions."
good,It is a good job to work to learn the ropes. Management could be a bit annoying at times but you get used to it. I enjoyed it overall and have recommended many people this job.
good,The people at this job were people that would help you elevate if someone was to ask all the right people. Everyone was nice and the customers was okay to me.
good,Not s bad place to work as long as you have a good supervisor it is a job where u can go at your pace and get it done ....orders can be bigger than others because u do have double order nites....me and the backup supervisor broke the Peyton down and brought everything  to our co workers isles to stock
good,"Kroger company is great company to work for, have advancement if you have time to wait, but great second job for extra money or if you're retired and looking for something to do."
good,"This was my first real job and it was a great experience. Although some aspects of the job could be frustrating, it was still the perfect starter job for any teenage kid looking for employment."
good,"I worked for Fry's (in Arizona) which is a division of Kroger.  Although I was hired part-time and only wanted about 24 hours per week, I typically worked 28-32 hours.  I really didn't mind it because there was always plenty to do and the time went by quickly.  I had some minor issues with management and how they communicated, or in some cases, the fact that they did not communicate effectively.  My co-workers and most of the management were great to work with."
good,"Gu"
good,"It used to be a pleasant place to work when I first started , but became unpleasant after awhile. Not every manager cares about the employees.  It changed"
good,"Kroger loved giving black to their community, and youth summer position is awesome. trains well. and offing cooking classes, fun holidays, and great pace of working hours"
good,"Fun job but depending on department can be very physically demanding. Co-workers and supervisor were good and helpful. Good insurance and paid vacation, raises every 6 months. My only complaint was having a hard time lifting and pulling pallets alone daily. This ended up in me getting hurt to where I'm still affected by the injury 2 years later. Store managers could be a little demanding without chipping in themselves"
good,I had fun working doing overnight stocking but are times it would be stressful when I try working fast enough to get everything cleaned for the store to open.
good,"Amazing staff and coworkers , a lot of hardwork , old stores could use all improvements stop being cheap. Love your products. Customers are always nice and my boss and coworkers were easy to work with. You guys have many customer appreciations and people value that."
good,Good place to work for a first job to understand the workplace in general. People are nice so being nice back benefits you alot. When it's rush hour it can be taxing sometimes but overall it's a good job.
good,"Job gives you a sense of security for money coming in weekly "
good,"its a fun place to work."
good,Great people to work with and its close to home. I love doing cakes because at the end of the day i feel like my work put  on someone face. I feel very blessed to work at Krogers .
good,One of my first jobs fun down to earth. An a good time with the people I worked with and for. Plenty of room to grow. If the grocery game is your thing
good,Work was easy unless it was around the time of a holiday. Customers vary and that was a real pain. Store managers were switched out every few months. I was a part of a union so I did have some sort of job security but iI was never put into that position.
good,"All the workers were friendly and the job was easy to learn, good pay. They have great benefits and make sure that you know what you're doing and if you're not doing to good they'll encourage you to do better."
good,"Working at Kroger was okay. I don't understand why indeed is making me do this. You wanted 150 characters? Well, here they are. I dislike you very much right now. Enjoy."
good,"Working at Kroger was a wonderful experience. The reason why I left was because of the pay, compared to other places, as well as it being difficult to move up, in terms of positions."
good,Get paid every Thursday. You can work more hours than u need. Had to be people friendly I love working there. Customers are always nice in always leave a nice tip.
good,"Good management and job, but pay was not near enough for the amount of work required. Often dealing with difficult situations regarding customers while doing a significant amount of work with a starting pay of $8 which raises by $0.25/6 months."
good,"Krogers is ran by union..i love the people i work with,but i wish i had health benefits sooner rhan 9 months."
good,Favorites are definitely in the workplace. You must be able to work most if not all weekends. I've meet a lot of great people and some lifetime friends.
good,"They've had to cut hours lately, so there are fewer people on the floor on any given shift, meaning more responsibility for each crew member. Other than that the atmosphere is fun and the people are cool."
good,Kroger is a great workplace if someone is starting to work for the first time. The people who work there are friendly and acquaintances. Each department works together to keep the store operational and functioning. Overall the establishment was welcoming and great.
good,"I have been working part time hours at Kroger for about 7 years now. I have grown to love not just my job, but the people that I look at as family now."
good,"Kroger has pretty much a team based environment. Nothing really can't be down without the help of your teammates. Retail can be a very fast paced environment, but with a team to help you along the way, it can be great place to work."
good,"It’s a nice place to work, they do have scheduling issues though. Bakery clerk is not an easy position and is very stressful. Price team was a great team to work on and I would go back if the hours worked."
good,Worked there before and during my time taking college classes. Was comfortable with the work hours at first however wasn't happy that was was given full time hours with part time benefits. Once I started college courses managing the full time college schedule with full time hours was too much to handle on top of my then family situation and had to ask for my hours to be cut for the next semester. My grandmother asked that I quit to focus on my classes.
good,"Good first Job for people seeking to obtain work experience, if not had any. Very busy, so you’re always moving on your feet, standing still doesn’t exist."
good,Nice place to work. Great medical for employees. Fast paced work environment. Good co-workers. most managers in my experiences are demanding but fair.
good,I got this job when I was in the 10th grade. I worked there for 3 years and it’s still the best job I’ve ever had. They worked around my school schedule and my extracurriculars. We were like a big family. The pay was good for a high school student and after a year I had paid vacation. I don’t know any other high schoolers who got paid to enjoy spring break. The breaks are short.
good,"I worked there while in college and while looking for work after college. They were flexible with my schedule to allow me to study and get my hours in. They also told me if I wanted to stay I could have the option to move up to a manager position. Only downside is the starting wage is low, and does not increase often."
good,I needed a job to support my family......my dad worked there for 25 years in the meat department so I know how it goes from working with him and from also growing up.....great for college and high school kids
good,"Must be able to work in a high paced setting and multitask, thirty minute lunch breaks given for a full time shift, enjoyed working with colleagues and building professional relationships with customers"
good,"flexible work schedule "
good,Good people to work with but fast paced place to work. Always changing day to day never know what tomorrow is going to be. Must days time seems to fly by
good,"Can be a fun and rewarding job but can also be very stressful and under recognized position. Hours are long (10+) daily 5 + days a week depending on help, store conditions. Some expectations were not achievable based on the hiring pool and clients we had shopping with us."
good,I enjoyed my time working with the company that offered lots of friendships that will inspire new hires. A chance to boost your customer service skills while working with the general public.
good,Kroger was a fun place to work. The job was easy and everyone that works there is super friendly and just like family. Most of the customers were easy to get along with and regulars. It was a fast paced environment so it made for a quick day.
good,At Kroger I learned to not be shy and how to talk to people that I don't know. My coworker's their are nice and are great at their jobs. The hardest part of the job is scheduling fun outside of the workplace because no two weeks of scheduling are the same.
good,"It really all depends on your management staff and they rotate through managers every year or two. I've had a handful of good ones over the last 9yrs, but I've also had a couple that I'm not sure how they made it through management training. Overall, it's a good place to work, especially if your store has a strong UFCW presence. Benefits are good, flexible hours, discounts on store brand groceries, and family type working environment."
good,"A typical work day would vary.  For the most part, management would be supportive unless they became busy themselves. It also depended on the managers who were working that day as well. Some were more understanding and trained to work in a certain area than others.  Amount of work remained the same but the stress and business would depend on the day and time of day.  There was rarely consistency with what to expect for the day.  Over the course of working there for 6 years, I have gained lots of valuable knowledge that I will take with me where I go.  The amounts of training for what you need is there, but you have to actively seek it versus it just coming to you."
good,This was a great first company for me to gain managerial experience within 1 year of graduating from college. The management trainee program is ran really well.
good,I spent 6 wonderful years with fredmeyer jewelers in that time i met some wonderful customers that i looked forward to seeing. The environment that they have created there makes foe a fast paced and easy to learn job
good,a great place to have flexible hours and have great benefits. also a nice experience depending on what type of worker you are and flexible when wanting a change in the department.
good,"Hours are 8-5 or 11-7. Management was not helpful. co workers were very sneaky. Upper management was very fake and didn't really listen to employees, only management. It was a call center enviornment. I will not comment any more on this company at all. Have a nice day!"
good,"Great benefits and makes for an easy 40 hour week. Overtime is almost never necessary, but makes getting extra money difficult. Easy tasks. The hardest part would be maintaining good customer service with a high tide. The management in the Louisville division could be better."
good,Most individuals that work for the company tend to stay for long periods of time. Ex: 18+ years. They give you every opportunity to advance. They provide training and mentoring to grow to the next level of advancement. A wonderful place to work.
good,"Kroger sold their convenience store divisions and they eliminated my position or I would still be there.  In the ups and downs of today's business world, this seems to be common."
good,The store is a nice place to work. It is unionized and very fair for the workers. Earning full time takes too long and isn't worth it on the new contract.
good,"Working at Kroger was overall no to bad, but I made some made mistakes that (the first one was joining a union which 8 dollars out my paycheck every week) ended up costing me my job there, that out of the way working at Kroger was very hard and demanding at most times, but it could be easy and sometimes relaxed at times as well, most days would get there (Kroger) at least a few minutes early and clock in and put my stuff away and get to work by collecting carts in the stores parking lot, which most of the time the lot was full of carts almost everywhere and I'll add that maintaining the lot was challenging when the store was busy, or I would back people's groceries for instead which was not to hard,"
good,"Works well with your schedule, great benefits, friendly atmosphere, must have good public relations. Deal with public on a daily basis so you have to remember to deal with accordingly."
good,was enjoyable until a manger that was not good came in and changed up everything and shortened tons of peoples hours. payed weekly was a really nice thing.
good,"Benefits are very good and competitive.  Management is always there to answer questions when needed. Yearly reviews are done so you know how you are doing, do not just feel like a number."
good,I liked working here just didn't have the right transfer the where the job was. I got my customer service skills higher working with people and having the interaction that I had with them to get the things they needed and have them leaving with a smile on their faces
good,"started me at $11 per hour."
good,Had a great employee discounts on Kroger products and other discounts such as travel.  Company allows for flexible hours in terms of work schedule such as working longer days Monday to Thursday and half day on Friday.
good,Amazing place to be a part of the team and build friendships with amazing opportunities to advance your career as you go kroger is a fast pace yet relaxed environment
good,"Was lucky to have a good night crew, hardest part of the job was cleaning roaster & total cleanup from earlier shifts, lunch availability was anything in the store"
good,"Margins are smaller than ever and that is showing up in raises and hiring practices.  Metrics are the main focus of reviews, meetings and emails.  Moving away from original focus."
good,"Kroger is a great first job. It is super easy and laid back, all the people there are awesome and super friendly. I just left due to not getting any hours."
good,"This job was a lot of fun. I got to work with friends, talk about movies and games and all sorts of cool electronic gadgets with customers. Our manager was a super cool guy who had our backs 100% of the time and really did care about us. I wouldn't say that this was a Kroger thing, I just had an amazing manager who made the experience."
good,"As soon as you get to work, you hit the ground running. There is always work to be done. Sharpened my customer service skills and how to handle people more patiently. Great place to learn new skills. Some Managers are great by willing to listen to suggestions and learn how they can improve their stores with employee input. Others are just horrible. They act like they own the store and just can't relate to their employees. They walk around with a ""better-than-thou"" attitude and make some employees feel like their jobs are always in jeopardy. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult people whether they are customers or your fellow employees. Most enjoyable part of the job is the friendships you make. All in all, Kroger is a good place to work. Is physically demanding; some positions more than others. Benefits are great."
good,"Money was good but the stress level was high because of commision sales . Jewelry sales . Customer over flow was slow and very boring a times, it made the days very long.  Too much pressure on selling warranties."
good,"This Review is for the Jewelry Dept."
good,Kroger is absolutely a forward thinking company and there are areas who have embraced that notion more than others. There are many areas of the business that are slow to change and have not embraced a fast-moving mindset
good,"I loved the people I worked with and the customers. "
good,"A typical day at work in the customer service office in Kroger was on the brink of being stressful. Most days it was easy to handle so long as everyone did their jobs. However, communication is sometimes not the best, so it gets confusing on what to tell customers. Most of the stuff you have to learn as you go because they do not remember usually during training."
good,"Typical day was fast paced, I learned quite a bit about wine and liquor. My managers were great! The workplace culture was wonderful, my coworkers are fun and friendly. The hardest part about the job is the pay. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with all kinds of people."
good,"There are good things and bad things about this company. It just depends on what you’re looking for.  Getting paid mileage through Portland, Tacoma and Seattle you feel like you’re not making any money."
good,"had a great experience working for Kroger I felt like we were a family we all helped one another set goals made sure customers were happy, very good environment great benefits great company"
good,"I enjoyed working for Kroger. I would recommend this job to anyone who enjoys working with the public. It pays well, it's a great starter job but also something you can retire from."
good,Can to work sever meat and seafood to customers and packed and unpacked meat shelves and trucks. learned ho to cut and serve meat and seafood  as well as restock lunch meat containers and shelves.
good,"Typical day at work: intake of prescriptions, dispensing medications, inventory control, check incoming orders, and restocking medications and shelves."
good,Pretty laid. Busy during the holiday months. I loved my co workers and managers. The store was easy to map out to take back unwanted merchandise. Flexible hours
good,Worked my way up from Courtesy Clerk to Cashier to Front End Supervisor to Store Orientation Administrator. Only left because I have attained my degree from university.
good,enjoyed working here did so for nearly 14 years. sometimes still wish I did. Worked with a lot of good people here. Had fun and worked hard  here. good place to work.
good,"Everyday is fast paced. Always plenty of things to do.I currently deliver product to different departments, stock and condition. I enjoy the work but have had a major life change and am unable to work every weekend."
good,Truly enjoy the people that work for Kroger.  The company could offer more competitive salary and benefits.  They do offer vehicle and wireless plan discounts
good,It was a demanding job with good pay and great benefits package. Expectations were high and schedule could be grueling. They have excellent job training programs.
good,Everyday I was always busy doing something. I learned how to open up and be comfortable talking to strangers. Management was nice for the most part. The workplace is usually well staffed. The hardest part of the job is getting carts in the snow and rain. The best part is becoming friends with your coworkers.
good,I work 5 days a week include weekend. I like the management team where I work now beacause they are reasonable and understandable then they uplift employees in positive way that I like.
good,"Basically, you just had to learn the routine for each shift, for each part of the day.  There are many tasks, but none of them exceedingly difficult or daunting.  The ability to have different shifts with different tasks, allows for variation in daily routines.  Plus, promotes teamwork in the workplace.  The hardest part of daily routine is dealing with both customer and fellow employee personas or moods."
good,Everything is good I was very productive I've learned a lot of things I just did not like the flex scheduling and the difference and start and finish times that changed every week
good,Best job I ever had and paid well with the union. Strong chance for advancement there with great coworkers. Union controlled and plenty of job security.
good,"They offer a good starting pay at $9. Above minimum wage even though all new employees (under management) are hired in only as part time at first. However, they promise a min of 12 hours pr week and you're still entitled to receive Good healthcare benefits for a very inexpensive price. As with any job it can get stressful, but there are a lot of perks to consider, including a flexible schedule."
good,A typical ay at work is unlimited customer service for all customer. I learned about different vendors and their cost. Management is there for any and all question. The workplace culture is customer first. The hardest part of the job is a unruly customer. The most enjoyable part is calming down that unruly customer.
good,The 6 years I worked here where ups and down. I was one of the fastest cashiers they had. I loved it while I also worked in produce with fresh fruit and veggies. I just wish they knew how to talk to their staff.
good,"Meat Department is the most challenging department bc it requires a hands on skill that is not the easiest to train or accustom, Takes lots of time and situational learning and much time to acquire fines and speed. The amount of business the department takes on requires individuals to be fast. Also the wrapping aspect is a skill that takes time to learn, some individuals require more time than others. Kroger hires lots of part time associates such as retired grown men or women in there early 60's - mid 70's that do help and do what they can but its only a quarter of the job (helping customers/ weighing items). It puts to much weight on the rest which is already cluttered with constant corporate company changes and new job tasks added daily. The store management expects to much. Meat department associates should have a separate union contract other then being equal to all the other departments. It was like this in the past before my time where also there was a meat cutter journey-man/apprenticeship."
good,"Clicklist fast pace workflow, you were timed on how slow or fast you are picking items, and the constant having to push a giant cart around a store with guest, enjoyed the people i worked with. and the people in the store are usually nice. Would recommend for a college or high school student looking for a part time job."
good,I loved working there and I worked with some amazing people. I enjoyed going to work and it wasn’t as bad as i thought it was. I got paid breaks and it was easy to feel comfortable in that work environment
good,A typical day at work consist of of running the natural foods department. I had to stock the shelves and take inventory so that the manager knows what products to order.
good,"Would work there again, but would let coworkers know that this is work, don’t complain, stay focused and do your job. Some managers are awesome others aren’t that’s life all n all you make it what it is"
good,sometimes the workplace is quite busy especially during weekends. I learned a lot from them in terms of communication skills and technical skills as well.
good,The work environment at Kroger is very decent for all employees. I was paid fairly for what I did. The only downside was the amount of hours I worked was more than I would like.
good,"It was my first job and I glad it was, they taught me how a job feels. Great employees and mangers , it was a great experience for me around. Truly value what I learned their and I how could use it for comparison to my next job ."
good,"Work at Kroger was interesting, most of the day was spent stocking shelves and helping customers. But working in the meat department there was a whole other part of the job that consisted of preparing and cutting meat for sale. Learned a lot of stuff I didn't know before."
good,"I liked working here overall. Great people, good area, flexible hours. You definitely get to know your customers and look forward to seeing them during your shift."
good,Kroger is a focused professional atmosphere with increasingly reliance on selling services with the guise of customer service.  Reward is based on metrics established to avoid the opportunity to achieve set goals.  Customer services beneficial to health care are offered with no staff dedicated to the provision of these services. The result is added workload at the expense of dedicated services traditional to the occupation. Higher paid staff is reduced to benefit the bottom line.
good,it was a very nice place to work however I had to leave because I needed more money for college and the pay was not what I needed for that. Other than that it was great for the three years I worked there and a good high school job for anyone.
good,It was a great starter job for getting out of the food service industry. Hours were usually flexible. Had opportunities to move up in the store. Even started working on running a  register before leaving the job due to a PCS.
good,"In the pharmacy, Its a busy day on and off. The work environment is very fun and friendly. The hardest part about the job is meeting or exceeding goals on time."
good,It is a wonderful place of employment. I don't dread going to work daily. Majority of the other employees are fun to be around and make work enjoyable
good,I enjoyed it there but life had other plans. We had a newborn foster child placed with us while I was pregnant and dealing with my husband's career in the air force. Something had to give and unfortunately it was this
good,"Weekdays go by slow depending on what store you work at. Weekends , for example Sunday it was never enough cashiers or courtesy clerks and people end up having to come from other positions in the store to help out in the front. The manager that i had, had so many rules and no matter what happened it was always something that the workers have to do better. To me the store that i worked at , there was a lack of respect for the workers and that and many other reasons were why i had to leave."
good,I like working at the store.its fast paced and wild at times ..i love my job but at times its stressful ..i love my friends and customers .i hope to be here at least 4 to 5 more years .....before retiring ......
good,"It was a nice bunch of employees , My team was wonderful but it is tough at times with lack of people to work. My most enjoyable time was helping customers with problems and solving them. I learned a bunch on customer service and how to see both sides of problems from the customers point a view and the stores. I normally opens the front end at time of store opening and supervised cashiers and breaks, customer service personal, done money exchanges, drops, deposits, made sure customers were treated correctly."
good,"I have enjoyed working for this company. "
good,"Fortune five hundred company with a great reputation and brand recognition that precedes itself. Great central location, safe community, friendly and knowledgeable staff."
good,"Managers are understanding and flexible with schedule, serious about completion of tasks on time. They will put you in a department where you’re needed instead of where you may want to be."
good,"My job at Kroger was fast paced and enjoyable. They hire just about anyone who applies with a clean record. I was a bagger for over a year and it was pretty stress free work. A few issues that I ad involving pay and promotions was that they give you about a 6 cent pay raise every 6 months. They raise your pay by about a dollar an hour when they move you to work on registers. My problem was that I worked too hard as a bagger and they promoted the bad baggers to cashiers in order to be more efficient with speed and quality of bagging. This was just my personal experience with one store, and I never let it stop me from being a workaholic."
good,The only thing witn kroger is they dont care if you have a child and daycare is closed on Sunday's. If there is no other shift to pick from because you're at the bottom of sonority oh well. Other then that its great.
good,"A typical day may include periods of routine operation and frantic response to production line breakdowns. There is a wide variety of equipment to learn and management does what they can to provide for education and experience with them. The overall culture is one of extremes, from great cooperation and camaraderie to moderate competitiveness and strife among individuals. I find that learning enough about the wide array of equipment to be truly productive in a relatively short period of time is challenging. The thing I enjoy most is doing a newly learned individual task well."
good,It was a second job for me I enjoyed working there. The people made me feel welcome and we had a good team and the Management was fair. I wish it was full time
good,"I met a lot of great people working at Kroger. With different stores comes different standards though, so it all depends on which location you're working at as to how management runs."
good,Kroger provided a great work environment. You were able to speak to management openly about any concerns. Definitely worth working for to expand your knowledge.
good,A typical day is busy it take team work to help customer in the front of the deli and also help cooks in the back get the roaster chicken out on time.
good,being employed with kroger i did obtain the strength to gain customer service skills and also how to manage time. getting along with my co-workers was a challenge but we made each day count by staying focus on the goal into making sure that each customer got their service in time.
good,Growing to fast. Always short handed working 50-60 hours a week. I need a better work life balance. i want to se my experience and knowledge in Purchasing
good,"The typical day at Kroger is usually busy and very stressful at times. However, sometimes business can be slow. Sometimes, you work inside as a front end clerk and sometimes you work out in the weather with can be extremely hot, cold, or wet. The culture is friendly and professional. The hardest part of the job is pleasing sometimes unpleasant customers and demanding bosses. The most enjoyable part of the job is the pay, benefits, and flexibility supervisors have with your work schedule."
good,"During my time at Kroger we went through 3 different department managers. I feel like my department wasn't managed the best, because we always had people doing everything that a manager was supposed to be doing when the manager was sitting right there or just decided to leave early. I feel as if when you were first hired you were immeadeatly expected to be the fasted picker there was and if you weren't you were kind of made fun of. Another thing that I wanted to point out was that a newer, male employee was looking as his pay stubs online and noticed that he gets paid .75 more for working on Sundays so I decided to check mine and when I looked I wasn't getting paid the same. Even with these few complaints I would still recommend Kroger as a great place to work, they are also very understanding and are able to work with your schedule if your in school, have a busy life, or have a family but still need some extra money."
good,Working at Kroger helped me mold and shape the path that I want to take when starting my career. The scheduling was flexible as well as easy to work with.
good,"When I worked for Kroger for the first few years I was a front-end cashier the job wasn't too bad aside from a manager who I believed wasn't taking too kindly to me, unlike the other employees. When a new store opened up  I signed up and moved to the biggest store in the state third in the country (at the time). Mostly everyone was good coworkers. The manager thought it be best to be the cashier in the deli then move me to the bakery. I was all good and I did my best to keep everything and everyone happy. There were times I'd be stressed out but I got through it. after a while, I was switched to be a gas station (managers thought I needed to have different experience in different department.) But I did my job then I had to move from one state to another that didn't have any Kroger near where I was living. Overall Kroger can be a good starter job for someone just coming out of high school or during high school to get your money built up."
good,"The managers were nice and the work was easy enough, but it didnt seem like advancement was an option no matter how much work was put in, every one was treated the same"
good,"It was a good place to work for a short while but it not a job I would want as a career. A typical work day included bringing in carts from outside, picking up the trash, bagging groceries and sweeping floors."
good,"I was thankful that Kroger rewarded my hard work and loyalty with promotions and raises. I worked overnight, Krogers has a hard time hiring night stockers. Good place to launch a career."
good,Working at Kroger was very fast paced. It taught me to work in a timely manner and with quality. Kroger was all about quality. I enjoyed most of my working experiences there.
good,"A typical day at work is shopping for the customers and bringing out their orders when they are there to pick it up."
good,The Kroger  Co offers a great deal of opportunities for various career paths. They work hard to make the culture friendly and professional.  Over the past several years a lot of changes to the business structure have dramatically increased the workload for many salaried associates. Kroger stores are open 7 days a week and often 24 hours a day. This could mean a great deal of working hours across all 7 days. This should not be concern for young professionals without children that are wanting the experience these positions offer.
good,the team really leans on each other to meet deadlines I would recommend this for a lot of people the only reason I left was to find a day job and get off of nights but I would do it all again.
good,"The position was a satisfying job if one enjoys working with customers and supervisors to ensure customer satisfaction within company guidelines. In my position I was often outside, but company policy allowed us to dress appropriately to the weather conditions."
good,the environment is nice. they didn't offer me benefits and it did not get any paid time off. they do offer paid vacation after a certain amount of time working there.
good,I stock so its like early in the morning not a lot of customers around. You can work with headphones on so that's cool. You can have ratios and pericings
good,"well laid out "
good,i was working morning shifts when i first started working at krogers then i started working late shifts. its was okay i love morning shifts better but when you are working at krogers you have to keep up the communication.
good,"This job helped me get experience, the management is good, they listen to you but they will take awhile to take care of you. the workplace is a good environment to work and meet new people"
good,"I enjoy and appreciate my employment at Kroger however, I am beginning to feel insecure because of what I witness in managements closing sections of my department and terminating so many associates over the past month.   "
good,Due to Kroger's flexible work schedule and friendly atmosphere; would definitely recommend this company to anyone needing a first job.  There is job advancement available for those which would like to  climb the corporate ladder.
good,It’s okay management is okay. People you work with are okay pay is good. Hours aren’t the best they are all over the place. Managers seem to take interest in you.
good,"I loved my job but it just got to be too much!   I was the only one trained in Starbucks, deli, cafe, and bakery.  I was promised to be an assistant manager but was never allowed to do the job.  I'm good Dann good at what I do.  It really sucks they never gave me a chance."
good,"One thing i can say about Kroger is you will have some job security, which you wont find most places in Michigan since we are a at will work state, meaning they can fire you because of whatever. They have a union and good benefits."
good,"pay starts at 8.50"
good,"This is my favorite job that I have had. I worked as a cashier and in the liquor store. The store was bright, lively and high traffic. The staff was always very friendly to employees and customers alike. I absolutely loved my coworkers in the liquor department. They were all extremely hardworking and it enabled us to meet a lot of really great people. The reason I had to move on from the company is that it was difficult to obtain full time (I was part time for 5 years) and without full time I did not have benefits, advancement options or the pay which I needed."
good,This company had a lot of opportunities available. Management department was good and worked well with you. They truly look out for their employees and customers
good,"Typical work day was fast paced, structured, and team work oriented. Learned most functions of Click List procedures. My manager was the best manager I've ever had!! Everybody got along well and helped each other out when it was needed. Hardest part was getting up early. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I got to work with."
good,"Working here was productive, very fast paced and could be rewarding. I really enjoyed working with customers and some of my co-workers. You never knew what to expect on a day to day bases."
good,I worked for the clicklist area and I can say that job is a bit stressful starting out. It's nothing but physical labour but in the end I ended up loving my job.
good,I enjoyed working with the people  and talking to the customers as they came into the store. I worked in the floral department and I was able to greet the customers and assist them with their orders. I loved learning about the different types of flowers and how to arrange them.
good,"A typical day of work included bagging, retrieving carts, customer assistance, occasional shelving and facing products. Miscellaneous work included sweeping and mopping."
good,"The shift begins with a routine drag then picks up the pace as the day goes on. The customers always throw new tasks for any employee, but never leave unsatisfied. Management does take the time to know you and build a comfortable relationship. Lastly, for major holidays they do show their appreciation."
good,This company is great for individuals who are seeking their first jobs. They do not turn young people down and i like to see that. Working for the company is enjoyable but on holidays working in a grocery store its a little bit stress full at times as you can imagine.
good,A good first job and in the areas of IT you can advance. You may need to relocate or travel on occasion but Kroger will compensate you. It is retail so working holidays and weekends is a given.
good,"A typical day at work involves completing whatever it was you were listed to do. Examples of this would be bagging groceries, pushing carts, emptying trash cans, cleaning bathrooms, etc.. The management was overall good and pleasant to work with. "
good,"Kroger was my first job and I am happy that it was. It's a very team-oriented place and  everyone got along with each other. Pay wasn't all that good,"
good,"A typical day at work would be me setting up the seafood and meat sections, cleaning through out and interacting with customers. I would have to weigh, cut, wrap, or steam various meat and seafood items for customers."
good,I enjoy seeing my customers. I've learned a lot from Kwik Shop and from some of the employees. The hardest part is working alone on second shift and try to watch the store
good,Its a good company to work for if you are just starting out or if you want a job and can look past certain things that happen around you. Overall its a ok job.
good,"I typically closed the deli counter at night. The most enjoyable part of the job is the different range of people you meet everyday, with Kroger being a big store you hardly see the same faces everyday."
good,Fry's is a very nice place to work at. The management during my employment was fantastic. I would recommend to friends to work for Fry's. Great company overall
good,The people working there was nice. The company was fair and hr was ok. There was favoritism in store I work. I pick up another job casue they didn't get me alot of hours.
good,Kroger offered a fast pace productive workplace with with options for slight advancement. Kroger has a great employee base and great goals but sometimes difficult to meet tough goals set by management due to lack of employees.
good,I was there for three years and had the hours that I wanted to work and they work around school schedules. Good for students and for someone who is nervous for a first time job.
good,"I transfered in from Lanett, Alabama's Krogers."
good,"Being a Store Manager is a good position and has great benefits but it has long working hours. Meet alot of great people and work alot of holidays and weekends."
good,"As a pharmacy technician, you're required to have a lot of energy. To assist customers, interact with other health providers and cover all the areas that are in your area and outside of your area. The hardest and most enjoyable part of this job, to me, was the customer connections. The location at where I worked had a number of older folks and while it took a while for us to establish lasting bonds, some have passed since. "
good,"Since i work in the Deli, a typical day at work for me would be helping customers all day. Also i cook food. When i first started at Kroger i worked at Starbucks. the store i am currently at does not have a Starbucks :("
good,"Working at Kroger, you meet a variety of people which always made each day interesting."
good,"Good Job if you are starting out, but not a good long term job. I liked the the employees I worked with, but the job got very old very fast. It wasn't for me"
good,Working with Kroger was fun and easy for me. I usually had a good time going into work. My coworkers were all nice and the tasks they had me doing were simple. Very easy to catch on.
good,It was unorganized. It was dramamatic. The place was kind of divided. Everyone had there own groups of people they knew. A couple staff members were rude. The customers were rude. My manager was not as effective as he should’ve been. They didn’t allow me to change my schedule. The staff weren’t helpful.
good,Most employees here are temporary. High school or college kids just earning their keep. The ones that are full time and considered “lifers” don’t seem to be phased by the consistent flow of in and out employees. The turnover rate is high in the stores because there are so many young folk trying to get experience.
good,"This was a great place to work if you needed extra money while in college. It also was an easy job, and they worked around college students schedule.They paid enuff as a college student if you are not at the stage of paying bill yet."
good,Kroger creates a diverse work environment. The customers are nice and patient when you approach them to provide assistance. Employee work their best to provide the best service possible.
good,"Like all grocery stores, retail has its moments or good and bad.  As a national company the communication was excellent and everyone knew their job responsibilities.  I miss this company in Cali"
good,I always wondered what it was like to be a cashier and I'm glad i got it on my resume even though being a cashier isn't the biggest career. I didn't like how the boss didn't pay for attention to the employees outside because they were just fooling around rather than actully do their job.
good,"would either start operations, shut down or take mid day shifts."
good,"I enjoyed working at Kroger’s, it might not pay top dollar, but it’s very flexible. The managers and coworkers can help a lot when you need something. Benefits are reasonable and we do have paid time off."
good,"Kroger instilled duty, time management, exceptional customer care and customer service skills, and responsibility. The coworkers were some of the most friendly people to work with and helped to instill a safe and fair environment."
good,King Soopers is a wonderful place. Most companies focus more on sales than providing costumers with the best customer service. All Kroger stores whether groceries or merchandise make sure its the best version they are getting. They make sure customers make it feel like home which is something no other company really does. Kroger makes sure they're customers get the best and make them feel like family.
good,"Very quick paced, advancement opportunities are available and equal opportunity is avail to everyone. Create a family within the business four walls. Everyone is a team."
good,Working at Kroger's is a place for people who love interacting with people and have great customer service skills. You have to be able to adapt to change and understand the workplace culture to apply it to your own work ethics.
good,I learned many different jobs while I worked for the company.  The hardest part of the job was the fast pace and was also an enjoyable part of the job.
good,If your looking for a job with great benefits korger woukd be a great place for you! After working for around 9 months and 20 hrs a week you can receive benefits.
good,Day usually consisted of running a cashier all day and simply receiving patients medication. Resolve insurance problems and assist the Pharmacist as much as needed.
good,Been working here a while now and I want to do something different. I learned so much being here. I worked with the company for 4 years and if the pay was better I would probably stay.
good,"Not a bad place to work if you don't mind having a different schedule every week. Lack of full-time positions make working in larger areas a problem, most positions only guarantee 20 hours a week."
good,Kroger was a good job with lots of room to move up quickly if you are willing to learn and work. I was let go for medical reasons but if I could I would go back.
good,I liked working here a lot. Management was always stressed out and employees usually took the brunt of the stress that the managers were under. Management style conflicted with my PTSD.
good,I enjoyed working at Kroger I worked there a little over 8 years I was Manager at the fuel pumps for around 5 years then they ended up eventually building a Starbucks inside and I became manager of the Starbucks but all in all I enjoyed my time at Kroger
good,"A typical day of work was usually showing up at either 1pm or 5:30pm and then stay till 10 to help close down the meat and seafood department of the store. We were also asked to welcome any customers that walked into the Meat and Seafood department. One of the biggest things that I learned from working at Kroger was the importance of properly communicating to others. Workplace culture will vary between each store and department, however I believe that the store that I worked at had very good work culture. The hardest part of the job was probably the midday and dinner time customers that each wanted something steamed. The most enjoyable part of the job to me was meeting new customers and working with everyone else in the department."
good,"Reasonable pay, good managers and co workers, very heavy on satisfaction with customers. My manager is a good teacher, not a lot of stress, depending on which department you're in. overall a  good part time job"
good,"The workplace culture is very family-oriented, they look out for their own employees. However sometimes the company may not value them as much as they ought to. It's a fast-paced environment in the IT sector."
good,Kroger has shaped me into the employee I am today. They challenged my skills in every way and thought me that I have a great work ethic. The union benefits are amazing as well.
good,"This is my first job and have made so many friends here. The environment is not fair, for they are not flexible with schedule changes and any upcoming conflicts."
good,"With Kroger being an industry leader, it's easy to see why anyone would feel secure with the company. This was easily my best job to date, and I regretfully left to seek other employment. Such a great company."
good,Kroger is a flexible company to work with. Most store managers are willing to work with your school schedule. The insurance benefits are a plus and also dental.
good,"Fred Meyer is a busy store but has a remarkable customer service , the pharmacy has the best operating system , once you get used to it , it is harder to work on others"
good,While working At Frys has been a career boosting experience it still has many flaws such as a sometimes unclean environment and minimal time to rest. All and all I have learned a lot from Fry's but at times the cons far out way the pros
good,"Very busy and fast-paced. Never a dull moment and flexible with hours, paid time off, sick leave, vacation time, etc. Hours can get very slim at times."
good,good job but the management there wasn't the best . always had people calling out and on top of that when you worked and covered departments that wasn't yours it wasn't noticed.
good,"Fun job, just inconsistent hours.The co workers were very fun, usually highschool or college kids but the work is pretty simple. Everyone was nice and helpful."
good,I would still be there is not for the move to Alabama. I like the people I worked with and the customers. Management let employees if we was doing a good job.
good,The Job opportunities here are great. Its a great place to start if you are just getting out of high school or just starting a job career. However Management is not the best within this company.
good,"Dealt with the public on a daily basis as I worked in customer service. Dealt with exchanges, western union etc. Had to be very calm when customers were angry."
good,"The job description during the interview didn't match the actual work environment. In my capacity, I was amazed that I was working until 1am.  Enjoyed management staff but not the hours."
good,Nice atmosphere. Employees are friendly and very helpful. Benefits are awesome. There are many of benefits for working for kroger. I would recommend the job to anyone
good,It has been great experience. I learned a lot of new skills. The management was fair and there are a lot of opportunities for advancement. I recommend it.
good,King Soopers is mainly know for being a company that allows people will special needs to work and get a feeling of the working world. I loved that about them being happy to lend the hand to those in need. I felt as if my co-workers that were special needs had more or the same skills as I did and were able to get their job done a in and efficient and timely manner. On top of that the staff really make you feel as if you belong at Kroger and offer many career advancements.
good,Work can be intense but it can be done. Also is a great place to gain value in the company if that’s what you are looking for in Kroger. If not it can just be a good starting point for you.
good,"At Kroger, I learned how to make schedules based on tasks for each day and the daily sales volume. I also learned how to order seasonal products based on mark-up percentage and their performance in previous years."
good,"management is pretty fair, good employees to work with, will work with schedule if  your part time getting to full time takes 14 weeks of consecutive 40 hours with nobody on vacation or leave of absence. benefits after one year but are great."
good,"It's a good place to start and there is advancement. You start from the bottom and work your way up or you can switch departments, advance there and switch again to become valuable to the company"
good,"Great job but the work to life balance sucks. Depending on who is in upper leadership (corporate) you will have different expectations. The current president of the division I am in does not want you to leave the store until it looks immaculate, which means you may have to work a 12 hour day to achieve that. Overall it’s a great place to work but it really is a bummer missing out on family events and holidays to be at work. Pay is Ok, could be better, could be worse. Benefits are great though."
good,"go in clean up and stock as much as possible within 4-6 hours "
good,I like working there. It gave me insight and growth. I was a little shy before working there but thatnks to dealing with customers I open my mouth up more.
good,It was a good temporary job. Interacted with customers and rang up prescriptions. did data entry and basic cleaning. Counted and properly labeled medication
good,"Clicklist is an enjoyable department to work in, all things considered. It's difficult but manageable when you put enough energy into it. There is quite a bit of lifting and tons of walking that is required, but it's not too difficult until you get five to ten orders that have to go out within one hour and you're understaffed at the time."
good,I would recommend too definitely work with them I alot of opportunities too grow and advance good people too work for I had good years with them they gave me a chance and i am great ful for that
good,"I enjoyed working at Kroger , helping people. then only reason I quit was because they work on a part time basis. I needed full time and with them being union it hard to get there."
good,"Awesome, supportive team that was willing to patiently teach you everything you needed to know to do your job."
good,"nice place to work but stressful when there are not enough employees available during a rush. they have special dress down days depending the time of the year. football, halloween, christmas."
good,Great for a first job or a part time job. I enjoyed the work environment and the people I worked with. They work with the schedule you need for the most part.
good,"Kroger is a great company that recognises certain associates who cares for the business and for their customers. Over the span of being there, I have actively engaged with my coworkers and their management."
good,"Food4less have it’s days, everybody look out to help the new employees. I think the management organization need new some improvements. But so far from my experience I enjoy working at Food4less"
good,"Busy, it is fun working with other co-workers but some of the management is rude to you and acts like you do not know anything about your job. But besides the rude management  and it being busy most of the time i must say i do have a good work life balance."
good,"pretty laid back just do your work and listen not a lot to do so it always good looking for more work, I learn a lot about people. "
good,I worked for Kroger in California for 29 years. From store to corporate office. I enjoyed working for this company very much. I would not have left if they office had been closer to my home.
good,The job was nice something i never done before. The people were very nice and everyone helped each other. The only thing i didn't like was the pay not enough.
good,"A typical day at work some days fast pace, difficult days and learning new job training about the job, working with different customers with different types of attitudes on a daily basis."
good,As a salaried manager over 8 depts. and 300 associates my work load was as to be expected. The overall managers of the company are caring and helpful and enjoy helping associates to succeed. 
good,"I like the people the work environment it's a nice place to work"
good,"Ideal job for a high school, college, or elderly person. There is some room for advancement. I liked that they got paid every week and they had very good discounts."
good,"Fast paced and customer focused company with a variety of areas in which to work including grocery, service  deli, Meat, Produce, bakery, Nutrition center, health and beauty care, front end, parcel, cashier, Home improvement, Home fashion, Garden, fuel center, e-commerce, Pharmacy, apparel, home electronics and Fine jewelry."
good,It's a very nice company to work for you are able to advance in the company quickly you are able to get all the training you will need thru the company which you can apply in other fields if you choose to
good,This is a good job for a teenager still attending high school or for the elderly just looking to make extra money. There is room for advancement if you stay with the company for years.
good,"after working for the Kroger Company for over twelve years in the meat department, for the most part i loved working for this company. For most of my time with them the work environment was relaxed and very productive. a typical day included keeping the service cases full of product and interacting with the customers. when not working back in the meat room. when you were not on the sales floor, your time was spent either unloading the truck or wrapping  product to take to the sales floor. along with pricing head to make sure you have everything you need and you dont get behind"
good,"I worked as a clicklist attendant. Management was fair, but the hours were inconsistent. Sometimes we were so busy, but other times there was a lot of standing around doing nothing."
good,I had this job in highschool and I liked it. Worked after school and on weekends bagging groceries and helping deal with customer issues. The pay was good for a high school student who just needed to pay for gas in his car. I
good,"It's a very good place to start your first job but the pay isn't very good unless you get a high up position which depending on the store might not be available for many years, or have worked there for many years and got full time."
good,Kroger is not a bad job but it can be much better. too many distributions send to stores. most of the time you have to unload the truck while managing the store. Not enough hours to given to achieve company results.
good,It was my first job and was able to work and still attend football practice. I learned how to communicate and work with others in a fast paced setting and always developed customer service. When an employee gets a compliment they would make stars and post the compliment on a board for everyone to see.
good,"Kroger takes care of its employees very well. As an entity, the company itself is great. There are a few sticks in the mud that made the job unbearable for me, but that's just my own bad luck. In my 3 years there, the vast majority of my experiences with management and other employees was great. I would highly recommend as a first time job, or just something to slow down the pace."
good,"Working here at Smiths is a very friendly Environment, at times can get stressful when busy, Management is the best I've had, they are very kind and make you feel comfortable in your work place."
good,I worked there for 3 months before I moved and it was good. it was fast paced and was completive with a nice break room. it also had a starbucks located in store.
good,"One of the busier locations in the city. Generally, friendly customers, prepared and professional employees. Always a new experience at this location daily."
good,I worked there for over 20 years. Great advancement  opportunity.  Great pay. WillingNess to move you closer to home. A complete benifits package. Professionally managed. Quick to help you resolve any issues dress code is pretty good.
good,Every employee was easy going and joking around but also got the job done and help customers and other employees so they can do other work. Laugh when we needed to get the job done on time.
good,This was my first job and I became aware of the hours and work put in by customer service workers. This job was a good start but with the pay and hours that go by very slowly its not somewhere I'd like to stay.
good,We had a great group of people who worked well together. I used to open the store and sometimes close. A lot of people you knew shopped there. Our location was not as busy..
good,"I Trained as a cashier, it was very busy. Hardest part was ringing people up as fast as i could. The most enjoyable part was being promoted to cashier."
good,"Fun first experience. For those who are in high school and are looking for a first experience, it's a decent place to learn. I learned and had a great 2 years there. Had to leave due to school."
good,Kroger is a great company to work for they have good benefits. The pay is good if you are a department head or back up but you have to work your way up in order to get a good pay scale. Seniority is the key at kroger.
good,"This was a great job while I was in college. While there was no opportunity for advancement, I knew that going in. If you don't plan on staying there, then expect not to get moved up. You had a raise every quarter which was nice. I've never really known a company to do that. All in all, the location was a great atmosphere when I worked there."
good,"Kroger is a good place to work . tends to get busy. Often short of help. fast paced and tend to work overtime witth no compensation."
good,They were very short-handed but did the best they could with what they had. Everyone was very nice and tried their hardest to help and they did everything that they could to support their employees and future employees.
good,"Overall day consisted of stocking, zoning, unpacking, and good customer service. The general culture was mixed and the managers were knowledgeable of what they wanted to be done"
good,"A typical work day would be quiet at first then very quick paced, then slow down again. I dealt with quite a few angry customers, mostly returns or exchanges. The management didnt really communicate well, but showed improvement every day."
good,A great place to work and meet the customers needs. And form great customer relations. And friendships. Competing prices and maintain 100% customer service
good,"I started when I was in high school and really was fun and got to interact with people my age.  Throughout the years, you get to develop with more responsibilities and advancement.  Can be a great place to grow with the company or pay the bills through school."
good,The Kroger I worked out was very fast paced. I loved it. I love working hard at my job. I loved working with customers and helping/finding there needs. The managers in the store were great. I did learn to become a  pharmacy tech. thur kroger which was a good learning experience.
good,I haven't worked at Kroger in over 12 years and would not be able to provide current feedback.  I learned a lot on the practice of pharmacy as an intern
good,the best part of my day was working the paper towel section the worst was stocking the remains of everyone else's area. other than that Kroger was a decent place to work
good,I am currently in college and they really help me with the flexibility to work on my homework and work. Managers are really easy to speak to and the job is very relaxed.
good,"This job was definitely my favorite. The work was easy and the managers, with the exception of one, were great. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was the interaction I got with customers. My positive attitude was a welcome surprise to many and I feel through these interactions I was able to make people's shopping experience a positive and enjoyable one."
good,I enjoyed every minute working at Kroger. Friendly people and relatively easy work. I would've continued working there if my schedule had allowed such.
good,"My job in floral is the best!"
good,"I enjoyed working for Kroger and they really stood by me during a rough patch in my life, having a new born and helping me get to the young grown woman I was becoming they were a unity. We all worked together the only thing that i had a problem with was when i moved up to prep, and closing shifts, and not able to up my pay, bc I was more than just a deli clerk and i felt like that i should have gotten a raise."
good,I really enjoyed the time at King Soopers. It was a really good first job. Getting experience was apart of working at King Soopers. It was really sad when I had to leave.
good,My job at Kroger was fun and sometimes hard. The hardest part about working at Kroger was lifting heavy items. I enjoyed working in the bakery and baking cookies.
good,Never slow or boring. Nice family atmosphere. Everyone worked as a team. Great people to work with. Fair pay. Great benefits. The only problem I had was the schedule was not very flexible.
good,a typical day/night at work would be breaking down the merch and sorting out the merch the management was okay long as you did your work didnt have to worry about anyone down your back
good,"Kroger is a great place to start off as a first job. The hours and pay is pretty good for a high school student starting off. The harder you work, the easier it is to get moved up and to get more hours and higher pay. All and all, I’d say it’s a pretty good place to work."
good,This is a decent place to work for someone looking for their first job. It doesn't take much effort to be productive here and has a ton of nice employees.
good,Kroger is a great company to work for with lots of room for advancement. Senior Leadership is very engaging with all employees and keeps them aligned and informed on the vision of the company.
good,Working at Kroger on the front end was an excellent introduction to the world of customer service and retail in general. Being in the fast-paced environment and learning how to remember and enforce policies under pressure are solid ways to build patience and the temperament for customer service in any field.
good,I loved working at Kroger. I had a well balanced staff and friendly customers. Only downfall I feel the pay isn’t up to par especially the amount of work you put in.
good,"Pros- You can make your own schedule "
good,I love it there but it was getting stressful sometimes and the csm where i worked could have done better at their job than being on the phone. Overall i love it there
good,"None wrong it was just a chill work place, i had to leave because it got in between my classwork, football so i had to leave school was more important"
good,Kroger is a good company to work for with great benefits but you have to wait a year for those benefits to kick in. It takes too long for them to let you advance within the company. Seniority didn't seem to matter when it came to the scheduling you.
good,This place was a great place to work back in the day. It was unionized and the union would have your back. Now the union does nothing for you to protect you or your job. Be cautious if you apply.
good,Good environment. A great place for internal advancement in the company. Chances to work with all kinds of departments within Kroger. Both desk and in-field job.
good,"Work in Optimum Wellness Center.  Very familiar with supplements, herbs, holistic medicines, organic beauty products, organic cleaning products, probiotics.  Complete demonstrations on products, grocery store tours, ordering vitamins, and assisting customers with all their supplement needs."
good,"Working for Kroger entails great customer service skills and the ability to problem solve quickly. Everyday requires cleaning, stocking, cashiering and cooking ( deli and bakery). Tending to customers is the largest part of the job. Good breaks and lunches are provided along with benefits and pay. Management does move quickly however and turnover is a common occurrence."
good,It was a place where I grew as an employee and learned the basics of customer service and how to communicate with others in order to get a chore or job done around the store.
good,Typical work consists of at least 10 hours.  Work life balance isn't the best.  Pay needs to be better.  Busy and the ability to multitask is very important.
good,Great employees and staff customers are the main focus and i enjoy bringing a friendly clean  environment for customers to enjoy there experience and time so the come back again with the same expectations
good,kroger is a fun place if you make it fun. It does take a lot of work and focus. Its an easy place to start off in to work your way up to your next job.
good,"This was my first ever job, and I enjoyed working for this company. I competed in bagging competitions and also I was offered a raise and a higher position, Typical job duties were; bagging groceries, assisting customers, clearing lot of loose carts, cleaning the building, etc. I learned how to apply great customer service, and the culture was sensational. There was no hard part or bad day working there."
good,worked early shift and enjoyed what I did. management was good firm and fair. Im sure there was overtime to be had but I never worked it I never needed to work overtime
good,"Generally most employees are very friendly and kind to others."
good,A to the point work environment with flexible work hours and a steady pay that came weekly. I worked the evening and morning schedule with some graveyard shifts scheduled as well. I had a very consistent work schedule and flow due to flexible hours that were set for me.
good,"I learned quickly during my training at Kroger, it wasn't hard at all. It was a great job and overall a great place to work. Although they are  a union, the pay was nice and it met my schedule requirements."
good,"I learned what it was like to be valued as an employee, I would speak and my voice would be heard and I liked that. The upper management would actually care about my qualms however little I had and took the time to get to know me."
good,Kroger values its employees and customers. Most people who join the Kroger team also retire from this company. The company is a great place to works in any job title.
good,"Everyone is your friend. Going to work was nice knowing you're in good hands. The store is great to work for. However, working for KROGER was the downside. The pay is very low. They make promises they cant keep. Rarely see anyone get raises. The hours your scheduled may seem low, but they always need to call people in so you're able to fill in the gaps."
good,"I can't complain much. The manager was a bit much at times, but other than that overall a pretty nice first job for a younger student. If you were in my position, a bagger, it's pretty simple."
good,Excellent place to gain experience in retail pharmacy. Would recommend to anyone who is starting out in a retail pharmacy. All the Pharmacists that I have worked with in my years at Kroger are some of the most knowlegable in the business.
good,"Was an entry level stock clerk. Handled customer's groceries, assisted them with their purchases or any questions they have, performed maintenance duties in public and break room restrooms, retrieved carts, and performed other manual labor tasks. Hourly pay was minimum wage but job was Union. Management was not always stellar. Certain employees were troublesome. Interaction with customers was very pleasant and best part of job."
good,It is pretty fast paced. The best part about Kroger is how customer oriented the company is. The customers always come first and the company prides themselves on that. Management is okay they just change too much its hard to get used to one person then they are gone. There really is no hard part of working for Kroger.
good,"Extremely flexible schedules. Get any day off."
good,They would take the time to teach me things I needed to know and work with me on any problems I needed to take care of. The staff was always so nice to one another and willing to help any way they could.
good,"It was a good place to work, I did enjoy the store and the employees. The management staff within the clinic needed to change and that change did come, people are now better off"
good,"Most days were fairly balanced, stocking the meat wall and keeping things clean. Some days were terrible, coming in to 10 hours of work for a 6 hour shift (4 pallets of meat and having to clean/sanitize everything). "
good,The customers and my immediate team leaders were great to work with and for! The entire staff was friendly and management. I enjoyed working for Kroger.
good,I learned a lot from working here. It was a great experience. Took many training seminars that I really enjoyed. Was always on my feet but honestly didn't even notice .
good,it was my first job in high school and i loved it. very easy to move up in the store and not too difficult to where young people can't get the hang of it.
good,"With the employees that was there, it was very fun to work up there, we worked as a team, everyone got alone, and learned so much with the system and each customer, the hardest part about working with this company is keeping medication in stock. But the joy about this company is how so many customers did our survey and always acknowledge the work that I do"
good,The typical day consists of a shift that can be 4-8 hours long. Usually I would clock in and check the lines. This would tell me when I have carts so I would do sweeps and retrieve carts for that hour. The rest of the shift I would either do go-backs (which is to return unwanted merchandise to the shelves) or bag groceries for customers at the front end. A lot of the time customers will ask for help locating items so it was also my job to walk them to the aisle and offer more assistance. Depending on the amount of time I was working I could either have a ten minute break or two if it was a longer shift.
good,"I've been with Kroger for two years. When I first started, it was during the holidays as a part-time meat/seafood clerk ($7.30/hr). I was getting really good hours. After that, they were cut back because of how much we were allocated in my department. I cross trained in different departments to get just under 40 hours a week.  Within six months I was promoted to the lead seafood clerk position. The pay step was needed ($9.20/hr) but i thought i would get a little more because backups started off at $15/hr. The work was challenging but manageable until another Kroger close by was closed. We got all of the business and an entirely new management team. In the end; people quit , contracts were renegotiated (minimum wage was bumped to $9.30/hr I was  bumped to $12/hr) and because management never worked with us to build a relationship they now have impossible standards for us to uphold. That with the added business made a fun job being a community store for customers something stressful and focused on meeting demand in a fast paced environment. I love the relationships that I've built with people: associates and customers during my time here but it isn't worth the added stress with a lack of hours to get the appropriate help in. And corporate is a joke that can't make up their mind. Policies change and expectations are raised while compensation stays the same."
good,"I wish I would have stayed at Kroger. My personal store had management issues, but I have talked to many people after the original managers left, and they said it is much better, and I have heard the same from people at other stores. The weekly pay is great, too, and the discounts are nice. I also got relatively frequent raises (although I don't think that was necessarily all that common)."
good,I really enjoy working there.  I would like to find something with more of a job advancement opportunity.  I have been there for almost a year and I really enjoy it.  I just would like a job with career advancement.
good,kroger is a good company to work for. A typical day at kroger was not very stressful but when we had company coming in thats when it got very stressful.
good,"its was very fast paced, there was lots of work to do as a courtesy clerk. managers were fair and respectable, pay was decent. break room was nice and hours were plenty."
good,"Had fun their for the most part, was trained on a lot of jobs, which I appreciated to make me more of a asset to the company. I worked in different departments during the 13+ years I was there. Started in the Deli and I really did not like, yet I was just happy to have a job in those days."
good,"Laid back position, Over-night stock is a strength demanding job. I enjoyed this position because it taught me how to read Plan-o-grams and to perfect my organizational skills."
good,"A typical day at work includes talking to customers, cutting meat, stocking, and really just anything I was asked to do. It wasn't the worst job I didn't mind anything but the hour I was receiving. Other than that I did enjoy my time at Kroger and I wish that I could go back and work again"
good,"I enjoy working at Fred Meyer, but there are no raises, and really nowhere to advance which is frustrating.  Management are great, but there things are said that never happens for the employees.  I want to be able to grow, and succeed and Fred Meyer is just not the place for that."
good,"Kroger is a decent place to work, and provides substantial benefits to even part-time employees. However, the take-home pay is low for less experienced employees."
good,I enjoy working with my associates. Management is good. They work with you as in your schedule . I enjoy that customers know me by name and when they compliment me that I'm friendly.
good,"For the most part an overall easy job. Management team is aberage, and the pay is decent. I definitely like the fact of working overnight. Hardest part about working at Kroger is the fluctuating hours."
good,"Overall, management and condition of store was mediocre but most else not having to do with the store specifically were great, including benefits and the Union."
good,Great place to start a career in retail and in the customer service industry. Lots of hours and room to explore and exercise training and consumer satisfaction.
good,"Very nice people, the coworkers are very helpful. Management was available any time they were needed. Work supplies were short at times making it hard to complete jobs."
good,"This was my first job. It was part time, nearly 20 years ago. I enjoyed working there then, but with so much time having passed, I would be speaking out of school if I were to evaluate Kroger as an employer today."
good,Loved working for kroger as a loss prevention specialist. They are very hands on with training and will back you up no matter what. They really care about there employees
good,I good place to work if you need flex hours. Great for someone who only needs extra money. Have a long Christmas vacation. Good job for someone who is good at problem sollving..
good,Great benefits and company.  No work life balance as a store manager. Many opportunities to advance if you are willing to relocate and step out of our comfort zone. It's a family like company. Build great relationships with co workers.
good,Throughout my whole time being at Ralphs as an employee I’d say my experience was fair. My team members were amazingly nice as well as supportive with one another but the management team was really poor.
good,Kroger was a well off job. It is especially great for college students as well as seniors. The tasks were not hard at all nor were their employees overworked.
good,"enjoyed working at Kroger, learned the importance of providing each an every customer exceptional customer service, greet each client, learned very much from the floral manager, enjoyed working at the floral department."
good,"good balance of technicians to pharmacist"
good,"I worked as a cashier, scanning customers grocery items and help bag the items. I would assist customers finding items throughout the store. I would come in often on my days off when needed."
good,"Kroger was one of the best pharmacies I ever worked for. The district manager was awesome and when hours were cut at the store I was at, he found something for me to do while I waited for another location to be available. There was a technician trainer who helped with the certification process and with additional training as needed. When there weren't enough hours at the store I was at, I could travel all over to get hours if I wanted, with compensation for travel. There were also times when I was sent far enough away that a hotel room was provided. I felt that this company really cared about their employees."
good,Working for City Market you get everything you need and it does not require special skills. This is a very good job for young people that want to find their first job because they treat you well and also for retired or old people. If you like the job there is higher positions that they inform you about so the system is made very well.
good,"A typical day at work revolved around hard work that required putting items on shelves for my department and assisting customers. I learned that working with co-workers at Kroger was a vital learning experience when at the workplace. Management was decent, even during rough days. The culture at work is simple and swift. You go to work to finish the job and at the end of the workday, you go home. The hardest part for me is always speaking with customers. The best part of the job was being able to work with great people and meet a variety of customers, some of which I knew."
good,"I loved how busy the store stayed. "
good,"Workplace is what one makes it -- That is, collaboration with store management and with corporate office can be achieved through open communication, willingness to incorporate new initiatives and calm reason. "
good,"It was hard having such an irregular work schedule to balance outside work activities/life. Getting to know the customers was great, made for fun days."
good,In an eight hour shift any multitude of tasks are asked to be completed. I had learned how to write schedules and order needed supplies. A wide variety of managers worked daily. the hardest part of the job was switching to different department whilst other tasks needed to be completed. The most enjoyable part of the job is the slow days when larger projects can be completed without interruption.
good,"It's better than your average grocery store job."
good,"co-workers were very nice and helpful, customers were friendly, store had a good vibe, many customers had their own bag for me to store their groceries in"
good,Staff was very friendly at the store but the higher ups don't seem to have much compassion for people.  Enjoyed the company of my fellow employees.  Not bad.
good,"good workplace culture, supportive and positive work culture,  growth options, events, food events"
good,"I loved my time at Kroger, it was easy to make friends with my coworkers and I came to appreciate some of the customers who shopped there frequently. I didn't care for the rude customers who tried to get in your face if they think they're right, but most of the customers are pleasant and kind."
good,This job i had the opportunity to learn leadership and Management skills. I also had the opportunity to work in different areas performing a variety of roles.
good,The coworkers I have give the customers an atmosphere to be comfortable. Very friendly workplace. Managers are interpersonal and help out with the bottom line.
good,Typical day of work involved a lot of counting of product. Day usually went by slow due to it not being a fast paced environment. Training for job was very good.
good,"What enticed me to Kroger first off was their benefits, they are definitely a nice perk to the job and one of the biggest reason I've stayed as long as I have. However, benefits only take you so far. Those I've worked with as far as employees, and direct supervisors have been very great to work with and have treated me with respect. However, beyond those things begin to become muddy. The store directors can mean well enough but generally don't take what they say with anything but a grain of salt. I was promised a raise numerous times however that never happened and it took almost 3 weeks to even find out the reason why. Supplies in our store almost were always out. We're talking necessities such as paper towels, soap for hand washing and dishes, floor cleaner, toilet paper, gloves for the food service workstations, etc we were out of for weeks at a time and management that ordered these items didn't seem to acknowledge this was a problem. Secondly, the order system for the stores is not working how it's supposed to be. Products are out of stock for weeks at a time but slow moving products come in consistently with no need for them and management can't seem to find out why this is and won't hear back for weeks at a time as to why things are happening like this. The final straw for me is for the last few pay periods, corporate payroll has been making mistakes with my hours. For one week, i'll be over paid and the next pay period they will correct it by decreasing my hours. This has gone on for 3 weeks now and nobody can give me an answer as to why this is happening."
good,Started working here when I needed a job to help pay bills. Environment is nice and there's always room of moving up. Co-workers were nice and always try to help with any problems that you may have. It's a good place to start somewhere.
good,I love this place because it had a union and majority of the staff were nice. There was a floor runner who made me feel bad for everything I did. I kinda left because of her.
good,"There was always something to do, even on slower days. Management was always pretty responsive and helpful. It was usually busy so the shifts went by rather quickly. A few good benefits, including a discount on store brand products. Most coworkers are friendly and willing to help anyone. I learned alot about how to handle a myriad of customers and services. Overall I feel I am better off for having worked with the Kroger Company."
good,The environment was very welcoming and friendly. Hardest part would have to be dealing with rude customers but it taught me stay calm and fulfill their needs.
good,Its a typical cashier job and very simple that much I enjoyed. But I will always say that every cashier job needs to allow their workers to have chairs regardless of medical needs. We don't get to walk around all day we are confined to a very finite space throughout the entire day and thats hard on the feet. Other then that the workplace and other staff were great to work with!
good,Nice place to work minus some extremely ignorant coworkers. Management was always nice and understanding. Most coworkers were welcoming and open to speak with me.
good,"Good place to work, well managed. Always kept us busy, GREAT benefits.its pretty much a easy job just don't get behind nothing is hard about the days go by fast because it stays busy the other employees are good to work with its a friendly good evironment"
good,"I learned a lot at Kroger's, lots of laughs great management. Customers love coming back there to shop. Great prices etc.  The most enjoyable time in the break room. we get to grow as a person."
good,"I love and enjoy the people Iv gotten to meet and work with but the pay and amount of work I have to get done doesn't balance out. I make barely more then minimum wage 7.55 and I don't get a pay increase till 2 years and that pay increase is 10 cents. But it doesn't effect them. They can find another 16-18 year old to do the job if I leave. I work hard but at the end of the week 180$ isn't going to support a family. Even a 1$ raise would be alright but like I said it doesn't effect them. Their turn over rate is ridiculous. It's a good place to start out and I would recommend it to everyone. You get experience and opportunities to advance if you work well with people and everyone, for the most part are very helpful and friendly."
good,Great pay with even better people. Been there 2 and a half years have gotten help from good people even when I was going through personal issues and wanting to give up they was there with nothing but love and assist.  Don't get that from a lot of jobs..
good,"a great place to work, you show up and pump gas, you get to meet a lot of great customers that are traveling all over and you get to work with some awesome people as well"
good,"A typical day at work is spent well, routine tasks and steps are followed. A great experience with the management, highly flexible with timings. I learned great communication skills, and effective way to deal with customers and how to serve them better. the workplace culture is thriving and well-structured. the hardest part of the job would be carrying heavy loads of cartons and boxes. the most enjoyable part of the job would be engaging and meeting new people."
good,Good environment. Employees were friendly. Managers were fair and nice to be around. The hours were good and flexible. Vacation pay in only a year. Easy to switch departments and move up.
good,"Always was a wonderful place to work , my time there was very stable and energetic , the location was nice and the other staff were always very helpful"
good,"Everyday is pretty much the same day, get behind the cash register and serve our customers, what got me through each day were my co workers. I would say that was the best part of Pick N Save, the people I worked with. The culture was fun, but hard working which was the perfect environment for me. I learned a lot about responsibility, organization, and how to communicate effectively. Overall I had a good experience at Pick N Save."
good,The best part of this job is the people. The most difficult is the feeling of never having enough time to get everything done and always being pushed to get more done
good,"The work place was well kept and managed. My co workers worked well. Management gave clear and concise directions as to what they wanted. The hours I was given were troublesome at times, however."
good,Flexible work day as long as you put in the time to complete your daily tasks. Opportunities to learn new skills if you put effort into learning them and show enthusiasm.
good,"A typical day at work for me is get up, go to work and do the best of my ability, making sure everything is running smoothly and efficiently. I have learned that a customer always comes first. Management does an excellent job at running the store."
good,"You move carts, you bag groceries, you clean...  This job is great for someone who is looking for something to bring in some extra pocket cash like I was, especially for those of us in high school, though depending on managers and store locations you may have to work until midnight.  Besides being interchangeable for any odd jobs that might arise, working at a King Soopers store really isn't that bad, save perhaps for occasionally being made a janitor for a day or two."
good,"The job involved a fast pace and physical exertion, stocking shelves, moving large boxes and crates. However, Everyone was really nice and really wiling to help me learn new things. I had to leave because I needed steady hours, reliable from week to week, otherwise I wouldn't have. It felt like I belonged and each manager stressed how much Fred Meyers (Krogers) wanted each employee to be happy and to stay. For example, I was often told I was doing a great job, and often told if I wanted to work in another department, all I had to do was ask."
good,i have been with this company going on 6 years now and i must say that i have learned about this company and working in the meat department. There is so much i didn't know about meat but now that I've been here for over the past 6 years i can tell a customer what is the best choice of meat. It has been a funny experience working for this company and i love working in the cold. If you love retail and enjoy dealing with customer i suggest this job to whomever is looking for a great workplace
good,"Kroger was an exceptional place to work at as a teenager because it taught me how to communicate effectively with people, whether that was the management or customers. It also taught me how to do various tasks, like work a register, handle money, bag groceries, or stock shelves."
good,Ranging from cart pusher to customer service you will a lot of things to do. There is a possibility of advancement however with the upper management it can be hard to keep a cool head in situations.
good,Work was repetitive and required a lot of physical activity. Management was good and responsive to any questions or concerns I had. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work with people that I could get to know and work with.
good,I work in the pharmacy so it is a totally different experience than working as a cashier or in the main grocery store. Overall I enjoy the people that I work with. The ins that they offer the employees outside of the pharmacy is great and cheap.
good,On a daily basis I would be responsible for ensuring the operational aspects of the home department.  I would have to check freight loads and ensure product is being worked to the floor.  I would work with the other departments within the store to ensure stocking and cross promotion.
good,"The Kroger company differs from each store, but one thing is true about it. The people are always ready to work together to provide the best service for their customers."
good,"- A typical day at work would begin with the Bidding process, being a union based warehouse our employees are given a job at which they desire upon their position within their seniority,  top seniority associates are given first pick at premium jobs to include lift truck operators, salvage house (cleaning trailers) and receiving (scanning and receiving hand-bills and inbound product).  My team, the PM perishable loaders will bid a section of doors on the loading dock, they will remain accountable for the quality and quantity of the product shipped and loaded in that particular section through the duration of the night. After my associates bid their sections they are to report to their respective work areas no later that 5:45 pm."
good,i liked the job i had to leave being that i was going off to school. there was great benefits associated with the job. the hardest part about the job was having to bag and scan customers being that the store is super busy you have to double your work at a fast pace
good,Management at times could be overbearing which limited the amount of work that could be done but when brought to the attention of the superiors it was understood and handled well. I learned that no matter what you can't please everybody but it's worth while to try. The culture was diverse and a pleasure to work in. The hardest part for me was learning the people skills and reading ow people were doing. It's important not to overstep and ask to help someone if they clearly don't want help. That was hard for me because I love helping people. the most enjoyable part of my job there was getting to know everybody that came in and form friendships with the regular customers.
good,This is a great job for someone who doesn't have bills or kids. Now if your in management then your pay should be a lot better. So depending on your needs and wants it might can work out for you.
good,"I worked there for many years in various positions, and most of my co-workers/managers were great to be around. They were flexible with my schedule if I needed a change, and I eventually got decent pay for working in a grocery store in a non-management position."
good,"When I worked here as a bagger this was my first job I held. As a bagger you would basically bag customer items. There is more being cleaning (like bathrooms), helping customers, and go backs (putting items back on shelves). For me I usually bagged, 30 to hour would be bathroom cleaning, and another hour would be carts. Sometimes you would even help customer get their items to there cars or get items for them. "
good,Store #527 the store is very busy but we also had fun will working. They pay was okay I loved how we had a raise every six months. I have learned how to deal with imset customers.
good,Kroger was a wonderful place to work. It taught me very essential working tools and improved my customer service skills. I worked a Kroger for 8 years. In those years I went from a stocker to cashier to a supervisor. It was a great place to climb the ladder.
good,Fun and easy work that allows to get to know your customers. Most really appreciate what you o for them and that means a lot. daily tasks that can be managed in a timely manner.
good,"While my time at Kroger was fairly limited due to personal reasons, I enjoyed my time there.  I worked reasonable hours, was payed fairly for my work, and was respected by my fellow employees."
good,it was fun andbut could get stressfull with everything that needed done. i learned how to perform tasks to a completion in a workplace. management was great. was lifting so may different waters all over the place. the costumers and pier interaction are fun and full of many different interactions.
good,"Kroger is a great grocery store to shop at and is pretty decent to work at, whether it be a part time job or a full time career. Most employees are nice."
good,"My time at Krogers was satisfying and fun, largely due to the great culture the company promotes among its managers and employees. My various managers were all incredible supportive and friendly, and the other employees were more than willing to show me the ropes. Prepare for a lot of training, though!"
good,"I liked this job I did almost everything accept cashier, so bagging, getting carts, and stocking. Wear comfortable shoes, other employees were very friendly."
good,"The people you work with can make or break a team. Management was friendly and coworkers were fun to talk to during slow times. If you do your job and are self motivated, you will have nothing to complain about."
good,Working at Mariano's was a great experience for me.  I was able to get a great experience with people who were ready to help at any time and good coworkers.  I learned a lot about customer service and how to be a diligent worker in the grocery business.
good,My experience working at Kroger was that it was very flexible with my hours considering I was still in high school. I was able to change if I ever needed to with little problems. The job was easy but it did get boring at times with repetition.
good,I worked at the meat and sea food area. And I must say it wasn't hard at all. It took a little getting use to being around freshly cut meat with blood still all over it but overall a great work experience.
good,"Hard work, start the day on the go and end the day on the go.  "
good,"I love being a manager at Pick n Save. Everyone there was so friendly everyone got alone. Responsibilities"
good,"The co-workers there are like family, but the pay isn't the best. The co-workers are what get you through the day, and will be there for you on your worst days, and are really supportive."
good,Room to advance under the right circumstances. My personal supervisor is outstanding. I was lucky enough to have a store manager that saw that I worked harder than minimum wage and helped advance me.
good,"Needs to be a very organized individual, a good coach/teacher able to multi task and be flexible as every day can be different bases on situations out of your control. Very fast paced."
good,Fun place to work. the coworkers were nice and it had plenty of opportunities. There was some drama every once and a while but it was usually sorted out pretty quickly.
good,"The job consist of cashiering duties, cleaning taking care of the customers, Counting down cash drawer at the end of every shift. "
good,"I love this company people , managers and staff. We are a big family . If I weren't relocating I would of retired from them . I am going to miss them as much as they are gonna miss me."
good,"Kroger is a great place to work...f you don't have bills. The people are amazing...the pay is out right horrible. I work in the pharmacy so I don't see much of the store, however, i always see other departments willing to lend a hand."
good,Enjoyed this work setting and was able to experience this opportunity. I'm on the second shift and the hours are kinda late but we do all of work and we work as a team even sometimes we get off at midnight or later when we are short handed.
good,"Great variety, great prices. Really good and talented people at the helm and store level. compensation could be more competitive. A good place to work."
good,"As a Courtesy Associate, I would greet customers as they entered the building. I would bag grocers fast and accurately, making sure not to sill or break any merchandise. If there was a customer that needed assistance taking their grocers out to their car, I would help them. I would also retrieve carts from the corrals in the parking lot. If there was a spill in one of the isles, I would help to clean it as well as checking the bathrooms. While working there, I learned the proper way to bag grocers so that nothing gets squashed or damaged. The management was nice, and were always helping customers when needed. For instance, one day there weren't enough registers opened, so the managers had some of us hand out freebies to the customers. The hardest part of the job was having to clean up the spills and the bathroom accidents that would occasionally happen. The most enjoyable part was meeting all the new people and getting a discount on all Kroger Brand items."
good,"Would go into different Kroger's and do the resets of products.  Would clean and move shelves, along with merchandise  Hardest part of the job was finding stuff in some of the stores.."
good,"On a normal day I would come in around 2-3 and I would have someone with me for about 1/2 hour-1 hour, 9/10 times I was left alone to close. I was in charge of keeping product area and sugars stocked and well kept. My favorite part of the job would have to be the relationships i got to build with the customers, getting to meet so many different people from around the world was the icing on top to the job."
good,I enjoy working with a great team! The pharmacy is where I'm currently working although I when I started I was a courtesy clerk and have worked my way up slowly
good,This company offers a supportive work environment as well as growth. This company offers a pretty good management training program.
good,"If you like a busy day and meeting new people, this is the job for you. Nice folks and great bonding with your fellow employees. Never a dull moment here."
good,Its a fast paced environment requires plenty of attention to details. Customer service can be improved. Management strives to resolve issues in a effecient time frame. Employees are friendly.the hardest part of work is when a lot of work load falls on one person and sometimes working long hours. Serving customers is the enjoyable part of the job.
good,"Only complaint is that the employees should be paid better."
good,it was a very fun enviroment to work in the team work morale was at a high but i just need a permanent position. i like working with the customers an being the one who could aid their issue. the company is a great comapny to work for i would refer anyone to them
good,"No opportunity for advancement, pay is low as compared to what you would get somewhere else, customer is always right even if they're wrong"
good,"I love the people I work with, but I feel that Kroger is very unorganized at times causing chaos. The customers are the best part of my day. We are taught to always put their needs first."
good,"A typical day at my work is generally fast paced, especially if we are experience an upcoming holiday. I've learned a lot of amazing customer service skills, as well as interpersonal skills when working with a whole store of other associates."
good,Working in the meat market was a great learning experience. Stocking and cutting were the main points of the job. Everyone who worked in the meat market was friendly and helpful.
good,Overall quality work environment; mostly laid back and easy going. They do have expectations but you know them and they are not pressed in your face. managers were nice and the relationship was mutually respectful.
good,"The culture, people and even the customers are very decent and usually there will be no problems with any of them. As a student, they were very flexible and I recommend this job to people who live by a Kroger."
good,"Overall:"
good,Interested in an entry-level purchasing position that could lead up to a responsible management position in the retail industry. I think the hardest part of a job is when the job is not completed.
good,"A typical day at work would be generally slicing meat and cheese for customers or Icing cakes/ cupcakes and baking goods. I switch between Deli and bakery different days during the week because we were a little short on employees . I've learned so much from this job . How to be friendly fast and clean. Whether the situation is good or bad with a customer i still remained calm and kept a beautiful smile on my face. My co workers were very helpful ,actually we all helped each other .Our store was very busy throughout the day so everyone was very kind and fast paced during rush hours. My department manager was Pretty good . My store Manager was the same , pretty decent and knew exactly how she wanted the store to look. My overall experience at Kroger was exciting , fun and a new experienced . I really enjoyed."
good,"I enjoyed working with the public and being a cashier.  I learned how to be a cashier, bag groceries and deal with the money aspects.  The management was ok for the most part  They put me in a position but failed to properly train me."
good,I started working at Kroger in may of 2016 and overall it was a good job with decent pay but after a while it was getting hard to get my schedule to correspond with my availability almost every time I would talk to my supervisor about my schedule and he would approve it the store manager would override it and schedule me on days I can't work.
good,"This was a seasonal position maintaining the Organic Produce section."
good,Team work is a must to get the work done. I learn better leadership skills. Professional managers. Diverse cultures. Friendly employees. Hardest part of the job is the salary.
good,My favorite thing about working here was that there was always something that needed to be done. It gave you plenty to learn and was a very productive place to work. I was able to learn many departments during my employment here. I enjoyed working in accounting very much.
good,"customers great"
good,Group of people working together to get the job done.  The Kroger Technology team is working to be a first rate development team.
good,"My time at Kroger was a pleasant one, being the lowest and newest employee I did get stuck with a lot of the nastier jobs such as bathroom clean up puke or food spills but all in all i like working there it was a fun and energetic place for me to go to and expel all this exsess energy. Every day i would bring back the carts, bag groceries and help various customers with finding items, heavy liftng, taking items out to there vehicle if asked. Keeping the store clean was also part of my job i didnt mind that it was pretty much the only time i had to myself."
good,when I first started with Kroger I loved it very much. After 15 years of loyal service I had a work injury and came to realize I was merely a number to them
good,"I bagged groceries, and brought carts inside. I had the chance to meet new people, and interact with them. Management was very well built and breaks were scheduled well. employees seemed happy about their jobs there as well."
good,"Great job as a high schooler or college student, my management was flexible with my schedule. Paid weekly. Okay hours. Anywhere from 12-25 hours. Great coworkers."
good,"I enjoyed working at Kroger. I enjoyed decorating cakes, making deli trays and dealing with customers.  It was a very fast paced job that made time go by fast."
good,Loved working with customers and getting their deli products together. Also cooked chicken and made deli trays. Always made sure everything was correct before given to the customer.
good,I enjoyed working for the company.  They had great benefits just not enough pay.  The manager had changed three times in my short time there which made it hard to train because each manager wanted things different.
good,Krogers does a good job with keeping the lines moving. People such as myself love that everything is easy to find and its easy to get around and get help.
good,"Over the past summer I worked at Kroger in Canal Winchester, OH. The people who worked there were very friendly, and it allowed me to meet different people due to all of the customers that came in. This in turn allowed my communication skills to be even further enhanced, as these conversations were 1 on 1."
good,Been working here for 2 years. A great company with excellent benefits if you want to work their your whole life. Pay is not great and not much room for a raise since it is union.
good,"At Kroger, I started out as a cashier then I moved to clicklist when the new Kroger Marketplace opened. The work was fast pace at times, but I liked that. The management worked with me when I wanted to move departments. My co-workers were friendly. The hardest part of the job was the hours. The shift and times that you worked always changed from week to week. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting all the new people."
good,"The management is great and the coworkers are awesome. The work is pretty straightforward and no one expects you to be perfect. Scheduling hours is pretty flexible and the managers are willing to give you odd hours to fit your schedule. However, the $9.35 you start at for produce only yields $7.52 an hour after taxes and union dues. If you want a raise you have to sign up online for more training, but the online system is constantly kicking employees out and the process to fix it is complicated and spotty at best."
good,typical day at work is usually for 6 hours with a 15 minute break. my 15 minute break feels like 7 minutes. i learned that you got to always over achieve your goal and put on a good attitude for the customers. the hardest part of working at kroger was keeping the customers satisfied. customers always have their own opinions about what they like and every last customer we have cannot be pleased.
good,I love working with money ringing up customers telling then there total and talking to them while i get there groceries together bagging them how they like Meeting New people
good,"Laid back, fun place to work at.  You can work independently and get your work done.  Fast-paced for stocking but got a good work out. Nobody bothers you if you are working but a lot of repetition."
good,I have great respect for the management of KwikShop. They really stand by you and give you an opportunity to grow within the company.  I really succeeded with them but needed a life change and moved to Houston.
good,I like working there it just to cold in the winter  and the pay is not enough  to live off of the staff is great people  to be around  it get slow at the end of the month that when they city your hours down and I don't like that but it something  to great for a single  person  not a mother like myself .
good,It was a great experience I had working there for 9 months I had a lot of fun meeting new people everyday and see my co-workers. My co-workers were basically like family and I would be in the kitchen making an preping whatever we had that day I would make. Sometimes I would be in the pizza and barbecue area learning new things. All of these new things I've learned at Marianos will be something i will never forget.
good,"Great place to work. Just need better hours for high school students. "
good,I worked in the deli and i did not like it at all only because i was the only non smoker and they would leave me by myself to smoke together instead of smoking one by one i mean i don't mind working but setting up the deli is alot for 5 people let alone one
good,"I LOVED my time working at Kroger Pharmacy! There were times it was VERY stressful, but overall I loved working there! They do not pay their pharmacy techs enough!!!!!!! I have a less stressful pharmacy job now, and get paid much more!! I still visit my Kroger family and love them very much! I considered going back to work there, but the pay is so poor. After 4 years of working there, I was only making $11. I make $3.25 more at my current, closer, and less stressful job!"
good,The management and co-workers are enjoyable to work with.  They also are very understandable to talk to.  I would refer anyone to apply to this company.
good,This particular Kroger's is a great facility to be a part of the crew and the team. Definitely customer friendly as well. This is a family for anyone who walks in the door
good,"Hours were complicated but it was a new experience and I enjoyed the time I spent there. My coworkers were nice to me and so was management most of the time. There policy's can be quite strict at times but they make the store a great place. They also offer a wide variety of benefits, especially for long term employees. Great discounts, and even though I quit, I still shop there!"
good,"Great people to work with, never had any issues with the people I worked with side-by-side. It was nice because I always had something to do and was never just standing around. The only two problems I had was with management scheduling, when I was still in schools and could only work afternoons and evenings during the week, they would still schedule for day shifts. Also it was hard to get a lot of working time as the department had to cut hours. I would recommend Kroger to anyone who is looking for a friendly/busy environment."
good,"I loved interacting with customers, I learned a lot about the store I was working in and about the people I worked with. I had a lot of friends, to the point that they were like family to me in some regards. The hardest part was feeling as though I was the one who followed all of the rules to the best of my ability whilst others occasionally ignored them but never saw punishment for it. The most enjoyable aspect however was certainly my interactions with the customers and other employees."
good,Kroger was an overall good company to work for. I was with company for 18 years. Customer service was most enjoyable. Typical work day was fast pace with multi tasking being part of the day. Co-workers were enjoyable and team work (though difficult with some younger employees at times) was key in all aspects of job duties. Managament was for the most part fair and considerate. Pay rate was consistent with other pharmacies and benefits were excellent.  I would recommend this company to job seekers interested in this field
good,A typical day at work was a fast paced environment helping every department necessary. I learned a lot about distributing and vendors. Hardest part of the job was having several managers and their orders not the same. Most enjoyable part of the  job was the customers.
good,Would be a good job somebody in school. They are very good about their scheduling. Employees are helpful. Everybody's friendly. They operate on a good set of work ethics.
good,"Great job,  terrible pay.  I knew someone who worked for Kroger 13 years and only makes $13 an hour. "
good,Have a good time working there interacting with customers. Look forward in coming to work. My co workers are very easy to work with. Easy routine work.
good,it was my first job. had a lot of fun. did not like the way that they treated their employees. The customers were a great perk of the job.  moved up quickly
good,"I thought working at Kroger was a good experience, management was helpful and they allowed me to become a manager in less than 5 years.  Working with the people was great too!"
good,This job is a good entry level job for anyone who is looking to work in retail. Your hours are flexible and the do offer a good range of benefits. My coworkers are great and is an overall exceptional work environment. This job has taught me a few things over the years including; how to deal with customers and work in a team environment.
good,It's ok the manger is not very good with there employees n everyone is on there phone and rued to the customer. I didn't like it because I felt I could work in a better place.
good,Roundy's is a good company to work for. They are very giving to their employees and compensation and benefits are great. I have nothing negative to say about any member of management.
good,"As cut fruit lead, I maintained a full shelf of hand cut fruit, kept up with sales, engaged with customers, ordered supplies in timely manner, and made special request orders. I learned the quickest way to cut up fruit. Hardest part was keeping up with the demand of sales and withstanding the cold of the freezer. Most enjoyable part was making beautiful fruit bowls."
good,"There is not usually anything exciting that happens. I come to work, stock the shelves, do back stock if I have the time or if there was not a truck. Then I condition the aisles I worked (making them look all nice and pretty for the customers). Management is ok, they are very reasonable with the scheduling and do listen to your requests. All in all, it is a very relaxed place to work."
good,I currently work herexperience as a fuel clerk where I attend to all customers needs and wants whether ithe ha's to buying gas or any other questions they may have for me
good,Good company with a highly focused agenda based on the customers' needs.  Lower management is working with the employees in each department.  Upper management in the store engages employees often.  A lot of camaraderie within each department.
good,"Coming in to work is relatively uneventful, though just seeing how many customers are in the checkout lines gives me a good feel of how busy the day will be. I wouldn't exactly say that the information I learned on the job will help me anywhere other than a Fourth of July barbecue, but the real skills I picked up were dealing with customers, such as listening when the had complaints, doing my utmost to help them find what whatever they were looking for, and on rare occasions, hearing from my manager that someone appreciated my help enough to mention it to them. My co-workers all have a good sense of humor, which helps pass the time when customer attendance is rather slow, which is the hardest part of the job. Once you've done and cleaned everything, when there's nothing to do, there's nothing to do. It doesn't happen very often though. The co-workers help each other get through slow times, and the co-workers are the best part of the job."
good,"It was fun learning different things and then training others how to do them. It was also fun helping customers in the store locate items."
good,"It was tough when I had to work outside as a cart attendant in very hot days considering breaks were strictly limited. Although harsh at times, I had a great time working and of course I enjoyed my job."
good,Working at Kroger was very interesting place to work as the environment and clientele provided a friendly workplace. The managers were firm but always easy to approach when you had a problem. The work staff are willing to help each other when needed.  I have to admit the that pushing cart and bagging groceries is much harder that I realized. Not only that I really had to learn the store that I worked at to better help shopper. But all of this was worth just to hear how much people the shopping at Kroger Store.
good,Working at Kroger was a very laid back job where you around alot of different people and doing lots of different jobs. The co-workers were very friendly and helpful
good,"some are amazing other could be better, the main reason why I stay is because of the customers. with them I wouldn't change a thing"
good,I enjoyed interacting with the customers and my co workers. I worked at two Kroger locations and I had a pleasant experience at both.
good,"The was fairly respectful and friendly, the work day was pleasant for the most part, and co-workers were very kind and helpful. Customers were not difficult in 98% of cases, and the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting kind people in a friendly environment, both employees and customers."
good,On a typical day at Marianos I start at 130pm-11pm. I learned how to prep salads and also fruit salads/ salad bars. Management was ok not really on the scene to much. My co-workers were awesome great people to keep in touch with. The hardest part of the job was working in the freezer area. The most enjoyable par of the job was hearing customers tell me how much they love my work.
good,This job is what you make it. Could be extremely busy at times but for the most part it is very great for a part time job. Only reason why i left is because i went to college
good,"You can actually make more wages in a non-union shop, but Kroger is still a good place. The store I worked in had some very good managers, and understood the business; not something I expected from a union shop. The staff and management does have support for their employees."
good,"This company has to be one of my favorite places to work. The customers are all polite, everyone is wonderful and the enviorment is fantastic."
good,"Fast paced, and friendly smiles. The downfall was pick and choosing of favoritism. Workers got chewed while the favoritism by acquaintance got praised."
good,Great working with customers and meeting new faces daily. The hours worked well with my family. Great co workers but management was a little bitter.
good,Its nothing like it was when i first started. Now employees dont get half the credit they deserve. Training has gotten worse.
good,Kroger was fun place to work getting to know your costumers and knowing them by name and the things they bye. Its nice having a rounded placed to work that everyone has a part and works together to reach the same goal.
good,"Has a company, Kroger's is a good place to work with very helpful benefits. Each store rotates it's store manager's about every 18 months, which helps bring in new ideas and perspectives as far as improving store, customer, and employee needs. Starting pay is not the greatest, but raises come on a regular basis; when and how much all depends on the union contract. In my opinon, a good company to try and build a career"
good,"Working here was a very good experience, the workplace atmosphere was nice and welcoming. The other workers were nice, and it was a good place to work filled with good people."
good,Fun place to work. Easy to establish a relationship with the customers you serve. pay checks sucked. worked hard all week for little reward. even top seniority people did not make enough money.
good,"everyone was nice"
good,I love the environment that I worked in. The customers were great. The manager at the time was horrible but fortunately enough for me I survived. A good job for high school students.
good,Kroger has been a great place to work for and has worked with me and my school schedule. Kroger gives you great customer service experience and has many advancements if you wish to continue to work for Kroger.
good,"I load the smoker with ribs, brisket, and pulled pork everyday at 8pm."
good,"It was a nice place to work and the people were friendly. I worked on Saturdays, Sundays, and Fridays because those were the busiest days. All I did was bag and retrieve carts. Overall, I think its a decent place to work at, temporarily."
good,"Company, benefits, and work life balance was great. Management was supportive but there was little advancement opportunities."
good,"There was always something to be doing as a cashier. The managers were hard to work with. There was no collaboration or communication between them so employees were told to do different things by 2-3 different managers. Co-workers were all easy to work with; however, the turnover rate was very high. The hardest part of the job was getting the store to work around class/extra curricular activity schedules."
good,Retail is not for everyone but you work with a ton of great people. I am in management and it is very rewarding. The hours are demanding and you have to work lots of weekends and all holidays.
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my time working in Kroger Pharmacy! I had a wonderful boss and co-workers.  I would love to work for them again!
good,Worked for the company for over 9 years in both part time and full time positions. Sometimes it is long hours but it isnt always like that. The management is nice and willing to work with you with any problems that may arrise.
good,"A typical day at work would be very interesting. Work there was taken very seriously and we still had fun because we knew how to get serious when customers were in need of assistance and when to play around which was in  the break room. I learned the life of a cashier, how serious it is; you can get the entire store in lots of trouble if you accidently sell a minor alcohol. There a lot that tied into the cashier position. I learned how to greet customers, inform them of sells occurring, and help clarify situations when misunderstood. I would say the co-workers there were excellent, they would not hesitate to help you out when in need. When I first started, I would frequently ask questions if I had a new task to make sure I'm doing the job properly and they would happily explain what to do. They offered rides to other co-workers that didn't have their own transportation. Hardest part of that job was getting customers to donate money to organizations during the holidays or buying a hunger bag for a family that can't afford it. The most enjoyable part of my job was speaking with customers while checking out, met so many interesting people."
good,I went to work and always had fun people to be around and friendly respectful management. I would recommend this place to people
good,"This was my very first job. I started off as a Courtesy Clerk, where I gathered buggies, bagged groceries, and also dealt with store sanitation. After being there for a month, I quickly moved up to being a cashier, which I did that for three months. then I got borrowed to do dairy department tasks, grocery, frozen, and even some produce. But then I moved to market which I did for a little over a year before I quit and left for Teleperformance. Had I had stayed, I would have been promoted to meat cutter which would have earned me quite a large pay raise. The best thing about this job was that I did it very well and moved up very fast, which was great for it being my very first job. Management was my only disagreement with the store. They did everything in their power to keep me from being full time, even though everyone in the store saw me as such a huge asset to the company. Hence the reason for my departure, after being loyal to them for well over two years."
good,"Amazing workplace, where there is much room to move up. The job has great benefits for employees. The average weekly schedule was a minimum of 15 hours, with a maximum of 38 for part time workers. The store often provides free lunch for its employees in the break room. Employees get payed weekly and can possibly earn bonuses in multiple ways."
good,Kroger Co. is a good company for High School and College students. It has always been easy to manage my work schedule around my class schedule.
good,Management and supervisors were always reliable. Co-workers willing to lend a helping hand whenever possible. Flexible schedule to accommodate school and extra curricular activities. Hands on work environment.
good,"I loved the Managers and People I worked with , Sometimes the customers might become rued but most of the time it was Great working there."
good,Hardest part of the job is trying to reach quota before the time deadline but for the most part you're working alone so you have time to think and get a peace of mind. Co-workers converse with you and keep things appropriate.
good,"It was always to much, I'd do my job.. and my job would become a wreck because someone else's job was laid on me.. I had to do twice as much work in one day. It was hard for me. They demanded and criticized me a lot, even though there were lazy people they didn't demand or criticize. It was an unfair opportunity."
