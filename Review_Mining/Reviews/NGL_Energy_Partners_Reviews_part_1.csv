rating,review
bad,low pay  management is real unorganized. they care about there buddys this company hires illegal immigrants to drive 18 wheelers and even lower management are illegal immigrants and take care of one another
bad,"Would never recommend putting yourself in a bad situation such as NGL"
bad,Management on drugs. No regard for employees.  High turnover.  No training.  Environmental issues and violations.  Blames problems on staff.  No leadership.
bad,Got fired cause did not use hand scanner to clock in. And out think that is not fair due to hand scanner not working just looking for a reason to let people go sorry company to work for
bad,need alot of management changes with in the company and the right people to be in the right places and then it would rise but at this time it will just stay below margin
bad,Repetitive work. Management has no consideration for their employees and they are constantly replacing people with the high turnover rate. A typical day consists of fixing mistakes made by other people and handling overdue invoices that never got paid. They don't offer raises even if you've been an employee for years.
bad,"Horrible work environment, discrimination, slandering, toxic work environment. Unfair treatment. Just horrible I wouldn’t recommend working here to anyone."
bad,"Busy, stressful due to the environment created by upper manager"
bad,"Don't do it this company says stuff and will do the opposite cut throat micro management you have to constantly watch over your shoulder even if you think you do your job as it says in the handbook and trained to do so shave policy no hair past the corners of your mouth automatic write up no raises no bonuses no recognition on the good you do only the bad slip seating , hauling water or frac sand pays the same if not more"
bad,The place is a joke in New Lenox please do not apply at this location you will regret it me and several supervisors left that place  no balance life the place is terrible and not safe
bad,Ngl energy partners is the most backwards company to work for. They dont care about employees safety at all. None of there safety stations work like eye wash and shower station there just there for show and not even connected to a water source. Work place is always to dirty and grass and weeds are always too tall making it perfect for a rattle snake bite which I have steped on at least 6 times already this year. The manegment doesnt do anything about it not even cut the grass.
bad,"No processes, procedures or any idea what they are doing. Zero culture. Management do not know anything. Constantly embarrassed for service failures.."
bad,"The management treats you just like a number not a person. The hours are horrible along withe the pay. They will work you 24 hrs a day if you let them, and if you don't they will fire you."
bad,"Very poor equipment, very poor management, all around poor company!"
bad,"worst place i ever worked, the pay is horrible, management is horrible, they never fully describe job duties and regional supervisior rarely follows through on getting info in a timely manner, dispatch is horrible, everyday there were mistakes due to lack of info from dispatch, very embarassing standing around while they try to figure out there mistakes, dont be a stat driver you will get burned, the pay barely covers the cost of gas, cant support a family on only $200 a month after paying for gas thats all thats left of your pay check"
bad,Management sucks. They don't care about their employees. There are no raises and the benefits suck. This is by far the worst company to work for. Controller expects a lot of work with little compensation.  No room for advancement.
bad,"If you want to be overworked and underpaid with bare minimum benefits, this is the company for you. They do not value their employees at all and they are happy to take your job with no notice if the business model changes. 12 years working with this company and I was laid off and forced to train my replacement as a term of my severance pay. It was blackmail to say the least. The corporate office is located in a different state and they are very out of touch with the compensation that is required to live in CO. Fortunately for them they are in Tulsa OK. I strongly recommend staying far away from this company."
bad,The job is easy. The coworker are great. The management is really bad. Getting uniforms and crucial equipment is difficult to get the company is going not willing to put the money for it. This includes gloves that are a must to handle the toxic water.
bad,Only short term positions and no training  close environment so everyone is sick at the same time. Inpatient managers that yell when you make a mistake.
bad,Company culture is brutal. You have to be in the good ole boys club to have a good career. They don’t hold management accountable at all. Very ruthless culture and no accountability on upper management. Stay away unless you have no other opportunities.
bad,They Vice Presidents don’t know how to run the company when you had a concern they just told you everything you where doing wrong upper management tim was the worst person I ever worked with worthless and dumbest person I ever met
bad,if you are looking to do good and not get involved in daily gossip about people than do not apply to this company. I would strongly urge people to stay away from this company. human resources doesn't care about the employees and management is no different. they make up lies to fire good people while the bad workers are still there. this is the worst company to work for.
bad,Just horrible company to work for supervisor dont care they'll throw u under the bus real quick. They dont provide per diem. No room to advance with this company.
bad,"Poor Management !"
bad,"I was a temp. driver for this company for 5 months. Management is dis organized, terrible equipment, lot of discrepancies on the trailers. they change their mind to many times, the transportation mgr. is trying to run it like a trucking company, bit it can not run like that  for it is a logistics warehouse. Terrible place to drive for and the pay is low."
bad,"Good place to start out as a semi experienced driver. Pay is on the bottom end, though. Management and dispatch are top notch. Benefits are decent, low end coverage though."
bad,"Unfortunately, I am in the process of filing a complaint against this employer for illegally using my credit history as a deciding factor in my ability to fulfill the requirements of the job."
bad,Gave us a bonus and then took it away the next day. Then on August 5th they came into the office and told us they were closing the okc office.
bad,"The company from a whole agenda is about recovery of oil. That being said, meaning they are the type to walk over a 1000 dollars to pick up a nickel. They don't care about their employees, because of their high turnover, facility managers last more than 5 months before they quit from lack of upper management support"
bad,"OK place to work Monday thru Friday. i learn to use heavy machinery. Management is not fair to certain groups of people. I love the co-workers, they were like family. Not hard work at all, very easy to do. The highlight of my day would be completing my duties."
bad,I started working here when the oil industry started to slow down. In turn the promotions and raises that we were promised when hired were eliminated as explained to us by the district manager.
bad,i worked in the denver office..the customer service dept. The people were rude. One of the girl who was young was bias about older people she was alway gossiping with this male dispatcher..people disappeared.she new who to fool the que computer..stayed off it. i do not believe mangement did not see this or did not want to. Alway the young reps would complain about everyone else. I think their should be a camera in there so the CEO will see what goes on
bad,This is a set up they only operate pallet jack riders no cherry pickers and pay was 11.50  but they can’t keep nobody so now they claiming 13 a hour. Until You see your first check. Orders are times based but depends on Who all comes to work. If you are the only person there. You might as well get a pellow and blanket. & supervisors will not help you. It’s not their job. But at the end of the day if you need money get that check
bad,"Would only recommend if desperate for a job. The management is awful, not enough training, very high expectations. "
bad,I really didnt like working at ngl they wasnt a fair paying job I believe they pay so little but wanted the workers to work hard for a 10.00 Job when people should've been getting 12 dollars and more
bad,company does not offer good support never know if your doing ok or not dispatch asks confused most of the time not a company that you want to devote anything other than what you have to management shaky
bad,"Hourly wage not enough for carrying Hazmat. Hours drop off in spring/summer. I quit due to lack of work. Couldn't get 40hrs/wk. Was told I'd be on call every third weekend. Turned out to be every third week, for an entire week."
bad,Bait and switch. Oil companies bring in people at great salaries and after a year or two they merge and bring down wages. No job security and pay is always switched around.
bad,Oilfields got slow but this is great job so many.people had to go get other jobs by for the most part this is a great job they provide a good workplace
good,This was another role I took on during the downturn in the oil & gas industry. And it didn't work out well. I didn't fit in and I really didn't like the cube farm seating.
good,Asked to work roughly 60 hours every week and plus more during end of month. No recognition from upper management for the hard work.
good,"I was a courier driver for close to eleven months. When I started they didn't give me the option of day or night shift, I was thrown on nights and stayed there for months. It wasn't terrible, just monotonous and at times very frustrating. The shift had no real end point, you worked until everything was delivered, which could be hard to get ahead at times due to dispatch adding new orders. The day shift was easier other than waking up super early. Management was in the other side of the state, so getting a real answer about anything was a hassle. I liked most of my co-workers, in the end managers are what ruined the job."
good,My direct report was great and supportive.  Good work environment but communication was poor. Latitude with technology which helped with efficiently completing tasks.
good,"During my time with NGL, I'd learned the culture was strongly impacted by a few employees and they were pretty ruthless with this power.  Also, they went through a very impacting management change that was very impacting on my position ~ not in a good way."
good,"A typical day at work"
good,"Company is closing, end of job assignment.  Relaxed atmosphere, dress is causual.  Lots of overtime working for oil and crude."
good,"NGL employs nice hardworking people, but too many long nights, not enough feedback on tasks, little communication on expectations, and not enough appreciation for hard work."
good,There is no advancement in the company and no recognition for your work. They say they will give you a raise and then never actually make it happen. They do not hire enough people so it is always short handed. The work is not difficult if they would just hire a full team to distribute the workload. The hours leave no time for other things to do so if all you want to do is work work work this the place to be.  Training is a breeze if you are willing to learn and actually commit to the hours.
good,NGL offers a fast paced constantly changing work environment. The company has several different integrated business segments and is a great place to learn about the different energy markets.
good,"Good money. Pitiful management. Back-stabbing internal politics. No clear chain of command, due to over-lapping layers of bosses. Constant atmosphere of ""who are we going to blame?"" if anything goes wrong."
good,"Fast paced, job duties depending on the circumstances sometimes over-whelming.  Good team-work among co-workers.  All training provided to ensure your ability to perform your job duties."
good,Work four on four off rotating twelve hours shifts. 6 am to 6 PM or vise versa. Really good starting pay and is room for advancement if you desire....
good,The departments do not interact well with each other. There is a definite lack of team effort. Business units are not held to the same standards throughout the company.
good,Great workers always working to fullest always get things done on time and always correct on what shop out have great scores on product never disappointment
good,I was given a dispatch and went to pick up loads and take them to the proper disposals. I had to do regular maintenance on trucks as needed. Attend safety meetings when required.
good,if you are very sensitive to racial slurr it may not be the best place for you. it a very rewarding place to work for if you happen to be one of the chosen few
good,"At one time, under the name High Sierra, this was one of the ""happiest"" oil and gas companies in Oklahoma. When NGL bought them out, things slowly changed."
good,We had a day driver and a night driver.  Most everyone did their 12 to 14 hour shift and got back and their were some who gouged their time which then makes it where you don't get at least your 12 hours in.    The oilfield has it's busy time and then it has it's slow time good
good,Working with the crew was the best.Working in budgets was a big plus. Having corporatr in Dever was the hardest part
good,"Unload trailers that carry water,oil, flowback, water toxics. You work 12hrs shifts 4days on 4days off. You have a partner and you work day shift for a week and night shift on the other.."
good,I felt like they play favorite and didn't like the fact that one employee know everyone pay information. This job was not for me. I wouldn't not go back  to work for a this company.
good,"Good company but some of the management was questionable, they have been bought out and restructured. I left around the buy out time they are now Deepwell services"
good,my experience at ngl was great it was hard work but a job is a job and I needed the job so I took it
good,"Everyone seem to get along and were very helpful to each other. There are several different cultures, so there was no discrimination Job assignments are basically established.  Hardest part of job when first starting, is the training curriculum need to be established."
good,The location and employees were great to work with. Management were not around but were at time able to be contacted by phone. But only on their time.
good,"overall you have to work overtime just to keep pace with your workload. Had a great time in the work environment, the people were great, but the pay was very underwhelming."
good,"work load is stable everyday. It will be more stressful during monthly close, quarterly close, and year close. The management is good. However the office is very quite most of the time."
good,"There a fairly new company only 10 years old. They had a lot of growing pains. They spred them self to thin. But there slowly getting it together. So try them out, see if they fit."
good,"Usually a two man crew, workload is dispersed between employees, its a good starting job if you are new to any type of heavy labor. Starting pay is good, but not to much room for advancement."
good,Typical day starts out reviewing e-mails on downed equipment & PMS needed done & schedule them accordingly.Notify Management when equipment is ready for use.
good,Enjoyable place to work.  Good working atmosphere in the office. Benefits were great. I was able to learn other duties in the office to expand my knowledge
good,"Days began at 7:00 am. Planning the day and reviewing the previous days performance and or issues. 4 hours of work followed by 1/2 hour of lunch. Work resumed and continued until 5:00 pm on a good day. "
good,"Good work environment on a daily basis overall. I learned basically all there is to know about how to run a Salt Water Disposal and my experience was wonderful, also working with all the employees was a plus due to them having your back when you needed a favor, or just out in general. Management, I can honestly say they were on point and knew what they were doing."
good,Its a company where you feel peace and security. Every time innovation is a starting goal. Follow chain of command and every time keep comunication with your superior.
good,It’s a very good company and good working environment and they provide housing and kitchen staff but after that everything is good and you have to be very responsible and fast pace
good,"The office was a relaxed atmosphere to work in. The shifts were long , 12 hours, the company provided drinks and snacks for the employees. Great teamwork . Dispatches and shifts were rotated to ensure everyone could do all aspects of the dispatch. Company had a good 401 K match and benefits."
good,Great company and a good working environment. Very good ceiling for advancement with good management. very good training implemented within the company providing the employees with the necessary tools to succeed not only within the company but in your future as well.
good,"NGL has good PTO time, pays by the  hour, has long hauls, has good benefits. The trucks are old. A typical is one load , it's a very relaxed place to work no pressure."
good,"fast pace  enviorment"
good,You could work from home or anywhere from your lap top I love this job too bad it was only temporary job I would of never stopped working for that company
good,"typical day, leading others helping where needed. I learned a lot about the oilfield in a shot time, great to get to know all my co workers, and form a good friendship with all. cant think of anything hard about the job , the best thing about the job were the people I worked with and the friends I made"
good,"Input invoices for Cargo airplanes and vans for shipment of medical supplies through the US.  Checked and corrected errors in A/R and A/P in the EMR systems.  Filing and making sure that all supplies were ordered for everyday processes."
good,"This is a fantastic place to work. I have learned a great deal regarding time management, cash analysis and the oil-gas industry as a whole. Management is very strong and the leadership seem to have the best intentions for their employees. You are expected to put the hours in to complete the job."
good,"learned a lot about natural gas cryogenic distillation and gas plant operations "
good,The only reason i left was due to loss in family. would recommend to anyone. Management did its best to provide a healthy and productive environment to all employees.
good,I had grown to call everyone at NGL Marine my brother I knew everyone and loved working for the company. Very competitive company on the rise in the boat and barge industry.
good,"NGL is a great place to work.  Dedication and adaptability to business needs is a key to success at NGL companies.  A good home for selfless focused people. Work/life balance is very generous; but, when market demand is high, it's all hands on deck.  Intelegent leadership with sound planning strategies."
good,working at NGL was a fun learning experience working at an oilfield related job taught me alot unfortunately when the oilfield slowed down our plant shut down
good,"I greatly enjoyed working for NGL Energy, the management was very knowledgeable in regards to the job performance requirements and provided opportunities to learn new aspects of the job and the programs. It was a highly team oriented office with associates who were always willing to help."
good,"Fast paced with opportunities to learn new skills and broaden your knowledge. Managers are knowledgeable and great to work with, in a fast pace office."
good,I am currently a driver still employed here. This job has been the easiest most laid back driver position I have worked. My spot is M-F. Weekends off except during the big holidays like thanksgiving and Christmas. Usually have to work on either the day before or after the holiday. Which isn't too bad since every other work week is M-F. Flexible time off when requested. Free food at each facility. Management is by far the best management I have ever dealt with in a workplace. I have been employed here 2 years. Unfortunately I have seen my fair share of lay offs. Which is common in this industry. If you know this industry. I work my tail off and stay out of the way. Work 50 hour weeks minimum. Don't have any complaints really. If there's any driver openings put in your application. It's worth it here. Benefits are excellent.
good,I like the job and hours the rain is a bad part because we can not work in the bad weather the ground is to wet and the tractor will get stuck and mess up the ground
good,"Nice coworkers, friendly management and very helpful. The only downside is you might have to go work ar other facilities and you get no pay for your gas and you cannot clock in till you are at the other facilities."
good,"I gained a lot of experience, great friends/ working partners, and picked up on general knowledge of tools. There was never a hard work day because my manager only approved of high quality workers to be around."
good,"NGL is a oil and gas logistic company, but it is not limited to just moving crude.  They also market the product. NGL is a great place to work. I would highly recommend to anyone, if they are interested in applying to this great company."
good,"NGL Crude Transportation- .Great place to work awesome management, top notch Dispatch, Dispatch management can be reached and always there to help +++"
good,"It was a great place to work and had great people in the supervisory roles.  It is a place I'd recommend to anyone looking for a job.  I could always count on support, as well as recognition."
good,company has good management secure work good trucks lots of hours great benefits direct deposit the whole nine yards the only down side its in cotulla and im from laredo
good,"This job was busy some days, very laid back job. The guys always needed help and when they did I would do what I could to help them other than that id make sure the disposal was clean coffee was made, and food was restocked."
good,everyday was a blast and a learning experience with this company its just a shame that me and other people were let go. due to the oil prices being so low.
good,"My training was excellent and occurred steadily over time, allowing me to assimilate and integrate complicated material. My interaction is minimal now, and primarily by phone. However, all of my experiences have been positive and growth oriented."
good,Peak season is very busy and very rewarding knowing that you are helping parents fulfill their children s wishes.
