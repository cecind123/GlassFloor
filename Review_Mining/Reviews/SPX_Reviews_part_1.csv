rating,review
bad,Management team had superiority issues.  They had no restraint when it came to treating employees like garbage.  They also had the least professional environment of anywhere I ever worked I. The past 40yrs and all of that was perpetuated from the very top down.  In short I have never worked anywhere with so many foul mouthed jerks!
bad,At the time i was employed here the automotive market tanked  and was laid off.  the job was hard heavy lifting etc. they had a ecent pay scheule an incentives along the way. im not sure how it is there today. they had an aquisition
bad,"This company doesn't want to invest in people or the company.  You will be pushed and pushed and pushed but because of how the bonus structure is designed, you will never see one.    No matter what you do, you will be a number.."
bad,Managers get away with murder. My supervisor risked 3 people's lives for 30 days and nothing was done to him. Wages in all departments are cut by 10.00 compared to grandfather rate. HR will lie to you to get you in. No bonuses and union is soft and cowardly.
bad,"This place was terrible. The proverbial ""sweat shop"" if you will.  Once worked three days straight troubleshooting a systems issue (with only two hours of sleep) and was written up on day 4 for being late."
bad,"SPX bought the company I worked for and while the reorganization was in place many people lost their jobs, turning a family owned company into shamble."
bad,Management is not good. People there are stuck in their ways. They will lie to your face. They do not hire people. I knew a guy that work there as a temp for about two and half years. They promised to hire and then end up laying him off.
bad,"Worked for this company for five years, horrible leadership. They aquire many product lines with very little knowledge about what they are getting into. Priorities change daily, very worried about the lag data but have no clue what lead measures to monitor to make positive change happen. More of a ""pound the fist on the table"" and create fear, kind of atmosphere. This company has no clue how to retain talent, you will get no where unless you're part of the 'good ol' boys club""."
bad,"From my perspective as a former employee, this was once a great company to work for ,at one time. Currently the brand has been tarnished. Too much individualism too much racism and very little respect for person. While I did meet some ppl I won't forget , I still don't have much good to speak of. When your upper management and certain lead people are being hypocrites on the daily. It seem unlikely this company will progress into the future"
bad,"Too many hours of very hard work for very little pay. Required to work excessive overtime. Most people speak very little English. Expect absolutely no life. Sleep and work. Day off, catch up on sleep. There are too many other good jobs out there that pay what they are worth."
bad,bad  sales  team  because  they  are  taking  on  contracts  they cant  fulfill  on  time  to  deliver  on  project. They  give  employees  a lunch  as your  bonus.
bad,"Horrible company, bought us after a year or so closed us down."
bad,"This is an excellent place to work if you hate your family or don't have one. The general management is way to gung-ho. I understand doing better,  but they take it way too far."
bad,Work was not hard.  We kept up with production and worked a family.  The pay and benefits were excellent.  Cleanliness was our priority and followed safety rules.
bad,"Newport Facility doesn't care about their employees. You are a number and nothing more. That's the new corporate way. Simple supplies and tools are refused. Equipment is out dated and dangerous. The human resources department does what the manger says not Corporate. Corporate lets Management do whatever they want as long as they are generating 40 million a year, they don't care. Number of employees has dwindled over the years forcing people to do multiple jobs in a stressful environment. I don't mind the work at all. The floor employees are good people. Management on all levels is a joke. ""Do what I tell with no lip or I'll help you pack your stuff"" Temps are made huge promises only to be lied to later."
bad,"not to trust supervisors and employees, did not provide positive feedback only looked to cut, the hardest part of the job was going in each day"
bad,great job it was like a family and everyone knew everyone the pay was great
bad,The job was great but the people there aren't honest about intentions. You are always on pins and needles about your position. The work is consistent and you are aware of your duties.
bad,"Słaba kasa, awansują ludzi miernych i nieprzyjemnych w obyciu, byle tylko potrafił gnoic pracownika. Kolesiostwo i nepotyzm. Inwigilacja. Tysiące kamer dyrektor Koszula, przerost formy nad treścią, najdroższy cięć w historii polskich korporacji. On passatem gównem nie będzie jeździł  Audi to dopiero dla niego godna marka. Z za plecow potrafi wyskoczyć"
bad,The managers lack the leadership skills and expert knowledge.  Employees are not fairly treated.  I would not recommend anyone work for this organization.
bad,"stay in your work area, how to work smarter not harder,stressful to much pressure not enough communication to the workers,most people are nice,standing up all day. when it was time to go home."
bad,Too many people with no degrees and who have been with the company. They worked their way up to management positions and make sure that others fail. High turn-over.
bad,The company is a fortune 500 company but the thermal products division is operated outside of corporate over-sight and the inexperience and unethical practices stand out.
bad,Provided your in the front office you might give it rave reviews. I can only address the facility that I work in. It's a large international corporation. So I can't really speak for the entire corporation. They do turn a good profit. On the whole. I will say if it weren't for the union such as it is. This would still be a undeniable sweat shop.
bad,"The job offers good hours and OK pay. I worked at the SPX after market in Ocala Florida working in the warehouse is very uncomfortable after you see that the people that's been there the longest doesn't do anything and if you're new you got to do everybody else's work while management just sits back and watches. The manager is prejudice and warehouse Lead people are straight up racist, very uncomfortable to work there, you're not allowed to talk. In the breakroom everybody complains about the smell of food so you can't even sit and have a good lunch because you have everybody complaining from the managment  to them last people in the warehouse. God forbid you want to make coffee because the manager thinks she's the cleanest person and checks everything you use. I do not recommend this place unless you really need the job and then you're going to move on. The turn around it's just incredible at this Warehouse."
bad,very poor management. think twice about applying there. they go through layoffs often. the working people there are cool.
bad,"Many of the managers played favorites and acted childish.  The managers who were very professional, well educated and driven to be successful were not fully supported.  Many of the co-workers were wonderful people and did not receive enough recognition.  A benefit of working at SPX was it was close to home."
bad,The Corporate Headquarters focused on short term profits over long term benefits for the organization.  They ran the organization like a short term investor looking to sell the division to maximize return.  I've seen them destroy many of their business units by underfunding and having the business units wither on the vine.  The best thing that happened to our business unit was to get sold to private equity.  How often do people say that!
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job is working with people that what to get the job done right.
bad,SPX was a great place to work until the business unit was closed.  After removing 70+ jobs the company was then sold.
bad,Top management gives a high priority to Job Work/Life Balance in books but practically you wish for it.
bad,No respect for people. Last year alone fired 15 employees and many more quit. SPX is a good company but the Tulsa facility is not.
bad,Revolving door; never know if you are going to have a job or not. Management is always changing and its who you know not what you know.
bad,"Spxflow has gone through significant changes in the past 4 years. First it moved from a geographical split into a market oriented structured but very financially focused."
bad,Work load is  heavy and not much time with family. No matter how long you have been there they are willing to get  rid of you.  Management thinks they are better than you  even though they do not know your job
bad,"The day to day workers are fantastic. They are tireless and really care about turning out a good product. The corporate management only cares about dollars and looking good ""on the (Wall) Street"" They do not care about the work force at all. They have cut employee benefits so much, most employees count on their spouses' benefits."
bad,Nice organization but foreign influence not good for US employees.  Really liked for the organization.  Work schedule very flexible and US management really good.
bad,It was a good experience about assembling hydraulic pumps and also taking inventory on all sorts of parts that you would need in order to build these hydraulic pumps
bad,If you've worked for one pump company then you've worked for them all. There is nothing else to say. If you're having problems in your current pump company then this company will have the same benefits/problems.
good,"Co-workers are hard to get along with sometimes."
good,"No Comment or rating for this company at this time.  You have meetings to attend, the workplace culture depends on what department you work in on how to rate the culture."
good,"Management turned over every 12-15 months. Wonderful team members, dedicated up was always having to reinvent the wheel with the constant management change which brought new process and procedures."
good,"Overall I enjoyed my time at SPX Corporation. The reason I left was due to a promotional opportunity which also cut my commute in half. My role as a Senior HR Generalist consist of responding to employee concerns/questions primarily on the operations side of the business, educating the employees on policy and/or HR process changes, recruiting, reporting, responding to 1st and 2nd step grievances, managing projects and overall supporting the business. I learned to multi task and adapt to change. The hardest part of the job was the commute. The best part of the job was the schedule 4-10's and building relationships with the corporate team, local team and having the opportunity to interface with the HR team in China."
good,"Checking computers for viruses and installing updates"
good,"Quarter to Quarter mentality is the biggest knock on this organization.  Middle and Upper management is out of touch and reorgs based on personnel on whim."
good,they are big on safety and are trying to change the culture within the company to be a more employee engaged enviroment where the employee's are more involved with decision making
good,"With the lack of training, management, shift options and forced overtime. The only benefits to SPX are the pay and job security. Spx will ruin your family."
good,"Very High Stress and faced paced work environment.  "
good,"SPX, like many companies wants to do more with bare bones resources. The culture in Ocala is one of finger pointing with no accountability, there are underlying issues around reverse racism that I have never encountered before and is demotivating. Some management is very supportive, others are not - and may ask you to turn your head away to get product out the door."
good,"•	Global responsibility through 4 main divisions (20+ business units) within the segment covering over 15 countries."
good,"Looks good from the surface, but far from it.  Seems like the company is always playing catch up and being reactive instead of proactive.  They have strong brands but they are fading quickly in the face of indecisiveness on a daily basis.  Management consistently turns over and thus traction in the market place never occurs."
good,SPX was a Fortune 500 Company. Great co-workers and direct reports. The most enjoyable part was the creative aspect and traveling.
good,"Upper Management in the Shared Service Center has no Shared Service Center experience.  This lead to many issues and failures on their part, which they roll down to middle management.  Nothing is ever good enough and the Director operates as though she is in a tornado....try to stay out of her way"
good,Great new building. Large company with many opportunities in manufacturing and support services
good,The Company is addressing most of their short comings and aggressively pursuing other markets. They are changing around roles / responsibilities to attempt to aquire a winning recipe.
good,Weil-Mclain was a good place to work my position was good. I was able to learn a lot on my on as far as different software programming etc. Never had a write up but after a serious surgery they railroad me after giving 10+ years of work. Upper management can not be trusted all your personal business will be separated across the plant. If you don’t have a great relationship with your supervisor/ management please don’t trust trust HR
good,The glass mold job comments were supposed to be here Contech was the job I liked and the pay was good but the economy really hurt that place and good workers were gone .
good,"Design cooling towers, mostly fiberglass design with a little wood design.  "
good,Wasn’t all that bad I had a job for a day and didn’t get another shift since. Wasteful really as it’s an easy job long hours not to bad for someone who’s just left school looking to get straight into work.
good,"There is a lot of overtime opportunity, so if you dont mind the work there is a lot of money that can be made here. Also a lot of different type of work to expand into if you would like."
good,"The days were never the same some were fast paced, and some were slow.  I learned new skills regarding project management.  People were willing to help teach or assist in your learning new skills.  The hardest part of the job was getting the opportunity to learn the new skills.  The most enjoyable part is the people I'm currently working with."
good,this is a well established company.there management skills and getting information to there employees can be improved.i learned alot with this particular company.the hardest part of the job was getting use to being in the air with a safety horness on.i learned how to read blueprints and maps along with the job.and also safety first.
good,"billing"
good,"Not a good experience in my career, but I learned lots. Lack of clear strategy"
good,SPX Corporation was a good place to work. They were good at creating cross-functional teams to work together solving any issues that come up. I learned quite a bit about lean manufacturing while I was there.
good,Started the day with phone calls and meeting with the team. Culture was typical office and very quiet. Worked with MS-Excel on a daily basis and learned many functions of this program.
good,"Supporting our Representatives world wide with the Customer Needs to keep their Cooling Towers working. Receive orders, find the parts requested, and ship them out as soon as possible. Support from management and co-workers. The hardest part of the job is when you cannot get the parts requested in the timely manner that the customer needs. The most enjoyable part is fulfilling my customers needs and providing exactly what is needed and when it is needed."
good,Very safe place to work. Great pay and great employees. No chance of getting a work place injury. I really liked this job.
good,"Badge in at 6:00, Sign in at the control room in the unit of the day, Then go get work permit for the day, Go to our staging area drop off lunch and sign in again, Grab equipment and tools for the first half of the day, Go back to unit to start work around 8:00, Go to lunch at 12:00, Eat lunch and grab materials for second half of day, Be back working around 1:30, Turn in mic and permit around 4:00, Badge out at 4:30."
good,Working at TCI is one of the most challenging opportunities I have ever been afforded. The management team is motivated and relentless. They expect the best and work with employees to get there.
good,Typical work day consist of applying cash for 6 business units. Train all new employees. Assist and answer any questions related to lead rolls
good,"Crescita professionale, ottimi colleghi, buone strategie di business"
good,"As a Fortune 500 company, the organization uses corporate concepts and approach. The company is in a competitive market."
good,This is a great place to be employed. The atmosphere and enviroment is good. People pretty much keep to themselves unless there is a huge project that they would have to engage with each other.
good,"I worked outside and pulled parts per customer orders and loaded carts that were then sent to the shipping department. I also worked in the shipping department where I assembled the wooden crates, packed parts sent in from yard and completed final inspections before shipping to construction sites for final assembly."
good,A typical day at work continuous work and sweat. I learned 5S house cleaning and how to be a team player. I also learned how to be a multi-tasker. I worked well with other. The hardest part of my job was working in the heat. I worked around 450 degrees ovens all the time. The best part was when company had events.All co-workers came together and had a good time.
good,"I had the best mentor, who was a PE in 8 states. Reinforced all that I had learned in school."
good,"Typical day at work is very busy and could be smoother with better tools to work with and reliable network."
good,Learned alot working on all types of prototype equipment. Workers were very skilled.
good,This was a fun workplace. the whole team got along well. Management was real unprofessional.
good,Advanced skill level and educational opportunities were very good
good,Enjoyed the people and the challenge. Toughest part was dealing with executives from many areas with varying opinions.
good,I haven't worked there since 2008 so anything I write may not be applicable to today's culture and work environment.  One of the best options for a mechanical engineer in Ocala area.
good,SPX was not a good company to work for.  Cared only about the bottom line not about the people.  I worked for them fom 2003 to 2013 after they bought out my company.  Not a pleasant experience at all.
good,"After coming from being laid off any job will do and that was the case with this one. My immediate manger was great as well as my group. However, as a whole the company was not so great. I'll put it like this I was hired through a contract house IPG for SPX for Chrysler. After about a year most people were hired in direct to SPX. When it was my turn we interviewed and all went well up until I heard nothing of the matter. After waiting and waiting for an update I decided to contact the SPX HR and was then told it was not going to happen. So talk about a sorry feeling."
good,job was too short due to production slow down after being hired
good,"The people are the best part of working at SPX.  Most are friendly and professional.  There is a sense of camaraderie.  Coworkers often gather outside of work for social activities.  There are also some company-sponsored social activities."
good,"It's a tough environment to work in, but you are paid fairly for your trouble, and provided with PPE."
good,"Lots of overtime and decent pay.  Work not the easiest and not the hardest.  If don't mind working with your hands, definitely not a bad place to work."
good,"machine operator , preventive maintenance , responsible of all quality products and contribute for customer satisfaction and continue of improvment"
good,"The initial working environment was great, challenging, rewarding and really a fun place to work. But, as time went by and changes were implemented it was not a place to look forward to going to every day."
good,"All in all, it's not a bad place to work. The lower and middle-level management are fine to deal with, with some diamonds in the rough. The real trouble comes from the higher-ups who demand long hours, increased productivity, and hardly ever approve investment into their machines. Each machine that I work with is no younger than 20 years old, ran practically 24/7. Not a place to build a career unless you intend on climbing the corporate ladder."
good,"Completing the job make sure it past x ray. I've learned how to weld on different assignments.  Management was great, had positive feedback on my welding skills. The hardest part of the job working in the heat. Most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers, being able to work as a team."
good,"can't say too much, only there for just over a year before they closed the data center and laid us all off.  Benefits were excellent.  Opportunity at headquarters good."
good,people are generally nice. the work shifts consists of small groups of employees. They have a union within this company
good,"I have thoroughly enjoyed working at this facility because of the people.  Each work day brought new challenges but through team effort we accomplished a lot.  Unfortunately, the team did not include management."
good,I liked that I was able to forge my career as a HR Generalist at Pratt.  I did not care for their manner in which they handled employees as though they were commodities.
good,The lack of professionalism and experience of the SLT will prevent this company from continuing to growth.  Promotion only comes if you're part of the Good Ole Boy network.  President is excellent but probably won't be around long as his ceiling is the sky.
good,"Oportunidade de aprendizado, fácil acesso, aprendi muito"
good,Many changes are currently taking place at SPX.  The Shared Service Center was relocated to Charlotte last year and the 4 people that work in corporate accounting are currently getting merged into the Shared Service Center.  This is a very different work environment than I am accustom to which is why I am seeking employment elsewhere.
good,"A typical day at work invovled performing chemical experiments.  I learned new experiments.  The supervisor was really good to work with.  The workplace culture was that of a manufacturing environment.  The hardest part of the job, at times, was standing on my feet all day.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to use my chemistry degree."
good,This was a very difficult position.  It was dirty and not a safe place to work.  I climbed in to cooling towers and to perform maintenance and rebuilding.  Management was difficult.
good,They don’t care about their employees enough because yes u do get free stuff on ur birthday and at Christmas but only if they hire u on which can take awhile it only took me 6 months but it took others years to get hired on and all they care about is work work work getting the production numbers they don’t care if u are dealing with personal stuff  in ur life or not
good,"I learned a lot working there. Shop is shutting down so looking for a place I can advance at now. My schedule changed frequently, but that was the price I paid to keep a good job."
good,"it was a great job and good paid"
good,"SPX was a good employer but I did not like my supervisor.  I feel she did not treat me fairly.  Due to the downturn of the economy, they eliminated my position."
good,Very challenging in a positive way.  Extremely busy schedule.  10 plus hours a day.  Good co workers.  opportunity to advance.  Educational opportunities
good,family oriented environment.  Very flexible work schedules.  Friendly Environment.  Positive attitudes amongst staff and employees.  Benefits were great.
good,A good mix of Mechanical and Electrical work.  Works together helps obtain greater results. Developed good work relations. Completing tasks gratification.
good,Good pay and benefits. Management does not have great people skills with employees or outside contacts. The pay range has not improved in the past 15+ years
good,Great Place to work for with a solid group of employees. Pay is great and the work load is challenging but bonus plans are pretty much non existence.
good,"This company offers exceptional growth opportunities if located in the right areas of the operation, whether it be a local business unit or at the corporate level. "
good,"regular construction work day, great corporate office, great support"
good,"SPX offers excellent medical, life insurance, and disability benefits. They offer a solid Engineering Development Program for college graduates."
good,"This work was all computer, maintenance manual, technical writing and data tagging.  SPX was on contract with Allison Transmissions to revise their technical manuals.  We interfaced with the engineer stake-holders for each of the product lines.  We wrote Training Manuals, Repair Manuals and Troubleshooting Manuals, just to mention a few.  All of the employees that I worked with were easy to get along with and very helpful when needed.  Once a day our supervisor would conduct a conference call with all of the other cities / job sites that were contributing to the production of the manuals.  It was fun watching an expert conduct the organization of this major effort."
good,"General manufacture duties, packing, shipping, form filling, computer imputting of information."
good,Time well spent. The accounting department was exceptionally coordinated. Management provided opportunity to understand the component parts of the accounting function.
good,"It is a good place to work. My managers are nice and friendly, my coworkers are a great group of people."
good,nice fast place to work was treated fairly and enjoyed working there.  clean factory and treated everyone fairly.  all you had to waz your jib and the respected you.
good,"Good place to work. people are focused, lack in teaching other people how to work machinery in order to gain some experience to better yourself but overall a good place"
good,"Fun work place with supportive management.  They seem to be all about the numbers though.  Decent amount of red tape and politics, but is expected in a big company.  It was a good place to work and they do challenge the skills you bring to the table."
good,"8 to 12 hour days"
good,SPX is a good place to work if your job is not cut.  The design / engineering teams have good processes and each member is able to contribute.  Management needs to be careful to not cut quality in an effort to reduce costs.
good,"Work at your own pace, coworkers like to talk about others behind their back, didnt like the seperation of management and employees within the building, made for a not so productive team environment."
good,The people I worked with are nice. The reason I left was to pursue my doctorate.
good,"SPX had great technical writing tools to perform my job.  All of the computer or software interruptions were resolved quickly. "
good,I learned a lot from this job. It's pretty easy to get the hang of learning your role in the workplace. The pay was fair. The hours were great. I recommend people to work there.
good,"There were several product lines at the Houston location, and that allow you do develop better understanding of manufacturing, procurement, and planning opportunities and challenges."
good,Good place to work. Good people.Look forward to going to work everyday.Helpful and very informative.Employees and management communacate very well.Great place
good,Overall the culture of the company focuses on results - which is good.  The human resources culture is not great.  Their focus is to not get sued vs. employee development.
good,Immediate supervisor was great though senior management was deeply flawed. Great colleagues and customers. Enjoyed the business enormously because of all the wonderful distributors.
good,"Good place to work, family like work culture.  Good work life balance, rarely work overtime hours, travel is a minimum.  Niche industry, highly competitive."
good,"Overall this is a good company to work for.  Current market conditions has driven management to make necessary but uncomfortable business decisions.  This has driven more complexity and uncertainty in the nature of the work, but can be enjoyable to those seeking variety.  Most of all, the people of the organization make SPX an enjoyable place to work."
good,"I would run a crew each day putting together high voltage transformers all over the united states for utility companies that purchased transformers from the company I worked for. I learned how to run a crew, work safe, be fair to each team member & give project status updates to my office as well as the customer on a daily basis. All the people I worked with were very good guys & very hard workers. Seeing most of all the states in the united states was the best part of the job but it turned old quickly. That is why I say the hardest part of the job was being away from my family for long periods of time."
good,"Worked from home office for the nine years w/ fairly extensive travel via plane. Visits to Reps. to aid in products support, Business Meetings, attend Trade Shows and introduce new products and technology."
good,Company is professional and willing to advance those that are interested.
good,"1.Provide training"
good,"This was one of my favorite jobs. It was hard and repetitive work. That given days went by fast. The company was very good with safety for the most part, and was never overbearing in their demands out of you physically."
good,"Very fast paced, and good working with hard working people. the work is easy and a good learning job. Alot of experience to work with. It is a M-F job so you have the weekend for your family. Management appreciates your hard work and recognizes it The hardest part of the job is that its a multitasking job and it is a timed job but very rewarding."
good,Overall a good company to work for. Financial team was solid. Management was accessible and generally easy to work with. Pay and benefits were decent.
good,Management diligently worked to help relocate workers with the move of their product a crossed state lines or aid adversely affected employees find and obtain new employment.
good,"I would open the studio and prepare for the classes with sound and exercise equipment assessments, and check in attending clients prior to the start of class. I typically guide a group of 8 to 11 customers through an intensive 50 minute pilates class paying close attention to the form and safety of attending members. Instructors have very minimal class interaction with coworkers or management outside of scheduled team meetings but the culture of the business was cohesive and friendly."
good,I had a great job with great opportunities Only reason I left was for person reasons.  Great up beat surroundings with interesting challenges.
good,"I was with this company for 18 years, I learned how to deal with all types of people and situations, I became very accomplished with computer repair. Great place to work. So glad to have had opportunity to work there."
good,SPX is a great place to work. The employees are awesome and they appreciate HR and upper management. The company works very hard to show employees that they are valued and appreciated. As with most companies the days continue to get longer and the weekends tend to belong to the company with cell phones and laptops.
good,"Overall a good place to work if you like to work. There are many, many, many experienced people at different levels in the company - 30 to 40 years of experience. They are extremely passionate about the products, but are somewhat disillusioned by the corporate nature of the organization. They started working when it was a single owner and entrepreneurial culture. "
good,i have enjoyed working for this company as the people and management are excellent
good,Left only because of IBM job offer which was closer to home and family
good,"Originally recruited by former CIO, who established a global, shared services technology vision. Technology operation now lacks cohesive strategy and vision, and is managed by committee."
good,"Nice place to work. A good balance between work and personal. Competitive compensation for well-qualified individuals."
good,"getting yourself ready with ppe equipment, nuts and bolts.. replace rotten structure with fiber glass... cut if needed and work as a team to get the job done."
good,"It was a startup and provided good feel of doing everything from scratch. Sales, operations, admin , logistics, customer support -- All were part of day to day deliveries."
good,"A typical day, Design and Development of special tools for customer’s needs and requirements. Maintaining a relationship with manufacturing personnel and customers."
good,The company overall was a blessing to work for. The company in general was bought and sold four times in a 15 year spand but givin that the management stayed the same and the employees were satisfied with most all the changes. The management let most all the employees do the same things that they were doing for years because everything was already working good. The thing I liked the most was when there was a problem the input to fix the problem was a combination of engineers and employees which made the employees feel like they ment more to the overall process.
good,"I currently work for an Aerospace company, Every day is challenging but am always up to the task, We have a great team that leans on each other with the same goals in mind and that is to keep costumers satisfied by completing jobs on time with quality work. I learned how to work with all departments[Management/Planning/Assembly/Quality and Warehouse.I enjoy getting each task done for each day. I don't waste time because time is money. I am always willing to learn and progress with the company.."
good,"Received wonderful reviews for the past 3 years at company.  "
good,"azienda dove vige ancora la legge della meritocrazia."
good,"hardest part of the job was having to go up scaffold about 30'. I was'nt afraid, just did not feel comfortable with the height"
good,I moved so was only with spx for short time. great management good company to work for
good,"typical day: upload of bank statements, allocating the cash to customer accounts in close work with the credit controller, reconciling the sub ledger Bank GL accounts. check all Bank balances and transfer if necessary fund to cover accounts for evtl outgoing payments. Answering queries regarding Customer accounts inter company or 3rd party in the afternoon working on continuous improvement projects if possible"
good,"This was a great job where I advanced from an Administrative Assistant to the Data Analyst. I learned a lot in HR, Quality, Shipping and Recieving"
good,It was a good place to work. The staff was ok. We worked a lot in the busy times. They would have lunch for us some times. Some times they would give gifts.
good,"As long as you did your job, nobody never said anything negative, they always said good job.  Encouraged employees to take advantage of the company education tuition repayment plan."
good,I was hired through a temp agency and the money was good.  Wanted to be a permanent employee of the company but they didn't have any open positions and I was laid off.
good,"Busy"
