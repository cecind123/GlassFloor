bad,"It's a really bad place to work at. They don't want to hire no one. They don't care about you or your family. They work u like a slave, they have no respect for there employees"
bad,"Muy mala empresa, en el laboratorio de IQC (Incoming) los mismos compañeros de trabajo hablan mal de los demás, los jefes dan favoritismo a personas en específico y siempre prefieren a alguien sin estudios que a un profesional con título. Pésimo ambiente laboral y falta de un líder con experiencia para controlar todo esto."
bad,Such a horrible comapny to work for. You have to be temp for over 6 months before you can even be considered to be hired. Also management suckkkkks. Its so horrible.
bad,"I worked at Hologic for 3 months as a temp, there was no respect for temps whatsoever. You felt like an uninvited guest just there helping out. The agency that got me into Hologic, Randstad was worse, they don't listen to you, constantly bother you with texts, calls and IM at all hours, even after work hours when they need in something from you. But when you need info from them to verify employment and get a reference for a manager or co-worker the will give you the run around and flat out ghost you if it doesn't financially benefit the agency."
bad,"A typical day of work is dealing with management, I learn to deal with the problems. my co-workers was a go group of people.the hardest part of the dealing with management.the enjoyable part of that was getting off."
bad,"My experience was so poor that I have little to say. The management, which started as terrible, somehow managed to get worse. The product management group was led by people who could not even write a coherent sentence in English. The products are good, but the lack of talent in engineering management and product management meant that products always fell short of being spectacular, or better than just good."
bad,"They don't hesitate to layoff employees, often reposting the positions 3 to 6 months later to hire at lower wages.  Benefits package has dwindled, profit sharing ceased, medical and STD / LTD replaced with much lesser plans. As they have grown in size the quality of the work environment has deteriorated.  Management, particularly middle management, is insensitive to the needs of employees."
bad,"Since I've worked at Hologic, I've learned many aspects of the company but I am currently looking for new employment because of constant layoffs. Only to see the job is posted again after 3 months. "
bad,"I worked in the Facilities department for two years. "
bad,"If you want to be criticized for a positive attitude, enthusiasm and awsome credentials then this is the place. They may have excellent products,  however the mfg team gets treatment like 1st grade."
bad,"The managers don't care about you and your co-workers are rude, nasty, talk behind your back, they hate their job and make it known. Very high stress level and I was showing a manager a program because she didn't know how to use it. It was very lonely and not a good work environment. I would go home crying every night because I can't stand getting treated like a robot and if you made an error the supervior would be on your case like it was the end of the world. They don't appreciate anything, managers come and go as they please, they come in whatever time they want and sneak out of work early. There isn't a ""team"" environment, it's a bunch of cliques that go outside and smoke for 20 mins every hour. I am so happy to be out of there. The people I worked with would be on social media all day, texting,  on personal phone calls and shopping for clothes online. I'm very disappointed. I was hoping for a long term career, I should have stayed at my previous job ."
bad,"This is a giant Corporation that swallowed a family owned business that was a threat to Hologic. Hologic made an offer Gen-Probe could not resist, Everyone but the higher ups payed the price. Building got closed, people let go, and pay went down. Work hours went up so did the revenue of 3.5 billion dollars and yet they could not afford their employees for over a year a good enough salary. They hire temp employees for some times two years with very low pay hard hours and no benefits, with no guarantee of full time job."
bad,"The company is focused on management and individual contributors have little empowerment or professional satisfaction. They have taken to terminating and laying off experienced folks so that they can re-post their jobs at a more junior level and for less pay. For a woman's health company, it is very family unfriendly. They also hire very few minorities."
bad,Worst experience of my life. People were down right nasty and highly unprofessional. Compensation was nice but that's about it. Would not recommend to anyone.
bad,"As a contractor, It goes with the territory. However, Treated like dirt and talked down to consistently...degrading!"
bad,"Les trabajé un año, como inspectora de calidad por un salario paupérrimo. Me despidieron por acusaciones falsas de compañeros (ambiente laboral hostil). Habían personas en cargos grandes que no tenían ni siquiera secundaria concluída; mucho favoritismo. Mala empresa."
bad,Horrible management that prides themselves on turnover rate. The company several years ago use to be a great place to work. Unfortunately with out new products they have taken a senior level job to an associate level job.
bad,"Co-works were ok at times to work with, very mouthy and racial. management set you up to fail. always promised to promote within but hired outside of company. hardest part of the job was watching people play games on their phones or computer during production time."
bad,Certain people would act like your friend but than talk abut you behind your back. The entire management staff was let go during a reorganization. Even the VP was let go.
bad,"Working at Hologic, the job itself I loved. Management mostly were as the song states ""smile in your face"". I was cross-trained on several jobs, according to my manager, a very good employee; always helping others, did my job above and beyond...worked ot, weekends (Sats and Suns). During recovery from surgery, management switched hands once again, and I was let go. I was told they downsized."
bad,"Management doesn't care about you, mismanagement seems to be the most consistent attribute. Corporate culture is fragmented. Is HQ in Bedford, or Marlborough? Or San Diego? Pay is awful. It's all about lining the pockets of investors, masked by the guise of saving lives. The best part of the job are the great people you work with, they're all getting screwed too, unless they're in the inner circle of management. you won't go anywhere here."
bad,"Favorites were treated well, good old boy mentality. "
bad,"Goals change through the year, budget cuts are frequent and no long term vision. The people do excellent work, work hard and quality is the highest priority but management doesn't seem to be interested in its employees."
bad,"I really enjoyed the work, but the environment/culture was very difficult to navigate.."
bad,"over the last 6-8 years with new management downsizing, cutting costs going to other countries for manufacturing, threatening the outside contributors and threatening employees has turned Hologic from a company who cares for their employees to a company doing whatever it takes to get to the bottom line - double digit savings in engineering, manufacturing, operations.   However, Marketing and Sales is as rich as a company can get.  but that's what the new management is all about - LOOKS, not security and caring for their employees.  Just look at their booth(s) at the yearly trade show..."
bad,"The old Hologic was a great place to work. The new Hologic that has come about no longer cares about its customers or employees, just the bottom line."
bad,working environment sucks. corruption at its best. if youre a temporary employee cant win arguements etc. the veteran employees they take advantage of the new hired people. talking about the temporary employees. the management doesnt take the temps side. so if youre working at this place be sure not to argue with the old employees. or youll get fired
bad,"Overall a good company                                                                           "
bad,Not a good fit for me. I am a capital sales guy who is use to calling on multiple specialities with a wide variety of products. At Hologic there are limited products and limited specialities.
bad,"Hologic (formerly GenProbe) is a good company with a great reputation, industry leading products, but has a very divisive and toxic culture. They typically only promote from within and it's a 'Game of Throne's type environment vying for leaderships attention. Most of the good people that I had worked with have since left the company. There is poor management oversight, very little leadership but lots of management."
bad,"Hologic is notorious for doing massive company wide lay offs frequently. They have closed many facility's causing everyone to get laid off. They are known to buy out other companies and do what the call ""reorganizing"" with their loyal employees that have given many years to them. They expect people to triple their work load for same pay. The company when it's good is good but don't expect to be there forever. Given the opertunity to work here again I would run for the hills."
good,"Company was constantly switching CEOs and buying other companies they didn't need. They were almost put out of business multiple times. Many people lost their jobs while the CEO got a multimillion dollar pay out. Pay was some of the lowest I've seen for the field, and the job title didn't match the job description at all. Was doing a sys admin job, for help desk pay."
good,"Hologic has outstanding products that serve the needs of Women's Health, but the current work culture needs to be worked on.  Seems the focus is on cutting costs to the detriment of the service engineers causing many to leave due to a bad work/life balance, pay inequality."
good,"Hologic has a core of tremendously loyal and intelligent staffers who have delivered highly competitive solutions in the company's wheel-house of fluid test kits, genetic diagnostics and imaging. Unfortunately, the company has no sense of its true competitive assets, people and is commensurately poor in human capital management and CoE development. Most of its success comes from a small group of ex-engineers turned middle management who are challenged as to how to achieve world-class scale in ops and retention, and an executive team with no sense of the middle and bottom of the org. As a result, the company is reactive more so than innovative and is vulnerable to loss of capacity should its delicate, albeit currently successful, chemistry ever change."
good,Job moved overseas did get experience in the bio-medical manufacturing field.
good,"It's a good company to work for, but there is very little to no in company promotions.  There are a large number of outside managers bringing in there buddies."
good,Cleaning the Service returns was disgusting.  No other employee wanted to do it.  Customers don't care how they return them.
good,Get you money walking in the door since raises have been put on hold.  Seems a bit unfair based on the millions of dollars per month the company makes for profit.
good,they make a fine product for woman's healthcare. the managers play favorites. you're not rewarded for doing a good job
good,To much favoritisms from managers with certain floor employees.Good Christmas party. Fair days off given. Starting time was great . 7.00 am to 3 .00pm Clean Company. Down fall is that seems like around every 3 years or so there’s a lay-off and they don’t call back there employees back when business picks up again. They hire all new employees.
good,"Able to work remotely. No work/life balance, Several departmental changes. Outsourcing several departments. Not many advancement opportunities. Not enough IS support."
good,"While I believe that I learned a lot working as as a Chemist at Hologic, there is no doubt (at least when it comes to this position) that there is seriously low chance of career advancement in addition to the compensation for the amount of work that needs to be done. However, I do recommend this position to new graduates as it is a entry level position whose managers care about you learning as much as you can during the time you are there. Also, this position is considered a manufacturing position hence the low pay even though it is a multidisciplinary position that will require you to learn and retain a lot of information."
good,"Poor management and managers.  Does not value employees. "
good,"I was in the customer support my team was the first point of contact for the customer.  "
good,Was transferred to new department and was not happy with the job. Was not allowed to go back to the job I was hired to do. Too much paperwork for the job. A lot of pressure to get work done when the load was heavy. No one was cross trained so time off was hard.
good,"From my experience, groups will help one another out for the most part. Whoever is over loaded with work will get a temp to help level the load. The food is great, built in café with food served breakfast and lunch. Paid government recognized holidays and sick days per hours accrued. Management could be better, never focused constantly changing minds. Does not listen to other coworkers to an extent. Hologic is a FAST growing company and job security is a sure thing. Advancement however, there is little to any.  After a year and a half of service and leading a lot of projects there was no advancement for myself. Again, back to little or no advancement. However, Hologic knows how to hire its employee's. Everyone is very enjoyable to work with. I have had little negative experiences with other groups and workers."
good,Teammates are great and everyone supports each other. Little actual training or support from management and no room for growth for temp. research associates
good,"As a college student pursuing a degree, I didn't really care what work I was given. With great hours and pay, I couldn't say no.  Once everyday became a routine, the work became boring and really slow.  I always had to ask for more work. My supervisor underestimated my skills constantly and made me feel like I didn't know any better.  I also wasn't trained well when I first began, which annoyed me as when I asked for guidance on a project, they wouldn't show me what to do, they would just take over.  Coworkers argued a lot within the office. Felt like high school. Everyone also had their own clique.  I wouldn't recommend the environment and culture at Hologic."
good,Learned to build and final test of three different medical products. They had a good and positive attitude with all it workers.
good,I liked the work that I did because not only was it helping me as a female but women and some men all over the world.
good,"Great company to work for. One thing that has to change is the heavy workload for employees. At the manufacturing end, there is the need to open more opportunities for advancements."
good,"There are a lot of talented people there.  The atmosphere is comfortable and everyone helps and gets involved.  "
good,Hologic is a very fun and productive place to work for.  I've learned a lot throughout working for this company for almost 3 years however the hardest part of the job is the commute.
good,Great diversity of tasks.  Worked with great team of people.
good,"Hologic is an exciting and innovative place to work. There are opportunities to grow, but you must be self-driven as this company is not very conductive to helping their new employees learn."
good,"It's great work work for a place that does so much for women's health.  There has been company changes that focus more on the bottom line versus the patients, but it is likely temporary as things get solidified for the long-term.  Being on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 puts a lot of pressure the the leaders."
good,Currently I am working at Hologic and feel is time for me to make a change and pursue another career within a bio-medical company.  Hologic inspired me to think about other opportunities in other companies.
good,It has been quite some time since I worked for this company. I did enjoy my time there but it has been so long that I do not feel I am the right person to give a re review
good,The benefits are great. Many of the people have been working there since it was Gen-Probe. The culture has changed significantly since it became Hologic.
good,"To overloaded with work, TB's and no time for admin. Management just asks for more and then calls you on it during reviews."
good,"Company has gone through a lot of change over the last several years, with several changes in executive management. Employee engagement is impacted negatively due to the lack of stability in leadership and organizational changes."
good,I worked mainly alone doing administrative work and data entry work. I enjoyed working alone because I felt comfortable knowing that I was in control of what tasks had to be completed first. And I learned really quickly so doing these tasks were really simple in my eyes since I can pick up learning new traits fast
good,"Makers of world class top of the line medical devices, Hologic is a fast pace growth company. It has good benefits and one of the best service organizations."
good,"good product but not chance for movement internally. dont care for the ""little people"". strong focus on putting out a good competitive product"
good,"I was recently employed at Hologic and enjoyed the experience overall. However, the company just changed ownership right before I came in so it's a slow and rigorous process to implement new changes and find out what works. I was also on as a temp just before they decided they weren't going to be hiring any new employees and they will be cutting costs, so I was laid off. That was my experience with this company. However I'm sure once they work out the logistics; sometime in the future it will be a good place to work."
good,"When I was at HOLOGIC, I remember working in lean manufacturing in a very clean and organized facility. The benefits were compatible and co-workers were ok to work with."
good,Overall a nice place to work at. The hardest part of working here was the daily anxiety especially during lay-offs and if the company performed poorly during a quarter.
good,The job was ok. Now that it's being moved to Costa Rica it's not relevant though
good,Hologic is a good company. I am looking to move into surgical sales.
good,"only hired contractors from India(H1 Visa)"
good,"Work days were on average 11hour days. I learnt about product life cycles (everything from R&D to product launch), strategic marketing, business case writing and presentation, marketing lingo, EU/North America market differences and how to bring IVD products to market. The company did its best to promote healthy living by having a gym onsite, ergonomic tables/chairs/desk setup, a fantastic cafeteria with great outdoor and indoor seating (located in San Diego, CA so enjoying the sunshine was vital!) and great company days every quarter where we would receive updates on how the company was doing and lunch would be provided. The hardest part of the job was having 7 bosses in 2 and 1/4 years as the transplant diagnostics business arm was not fully understood by Gen-Probe when it was purchased and therefore it was hard to find a suitable Marketing Director for me to report to. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning everything on the job!"
good,Specifically from a research and development perspective there is not much opportunity for advancement unless you have a PhD.  Other departments are better depending on the role.  Overall the work is not too demanding.
good,"New site with production yet to start. Gained experiance in project management, good small workforce at the moment"
good,Hours 5:30-2:30
good,"Decent place to work overall but as of late you have to wonder how long the job will last since about 200 employees were basically handed off to another company."
good,I worked in the R&D lab designing new products with an amazing group of people.
good,"A good place to work. It had good management. Company had bought out original company, Cytyc.The company had good growth, they treated their people well"
good,"Easy work as an operator building medical devices for cancer patients in a lab environment.  "
good,"Provide fast and accurate repair, installation and preventive maintenance of Hologic equipment. No after hour on call at this point, next business day service.  "
good,"Very poorly managed . Management staff was unable to meet the demands of their positions and as a result , structure of the manufacturing site crumbled. Some employees worked hard and put forth effort and dedication into their work and others hardly worked. A typical day included working very hard , and being dedicated to my team . Most days I did other employees work as well. The human resources manager had personal relationships with some employees and those employees received preferential treatment . HR was also very biased and did not perform well in her position as defined by HR guidelines/ Job description. She failed to take action concerning a very serious harassment (by a supervisor) claim even after solid proof was given. It was brushed under the rug."
good,Working at hologic was great. Work was always changing and challenging.  Ibjust feel like they just don't recognize the right personal for thier performance.
good,"Hologic is a good company they have good benefits and they manufacture products that assist women in extending their lives by early cancer detection as well as treatment.  Hologic does not foster an environment that offers movement within the company.  Management is very unapproachable and they do not advocate for their employees.  Its the ""good ole boys club"""
good,"- Manage the Mobile devices such as iphone, ipads, mifi devices, aircards and blackberries"
good,"Working as a contractor--definitely not as good an experience due to no paid holidays, no PTO of any kind.  The company's work and mission are something I can get behind, though, and I hope to go full-time."
good,Innovative technology to help improve women's health.  The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that every day when I execute i am helping someone get the medical care they need.
good,from the moment i came in this place i have learned a lot more about my job. My co-workers are great. the hardest part of my work is that i am always thinking about my patient and i want him to have the best result of here. the most enjoyable part of work is when i find something new during my work if it is an experience or it is something about new pathology.
good,"1.  a typical day as a temp is not usually stressful, but it was odd. I'd have a queue where I'd be assigned various tasks. Most could take an hour or less, but choosing which tasks to do first was sometimes the hardest part as tasks could pile up unpredictably."
good,"My typical day at work would be to assemble breast cancer products on a assembly line. I learned awareness about breast cancer and the good the company was doing to try and identify early stages of breast cancer. It was a lively environment. My co workers were decent people but you had some people that didn't understand or try to learn the value of their position about saving lives. The hardest part of the job was being specific in details in which product had to be assembled. you couldn't just add pieces of just assemble unnecessary parts that didn't belong. you needed very strong attention to detail. The most enjoyable part of the job that it was a very laid back environment even though you had a quota to reach at a specific time which was never impossible to reach as long as you were dedicated, focused and can follow directions."
good,I enjoyed my time working there I just wish that there wasn’t a discrepancy about how they felt about the difference between direct and indirect labor force
good,"Good Company Good people, I was working in Massachusetts and the rumors are true the people out there are the rudest you will ever meet.  Pretty country thou."
good,"Its a great company.I would like to work there again. They have a great work culture.Their products are really great."
good,Challenging but rewarding in numerous ways. I enjoyed assembling and final testing of medical diagnostic machines. I learned to work with others in goal driven environment. We worked to obtain a common goal by providing a good quality products. Management held the team accountable for the goals. Really enjoyed working there because the coworkers and fair management / leadership.
good,Hologic is a great company to work for and a part.  Their many products have a outstanding appreciation with the customers all over the globe. I was a great venture to have work for Hologic.
good,"Non è mai passato giorno lavorativo senza imparare qualcosa di nuovo in uno dei campi: fisico, elettronico, meccanico, informatico, ospedaliero. Colleghi molto disponibili e ben preparati in ogni aspetto sia intra che extra lavorativo."
good,Employees were treated well.  I enjoyed my coworkers.  Worked very independently under supervision.
good,My work day at Hologic was to set the line up for the nightly production. Over look a group of 10 to 25 people for production. The night shift was started and ran by me. i also trained each person on numerous jobs. There was nothing hard about the job because i love a challenge! The most enjoyable part of the job was making sure our product was produced the right way so rhey could be used to help saves lives.
good,"Experience:"
good,Fosters growth and creativity. Treats employees well. Learned many new skills.
good,"Not enough compensation or promotions - there is no incentive to work hard because you will not get a performance review based on your work. That being said, someone who works hard like me gets taken advantage of. Corporate too far away and doesn't care about employees."
good,"I have been at the company for a long time and the best part are the people I routinely worked with (including my team) and the products we produce that save people's lives. "
good,"Great people to work with and work for, supervisors do not micromanaged but rather encourage you to perform at higher level. Wonderful products to make and build with a worth cause of improving women health and combating cancer. Thy also practice safe manufacturing environment and good life work/life balance."
good,Good place to begin your career. Many changes withing the organization set up which does not allow to carry out long term projects.
good,I worked at Hologic early 2000's and it was a awesome place but after reading the reviews it makes me sad to see so many negative comments about a place I used to work at. Things change and so do people a great place to work is a snap-shot in time; the right people and right management apparently something here has changed drastically.
good,"Great company. Most people are hardworking and caring individuals."
good,Hologic is a company that treats employees fairly. Provide ample benefits and pay.
good,"Good people, small business environment, lots to learn. Pay was a little low for me, but it was an odd situation (internship, basically)."
good,"Ho avuto la possibilità di crescere professionalmente e di maturare esperienza a livello internazionale.  Una società importante, anche se di nicchia, con dei prodotti di alta qualità."
good,"Amazing people in this organization across all levels. Enjoy working for Hologic. It's a fast paced work environment, yet fun! The people at all levels make it a greater place to work."
good,Hologic as a whole is a good Company. But as for the managers there is some things are best not said. I have been here for quite some time and change is needed.
good,"Pretty mellow work place, doesn't seem to be micro management going on.  Most people here seem to work hard and are really smart.  There are a ton of temporary employees.  Managers in my department are understanding, but work is the priority.  Not many department related events/functions though.  There is a food cube people will bring snacks or breakfast to every now and then, that's about it."
good,"Travel to different locations and work with different service engineers on installations, PM's and Repairs of different Imaging products. Responsible for scheduling Travel, Lodging, transportation and On the Job service connections."
good,Company is very forward thinking and easy going.  There is a great work life balance and they encourage you to be as creative as possible which gives the employee a lot of freedom.  However the only downfall is that they do not pay as good as their competitors.
good,"Good Job security and management is fine to deal with, the work is often cool, involves a lot of travel, there are no strict deadlines for any part of the job, no big pressure involved."
good,A typical day at work begins with looking at the daily job report and planning accordingly for the day. Very busy environment especially during the final week of the Fiscal Month. Picked up at a whole lot of experiences from this company from Lean Manufacturing to Interpersonal and Leadership skills. The most enjoyable moments are the summer and holiday gatherings where all employees including management have a time together mostly eating and interacting and don't have to worry about work.
good,"what I learned:  The medical device industry is heavily regulated, the quality system ISO13485, cGMP, CFR21 were quite different than those of other industries I worked in.  I am happy to have had that opportunity."
good,Constant sustaing work being done and not new product development.
good,I learnt a lot about how to work on assembly line and the management was good and the work place was safe and the hardest part was re-working and i enjoyed the assemble
good,"Culture has been headed downhill as of lately, but overall the company is strong, mission is followed, and growth/ development is a focus. Benefits have improved significantly in the last 2 years or so. The divisional structure can be viewed as more of a hindrance than a help, and a more centralized operational structure could be a benefit as the company continues to grow."
good,"Overall I found everyone to be very welcoming and helpful, everyone from marketing, to finance, to engineering intermingled. People were always willing to share knowledge and experience. However, on the side of general management, the upper echelons seemed unaware of the needs of their workers, and there was a greater focus on short term growth, instead of employee well being and product development."
good,"Unlike any organization I have been part of, Hologic's employees are among the most passionate. They live and breather the mission of not allowing one woman to be without the benefits of proper breast screening."
good,"Clean environment, well controlled. Requires you wear lab coat, latex gloves and hair bonnet. Cool place to work for and most employees are friendly. Employee recognition a plus."
good,Overall I think Hologic is a great place to work for. They take care of their employees. They taught me to work smarter not harder. I enjoyed working there because of the people and the products that saves women's lives.
good,"Company to Marlborough Ma and out sourced manufacturing to Mexico .Management was dramatically changed in 2015 and 2016"
good,"Receive to stock incoming manufactured components"
good,I answered calls and emails related to the product and the customers orders. I did data entry on orders for customers via email and fax.
good,San Diego location is in transition. Optimistic about new management & strategic direction.
good,Travel as an applications specialist weekly. Work with radiologists and technologists. Demonstrate and train.
good,Innovative company with great compensation package and casual and friendly place to work. Flexibility with start time and end time. able to work from home occasionally.
good,"Great place to work but preferential treatment given to single moms over the older employees with either no kids or grown up kids."
good,"Good company if you are in the right division.  Great people, hard workers.  Culture is corporate, but not stuffy.  "
good,Exposed to numerous organisms and a variety of processes. Excellent company for knowledge/experience with different machines and techniques.
good,I worked as a field engineer for this great company. I highly recommend this company to anyone looking for work as a medical field engineer. This company offers a great support network for their engineers and they are truly focused on customer satisfaction.
good,Fantastic group of people and the company has great value. Good work/family balance. Problem is they bring in mostly temps and it takes well over a year to get hired.
good,"Monitor dailey activities wihtin the A/P department, ensuring all deadlines are met. "
good,"The hours are pretty flexible as long as you put in your 8 hours and complete your work.  The management is good about showing appreciation through events, lunches, and verbally.  Employees are encouraged to contribute with suggestions for improvements and those suggestions are taken into consideration.  "
good,The work experience really depends on the team you are working with. I had the opportunity to work with a very supportive and passionate team who cares deeply about the team and department goals. It is great to have upper management who understands the difficulties of particular projects and assign additional support where necessary to help complete our tasks.
good,"Overall, work experience was very positive. However, some middle managers stayed in place far too long, so there was little opportunity for advancement."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Hologic, it is a wonderful company, wonderful purpose, wonderful people.  I left for a different opportunity - one that was in a different field."
good,"A lot of work to do. Mostly use C# in Santa Clara location. People were pretty friendly and easy-going. The salary was not bad. "
good,"Overall fast-paced, career oriented, customer driven work environment.  Cutting edge technology."
good,the corporate structure was well maintained.  My direct bosses still tried to keep the little mom/pop shop environment going.  It was a great company to work for and they allowed me to grow and learn.
good,"Great educational opportunities, Feeling of accomplishment everyday through service of equipment helping save the lives of many women through mammography."
good,"After working in restaurants, film sets, classrooms and on the security beat, I finally got a job at an office.  My team made me feel right at home and I thoroughly enjoyed the collaborative efforts of the team."
good,"Hologic was a terrific company to work for and I would've still been there, but unfortunately they went through a transitional period and the entire company changed."
good,"I handled all the export shipping documents and scheduling outbound shipments for system shipments to dealers and direct customers worldwide with various freight forwarders. I multi-task and have an impeccable attention to detail.The hardest part of my job was at the end of quarters when international shipments were added on the last two days and I was unable to schedule various freight forwarders to come in to pickup these shipments."
good,"It's a fun place to work in. but, there are some people that wants you to leave the company. such as Production Leads from 1st shift to 2nd shifts."
