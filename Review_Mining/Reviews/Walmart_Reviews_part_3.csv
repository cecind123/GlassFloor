rating,review
bad,"No the best but not the worse. It's a busy place, not a lot of attention is given to employees as individuals. I like the employee discount."
bad,"Most of management acts like immature children. they hold non work related grudges and don't appreciate their associates.The pay system is very unbalanced and unfair. They make things sound much greater than they are. all the rules are worded to bend any way management wants them to. Management doesn't care about scheduling needs and only care about the customer if they believe the customer will call corporate. in the end management makes this company one of the worst i have ever worked for turning a retail establishment that's purpose is to help people have a low cost and friendly shopping experience into a high school drama fest; filled with bullies, cliques, and power hungry monsters."
bad,"Wal Mart's an alright place to work if you need a job or are still in school."
bad,"busy days, learned to work in fast paced envirorment, some management helpful, co-workers nice and helpful, the hardest part of the job was the slow days, i enjoyed the customers the most"
bad,I was working full time overnight while being a full time student in college. Wal-Mart wasn't very considerate to the fact that I had class soon after work. It was days where I stayed over until 10 o'clock am when my shift ended at 7 o'clock am. I was physically assaulted on the job multiple times and only one manager attempted to try and Fox the problem. The manager that made my schedule refused to give me days off for drill weekend in the Military. The managers talked so badly about other associates like high school students. They often tormented associates until they quit. They didn't abide by the guidelines and over worked you. It's a terrible place to work but the money was great.
bad,"Walmart is a job for someone who is  fresh out of high school and not trying to be there long term, it's a good beginer job. As a manager instead of doing my manager duties I'm doing freight."
bad,Walmart can be a good work environments but can get bad if the management team changes constantly. Some managers don't care about the jobs.
bad,"Walmart management team is so corrupt and will use you. no sympathy and take no days off either. even if a family member dies, you better show up. no excuses because they hire managers with no heart, no back bone and no soul. i was the most humble, hardworking employee at my walmart night shift job. unless you got connections, you are nothing but a pawn"
bad,"Wal-Mart has a reputation for low prices. This Wal-Mart just doesn't meet the standards. Management is horrible at customer service, cashiers are rude, CSM (cutsomer service managers) are always running around doing absolutely nothing. Overall, horrible store."
bad,"they over work and underpay, never again will i work for walmart! most of the employee's are lazy and management is too, and the customers are the worst!"
bad,"Over worked"
bad,"the job has little pay but your requirements was over the top, managers were inappropriate when it came to voicing there concerns,flexibility was not considered even when employees brought it up as a concern"
bad,"The training if fair, incentives are fair, salary is fair, communications can be an issue, co workers are seriously hard working people, the people are everyday people usually with a smile, but many sad lately"
bad,"Moving through the ranks starting as an electronics employee then onward and upward to loss prevention was a learning experience. My co-workers and the customers greatly appreciated my knowledge of everything in the electronics department and more so during my stint in LP as I knew how to secure the merchandise and having a passion for electronics I actually cared about the job. Management at my store was very lackluster and standoffish to be honest, as a military man their leadership was quite poor."
bad,"I do not have anything to say about this work environment that my overall rating above doesn't already state, as well as my pros and cons."
bad,"it just wasn't a good place to work. nobody did their work, always playing and goofing around. management was slow to help you with requests"
bad,"Floor associates are treated poorly; therefore, customers aerated poorly. Management is inexperienced. Most floor associates and stockers are just hard working people trying to get by as best they can."
bad,The managers are rude and not helpful. Work environment very stressful. Not at all a fun place to work. They demand way too much from one worker. The managers show favoritism.
bad,i personally feel like working for Walmart is kind of like being in high school with all the rumors and well as people not respecting you .
bad,"A typical day consisted of scanning and bagging items, collecting money, and returning change."
bad,I only worked at this location for a month. The management was not involved with the employees and most of the employees were not very friendly. The training for the job was not thorough and I felt very under educated about the job and location.
bad,"High Expectations with low pay and sub-par management. They showed favorites and they already knew who was going to be promoted so if you weren't high on the totem pole, you didn't get promoted."
bad,I held many entry level positions within the company. Not a bad place for a teen or person just getting out on their own to work. For an adult with a family and many bills its not t he right place to handle all those responsibilities.
bad,"Walmart is a worse place go work than it is to shop. Management is a joke and will contradict themselves every other sentence out of their mouth. They expect you to do the work of 3 people and then threaten to ""coach"" you if it doesnt get done."
bad,"Focus always was on ringing as fast as you can, and while your main goal should be providing a positive shopping experience, you were told by management to limit guest contact in order to meet ringing #'s.  Management very overworked and understaffed, with most being frustrated and slow moving when help was needed."
bad,Typical day at wal-mart  is stock and the zone the whole area where you work so it look appealing to customer and then provide customer services
bad,"Did not liked working here due to the fact that Management kept the upbeat attitude and culture the Store's slogan makes us think."
bad,"Una gran empresa para desarrollar una carrera, con grandes retos, personales y laborales, magnifica enseñanza en todo los aspectos, visión de vida en forma prolongada"
bad,I stock shelves and ensure the products are on the shelves for the customers. I may have to go to the back to see if we have any of the products for customers.
bad,"Go into work at 4 pm clear out back room and prep for unloading the truck alot of the time this until 9 or 10 pm to finish,  After pull fright to sails floor for the night crew to stock. Help stock until 1 am when the shift ends."
bad,Did not like working here over nights. Stayed busy all night tho.
bad,This job sucks. The Managers do not care about anyone else but themselves. The store also has rats and they do not take care of the food that is being placed out on the sales floor.
bad,It was a job.  I couldn't count on my schedule and had very eratic hours.  The company saves on their budget by cutting hours of minimum wage workers.
bad,"A day here is about enough to make you think twice. I worked for walmart for about nine months and all I can say is that they made it pretty clear you were replacable and family is not what comes first. Managment is terrible, the hours are unreasonable, and the work isnt worth the pay. Easiest part of the job is your hour lunch, and the hardest part is being treated very poorly for being anything lower than a manager"
bad,Customers was kind there sometimes I learned different things management was ok my co workers was great the hardest part of my job was not being appreciated and I enjoyed when the customers acknowledge your hard work.
bad,"A typical day at work is being frustrated all day. I have learned not to trust anyone, Most of the co-workers are really nice, but then you have the ""clicks"" whom I stay away from. Not enough employees--well that is because it is not a great place to work. The most enjoyable part of the day is leaving at the end of the shift."
bad,"It was at first, a great place to work at!  things were great and most fun to work at!  Management went down quite a bit, and got not so great to look at.  I do my best to figure out others best look out to review at this place."
bad,managemtnt was schechy never offered help i did not enjoy the and nor did any one else they never helped anyone out
bad,"Fast paced work environment in constant change where multi-tasking and ability to adapt are necessary.Employees are great people and consciencious,caring individuals.The many tasks assigned have unrealistic time completions or order of importance"
bad,"Just a terrible place to work, if you do get hired there be prepared to quit in a month or so"
bad,I didn't like this job at all and it was very hard to work here. During the time I worked there I would go in for 8 hour shifts and stand on my feet the whole time behind a cash register and when I didnt have a customer I would be standing at the end of my register asking people to check out. I learned how to work a register better and how to do returns. I learned that all customers are not the same and I just have to stay calm and do my job. I didn't really like my managers and they were very rude and just didn't care whether you were sick or not feeling well. The co workers were the best though. I loved being around them and talking to them. They were all friendly and outgoing. The hardest part of this job was the managers being rude and the customers yelling at you and getting mad because of a communication problem.
bad,"A typical day at work was being asked to punch in early for work then being told i have to take a longer lunch break to get rid of any overtime. What I learned was management hated to give overtime. Management was a joke, because no-matter what I did for them, I couldn't keep my overtime, I always had to take a 90 to 120 minute lunch break. Some of my co-workers were fun to work with but others weren't. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with getting no help from my supervisor, and fighting to get it. The most enjoyable part of the job was nothing."
bad,"Not happy with this place, associates and managment dont apreccite all you put in a day's work in this place.."
bad,"greet customers and rang up sales."
bad,"I experienced a great deal of harassment, discrimination and retaliation for reporting these incidents. I worked as a manager for more than a year, and found that I got no support from the systems designed to help associates with work related problems.They do not pay associates the wages they deserve, and take advantage of the cross training practices.  Walmart saves millions, if not billions of dollars on employee cost, by over-working associates, and under paying them. The policy enforcement systems do not leave room for flexibility, and fairness to associates."
bad,"The hours were crazy and did not take in consideration of home life or family. One could not work overtime without store managers approval. The stress level at this company is considered in my opinion, unbelievable. Bosses  very seldom, if every recognize the work their worker have done or do for them. If you do work over forty hours you have to take that time off by some other means. As for the co-worker I got along with most of them and consider them my friends and I have continued those friendship after leaving this company."
bad,"the job was good at first until they brought in new managers that werent trained and i got fired for absolutely nothing. they like to do that to alot of people"
bad,"Daily activities included, but where not limited to assisting customers, cashing out customers purchases, daily inventory, maintaining a clean and organized department and handling fishing and hunting permits for the state of Florida."
bad,"The job was easy and didnt take much to understand the guildlines to complete the task. On the other hand, the management team was not in tuned with the associates or explained do's or dont's of the store in order to stay in the green with the company.."
bad,"I worked here for over five years and no one even cared that I had put in my two weeks notice. Employees are under paid,  under appreciated, and OVER worked."
bad,"A typical day at work consist of zoning all departments, stockin shelfs . I learned how to set Mods , use the cash register. Managment was very rude but it depends what store you work at and how much experience they have working as a manager . All of my co-workers were team players . We enjoyed working together . To be honest the hardest part of my job was dealing with Management.  The most enjoyable part of my job was dealing with customers, building a friendly relationship with them and having the opportunity to meet many new people and different characters."
bad,"Verry different, kind of environment, not really flexible like they say. and hostile working environment."
bad,Worked there for almost 3 three years and hated every minute of it. 3 years I wish i could get back.
bad,The undisciplined and unprofessional approach of the upper management made day to day goal accomplishment difficult. Over all it is a very reactive environment which is extremely counter productive in a retail work place which deals with similar peaks and valleys from year to year. The proactive measures to which would allow efficient operation are not in place and when alternate methods are presented it is met with great resistance. experienced
bad,This started as a great place to work. I feel as if management is very unprofessional and it is very unorganized. The customers are what keeps me going while I am at work. It is a fast-pace job working on the front-end of the store. I am thankful that they work with my schooling while still allowing me to work there.
bad,"I had SO MANY BOSSES. It took me literal months to figure out which manager I was meant to obey when they would all give me directions. Then they would swith up and I'd have to figure it out again. They had unrealistic goals for us and grossly overestimated my ability to juggle tasks. "
bad,"Assist customers in retrieving items, giving information on technology, helping items into customers' cars. "
bad,Working at Walmart is easy if you just do your job. a lot of the managers like to favorite others and they don't pay their employees enough to do most of the work there.
bad,"Walmart only cares about walmart, not it's employees. I gave thirteen years of my life to walmart and they left me high and dry."
bad,"ASM position at wal mart is the tough."
bad,"desde que ingresas a la empresa, es algo pesado cuando llegas con  tu jefe inmediato, el trato con mis compañero era bueno con ninguno tuve problemas, me encantaba la atencion de los clientes y lo amable que pueden ser algunos, habia dias pensados como lo eran los dias de quincena, festivos, navidad."
bad,This place is like a slave master. They break your back for very little pay. It seems the only way you advance is if you are friends with a manager. i could say a lot more but i was taught if you dont have anything good to say keep it to your self.
bad,"I'd have to say this time around, Walmart has been kind of respectful, yet they still expect you to run the place on your own, the managers at least pitch in when it gets desperate.they still pull you up front if they need people, instead of hiring cashiers, explains why no one is ever on the sales floor, and they give nothing for benefits, now than they ever did...Individually, Walmart isn't as bad as people say, but the corporation itself needs to take ten steps backwards to make it right, because at this rate, they will be closed in 10 years because no one wants to deal with them"
bad,Was told I was part time only they worked me  full time with no benefits. When I was eight months pregnant I had three pallets collapse on me and nothing was done about it had to work my entire area by myself with no help and was timed for it.
bad,The most enjoyable part of the day is helping customers and seeing different people on a daily basis. The job is real easy but don't pay enough to its employees. Co-workers are all nice to be around and help you get through the day whether you know them or not. The hardest part of the job is not getting promoted when you put in for it and have been given the run-around or no answer when you have done what you were told needed to be done in order to begin a career.
bad,"Better of finding another job."
bad,"This would not be the desired place for employment due to poor business ethics. The employees of this company are not always treated with the respect and dignity that they deserve for working hard to keep this organization operating. Working together as a team makes the job fun to work for them, but this company has a history of favoring the wrong associates for promotions."
bad,The hardest part of the day is when customer throw stuff at you and cuss you out for something you didn't do.
bad,"they will hire you as part time and cram you with full time hours as to not pay you benefits also they had me fill peoples prescriptions when I do not have a degree to do so, also they did not train me at really at all I was with someone for the first 2 days then I was on my own for the next 3 months till I quit."
bad,The management team will pull you from any task you have if they have new direction come down. It is hard to get a set schedule that will give you a personal life
bad,"Takes skills and expertise to make it at Walmart. I made it through over 60 people who have come and gone since I worked there, I made it."
bad,"My time with Wal-Mart was horrible. While the management does nothing more than boss people around without the smallest thought of helping their employees, the associates are treated unfairly and with the most disrespect possible. The management will do what it takes to help those they like. They do play favorites and will take away every opportunity possible for you to move up if they do not like you."
bad,"Typical day, I would start off work with a late night meeting with other employees of the store. Was a complete waste of time, never anything that benefited me out of it.Then i would go to my cooler. Trash always every where, the cooler would be so full of new freight would take me about 20-30 mins just to position things where i can work. I was usually by my self and scheduled to do around 15+ hrs of work by my self  within a 8 hr shift. If i did get help they would send some one over who did not want to be in the cooler, and knew nothing of the location. Was more effort in to babysitting because if they did it wrong i got in trouble for it.Our store was a regular store and upgraded to a super center with out upgrading our storage area, was impossible to work from the back so we had to bring freight to the floor. This is how i was trained. I was made to do other peoples work as well such as pulling picks and binning even though it was not my position and expected to do all this and train who ever was with me that night. Management was impossible to deal with, and our store manager never saw my points and concerns. My co-workers well we all worked in the same store and every area had its own problems. We generally got along. Some disliked my area causing negative outlook on me.Hardest part of the job, being pushed to hard to get little credit, to get put down for two years, 0 respect from managers, to work hard to never feel achieved or good about myself.Enjoyable part my days off, to be fired."
bad,Walmart under pays all staff and treats you like garbage. The show no gratitude for the hard work you have given them.
bad,"Bad managent, Bad opportunities, No security, No pay, Better than Mcdonanlds"
bad,I have been with the company over six years and in that short time it has drastically changed. No longer does associates and families matter. All that they care about is their bottom line. The atmosphere has become so congested that it is no longer a great place to work.
bad,"The managers don't really care about their employees.  I was pregnant and they let me go before i went on maternity leave just so they wouldn't pay for it.  They won't let you have any overtime, and if your getting close to 40 hours, they make you go home."
bad,"It was interesting working behind the scenes of a complete remodel. Learned to install shelves , and follow written instructions on how items were to be arraigned"
bad,my typical work day is i go in unload two trucks for four hours. i go to lunch for an hour and then pull out the freight to the sells floor. then we clean up and sometimes stock or do picks.
bad,the pay sucks there is no advancement the management would rather ignore the problems than fix them to the point they have workers getting hurt and attempt to fire them until the worker pulls a lawsuit on them.
bad,Working for Walmart has been an experience. You have to deal with all  types of people in person. You have to stand for long periods of time and trying to get an advancement in career is tough They only consider older people for the job
bad,did not like this co. was with them for almost 10 years.I learned the telzon Co workers where alright hardest part of the job was meeting there times The most enjoyable part of the job was when I was asked to do remodels at other store.
bad,"Through my many years at walmart I have seen it all, I have witnessed managers throwing associated under the bus to save their own butt. I have watched people get a write up for not being able to do obscene amounts of work. people getting write ups because walmart changed their schedule 2 days out causing that person to have a no call no show resulting in a write up. I have told management that there was only one person scheduled for the whole day when normally there is around 6 and of course they refuse to do change it 3 weeks out or even call anyone in resulting in us being behind and get a talking to about how we need to handle the work. just one more example of how bad this company is, our pervious store manager would make people take a week off of work rather then send them to the doctor. Now I'm not sure if this is isolated events or all walmarts are this bad, all i no is i want out please help."
bad,"the worst places to work in. this company does not give over time, better pay(unless you stay 20 or more years), no benefits until a year later. sucks."
bad,"Usually short-staffed. Managers at my location micro-managed just to get a bigger bonus. Yelled at workers in front of customers, very unprofessional. Have to work there for 2 YEARS in order to get healthcare as a part-time professional. Did not want to adjust my schedule for school. HORRIBLE work/life balance. If you work here, do not try to stay for long, find another job as soon as possible."
bad,"A typical day of work started with unloading a truck which was generally bigger than the truck actually stated it was, followed by moving everything onto the floor. Not a particularly difficult job, but the managers at the location I worked at were difficult to work with, and were always pushing for more. My co-workers were pretty slow and lazy, and felt like they were not being compensated enough to work how they did. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the headaches that the managers would give, and the fact that I would have to rely on ""teammates"" who would not work as hard as myself. I really did not enjoy much about the job other than some of the people were, while lazy, still quite funny."
bad,I worked for walmart for over a year and I would not go back or recommend it for anyone.  The company itself does not care for its employees.  Each walmart is ran differently and promotion is based on favoritism.  Every employee is expendable and being fired is very easy.
bad,management left a lot to be desired.  cleanliness in the store is not up to par.
bad,"department manager, bad hours, lack of management, worked bad hours and was not compensated well"
bad,Not motivated to care about employees. viewed employees as a commodity.  I DID WORK WITH GOOD PEOPLE THAT WERE WORTH MORE THAN THEY RECEIVED.
bad,"You needed to be a self motivator and starter in this job.  I learned fast and well.  The Doctors hold a high level of teaching here, they are the ones that taught me what I know."
bad,great place to work but the pay is low but id do it all over again
bad,"I did not learn anything new about the positive side of big box retail. This massive, multi- trillion dollar company no longer executes Sam Walton's purpose, goals or vision for his company. The management teams never know what each is doing at any given time on any given shift. They treat their employees with extreme disrespect and remind them consistently of how disposable they are. Wal-Mart has over- expanded in the last 15 years, does not offer full time employment to their tenured employees unless they are lucky enough to be given the opportunity to bow to the scurge of salaried status (a.k.a indentured servitude -70 hour work weeks, 44 hours pay), promotions are given on personal opinion or friendships and not the value of work produced by the individual employee and merit raises or cost of living raises are NEVER given. Overall, McDonald's treats their employees better. At least they offer benefits at most fast food places and don't take 60% of your pay. My most enjoyable part of the job was helping others but on the flip side the worst part was watching the eyes of the employees as they worked for pennies on the dollar while trying to support their families on minimum wage plus $.50. My co- workers and I were very tightly knit and I am often asked when I will come back to be their CSM. I almost weep to tell them the same thing each time, ""I'd rather chew my own arms off then come back here. You should look for another job. I'll let you know if I hear or find anything."" Totally irresponsible company and not at all fair to their employees. Its like a slap in the face when"
bad,"Constantly busy"
bad,"This was an unorganized place of business, under staffed and under paid."
bad,"I worked the cash register,stocked front end displays,and preformed customer service.There was too many supervisors,not a friendly place to be!"
bad,"Opening of bakery @ 4am preparing all fresh bread for the morning bake ,taking cake orders and greeting customers"
bad,"I started in the Dairy PT and have been in the Pharmacy for about 3 years now.  A typical day would be composed of filling perscriptions, inputing them into connexus, doing any problems solving, and the tasco out the prescription out to the patient and then sold.  "
bad,this Is a job for a person with a family and bills. Low paying but do have room for advancement
bad,"I deal with at least 200 different customers everyday,the part i like the most is interacting with customers. My coworkers were pretty fair when they got to know me. I like to work at my work place and leave making friends to free time lie outside of work.The hardest part of my job was dealing with the rude customers that always threaten me with police on duty and nothing was done about it."
bad,"Very low pay for what you're expected to do and put up with. Bad management, bad pay, horrible customers."
bad,"Learned to work on my own without sufficient guidance."
bad,"ring up customers"
bad,Remove retail items set up new racks replace items. Learned how to read plan o grams set ups. Management not so great. Met lots of new people. Hardest was not being excepted at the end to be an associate. Enjoyed most everything else.
bad,The co workers  were not team players.   The most enjoyable part of the job was that I learned different things as I was able to move from each department.The management was not so helpful.A typical day was putting merchandise back where it belonged and zoning.
bad,"just preformed basic duties as a cashier. you work with people of all inds, cultures and backgrounds, you just have to be a people person to preform this roll. is a very stressful job and face pace durning peek hours."
bad,"do not work there, it is a coal mine business plan. You are trash and they throw you like so. They will take full advantage of their hard workers, and see to it they exhaust you, and leave you with nothing to show for it."
bad,"Loads of work and no recognition. Uncomfortable working environment due to the constant pointing out of mistakes from the supervisors. Being blamed for what's not my fault, and forced to correct it in orderly fashion and to complete my assigned tasks before my shift ends."
bad,The hours might be steady but they don't like paying overtime. And they treat you like a little kid. The management sucks. They only care about themselves.
bad,enjoyed the people i worked with. everything was at a fast pase. management was unfair and played favorites.
bad,"os dias de trabalho não eram muito bons a chefia e a gerência eram horríveis, porém os colegas de setor eram divertidos e companheiros."
bad,it make dog food from raw meats and veg for the dogs i dont interst that position
bad,"they cant figure out how to properly staff only one department of walmart the deli there is never enough staff in that department. promise advancement but its almost impossible to aquire full time. they have set procedures for illness... a whole big hubub with doctors notes and paper work and bull****.. and after following all the steps in thei procedures i somehow dont get schedualled at all without any notice, communication nothing, bull"
bad,"Empresa que espera do profissional cerca de 90% de dedicação ao seu trabalho, para as metas sejam atingidas e que engaje também seus colegas para que todos se unam para atingir todos os objetivos."
bad,The only reason I enjoyed WalMart was because they worked around my school schedule. I felt like my job was always on the line and they could just pick any person off the street to do my job. I never felt like I had any job security. Management was awful.
bad,"Management seems to forget that hourly associates are people and not robots, and Hourly Associates do not care about their jobs or how best to serve their customers."
bad,"My employment at Wal-mart was brief, but at the time I was able to experience the lack of structure within the company. I was never fully aware of who my actual manager was because there were so many. Aside that, whenever I would page for more bags, change or receipt paper, it would sometimes take the managers 10-15 minutes to respond, even though there were so many. By that time, I would have very disgruntled customers."
bad,"Taking care of customers, helping each other to do jobs.  How different people are.  Management does not communicate with each other.  My co-workers are great to work with.  Hardest part of the job is dealing with disgruntled or rude customers.  You do your best to help them.  Having a good time with my co-workers."
bad,"No training unless you ask, I learned everything myself. Hired from an overnight remodel where humans were treated like animals to stock the freezer, still treated the same. Your life accomplishments do not matter to management, as you rely on career advancement through their WIRE computer network system. You get thrown in random departments to attack 3-5 pallets per night, every night, alone. Management will try to frustrate you. Appreciate all the teammate co-workers I met, but I will not work overnight for Walmart ever again."
bad,"Typical day includes customer service, financial decisions, scheduling, reviewing company policies, new employee orientation, training, and following company policies and procedures."
bad,"Working at walmart was at first, very exciting but not only were some of the employees horrible co workers but the management team wasn't very good either they had their favorites and treated some of the staff as if they were beneath others that were also employed by them."
bad,"I would not recommend walmart to anyone.  They only care about coverage and ensuring the store looks good.  When you need help they wont give you any, but if you do not need help they give you help and then want you to leave early to save payroll.  If anything happens like an emergency they threaten your job.  It really is a crummy company to work for.  It took me 4 years to break the $10 mark.  Never again."
bad,"I learn to handle cash at the cash register as a cashier. Over-night stocking,modular display and floor plans, filling up claim stub for damage or stolen goods"
bad,The hardest part of the job is lifting. Everything weighs more than fifty pounds.
bad,"Job was very demanding physically"
bad,I was not impressed with Wal-Mart's expectations of their assistant managers and how they expected me to treat the hourly associates working in the store.
bad,My experience with this work place was not a good one. One hand doesn't know what the other is doing and it all falls to the person on bottom.
bad,I held a number of positions with Walmart and gained a wide variety of experience in a retail and warehouse setting.
bad,"For the past few years Walmart as a company has decided to lower the overall number of employees resulting in more work foisted onto fewer and fewer people. Other problems pile up such as mismanaged schedules, being called away from your primary tasks to go do non-related tasks, and having to cover multiple departments."
bad,"this job is easy, but the company treats there employees like poo"
bad,"A typical day at work is clock in go to my section clean up from the shift before me and start. running the register, filling orders, writing orders, customer service, stocking and cleaning. I learned to keep to myself and do my job. The management look down on you and the co-workers need gossip. The hardest part of the job was going to it every day. The most enjoyable part was going home."
bad,Not recommended for anyone - toxic environment. The district manager sabotages the store manager and there is not a single employee who is happy working there now.
bad,I worked at Walmart for approx. 5 months and in that period one employee in particular was caught spreading rumors about others (including customers and managers) and was reported for this without consequence or reprimand. Do not work here if you want a drama-free environment. 
bad,"What made this job enjoyable for me was my co-workers, immediate supervisor and and customers."
bad,Labor intensive job. It was all about being productive in merchandising and selling the products as fast as possible.
bad,"It is an alright place to work. It doesn't really offer much and no matter how hard you work it never gets you anywhere. If you are a female you can get interviewed for a higher position, but only have a change if everyone else interviewed for that position is a female as well."
bad,"I'm not sure about other Walmart branches but the one I worked at well...I hated it very much. No communication, poor management, and overall I was doing tasks that was not in my job description, and doing jobs that employees actually hired under that description, say cashier, was being paid more for. They boost family values but I really wasn't seeing it, no insurance at the time, (course now they do and I hear its extravagantly expensive). Others coworkers hated their job and spoke of it often. I only ever met a few people who enjoyed working there. So overall, a poor environment to work in and it served its purpose until I could trade up for another job. "
bad,Customer service played a very important role in my job at Walmart.
bad,Enough said...its a job...no work life balance...low pay....tons of work....not caring about family issue like they say
bad,Worked as an overnight stocker and did no get acknowldged for the job I was doing. There was no atmoshere for growing with the biggest company i the world. Wanted associates to come in and do job without ever complaining or asking questions.
bad,"Answer customer questions "
bad,I learned a lot working here but I will not miss the poor communication between management which makes our jobs nearly impossible to complete.
bad,"A empresa força a trabalhar sem pagar hora extra."
bad,"I liked being a cashier and helping customers at the check out lines in Customer Service, Layaway, and cash register upfront.  I stayed busy for the most part.  I got along with most of my co-workers and management.  The hardest parts of the job was dealing with rude customers, not being backed on some choices by manangement, lack of concern when it comes to shoplifting, constant rules changing."
bad,The job was slow as well as no advancement abilities. lots of wasted time as well as poor scheduling and jobs were poorly assigned.
bad,"Work was stressful."
bad,"Walmart was unfair, unexciting, and very stressful, with bad and trashy customers. "
bad,"9 hours shifts on the weekend followed by 4-5 shifts a week for a grade 11 student, it was too much."
bad,Was fired cause i managed to upset a manager. Your expected to do more than what your job entitles. will never work for them again
bad,the best part about walmart were the people.. like the people i made friends with. other than that i particularly didnt like working there
bad,"Worked for the company when Sam Walto was alive,it was nice to work for them then. Now,they get rid of people all the time and take away more and more. If you are not part of the click you are out the door and in all aspects."
bad,Typical day is scanning freight in & out of the bins to and from the sales floor on 3rd shift.
bad,"A typical day at work varies depending on amount of trucks and freight the store receives. A typical work day for a back room associate: to locate the freight in the back, scan out and bring the freight to the floor associates. This job taught me how well a large, corporate store runs and operates. But also, how freight is managed through out a weekly basis. Management was either spot on, or all over the place depending on which managers were on schedule. Most co-workers were great workers, except for the few who did not carry their own work load. The hardest part of the job was the long over night hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new skills from many different co-workers and management."
bad,"horrible manager, work hours suck, the co-workers are rude to customers"
bad,"Anyone who has worked at the Okotoks Walmart Supercenter knows how terrible the management is. Treated with no respect, terrible pay, hours were terrible, just an overall bad job. But I still made the best of it, working well with the people I was surrounded by every day, my co-workers were awesome, and had a decently fun time doing the job that was just terrible."
bad,Wal-Mart is on the very low end of the pay scale. not competitive at all. Also Wal-Mart's upper management has more concern for their quarterly bonus than their employees.
bad,"To sum up Wal-Mart without having to write a book basically, all you need to do is compare it to our government. Full of greed, lies and fake smiles. People constantly stealing, along with workers too like management. Even the in-store lost prevention steal from there. The Morales and self respect of Walmart and its pride died long ago with the original owner Sam Walton. The few people bragging and phrasing the job are the ones content with the bare minimum with life or the lairs of high rank who cut throat to get there."
bad,I enjoyed the customers but did not enjoy certain managers who are very baisis over certain employees.
bad,"A typical day at work sucks, due to the lazy customers we have."
bad,I believe that walmart doesn't offer a flexible enough work schedule. I've been working here for almost half a year and still can't get a solid schedule or be moved to full time; I get less than thirty hours a week.
bad,"A typical day at work, is always short of supplies needed to complete simple task which makes your job more difficult."
bad,"creo que a nivel estructural Sam wallton ideo la forma de evaluar a los trabajadores con las preguntas en la computadora , enteoria yo ya tenia puntos suficientes para dirigir una tienda , en la practica , estaban promocionando a gente que segun sus preferencias estaban por encima de mi pero no segun el analisis computarizado , es decir abia dos estructuras , y la estructura preferente de ellos es la que esta basada en preferencias personales pasandose por debajo la estructura corporacional disenada por el buen samuel , resultado, no me promocionaron ahunque lo merecia , ni me subieron el sueldo , como se devia y para no seguir con eso prefirieron correrme , , illegalmente , pero quien ba a perear con ellos '?"
bad,"Moving 7 tons of freight a night with only sporadic help, made my work abysmal. Management was never satisfied, advancement was very unlikely. I learned to truly despise the corporate world through my year there."
bad,Some managers will bust their behinds to help associates and then you've got the ones who won't bust a grape just hand out orders. The same goes for associates as well. Some are really helpful and others shouldn't even get a check.! Why is it that the hardworkers can't get ahead? The floaters if you will. The ones that do many things throught the whole store. Why aren't they offered full time and benefit packages? you want them to work like they're full time employees but don't want to compensate. I personally think Mr. Walton has turned over in his grave multiple times from watching how hs buisness has been run how hiis employees are treated especially. He was a family man and his employees were like family. This new generation Wal mart is everything but family. You people need to be more reasonable with employees if it werent for them the buisness couldn't run. we do the work. you people push the paper.
bad,go in to work and check if we have any notes on what mods to set that night if nothing special from first shift then i decide on what mods we set. i learned how to lead a group of associates. management lets the lazy associates do as they please and makes the hard workers pick up their slack. the hardest part of the job is making sure everyone is doing their share of the work and not slacking off. The most enjoyable part of the job is when we can all laugh but still get all of our work done.
bad,I didn't like it when a customer was not satisfied. Walmart would try to treat their employees like a big family.
bad,Walmart is a multi-billion dollar corporation that under values all employees that are not in upper corporate management. I have absolutely nothing good to say about Walmart.
bad,"eu gostava, mais com o tempo vi que nao era isso que queria pra mim."
bad,Pay was not enough to support a family if this is the only job worked. co-workers were often lazy but some supervisors worked extremely hard. not enough of the management were on the same page on how to do things or what needed done. helping people was the best part of the job.
bad,"I find that this company has the right track set in place to maximize being productive in retail, but has missed the mark greatly when it comes to the quality of Management needed in order to allow someone to succeed."
bad,"I'd work in the freezer section unloading 4-5 pallets of product alone as we were short staffed. I learned to rotate merchandise according to dates, to move and unload pallets, and assist customers in shopping experience. The hardest part of my job was working alone. The most enjoyable part was the satisfactory feeling of a hard day's work at the end of my shift."
bad,I only worked there because I was a college student and I needed a job.
bad,to them customer is #1 even when customer rips your head off but its still your fault after witnesses say customer was at fault
bad,no one works together and it all about the money not the associates any more
bad,I would NEVER work there again. They dont pay you enough for all the bad encounters you have there!
bad,i started out as an over night stocker within 6 months i became dept mgr over kitchen bath bedding and furniture then after 7yrs i went to dept mgr of electronics then i went to HR as a training coordinador then i worked in receiving
bad,"A typical day at walmart consists of, getting to the jewelry counter around 7:15am and open. Then its a race of time trying to get the load of responsibility I have done, such as getting all the watches stocked, all jewelry stocked, getting showcases stocked and zoned. Then I have boxes of freight to work on, usually around 5 an I have to get these all done before I go on lunch around 11-11:30 if I get one. If these boxes aren't done if these showcases aren't stocked no one else does it, it is my responsibility. After my 30min Lunch I have to work on freight and handle customers, we are usually busy around this time, if im lucky I only get 3-5 boxes of incoming freight because if I get more it becomes stressful. From around 12-1pm I try to get the freight checked in and ring people up at the same time, because I'm also a cashier. At about 1:15pm another associate comes in an she can take over ringing people up so I can do my freight, log it, and get as much out as possible because I can't leave many boxes with the night girl, shes expected to ring people up all night. I work 7am-2pm, no one comes in to help until 1pm an shes treated as a cashier."
bad,"liked the job, but company don't care about employees"
bad,I have been with Walmart for 7 years and most of that time has been at the customer service desk. When working the service desk you are dealing with alot of different customers. So you need the ability to adapt with each new person. You really dont have to have any regard to policeys and rules as they will be thrown out the window the secound a customer starts to get loud. Once that happens they will get what they want and maybe even a gift card for the time.
bad,"Wal-Mart treated there employees with disrespect, you ask questions they get really hateful with you. You need to go to restroom you have to have someone come and ring up people that came through line and sometimes they wouldn't come when they say they do. So I have to leave my area at times just to make it to the restroom. I just had a lot of problems being told to do something by my dept. mang and then get yelled by another manager for doing what I was told to do. That is the reason why I was fired from my job."
bad,Low pay work enviroment is the worst I have ever seen. I do not know how they stay in buisness
bad,good but they expect to much out of one person they expect them to do 5 peoples job with little pay and little chance for advancement unless you suck up to someone
bad,"customers made the job. would break down dairy, meat, and produce trucks. start at 10:00 work until 7. hand held inventory system on perishable wall never gave enough time to rotate (task management program). if the product came ordered, didnt include it on the pull list from back room (rotation). would work 3 departments per nights."
bad,I review them as one of the worst companies i have worked for.
bad,"Its always a new day at walmart, we strive to provide the best customer care as possible."
bad,"I was responsible for freight and binning merchindise. I learned how to work in inventory. The management wasn't great, Except for a few managers. I never felt appreciated for the work I was doing. Some of my coworkers were cool (my friends). The other coworkers always complained and were lazy. the hardest part of the job was not having a life. I worked nights and could hardly ever hang out with family or friends. The only thing I enjoyed while working there was getting a paycheck."
bad,Lack of freedom in your work
bad,my co-workers was fun to work with but management did not care if i got job done or not I liked the people I meet
bad,Not a hard job at all just lots of drama and two faced people. Management was just as bad and the crew. No one wanted to help.
bad,"I have worked for a local Walmart for a total of 10 years, When i first started back in 2003 it was really fun, family oriented, everyone was eager and great to work with. ""Black Friday's"" I looked forward too every year. It use to be where you could go in as a new associate and have everyone and their brother be available to help and train you the ""Walmart"" way."
bad,"Floor associate duties, good place to learn teamwork."
bad,Busy work environment. Learned how to deal with difficult co-workers.
bad,Walmart does not treat their employees right the benifits are not as good as a multi billion dollar company should be. I enjoyed the fellow employees and they did have a few managers that were gold but the over all managers were bad. At least at the granbury and irving store
bad,"A typical day of work included making necessary price changes, merchandising, supervising a team of associates, and ensuring all tasks were done in a timely manner."
bad,"If you're idea of a perfect place of work is working long unappreciated hours for a incompetent management that barely knows how to do the simple things it asks of you such as working the register or meeting customer needs, then indeed walmart is the place for you."
bad,"They treat you like you're nothing to them, expect more work for less pay. They are not concerned about advancement. The managers are not at all friendly and do not show appreciation for their employees."
bad,A typical day would be to stock shoes and clothes. Helping customers and cleaning up.
bad,"They were very rude and comained about productivity, yet always called upon me to everything else inside the store aside from my job. When you use their open door policy they do nothing but turn it around you. Overall walmart is a good place to start out but not to stay longer then a year."
bad,They had a business ethics that was contradictary to any I ever known. Will give full explaination upon request.
bad,"Duties included:Typing and filling prescriptions, in addition to calling insurance companies and doctors offices for authorization and, or verification of pertinent information that was needed. Place and receive orders. Check outdates and do returns. Customer service. Hardest part of the job was the distance I had to travel."
bad,"the job was fine, it was the people i worked with that was the issue. the trucks would come in to be unloaded and the people back in the warehouse part were so slow and got missing every time a truck pulled up. you had a certain amount of time to unload that truck and if you didn't, you would get chewed out and wrote up."
bad,"Walmart is not good with their scheduling, say like you need a second job you can't get one cause they don't have one set shifts..and they don't offer full-time"
bad,"management was all over the place hard to track down my manager, i did not like how they ran the backroom it was always disorganized so hard to unbin things because merchandise was so spread out. They needed to keep it more organized like other parts of the backroom. it was only a job to me. it paid some of the bills."
bad,"Too little money, not enough hours, terrible conditions, no opportunity for advancement, little to no benefits."
bad,lack of communication between employers and employees witch caused much confusion.the compensation was lest then expected
bad,"I worked at walmart for a few years around 2004 and left for better pay. It was hard for me because I loved my job and coworkers. I decided when I moved to another state to go back while I was going to school in hopes of using my degree to advance within the company. Upon my rehire I saw things had changed! They no longer hire full time, but they will work you full time at least for 5 weeks and bump you back down to parttime. This is so they dont have to hire you full time and you will see the process will begin again. Your benefits only begin after a year and it sucks. You dont get your discount card for 90 days. The one positive perk is if you attend APUS (online school) you get 15% off of fees and free books. If your a kid who just needs some money for the summer or something give it try. Adults with real life issues... DO NOT ENTER!!!"
bad,its a job walmart was much better many years ago . all about the money now not the people
bad,"They are so backwards, I honesly have no clue how they have lasted as long as they have, or maybe its just that store."
bad,"Didn't like working there. Management team seemed sexist and prideful. bad hours, bad customers, bad pay."
bad,Never have the right equipment to do the job.
bad,i couldnt find any good job so i took the job til i find a better job. I dont really like the job is all. it is part time job with no benefits.
bad,It was ok. They dont treat you very well. Iwas thank full that i had work
bad,Working at this company was one of the worst jobs I have ever had!
bad,Management are not very friendly people half dont greet the employees they pull you to do work that 8is not described in your duties
bad,"I did not really enjoy my time at walmart once the new management came in. It was impossible to keep hours, unless you could work when you were not available, the pay was awful, and trying to get trained in other departments was a joke."
bad,"enjoyable part is helping customer, none-enjoyable part is the management"
bad,lower level management was compassionate and understanding.
bad,"I enjoyed working at wal-mart but the pay is bad, work enviroment is all stressed. To many managers and not enough workers. Benifts are good if you can afford them. The managers do not care about the"
bad,They barely train you they just throw you to the wolves. It was literally bad it was more like a popularity contest. Nobody wanted to help anyone. They taught us things that just didn't seem right. Like we're not allowed to help a customer off the clock. Some associates take that literally. Once I saw a manager totally ignore a customer who asked him where the mayo was. It was horrible. I'd never work for the glenolden walmart again.
bad,inconsistent management and not enough hours. Their is very little control on workers who have been there for years they do what they want and blame the new guys. not a good place to work at all
bad,"work,clean,sale, dispense,insurance,i learn that its who you know to get promoted,wanted full time position,was turned down,went to store manager did not talk to me,distric refuse to make me full time,have a lot of experience, and can do the job,morale is low,"
bad,management was not so family friendly they only cared about their money and not theor employees!
bad,"from working at walmart i realized and learned how selfish and arrogant most people can be. I never had a typical day, each day was filled with something different some of the co-workers made it an enjoyable experience and i was glad to have learned the sytems used for scanning wirless connections n how to drive a forklift other than that my job wasnt pleasant nor did it come easy"
bad,"At my location we let go of 100 staff members an associates. So although it seems we are functioning with a full staff we are actually short handed. The management staff, knowing we are short handed over work the associates. There are too many members of management giving direction to one associate, to the point they have 10 jobs and only 3 hours left in their shift to complete said jobs.The associate becomes confused as which manager has priority, the associate is held accountable. There are too many memebers of management standing around yelling, instead of teaching and training the associates to better work as a company."
bad,Im only working there because its a job. I dont feel appreciated for the hard wrork I put in on a daily basis.
bad,I hated working there. Not very friendly and not managed well.
bad,"I really liked working there. The only thing that I didn't like was that I was told that I didn't do what I was told buy the Super,until the Manager came and saw exactly that I did what I was told"
bad,"This was THE worst company that I have worked for. Not because of the company, but because of SOME of the management staff. Although my position was an overnight stocker and it could get pretty hectic at times there was nothing difficult about the job. I worked in the dry goods food dept. for the most part, but I worked all over the store as needed. We had a great team and we knew what had to be done, however, no matter how hard we worked, it was never enough and no matter how many trucks came, we always got our freight done. Most of the time, we finished early enough to help out in other areas. Still, it was never enough."
bad,"Wal-Mart is a great company to work for, if you have the right personnel;meaning strong management. The management at the Wal-Mart I previously worked for is a poorly managed store, who lack interpersonal, communication, and managerial skills."
bad,Absolutely most awful place to work for in this entire town. The cashier are left to take the blame for every mess up in the entire store. There are also so many managers there is no way to keep straight how you are supposed to do something. They all tell you a different way and then yell at you for doing it the was another manager said to.
bad,Walmart is a fun workplace as far as working with all the different type of customers. My coworkers not including management were very friendly & open to helping with any question I had. All coworkers were team players & extremely friendly.
bad,"My co-worker are easy to get along with, but management sucks. Management can care less about the employess."
bad,"Walmart only good if you and the workers on the same level as you. some people think if they have a walkie talkie, they feel as if they can boss you around."
bad,"It was a learning experience and the Pharmacist and other pharmacy techs, were professional and we worked well together as a team."
bad,"This has been a not so fun working experience for me. There is no advancement in the company unless you are kissing butt. Management does not care about what you have say, your feelings, or family."
bad,It's not that great of a place. The employees are not taken care of as good as the customers. If your just looking for a job not exactly a career this is NOT the place for you. They work you as much as possible for the minimal amount of pay. I would not recommend this for anyone.
bad,as worker warmer during the time that I spend it in Walmart for customer service on the manager management they helped us to be convenient and to let us to have the customer service
bad,More than 90% of management there made you not even want to show up. There was standards of which were not followed by higher ups. And when I would go above and beyond to take care of the store and its customers I was made fun of!
bad,"No hour flexibility , no off day flexibility , management only tell you what to do , they don’t help you understand , in overall i would not recommend working at Walmart"
bad,Quite a few people get fired because of some stupid excuse the manager came up with because they cant fire you for medical reasons so they make themselves look good by watching your every step so they can fire you for anything. Also my leave got approved two weeks before I got fired yet they fired me anyways hmmmm.
bad,The cons are the management it is together or organized. The coworkers never want to work always short from so many call outs. They have favorites so they treat other ppl like awful. Pros You can be off when you need a day off. They have snacks or food sometimes. We get a discount card
bad,"As soon as I can retire I will "
bad,"When I first started, it was great, but the longer I was there, more and  more changes occured. They don't train you very well or prepare you for how cruddy the job is actually going to be. They literally sit you in front of a computer until you finish all the required courses, then send you onto the floor to shadow someone for an hour, and then leave you to your own devices. Unfortunately as a single parent of toddlers at the time, almost all the changes effected me in a negative way. The attendance policy changes, the lack of change in PTO accruence rates, and the computer system are what effectively caused me to lose my job in the end. They do not look kindly on anyone that gets sick, or their child gets sick, and have no other option but to call in. They started cutting my hours whenever I got close to being required to be signed on as full time and kept denying me the opportunity to be full time whenever I asked about the openings. Most of the management were great to work with. Only a handful were indifferent to, or just didn't care what you had to say."
bad,"Typical day would start with management meeting on tonight's goals and area assignments, then gathering hand-scanners and pallet jacks, and grabbing plastic trash bags for recyclables. Then you head out onto the floor to start your stocking. The timeline for the stocking was from 10:30PM to midnight was stocking as fast as you can, then you get a break at midnight. Then you are left with about an hour and a half to COMPLETE your stocking, then you are moved to areas that need help. After lunch, the managers usually shift everyone to zoning everything in the store to make it look acceptable to the store manager in the morning."
bad,I feel like this Walmart really needed better communication skills between workers .they said i was a Great worker and then wanted to triple my work load with no monetary compensation. i felt very used and upset and ended up just geting a better job.
bad,I loved communicating with the customers & talking to them about their day & also getting them out as quickly as possible with no problems & making sure they found everything okay
bad,They treat you like a slave and don't work with you on anything. Management  is horrible and if u don't meet there standards then they don't like you.
bad,"I will never forget the people I have met there, nor the time we have spent.  My life is better for it.  I now need to take what I have learned and become more, however, for myself."
bad,"It’s a good place to work temporarily but I’ve worked there 11years and wasn’t even getting paid $20hr and was a support manager. Always expected more work out of there employes with no compensation or even a little thank you. They want you to give, give, give but don’t want to give you anything it’s horrible pay wise but if that doesn’t matter to a person then it’s not a bad place to work!!!"
bad,"There were pretty good days working there but other days weren't so good"
bad,Working for Algood Walmart was kinda good at first they gave me the days i needed off for my wedding and my honey moon but when that was over with the job was not good anymore the managers was rude the supervisors was kinda bad  and plus they was low staffed.
bad,"The management is inconsiderate of the individual, but that is expected with a large corporation like this. However you can make decent money if you have the drive."
bad,Walmart has changed they dont treat customers or staff in a friendly manor.Customer was rude and so was the staff. Store was never clean and in neat order
bad,"Typical day: Work harder than you did the last day, forever or be let go."
bad,"The company has “innovated” themselves right out of customer service and culture for associates.  The workforce is so thin, customers don’t get the service they deserve."
bad,"Walmart let myself and a lot of the managers go for a complete company transformation "
bad,"Working for Walmart was starting off okay, until I got injured off work and they wouldn't accept any of my Dr. notes, I had to wear a knee brace and they would not allow me to wear it on the job."
bad,There's no structure also no accountability favoritism  people come in making more money with no  experience . There not  fair with the raises. Your not appreciated for what you do
bad,I use to like working here now i am not so sure anymore. I am not getting full time hours that i need. I think that employees  that have been in the store for almost 6 years like me should have senority over the new hires.
bad,If you get sick or hurt and end up in the hospital you’re more likely to lose your job. Management doesn’t take doctor excuses at all. Understaffed all the time and you will get taken advantage of if you’re a good worker.
bad,I have previous experience with this company direct competitors and would not recommend working here first. That being said it could just be my particular location.
bad,"Obviously, Walmart is a very large, stable employer, but how they (particularly local management) deal with employees leaves a lot to be desired. Local management has little time for employees and really doesn't listen to employee input or concerns."
bad,"For being a rich company they certainly lack a lot of respect for the employees! I know of so many people who are truly sad working for Walmart and would love to find a job that's more understanding and flexible and courteous, little or no drama. When I was there it was just really sad and full of drama and complaining! Always had to"
bad,Don't do it. You don't matter. The point system doesn't allow for life to happen. If you are sick or your family is sick you are still required to be there or loose your jon
bad,Offers very little in benefits no payed holidays work environment is bad with the store manager some of the management is ok to work for. The company has taken away almost all of the benefits away
bad,"Was promised 40 hrs a week, not once have i gotten that. They hire you part time ( to avoid having to pay benefits and you earning time off ) and promise full time hours but you'll never get them. Now they are cutting hours, not what someone needs that has bills to pay. If you just want part time/few hours then it may be for you."
bad,Not a good company to work for. There’s no real benefits unless you’ve been there for like 20-30 years there’s no pay raises everybody gets paid the same when some people deserve to get paid more than others. There’s a lot of cons it’s just not a good place to work
bad,"A typical work day was 10 hours.  I usually did about 500 prescriptions a day, and we had good pharmacist overlap.  The fact that we have cashiers and techs at Walmart made it a lot easier to stay focused on pharmacist work.  The phones were incessant at my store, but we didn't have a drive-thru and thus has a little less distraction.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping my patients.  The most difficult part of my job was meeting my bosses very short deadlines.  I was typically only given 1-2 days to throw together an off-site event or to meet my bosses demands and held to the highest levels of accountability for my and my teams' failures.  We would also be given new computer based learning (CBL)/training and told we were already late on them before they even dropped for us to complete.  I also was required to be on multiple conference calls every week, including weeks when I am on paid time off (PTO)/leave.  The pay was excellent, but I don't think they offer anywhere near what I was offered 5 years ago, and the benefits keep getting worse and worse.  I'd overall say that this was an enjoyable job, mostly due to how much I enjoyed working with my teammates and seeing my regular patients."
bad,I've heard that this company is a good company to work for I've heard great reviews about to die and I hope I will be one day we will see I get to work I can tell other people experience of working
bad,"They always talk about how they value their employees but I have never once felt like they were there to help me. I got to school full time and also work full time. They aren't flexible with my schedule so I can do both easily, instead they just cut my hours."
bad,"They care more for speed than the well being of the employees. Management doesn't want to hear an employee say no to them. Also for the work I did in Cap 2, 11/hr is not enough, all of cap 2 unload trucks and stock shelves. Also workers have to kiss up and tell managers yes’em in order to be appreciated and noticed. All the workers that do all the work get noticed for every little screw up they do but the workers who do nothing are basically invisible"
bad,I rather than feeling appreciated by my boss I feel demonized and constantly shut down. When I don't know something I ask for help as I was told to and I will instead receive what I can only describe as the wrath of management for daring to ask a question. I do not feel like my boss would ever go to bat for me and I get the constant feeling that she regrets hiring me. My coworkers will sympathize with me occasionally but I often wonder how genuine it is.
bad,Worked 15 yrs was kicked out like a dog for a  manager  lying on me to get ahead want a be she still  climbing the pole but when karma  come back around.  I was honest  team Walmart  no problem
bad,"At first it was like woah this place is where I see myself for about 3 years, but then it starts to get really tense and there isn’t a lot of communication between coworkers and management. It gets very stressful at times."
bad,If you right out of school and want decent money Walmart is a good temporary job! They pay some what decent until their system  acts up and ur pay history is no longer on the application then you don’t get paid what you should for any experience. There are few good managers. There are cliques. The store 1860 has had multiple fires and black mold under the deli hot bar and rat droppings in the deli
bad,The employees have no value to management.  The benefits are getting unaffordable.   I have even hear of employees qualifying for public assistance.  Shocking when you consider what profits Walmart makes for their shareholders! Disgusting.
bad,"Supervisors expect you to work at certain speed to get things done , especially when there's barely anyone there to help. They have scheduling issues to where you have to request an override of the time clock, and good luck when you have classes , apparently business comes first. Lastly,  they cut our hours down ."
bad,Horrible management. Manager yelling at you if you don’t get any MasterCards. Cashiers don’t get any respect by mangers. Harassment going on and management not doing anything to deal with it.
bad,They dont care about your outside life and the point system they have for attendance is crazy especially if you have kids the hours are always cut and the managers lack communication and never give recognition for your work
bad,"They'll complain about employees who don't do their jobs but will punish everyone and slash hours, even when they repeatedly say they're happy with your work."
bad,It’s somewhat decent most of the time! Some days good some bad unlike any other job. Some days it’s a repetition of doing the same thing over and over and sometimes it’s doing something completely different.
bad,Not really the best place to work.  You can work really hard and it’s never enough.  The only thing the pharmacy manager is worried about is getting her bonus. She mentions it at least once in conversation daily.
bad,I just wasted 2 years with Walmart and just when they were fixing to have to pay for my insurance they accused me of stealing something my manager gave me! Most of the people you work with are petty and will do and say anything to make themselves look better. They expect one person(me) to run the whole deli side by myself.
bad,"If you want a job that you go in one day and can be put in your department and the next day somewhere else. Or if you want a job where you basically have no chance at full time. Or a job that has favoritism. Or a job that doesn't pay enough for the work you do especially when it's not even what you signed up for in the first place, work at Walmart!!"
bad,"My first impression was that the shop had a relaxed atmosphere, since there was always someone's music selection playing fairly loudly. My judgment was premature, as I would later realize. You will go through a plethora of out-dated training material, and you will be tested on some of that material. The Fleet Assist system being used tracks a technician's time down to the minute, and they require accuracy to that precision. For example, if you take a lunch break, you have exactly 30 minutes. If you are more than 1 minute late arriving to work, it's considered an ""occurrence"". There are no lunch options within a reasonable drive accessible within the time window you are allotted. This means you will have to take your lunch daily. This also means that the time waiting for a microwave, combined with the time to cook frozen food items, may result in a rushed ""prison style"" meal. They also require two 15 minute breaks daily, once again down to the minute. They do have cable TV in the break room, but it's somewhat redundant since you have to watch the time closely. The list of absolutes and rules is quite exhaustive, and many of the seemingly ridiculous ones result in immediate termination, if violated. It will be expected to grasp and operate within the Fleet Assist system fairly quickly, and not much leniency will be given for the fact that your first 2 weeks consists mainly of training in other areas."
bad,"You can fulfill your task as your manager said and he/she will still say otherwise. You can try taking days off but they will still schedule you no matter what it is for. They don't actually care about their customers for I have seen the Cashier manager literally tell someone they can't do anything about her gift card being left at a register as the employee failed to give it directly to her but instead put it on the check-writing board to the side of the register for her to grab but they didn't and the customer after them grabbed it without the cashier looking, nothing was done to help with the lady with her stolen gift card but instead she was out of $75. They care not about their employees or customers at all and will mainly mistreat you for all they care about is sales and their gross income. *Hence why the managers are stuck up*"
bad,Poor consideration of those with disabilities. Lack of communication on top of inability to find management when most necessary. Very unsafe work environment.
bad,"It’s faced pasted with unclear instructions most of the time. Unfriendly work environment, stress level increases. Unorganized work stations. Supervisor have ridiculous expectations of task they aren’t even contributing on"
bad,"Worked their 2 years took the department manager test past but was hard to get in that job position they favorte people .if they no like you you arent getting in and no where to advance to "
bad,"I hate it here, they will not move me departments due to health problems, ever time I ask or mention to be moved I get looked over without reason and see new people everyday in the departments I already applied for and spoke to manage my about. I have Been ignored for a transfer to a store where I live literally down the street from."
bad,works well with school schedule; thats about it. A high stress environment and a company that cares more about the profit than keeping employees happy.
bad,I worked Cap 2 for about 2 months and was promoted to Cap 2 Supervisor which ended up being the worst mistake i made. Pay for the position in some eyes might not look bad but trust me you youll earn every bit of it. Upper Management is garbage and dont know how to treat you. The company in general dont care if you have a family. If you work for them they think they own you.
bad,"Staff pharmacist taking leave due to stressful working environment caused by unreasonable expectations of supervising pharmacist. Poor training, dismal Communications, management through threats and bullying."
bad,"Management tells you what they want you to hear with no folow through.  Lots of promises no action. "
bad,"I enjoyed my first store in Plano, which was a Neighborhood Market. My managers and staff were awesome. I regret not staying there.  I gained  valuable life/work experience there. The second store was a supercenter. I will make no comment about that experience."
bad,"This was not a very good workplace. I was not heard, they did not train me (used the budget to pay for other things) and the management was a bloody joke. They were all sleeping together and getting transferred around by head office. Cheers."
bad,"Management is something to be desired. They don't want to work with you about scheduling. Lack of respect for workers. Point system is not working for people with good, logical reasons for missing."
bad,Management changes schedule without telling you. Management does NOT care about there employees. Management will deny your availability even tho you have another job. Management treats the employees bad. Management will say they are giving you full time position but keeps changing the date on when you will sign papers.  Management also plays favoritism. Walmart is honestly the worst place to work for
bad,"I really enjoyed working there when I first started but that drastically changed due to managements disrespect towards associates, favoritism and lack of help. They claim to be all about their employees but in reality they only care about making money. YOU ARE REPLACEABLE no matter how long you’ve been with the company."
bad,"Pay is better than most jobs like it, but Bentonville (Corporate) has their fingers in your pie constantly trying to manipulate everything often for the worse. They change things just to change them. You leave work and dread going back. About 60% of your customers think you are trash and treat you as such. I have worked at 4 Walmarts and there is always a system of favoritism to take advantage of if you are lucky... Not bad for entry level work, but you can and should find better!"
bad,Misleading  management only hired me for black Friday.  They told me that I was doing great and thanked me for working extra hours then fired me on the next shift I worked
bad,"It was a very good paying job. The only problem was that they did not want to help move up. They kept me where I was after months of me asking. They kept it a secret from me that they weren't going to move me, I had to hear from someone else. The CSM's were always in their office on their phone, and were never around to help at the register, or self-check out."
bad,"Management will set an employee up to fail if they don't like them. They will not approve your days off, even the ones they need to go to the doctors. Therefore, the employee is forced to call in and use their occurrences so they will get fired."
bad,"Walmart isnt a bad place to work if you don't have to much of a life. But if you have kids, it can be a little tricky to work around the family life. And they will make you work any and all Holidays"
bad,"Worked me way too much, never got my paychecks in, would get yelled at for any inconvenience, whether it was my fault or not, managers are never there to help, severally understaffed so it takes forever to get anything done"
bad,The management play favorites. Negative work atmosphere. No recognition. Terrible communication skills. Doesn't hire within company. Terrible benefits.
bad,"When you complete requested task, no recognition, no encouragement. Was given a goal to meet in production, but then given a new employee to train so couldn't meet goal. Was not given instruction as how to meet goal,  when training someone else."
bad,"Management doesn’t give clear instructions, people get fired before we have people to replace them, and everyone is severely overworked. They combine large departments to have one department manager take care of while they take that department manager’s associates and send them elsewhere, leaving one person in charge of stocking everything, price changes, customer service, inventory, etc."
bad,"Walmart has a lot of people who do not care. I drive myself at work and take pride in what I am doing, and yet any time I have complained about coworkers harassing me managers have told me I would have to get over it. On top of that you do more jobs than you are paid to do."
bad,"Walmart is so well known there should be no surprises. What did I know? I was surprised that at my first introduction to the Distribution Center was quite positive. I took the job just to help subsidize my income while I was waiting for promotion at other job. I ended up liking my job at Walmart so much I gave up the promotion at the other job and became an area manager with Walmart. I kept my other job for the part time income and better benefits. "
bad,"I worked here during my college years because of the convenient location and good starting pay. That was the only good thing about it. I’m not saying all of the stores are like this, at least I hope not, but I’ve never experienced more unprofessionalism, lack of respect and uncleanliness in the workplace. How this store is still standing and how these people still work here I have no idea."
bad,"I work in the deli at Walmart. We are always short staffed and management has better things to do, example smoke outside, rather than help us. It’s extremely stressful and really not worth the pay. Everyone that works at this location Walmart is miserable but everyone’s got bills to pay so...."
bad,"Managment is very nice at the start and open to hearing your opinions and thoughts but when it comes to time off, it's like playing in a zoo. Especially If it's a family event, you are not guaranteed that day off even if you put it the time off request months ago. Also there is alot of unnecessary drama."
bad,"I made great friendships at my Walmart to last a lifetime, But I was constantly harassed by management, that I sucked at my job. (I was only there for 2 weeks)"
bad,"No te apoyan en muchos aspectos, dan muchas preferencias"
bad,"Being a customer service manager at Walmart was a very stressful job, because it is not easy to work with management. They can coach you for anything they want and get you terminated.  The work load is too much and the schedule is a flexible schedule with at least days working in the evening.  There is no job security at all."
bad,"At my store there is no appreciation toward employees unless you are buddy buddy with them, personnel works you 10 sometimes more days straight when clearly states no more than 6 consecutive days straight, your availability doesn’t matter, they schedule you whenever they want.. if you have kids or a family don’t plan on seeing them much!"
bad,"Managers often tasked stockers to more work than was able to be completed in one shift (ex. tasked to 12 hours of freight in a 7.5 hour shift). Overnight employees were expected to pick up the slack from other shifts, often being coached for work left by other shifts. Gender discrimination was common, and actively encouraged by management. Training isn't followed including putting stockers on register with little or no training and are ignored by CSM's when help is needed. Understaffing was one of the worst issues, leaving less than 10 stockers on a weekend routinely."
bad,The first 9 months I worked there it was a little hard but worth the pay. I was hired at full time and working over nights. It’s a neighborhood Walmart and they eventually stopped doing overnight stocking so we had to move to day. That meant they were deducting my pay 50¢ since it’ll be during the day   Okay whatever. After doing day stock for about 3 months I checked my schedule and i was cut to 24 hours for that week and the next one too. That is not full time   I asked who was in charge of scheduling and I was told my availability changed... I never changed it at all  so I asked for an availability sheeit and corrected it   Only then did I find my pay was cut  I could go on and on but Walmart jips their employees and cuts back on pay to save money  you will be lied to and never you think a problem is solve until you have seen the solution.
bad,"Job is ok.  Work and management can be stressful.  No full time, No benefits.  Pay is ok.  Actual job is not that hard or challenging at all if you like to deal with customers."
bad,The higher up managers really dont care about their employees. The lack of communication is horrendous. I've seen employees literally fall from exhaustion from poor conditions
bad,"The managers talk about you, yourself, and you 'team'  behind your back. Our team has been called worthless by our manager to another department manager. We are constantly being told that we don't do a good enough job. If I could find a better job I would in a heartbeat! "
bad,"Walmart was not the best place to work. The policies were biased and unfair, and any mistakes made by management were unaccounted for on their part. In addition, many employees were underpaid despite their efforts, seniority, and work ethic."
bad,"Constantly fighting management to provide the correct days off you need, alongside having to go through nearly every manager to get the equipment they were supposed to provide even then they will provide the minimum such as one time use rain ponchos that’ll rip and tear within hours of your shift. Poor management is the downfall of Walmart 1775"
bad,The overall experience working for Walmart was not good we were always understaffed and half the time not able to take brakes because of coverage. The management is not good no leadership or guidance.
bad,"Been working for Walmart almost 4 years now and I haven’t the slightest idea how anyone’s stayed an associate for over that amount of time. Their practices are unfair to their regular associates, I haven’t met a single manager who actually goes “by the book”. And even if you’re full time you’re really part time. I’ve worked at one specific store but have had the opportunity of filling in at different stores  to help out and they ALL run their stores the same. Went on maternity leave and they gave my position away and no one answers the phones (Team Leads are never in their office) at the stores to get in contact with HR (Team Lead). I have a four month old I can’t support because of managements incompetence. Tried to transfer to a different store but it’s been almost 2 months since I’ve been trying to come back and they’re giving me the run around because I’m full time and they’re cutting a lot of hours AND positions."
bad,"Walmart is what you make of it. There is a lot of times that are fun, and when you will have fun. It just depends on how you decide to work that day. You get out what you put in."
bad,Okay for a first job but gets old quick. It felt like highschool they refuse to move you if you are too good at your current job. To get what want you have to be best friends with over half the managment and beg which even then took 8 months even make anything happen
bad,Walmart is one of the worse places to work for this job isn’t worth the stress they don’t care about your family or anything they will work you live a slave and not even care
bad,"Walmart treats you like a slave if your too nice and humble they walk all over you giving you extra tasks and not pullin their own weight or helping out the team by assisting trainees ect. They are giving some people 6 hours of stocking or 3 sections worth of inventory and thats not counting the 2 hours they want the truck unloaded by. So it's either you finish the truck in 2 hours and have enough people hired and ready - which is never the case its always under staffed or they hire some lazy people ... CAP 2 evening shifts have the biggest turn over rate no one stays because the store is run by clown managers that walk around looking cute instead of training staff and assisting inventory stocking."
bad,"Very unorganized, very poor, lazy upper management crew. Zero communication skills with entire management team. Worst walmart store I've ever worked at. If you're wanting a career at walmart, do not work at store 2129 in Clearfield Pa.  Mangement makes it a miserable place to be."
bad,"90% of the management dont know how to manage people, which leads to more and more people leaving and putting more stress on the rest of us to pick up the mess."
bad,"Managers had their own agenda and only cared about them self."
bad,csm in the front do not care they throw you under the bus to figure it out Csms picks favorites nd if your not in the few you will be treated bad do not care bout advancment opp Some csm just walk the store during shift . unprofessional and idirect .  you complain they will write you up & give you points for telling them you need help
bad,"The management is horrible so much favoritism and nepotism, some departments get a lot of attention and help while others are horribly neglected. Always had two supervisors who worked contradictive to each other, almost always does anything get done about harassment and bullying in the workplace. There is to much strain on individual workers that is supposed to be helped by having a team but management does nothing to push towards teamwork"
bad,"You will experience the following:"
bad,Typically remained busy for the full shift.  Inconsistent staffing.  Inconsistent scheduling.  Very difficult to take any time off.  Good Benefits.  Great discount.
bad,"It all comes down to who your managers are, they usually hire awful people who should not be managing high school and post secondary students. It was a horrible experience, not sure how I lasted about a year there. Do not work here! This is for one of the Wal-Marts in Burlington, ON. Now after Uni both positions I had have been great and I did not hate my life. Again, it comes down to who your supervisors are.. if you are looking for a minimum wage job any other place would be better tbh"
bad,This was an ok job for schoolkids not a career looking forward too unless your in the pharmacy dept or retired. Low pay no benefits part time job. Absolutely no overtime. Management not on the same page.
bad,"You are very unappreciated at this job.  They dont care if you have a family or not! Management sucks, they dont know anything. They should know everybit of that store, not just there position."
bad,"Typical day:  who will show up to work?"
bad,"I would not recommend anyone apply at Wal Mart Port Perry. The management is horrible, dishonest, and will stab you in the back so fast. Store manager doesn't care if the store falls apart or not."
bad,"It really depends on your senior management, but if you have bad senior management at Walmart life is miserable. No 2 days are the same and you have to be prepare to go above and beyond every day for thanks less job and their evaluation system for their managers isn't fair."
bad,Walmart was a good place to work at first. After a few years Walmart’s culture changed. Upper management is only concerned with the money in their own pocket and no longer care about the associates.
bad,Love working at Walmart just don't love the fact that there are not enough hours and management is never around when you need someone for help Everyone is stressed out and on edge so it doesn't make it a fun environment to work in
bad,It is physically impossible to complete what they want you to do in a day. Management wants you to be nice and have a smile on your face all day but they do not act that way towards you. They will overwork you in your 40 hours and send you home at hour 41 so that you will not get any overtime.
bad,"If you are not a student then I would not suggest Walmart. New hires start part time. It is difficult to get full time hours. When other companies are raising their starting wage to $12-$15 per hr, Wal-Mart is still at $11 yet this company is the biggest in the world."
bad,"There would be days I worked from 1-11pm, in the deli. I have chronic pain in my left knee and developed back pain from doing dishes for 2hrs a day. You would have to pay me a lot more to work there again."
bad,You could enjoy working there at long as you who you could talk to and who not to say anything to about anything. just like any job you have your hard workers and you have you slacker.
bad,"At the location that I worked at, management couldn't do their jobs with any level of proficiency. They had low staff, most people quit within a year, and the supervisors had to stay overtime nearly every night to pick up the slack."
bad,No respect for associates or customers. They talk a good line but that's as far as it goes. I quit after almost 20 years because of how they wanted me to treat associates.
bad,"They want you to live for Walmart, not yourself. The  corporation of walmart is only about the bottom, line. BTW no workers no profit, corporate not getting that message, yet.."
bad,"They get your hopes up saying they promote within but they don't. If the manager like you is what counts but don't be that likable to the point to were they don't want to let you go then you will never transfer,so if you plan on making this a career keep a duck face you going to have to kiss allot of butt. If you stand up for yourself you will loose hours happens to several of co-workers I knew.  Oh I learned after a couple of times traveling to other stores that they pay you for travel  so if you do that make sure you get the voucher. Also use PPTO for leaving early if you have emergency or to take off points, also keep checking the points it will be points that pop up on there out the blue sometime the manager can handle that for you. If you feel mistreated the open door policy is a waste of time you still will be mistreated. so yeah good luck. I advise you to stay way from CAP 2 it the lowest paid and you work the hardest."
bad,"Management is too quick the blame their own associates for their usual shortcomings. Lack of leadership and guidance is rampant from the top down, and has created an almost toxic culture."
bad,Walmart is a very depressing place the managers are terrible at their jobs and hardly help anybody. None of the workers want to do their jobs no one even wants to be there its unorganized and stressful.
bad,They say they understand what you go throught but they really don’t and they are not very organize either. It’s the on in Sherwood is the one I’m talking about.
bad,"Depending on the store, managers might be slightly different in some ways but it’s all the same concept just a matter on the individual person and their work ethic"
bad,Not a fun place to work but a nice place to start if you haven't worked anywhere before. The managers will show you how to do things in a general way but are power tripping.
bad,"Wish I could change.  Poor management  poor coverage on busiest days.  Attitudes,no on cares. A lot of heavy lifting, no team work, bad working environment,"
bad,"It's Walmart, what's there to say about it that hasn't been said already? It's a temp job for college kids to earn bread money while they go through their courses."
bad,"Constantly pulled, changes to managment structure is constant. No job security. Made a lot of good friends there. No overtime allowed. Full time doesn't mean 40 hours"
bad,The environment is stressful.  Each manager gives and expects something different from you. The lack of communication between managers and associates. To get promoted you need to be a favorite.
bad,Work  almost 17 years and not brought  back to work while the store manager is on leave does not say much for the mgmt  team on board while store manager is out in low.You would think they would want to bring me back as a long term assoc. having above normal reviews for all I have  worked  but the mgmt team I felt with I never worked with as I was the voice of walmart
bad,"Very stressful, not able to grow with the company a lots if click in the company meaning if the manager don't like you they will not help you to grow in the company. Lots of harassment, bullying, bad name calling. Injuries not taken seriously. Manager making the work load "
bad,This was by far the worst pharmacy I have ever worked for. There was a lot of favoritism and the pay was the lowest around. The only good thing was that they provided the class for you to become certified and even then the pay was the lowest. People stayed to get the class for free and then left.
bad,"Wal-mart is a good entry level job for the young kids that are fresh outta high school as a way to begin their working careers, but nothing more.  As a seasoned adult in his 40s, however, I hated it because of the attitudes alone.  Before wal-mart, i spent 20+ years in factories, working on industrial machines designed to do production work.  Worst of all, the differences in maturity between both these job fields is too big to hope for positive change"
bad,"I started in recieving,  stocking, and floors, stripped and waxed. I was grandfathered in was getting things people today have no idea about 4 weeks of vacation and a Christmas bonus...."
bad,I would recommend this to someone who wanted to make money and had no concerns about having a life. Ive totally lost 2 1/2 years of holidays and weekends with my family. Though the pay was decent they were constantly adding to our list of responsabilities and cutting crew numbers. Extremly stressful. Customer service greatly suffered because of this.
bad,"Being 100% honest, your experience will vary on the store you work. My last store has RUINED my outlook on Walmart which is a shame because I learned so much from great managers. You do not have set schedules, your hours get cut, you have to move up IF POSSIBLE to get decent pay. Just...the worse"
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working here if you have a family to provide for, or if you are a student. They don't offer enough hours and they don't give you excuses absences even if you are sick with an excuse from a doctor or emergency room."
bad,"Management does not care about employees. "
bad,"It can be a hostile and stressful environment! Very demanding, work 10 to 12 hours(6 days a week during holiday season) with a 15 minute and 10 minute break all day,know matter what the season was. Sometimes they didn't give us the second break. They would say because we are getting off early(it will be a 9 hour day). Then on some days you will work no hours.(you will go in and they would send you home.When it was 30 minutes to 15 minutes to get off they would say, we have to stay another 30 minutes or hour.  Either they over work you or didn't give you no hours at all.They change every day their laws and rules. You get ,occurrence for everything.it was almost like a prison camp. and if you spoke up , they made you feel like you was a trouble maker. Then they had a temp service that hire people for them and they walk around like they where your manager, the temp employees.And a lot of harassing went on.It was a very different experience."
bad,The management make it known your replaceable and whether your doing good or bad will make sure you continue to know that your a faceless drone. The pay raises have gotten to the point of being a quarter a year. To make more money it's easier to quit and reapply because seniority means nothing.
bad,good company i think the pay can be a lot better especially for stockers and overnighters...great place to meet new people as well as co workers......
bad,"Poor management, and if you have an issue you have to wait MONTHS for it to be resolved. Unless you have been with them for 150 years then they will do whatever you want. Not a good work environment for people with families, or with any sort of disability."
bad,"I worked for Walmart for over 30 years. It used to be a great place to work. The last 10 years were full of changes, some good, but many not good."
bad,"Everything depends on the management team that you are under when I started I advanced quickly with management that saw hard work and integrity, then management changed and it became a game of favoritism."
bad,"Lower management  is poor. They are cashier managemnt but do not respond to cashiers in timely fashion. When cashiers are managed by a team of people who have to open locked cabinets in the front, check something on cashiers register, etc. And they take a long time to respond, the cashier also looks bad. The cashiers share drawers so is it really safe and clear cut as they like you to think it is when talleys and counts are made by humans every few hours? Cashiering is fun as far as contact with customers and not stressful when you are able to get your lines down. Walmart usually does not have enough staff. It is not a horrible place to start off at. It really depends on if you like the work and whether you can deal with some occassional bullcrap for a paycheck."
bad,They offer benefits to full time only. Management bullies employees and does not allow them to advance when they try. You work hard every day and get overlooked for promotion or raises.
bad,"a typical day involved the management scolding all the employees for not being fast enough when unloading trucks.\"
bad,Over staffed.  Limited advancement opportunities.  Was great to work with them.  I enjoyed stocking and the remodel work and doing things that kept me busy.
bad,Empresa cheia de caciques...e n tem nenhuma organização todos lá querem saber de tudo mais no fundo n sabem de nada...
bad,"""Fresh""Managementt is clueless most times. Moral is very low at most stores, underappreciated hard workers. Understaffed most times, customers are unpleasant, makes associates unpleasant. Drama created by most manageres, newly promoted."
bad,"I honestly hated this job because it paid average and it was bi-weekly. The lines were too long, the management sucked. "
bad,Management is terrible and run around like chicken with their heads cut off. It feels like an episode on mean girls everyday. Assistants act like popular prissy people and never directly address you unless it’s a hello.
bad,"So bad environment, poor pay poor management poor in labors caring,"
bad,To much work not enough time to do it there insurance not good they expect a lot from you when they (WAlmart) don’t pay you enough there always protocol calls  not enough  for WAlmart pays you
bad,"I personally do not like working here , they treat their employees like they are nothing . Management gets paid big money to sit around and do nothing . When you have a problem you can never get it solved . They are always messing up schedules and cutting hours . The people that don’t do anything get everything and the ones that bust their butts get nothing . They  expect you to get done the impossible."
bad,"A typical day at work depends on the customers and the managers, whether it be a good or bad day. I learned to be patient with people and money responsibility. Management is terrible at Walmart. Not friendly and very stressful. Lunch breaks are not on time no equipment, tools, or items for work stocked up. Socialize coworkers with different backgrounds and cultures."
bad,"I liked the people I worked with in my department, but everything else was not as great. They overwork with little pay. No overtime options, and if they let you work overtime you cannot keep it. You have to cut your hours down. Management plays favorites and will screw you over."
bad,"Walmart pays better than a lot of grocery stores, and they are flexible if your schedule is all over the place due to school or other things, but the work environment of the one I work at is deplorable. I would suggest you not work here unless your're willing to be treated like a peon and a child not only by customers, but also by your higherups."
bad,"It’s a horrible company to work for, the management team is awful. When I first 14 yrs ago they were the people, but the corporation is just greedy now and they always find ways to screw their employees"
bad,"Stacking the heavy crates is more stressful on an older person's body than you think.. it's nice being a picker, it sucks staging and dispensing though.. good for a strong teenager job. Can be super stressful"
bad,"Most days begin with a to-do list of what was missed yesterday with today's additions, such as change of seasonal signage. Though a great system the practice was undermined by the establishment as other areas would pull associates from their designated areas to compensate for lack of associates in another. Often leaving the prior to-do list left to one to two employees for an entire department and often without any management to ask for guidance. This resulted in most people being kind where they can be but cut-throat in putting their department priorities before helping any other."
bad,Awful : feel sorry for lower level managers Once again DO HAVE HEALTH ISSUES one manager was out on SURGERY messed up shoulder WORKING FOR WALMART LOST HER POSITION
bad,They were always known for creating jobs but now are getting rid of higher paying jobs I got a job that I felt that I finally deserved the pay after 29 years and then they got rid of it was going to knock me down to a different job and take my pay with it it's happening with alot of jobs there now didn't like the direction the company is going
bad,Work schedule was all over the place. I was constantly closing and opening on back to back days. The work was easy but very slow. I was constantly counting down the hours until i had to clock out.
bad,"When I worked at Walmart the management treated the workers as expendable robots.  If you were injured on the job, they'd allow you to take on a lighter job. Nice. But, if your injury slowed you down and you couldn't get the job done at the speed they wanted, you got fired. Even if the injury was on the job. Some on the management team didn't know what they were doing. They wouldn't listen to you even when you knew more then they did."
bad,"I have been in management for nearly 15yrs. The changes in Walmart on controlling inventory through processes has been a great improvement, but the Teamwork Environment needs a lot of improvements. There’s a lot of unnecessary back-biting in upper management. Either the Co-managers are fighting among themselves or harassing an assistant who has a mind of their own. Walmart is a great place to send your teenagers so they’ll learn the importance of a college degree."
bad,"Was not the best work situation. People with kids would get mornings first. I was told to pick between school or my work. Head office is rude, disrespectful and degrading. They would do randomly check ups at our location and would tell our pharmacist they were doing awful and fire them."
bad,"Wal-mart is a very judgemental place. It doesn't matter if you have a dr's note or not, a missed day is a missed day. Wal-mart asks to much for too little."
bad,They managers there are not there for you. They treat everyone as they are incompetent without having the knowledge to handle the projects themselves.
bad,Terrible place to work  the managers and their favorites will try to harass you if you are new and dont care about a minimum wage job anyway! There are lot of breaks which is nice
bad,If your looking for a place to work just to work and make some money Walmart is an ok place to work. It’s not family oriented and you don’t advance fast but it’s a job and you can make it work.
bad,When I first started in 1999 it was a great place to work.  Over the years it has gone down hill by them only worrying about profits.  They don't seem to care about the customer or the associates anymore. So after 20 years it was time to retire from them and move on to something else.
bad,"Be prepared for ANYTHING with customers. Also, if you're looking for advancement, be prepared to have been there for at least 7 years unless special situations exist."
bad,"Management was all over the place and there was a lot of favoritism. Extremely stressful during the holidays, kept me just under full time so I didn't get any benefits."
bad,If you're looking for a job that drains you and degrades you when you try your best and then let other people get away with the bare minimum then join a walmart team
bad,"When I started working for this company 18 years ago, it was great. Amazing, even. Slowly, and as the years progressed,  as the managers changed hands, they made it less about us as a whole, and more about them. Now all these years later, it's all about them, and not about us. Their associates. Seems to have become more of a dictatorship than a retail giant"
bad,"When I started working here I thought it was great but the longer I worked here I realized that they just want you to work there all the time even if you're part-time. For example, if you have a family emergency you better hope you have Protected paid time off or you will be fired for calling out 5 times."
bad,"This company's management makes or breaks it at store level."
bad,When I first started at Walmart the management team was a awesome crew. We got a new store manager and workplace moral went way down. I have had three great store managers and one absolutely terrible manager.
bad,"Salary Management had favorites. Very unorganized. Never greeted nor smiled towards employee's. No empathy for people's families and loved ones at home. Business before anything but not towards their families "" that rule only applied to employee's"". Hated this job except the decent pay as a manager!"
bad,"Typical work days involved the challenges of caring for patients and supervising pharmacy staff. I administered immunizations and performed MTM along with filling prescriptions and calling medical offices and insurance companies to get additional information for claims."
bad,"Dia muito longos"
bad,The whole dynamic has changed. They care less about your family and more about their bottom line. The management at that particular store were horrible.
bad,"my direct supervisor was nice ans worked well with me as much as she could, but all of the upper management was absolutely useless and did not care at all about anything except getting their paycheck...."
bad,"All else is bad. I’m sure all Wal-Mart’s are different but told no! Customers complain, workers complain it has really gone down hill fast. People retaliate often."
bad,"Be ready to receive a hundred different directions every day, sometimes instructions given are totally  opposite  to previous task, multitasking several areas at once since is always short staffed"
bad,Aucune conciliation entre deux horaires de travail.
bad,Managers never listen they say they have an open door policy but they don't. You have to tell them things that need to be done over and over. And then they throw a fit.
bad,"Work here only if you desperately need a job, but I advise you to keep looking for other jobs while here. There is room for advancement but you will be worked to death. The pay gives very little incentive to stay and the lack of appreciation from ‘higher-ups’ doesn’t help. “It is a job though”"
bad,The most enjoyable part of work was when assigned project completed. Work place culture not family oriented. The most hardest part of the job was to accept directions regardless of right or worng
bad,If you just need a job. Wal-Mart will provide you with one. They don't care about your well being they just want the work done. This company operations is not design for retention of associates but to keep a revolving door every 3 to 5 years. The culture has dramatically changed. It's more of a slave shop.
bad,Intente estudiar y trabajar pero practicamente me obligaron a irme pues solo me asignaban horarios despues de mis horas disponibles
bad,"It’s a good job if you don’t rely on the income as a primary source to pay your bills. You are trained in one department but then get placed in other departments. You can’t help customers effectively because you don’t know where anything is or anything about that department. Also, you are asked to work over but then get your hours cut the next week."
bad,"You barely get your breaks. They are very rude and it’s very unorganized. You also barely get any hours . You have 5 points for 6 months that you can’t use , until 6 months has started over again , or you’ll be without a job ( no matter what the reason is )"
bad,"At first I loved working there. Meeting new people, learning new things. As time went on and I progressed I was promised higher up positions that never happened. My work schedule and hours were all over the place. I hardly had time to see my own family"
bad,This was a part time place of employment while I attended high school. My managers were non-existent and lacked adequate communication to relay the days events for incoming staff.
bad,"I would not recommend Walmart to work for my friends or family, unless you are in real need of a job.  The environment in Walmart has changed since I first worked there.  It is not a happy place to work, you can see it on the associates faces."
bad,I originally thought this company would be great to work for. I realized after my 90 probation that it wasn't. Management is half trained & uninformed
bad,"As a manager I felt bad at times, especially when the store manager would tell me to fire someone in a meeting when he was supposed to be the open door. I felt like I fired people for some of the most minute reasons, but hey it's against company policy to chew gum on the sales floor... That's a good example.  This company has it's pros with it's cons. Some of the pros are the ability to move up in the company, but once you hit salary; say goodbye to your life. I swear I'd work 100 hours a week for four weeks leading up to inventory, black Friday and Christmas. Also I had copious amounts of vacation days 32 to be exact, yet I swear I only got 2 weeks of it in 4 years. The company has an amazing vision but the store managers and the district managers only care about making their goals and their bonuses and not about their employees health or well being."
bad,Worked for them for ten years. Want bad when I started. It has gotten so bad. They no longer care about the customer. It's all about e money. That wasn't Sams vision. Nothing about Walmart is Sams vision any more. It's really sad.
bad,It starts off as a good experience then Turns into a mess all the way around. It’s like high school all over again Fast turn over rate.  Management is a joke only get this job if you’re thinking temporary very inconsiderate when it comes to scheduling. When you ask for help or how to do something No one knows.. not a good experience
bad,"I started working at Walmart as a cashier under the premise that in a month or two I would be moved to work in a department(which is the job I applied for). The duration of my employment with Walmart I was never moved to a department as promised. I would occasionally be put in other departments to help out and I even did some truck unloading shifts(overnights) but was never permanently moved. I would consistently bring the issue to management and they would keep shrugging it off and saying ""Soon"". Underpaid, no benefits and management doesn't really care about their staff. Stores are understaffed. Working as a cashier sucks because you have to stand at a register for the whole shift, except lunch breaks, which was really stressful to my body. The only good thing about working here was the 10% discount."
bad,Was not the work environment suitable for me. I did not enjoy working there we were treated like  The whole standards squad quit after a certain time there because they got sick of how they got mistreated
bad,enjoy what I do enjoy working with a lot of the other associates typical day punch in at 7 am open registers clean them fill bags dust and sweep my area and wait on customers hardest part of the job is trying to wait on all customers at once I enjoy helping the customers with purchases
bad,"I really enjoyed who I worked with. However, customer service managers often hindered my ability to do my job in a timely fashion. In order to help some of the customers, I had to call on help from my CSM's and sometimes when helping me the service managers would have attitudes and depict it in my direction."
bad,"Never had time to be with family and company even on days off wants you to work because your salary, texting you while your on vacations, no support system when your away no one helps you follow up for you."
bad,"I worked in the  Electronics department for a few months then the Garden Center for a little less than 2 years. Loved it at first because I loved plants, but hated everything else. My department manager was ok, he was very pushy but he understood when I was having life issues. He was a nice guy but he gets very bossy under stress and frequently leaves to take a smoke break or do work elsewhere in the store, leaving me and one other associate alone most of the day. Frequently I was left to work by myself and the rate of customers needing assistance would cause me not to get any work done. I would be verbally punished when work was left incomplete too often and occasionally I was written up, meaning a strike, due to lack of performance when I was working my butt off. Explaining my situations gets me no mercy. My coworkers were nice for the most part. There would be some disagreements and irresponsibility between one or two of them, but I kept quiet unless it was hurting sales. The store manager was a complete jerk to everyone, not a lick of compassion or humanity in that guy. Blamed department managers for improper management of associates and and associates' poor performance. Dealt with this store manager for most of my time working with Walmart, ignoring most his complaints and focusing on my own problems. Last few months we worked with a new store manager who swapped with ours from another store. And with her, makes me wish for the jerk back. At least he got stuff done. This current manager is nicer to people face to face, but when it comes to doing work, shes awfully cruel."
bad,The management was terrible. Didn't check on other workers actually goofing off. had too pick up the slack.Then was told I needed too do more after saying so.
bad,"This company will not help you advance if that’s what’s you are trying to do unless you a an butt kisser. Every single manager in there has their favorites that they like to reward forget about even thinking they are going to give you hours (80) a week , they’ll cut your schedule down and give overtime to the favorite workers while you’re stuck working 16-24 a week"
bad,"If you want minimum training and goals that are difficult to achieve, come to Wal-mart.   Be prepared to work beyond a professional work week with no extra compensation, and be prepared to be blamed and held accountable for everything that goes wrong.  The associates and the company will never be responsible for anything that goes wrong.  You will be instructed to blame yourself, and you will have to come up with action plans to correct something out of your control.  The company will create policies that will halt any productive gains in any department, since they do not test in the field prior to implementation.  "
bad,Well been with company for 30 yrs and seems that the company is putting in management that know very little about retail skills and how to plan and build features.
bad,"I hated it!! My managers were mediocre at best and they NEVER cared for their employees,  and would lie to keep their jobs!!They were all out to save their own jobs and would throw their own employees under the bus for their own mistakes! They tried to fire me after my daughter was born."
bad,"First started in 2004 never once taking medication after 2 years diagnosed with high blood pressure, depression, and anxiety.  We use to have a 10 foot rule that we went by, later in years it stopped meaning within 10 feet you must speak or address whom ever walks in your path. It was stressful because really the managers that was there wasn't trained properly. When corporate would visit they would give a big performance then that's when the policy come in affect, management seems so nice and caring.... No they was putting on a big front for corporate. I am so grateful to be away from Walmart I have my dignity back, stress free. Thank you Jesus for answering my prayers.  Just wasn't comfortable with the aquisation they said about me after giving them my all for so many years 14years 10 months.  They showed me how much they cared for me. To God, be the glory."
bad,"I honestly kind of liked working here when I first started despite being told ""If you dont move faster I'm going to kick you so hard you'll feel it into next week."" And being forced to stay a couple hours past my scheduled time all on my first day. But the neverending cycle of problems has started to take it's toll and I'm hoping to find a new job that treats their employees like they matter."
bad,"From the beginning, I knew that I shouldn't have applied here. It's constant drama, older employees such as myself picking up slack from the teens-heck even from the older people too sometimes. I grew tired and numb to the whole thing. I've worked hard but daily I'm treated with disrespect and constant  pressure from everyone. You ask to change your schedule and the management will always avoid you. I've seen other employees working really fast and hard and still get treated poorly. My teacher from high school used to say, ""You must respect everyone. Because if you don't, it won't get you far."" I'd like to tell him about the people at Walmart because they keep moving up and the ones that work extremely hard, suffer. ""Ain't nobody got time for that""!"
bad,This wouldn't be a bad place to work but some of the management has no respect or integrity for any of thier employees they would humiliate and demene the associates
bad,"I worked here because the town I lived in had limited opportunities. The management is unacceptable, and you can be fired for the most asinine of reasons, even if you've never been disciplined, or coached as they call it. If a manager doesn't like you, that's all it takes."
bad,"The store I work at is a joke. They constantly have some type of drama going on and the management is the worst,They promote only the people they like, spread more lies than a hourly worker. and, when you call corporate nothing happens. They gave out rises and then cut hours. They changed attendance  to a point system and hired a lot of teenagers so it’s a constant revolving door of rude,disrespectful, loud mouth, ghetto people. This company needs to hold its employees to a better standard to make a better store."
bad,"Horrible management, seems like they don't know how time works. Always preaching customer service yet they want all the incoming freight done the same night as well as a zone. Multiple lockups and walking to the register every single time is time consuming and especially on a busy day"
bad,"Over the years Walmart has not had as much interest in their employees as much as they did when Sam Walton was alive. I feel like a lot of the benefits we received had been changed or totally removed. (profit sharing, sick and vacation time). Day to day was very busy. The sales volume kept us very busy."
bad,Everything at my store was unorganized. No one was held accountable for mistakes. Employees are allowed to call in to a hotline without getting it approved directly by the department manager so we were constantly understaffed which resulted in some people having to cover shifts with a split shift so they weren't getting paid overtime.
bad,"The management is very poor, the pay is unfair for the hours and amount of work put in, they take advantage of you and are inconsistent with the rules. Favoritisms is a big problem with the in store management."
bad,Management does not care about you.  They play favorites with everything.  My breaks were always something I had to fight for this includes lunch.  Sometimes an hour and a half late.
bad,"Department Manager are not knowledgeable. Horrible at scheduling, helping associate, and at customer service. Personnel is not resourceful to the needs of associates"
bad,"I transferred from NY to AL, my old walmart was good I loved my old store. this new store is ridiculous smh the assistant over my department is clueless as a door knob."
bad,Walmart is a very selfish company to work for. You will be overworked and underpaid. You will be constantly understaff and management does not try to fix the problem. They require you to complete multiple jobs some of which are not even in your job description. Many of the employees that they have are slackers and will make it difficult for acutal hard working people. Stay away from Walmart if you can.
bad,They have slow productivity and little help for the employees. They give decent breaks. There are heavy amounts of showing favorites. The work load is over whelming.
bad,They do not work with you on your schedules as a part time employee I asked to have my hours changed so I could attend college classes and they would not so I quit and lost my unemployment
bad,A typical day at work was standing on my feet in the same spot for about 3 hours until we got out breaks. The customers were generally nice and being in a small town you recognized many of the faces and were able to strike up a quick chat with them as you proceeded to check out their items they had purchased. The hardest part was when someone didn't have the money to pay for everything that they had paid for and so you had to deny them. Sometimes once in a blue moon you would find the good people with golden hearts who would help those who couldn't pay for their stuff and they would help them out. At one point I watch 3 people help a mother of 3 with one on the way and she was working and she had food stamps. They all helped her out. It made my eyes water up because it reminded me that there is still good left in this world. The management was iffy some days. They were all good people who hated their jobs sometimes and there were those who were truly rotten apples. I was lucky and unlucky to have both. I got more great managers than bad and to this day I can go in and see and talk to 2 of my favorite ones and catch up.
bad,The culture is a contradiction. One one hand they hammer patient care and safety but then on the other hand take away the staffing needed to achieve such.
bad,"the managers very rarely know what they’re doing. they tell you to do one thing but then switch you to do another and get upset when one of them isn’t done. scheduling is horrible, if you ask for days off you have to bug your manager to approve them and they always need a reason when you don’t have to give them one."
bad,It was a great learning experience for me. I was really  good at it but they didn't  give me the schedule  for my school hours. The managers didn't  respect  me because I was a minor and I needed them to over-ride everthing because of my age.
bad,The managers there dont follow company protocol. They believe only people who are lazy disrespectful and believe in dehumanizing people are the ones who deserves the title assistant manager or higher
bad,"They are rude to their employees, they act like they are better than you if they are in a higher position. most don't even try to help when it is needed. And expect more then one person can handle"
bad,Walmart only cares about their managers and themselves. They don’t care about the regular coworkers. If you try to complain about a manager they turn it back on you and try to get rid of you. If you are a managers favorite you get special treatments. You have to hunt down your manager everyday to get them to look at your request off and it’s a rare chance they will approve it because they are always reject it. Walmart wants you to give your life up for them.
bad,the pay was very good but the flexibility is horrible they don't let you take unexpected time off for family or anything else. the atmosphere was not bad.
bad,Wal mart just plain sucks.Management only cares about themselves and dont lift a finger to help you out.They will stand over you and  keep asking how ling will this take you.
bad,"Between management, the culture of Walmart customers and the policies, there was almost no reason to keep working here. My managers would regularly put their work off onto me, or when I was a department manager, would refuse to give any actual help."
bad,"I have worked at Walmart on and off for 20 plus years during different areas in my life .They are usually fairly easy to come back to as they are always hiring due to high turn over rates. Working at Walmart ,I usually enjoyed as I truly like working with and helping people. Working for Walmart is a whole different thing. You were able to put what hours you were available, but management would remind you over and over that you may not get any shifts if you didn't have open availability. This can be very hard for a single mother or father. Your hours are not always consistent and during lower peak times you could be scheduled for only 2 days a week. Considering the cost of living right now and that you usually are only hired for part time, most employees had two jobs. You do not receive any insurance as a part time employee for at least a year and it is limited. They have a new absence policy that is confusing and not explained very well. Management is 80 percent of the time not available and if they are it is obvious they have other things they need to do besides answering your concerns. To be fair management is usually under a lot pressure from upper management but it is a terrible cycle of disrespect for a place that demands respect for the individual."
bad,"I have been able to develop many effective skills pertaining to the business of retail."
bad,"They hire two part timers, work them to a frazzle, and give them no full time benefits or pay. Then they take a good employee like myself and fire them for going to the hospital. i was in 6 days. I told them i was going the day before i left. They just know they always have some pimpled face high school kid to fill your place. Good luck finding one 1/16th as good as me."
bad,Don’t count on having two days off in a row. Will not give a consistent work schedule. They have consistent training but management is so busy they cannot help when there is a disgruntled customer.
bad,"Slave shop. Over worked poor pay, will promise to promote you or give you a raise and it won’t happen, the upper managers change so rapidly and they never honor what your last store manager or manager promise, remember raises are given only annual and good luck if they remember or honor what the last manager promise. Under pay for sure"
bad,"I was a part-time employee and was constantly given 38-39 hours a week so I was just under the full-time mark. They were aware I was a college student and had agreed to giving me only 20 hours a week, but I always got twice that. Management is unprofessional and loves to gossip. They do not actually work/help the cashiers much. Management overrides at the registers took FOREVER. They never scheduled me within my available times and would not let me take off for my college graduation. They constantly made me stay past my shift because they did not hire enough people for the day, as if that's my fault. Breaks would not be given most of the time, and lunches were always 1-2 hours late. After standing for 10 hours at a register, can't say I really appreciate that. Terrible place to work."
bad,I liked some of the people I worked with but the manager would not make everyone do the same they would only make a few people work harder and let the others do what they wanted
bad,"Job in itself is not hard. Most of the work is very easy to do. However, the hardest part of the job is being short staffed. Sometimes it is very difficult to get everything done before the end of your shift. Most nights that I close, I have had to stay over 30 minutes or more just to complete all of the tasks required. The pay is not too bad. More than what I have made at other retail stores. However, I wish they would provide health insurance to part time employees."
bad,Friendly co workers. Good job to start out with until you have responsibilities and bills. Low pay and not that great benefits. Did not feel management was fair to employees.
bad,I've learned how to increase sales in a business and how to delegate certain tasks out to get the job done. I have worked on Black Fridays as a coordinator for the high ticket items. So I Know how to work under pressure and stress.
bad,"Schedules are very all over the place, you will never get a weekend off unless you request very much in advance and even then it may get denied."
bad,"At my Wal-Mart location management staff was VERY inconsistant. It was a case of ""too many chiefs and not enough indians"". There were those who did not abide with policy which made the job of a Customer Service Manager difficult as well as showing favoritism with certain Customer Service Managers. My location was known as ""the store that takes anything back"". There were SEVERAL occasions were I worked 8 to 10 days in a row before getting a day off. On 3 occasions 4 or 5 months passed before a weekend day was had off. Another Customer Service Manager received one or both Saturday and Sunday off EVERY weekend weeks AFTER we were told NO ONE would have entire weekends off. Again, favoritism."
bad,Terrible management won't back you won't make a decision could care less about their employees. Never worked for a company like this. Ever since sam died it has gotten worse.
bad,"stocking shelves. management is not very good here and very unorganized, "
bad,Stock merchandise and helped customers find what they was looking for. It can be very stressful and they expect you to do alot but barely wanna pay you or give you raises.
bad,The job at hand was fine but management was awful and always found a way to make sure you felt downed and they didn't allow you to advance if they did not like you.
bad,When I first started Walmart everything was smooth but then changes started to happen. New management came in and everything went down hill. The employees never have the proper tools they need to be successful daily and its jus a chaotic and inconsistent place to work for
bad,"Management is horrendous. ""Leaders"" would rather deligate than help leading to disgruntled workers who loathe coming into work instead of being the happy work environment its portrayed to be"
bad,Retail sucks. Walmart is the worst. They will give your 39 hours for a month then give you 12-19 when its tine for bonuses so the managers get the bonues and associates dont
bad,i really like working at walmart at first but now that i been there for 4 yrs the pay has not went up and the mangers is not good at all i really like work here if the mangers wasnt so mean
bad,"Lots of strange tastings going on all the time. HR dept seems to be mainly focused on those time frames. "
bad,I learned so much from my co-workers of home improvements.   I would pass what I learned.  And then there was the paint.  What paints was good in witch rooms.
bad,The job was okay but you just have the wrong people in the line of manager positions. They think that they can just treat you any kind of way but expect for you to be in a 'positive mood' after they've just gotten done disrespecting you.
bad,"A typical day at Walmart includes dealing with customers in a retail environment. You will learn how to deal with difficult customers on this job and how to interact with customers while delivering good customer service."
bad,Walmart is not all what it cracks up to be. Some are better than others. Management gets very pushy and too strict. They are constantly on the employees for not smiling and not getting enough surveys.
bad,Could be a good place to work if they knew how to schedule people. 6 hrs of work in 8 hours = ok. 14 hours of work in 8 = why the  **** not. Never a good job or thank you
bad,I been working for wlamart over 7 years I make as much as the people that just started all I enjoy my customers  and the people I work with on a daily basis!!  Management can careless about us!! A lack of respect  from management
bad,managers get more money for doing nothing and expect you to do everything for them after asking with zero respect. also the managers harass and sexually harass females which isn't allowed.
bad,"The amount of work at Walmart grossly exceeds the compensation. The management structure is okay, but promotions are not selected objectively; therefore, the managers themselves are often poorly suited to their jobs."
bad,"It was okay, did not get benefits. No set schedule. Always was rushed. To much drama. Everyone was always stressed out and tired. To much stuff going on at one time."
bad,It was ok at first but the pay is not even close to realistic for the work that is expected. Management couldn't care less about employees well-being.
bad,"You never know from wk to wk what hours or shifts u will get. Highly stressful and no communication. Managers micromanage everything and do not help at all. Company changes every quarter and someone is let go. They don't care about the people working for them nor do they want to. Associates are told to our faces that we are expendable and if we don't like it then don't let the door hit us on the way out. There is no loyalty from corporate. All we are is a payroll number that they want to loose to save a buck. Associates that have built this company are now having their jobs ""reconfigured"" and are left with no options but to quit or take the bad jobs that even mgt won't do. Corporate says they r improving with the times and they do this by eliminating the people who built the company. Hope the buck is worth the lives they ruin."
bad,Walmart is a very demanding company that I feel doesn't compensate fairly for the work expected. If you are a hard worker you're expected to pick up everyone's slack while they get little to no repercussions for not performing their job duties.
bad,"You are forced to stay after your scheduled hours and cannot get overtime. If you refuse to stay, you get fired. And from what I learned during employment, it isn't any better in other departments."
bad,"There are worse first jobs to have, but I had my fun with the team I worked with in the back. I wouldn't recommend it, but again in regards with your co workers you're all in it together."
bad,I learned a lot of great skills here but I also learned not to give so much to this job because they will take advantage of your ethic. This job breaks you down.
bad,"1. you don't get your full 40 hours."
bad,"stressful work environment, did not work around my schedule and was unpaid for overtime hours as a student, had to stay late some nights on school nights"
bad,"Constructive criticism comes in the form of belittling you not at all helpful in any way. Managers are very poorly trained & downright lazy, some obviously don't know how to be a manager. Too many dept managers who do not know how to assign work. It seems the good managers get fed up with the way things are done & they quit.. can't beleive this multimillion dollars company makes it mandatory associates work on Thanksgiving!!!!!!!!!"
bad,Management dont care or appreciate you I worked as a cap 2 stocker and there’s so many osha violations it’s ridiculous I’m shocked they are still open
bad,"During my time at Walmart I have worked 9 hour shifts with minimum break time, and got harassed at my job by older customers. not a fun time. if you wanna work there don't be a cashier"
bad,"couldn't get equipment, managers changers over 4 times in less than 6 months, no staffing, changed me full to part time no warning, overall this place sucked but each store varies"
bad,"The recent overhaul of the attendance policy took away any part-time employee under 3 years paid time off away. They claimed the $11 minimum increase to be your annual raise so people who were there a year starting at $9 an hour did not receive their annual raise when the minimum was increased. "
bad,unfriendly environment they can let you go for not reason even when your review in the past are good. the code of ethics are only in paper but they don't fallow policy. there is not direction from management and there is not training when roles change
bad,"Management is mostly poor. Hours are not flexible and management cares very little about a persons needs. Hostile work environment. Management would rather fire someone and hire a new employee than attempt to work with the current employee and reach a comprimise. There are no raises except for annual 2% raises. This leads to new hires consistently being hired at a rate of pay higher than that of existing employees, desptie a lack of experience, which causes a lot of friction between employees."
bad,Everyone talks bad about eachother Managers are lazy and they have lazy favorites its not that great tbh the pay should be more for the bs you have to put up with.
bad,"One of the worst places to work at. "
bad,"Bad management, terrible working hours and have to work every weekend while certain people that the higher ups know get to have them off. Me and a couple others were the only ones there that did our job and didn’t go hide and make someone else do more than their share. Did we get treated like we were the best workers? Nope, we got told to go do more work hat we weren’t even supposed to be doing. The breaks are nice you get a 15 min every two hours and an hour lunch."
bad,"I was with the company for 3 years on overnights, and rarely did anyone from my shift have ever been promoted. I was just about to get promoted but the at the last second they allowed the previous manager an extra week to come back, when they were gone for 3 months. The work day was stressful as they always wanted more from you even when you were working hard to begin with. The management didn't have a clue to what the associates were doing. And, if you even said the word union, you could get in trouble, as Walmart has a strict NO UNION policy. It was all just a laughable, sad experience."
bad,"I worked here as an early morning stock associate. The management was poor and lacked communication with each other. You'd only be allowed six days *a year* to call out. Even with a doctors note, you'd still get points for being absent. No absences were excused unless you previously got that day off approved. No work/life balance at all. Everyone who worked here was unhappy and hated the job. They paid no where near enough for the amount of stress that came with the job. The managers expected certain task to be done within a certain amount of time even though we were completely understaffed. Only holiday you'd for sure have off is Christmas day. Terrible job and I would NEVER go back here. Only good thing is the a flexible schedule with the days and amount of hours you'd want to work."
bad,"Not worth the time and bad management. I am lied to constantly about pay, hours, and job title. No reason to work here unless you're older and only need insurance not a job for younger kids trying to make a life for themselves"
bad,bad place to work bad management disrespectful to associates no flexable hours one week 40 hours next week 20 hours no compassion or respect for employees your just a number. employee turn over rate is real high.
bad,"Fast paced workplace, challenging projects, workplace has an upbeat and friendly vibe. Implements open door policy to make employees feel comfortable about issues"
bad,"Get to the door managers already handing you keys, vendors already waiting at the receiving door. Changed shift to 4am even though reports still print at the same time if you came in at 5am. So juggle checking in vendors, remember to get reports done, take break when and if you can even take a break. Finish vendors if they all show up when they're supposed to. Take lunch, come back to ups/fed ex/yellow freight. Check in merchandise as fast as you can cause it's expected of you to finish your tasks but then wait on managers to actually come pick up their stuff if they even communicate or come back at all, but also can fall on you if expensive merchandise isn't picked up. Also have to make sure vendor bins are slotted and labeled correctly, oh yeah, and bin signing as well. Clear out memo's, do close out report. Managers will have you bend the rules but if you get caught it will be on you, thus I am no longer employed. THANKS WAL-MART!!!"
bad,Entrei na empresa com o intuito de crescimento porém logo me desanimou saber que não seria promovido por meritocracia e sim por quanto o superior gostaria de mim
bad,"Mostly I appreciate the experience I gained at Walmart but at the end of the day I was just a number to them and nothing more, I wasn’t paid a fair wage and they didn’t care about my personal  success or growth."
bad,"I was fired due to not being able to miss days and my daughter was lifeflighted, I have the option to go back but I want to explore my options. Thats why I went to school to give me more options."
bad,Very fast pace in automotive department. Have to be fit and healthy to perform job. Annual raises got smaller. Not enough help that liked the job. Had job to support family. Had to get second job because was cut hours. Don't recommend this job to nobody. Herd its worst working there now than what it was back then.
bad,"Walmart needs to spend more time training their management team. From the assistants co-managers even the store manger. no one was on the same page."
bad,"If you are willing to put up with a lot, and I do mean A lot, the pay is commensurate. Because the work environment is political and sales driven, they not only have low employee appreciation, but also will insult your intelligence as a human being"
bad,Not Guaranteed Hours Crumby Scheduling Take Advantage Of Your Availability No Overtime Will Make You Leave Early at End of Week If You Hit 40hrs No Paid Holidays Management Very Unorganized
bad,"I only worked there due to my age no one else would hire me. I did not like it, it was boring and very very irritating. I do not know one person who works there who isn't trying to go somewhere else."
bad,Very bad management skills and poor communication skills through upper management/Human Resources. Strict attendance policy with non flexible schedules.
bad,Not the place to work if you don’t kiss a** they favor who they want and if you call in on Saturday-Sunday it’s two points automatically & holiday 3 points when you first start the first 6 months you only get 4 points then you’re terminated. If you have any appointments and no PTO to cover your hours you are terminated. Pregnant or got body pain dont go they don’t care about you.
bad,I found the store management poorly trained in regards to interacting with personnel.  This resulted in a lot of staff turnover  and poor morale among employees
bad,"This company just doesn't care. They don't care about their employees at all. If you are a single parent and have a sick kid... tough luck for you. You better just leave that kid to suffer alone or you will lose your job. My son was sick twice within 3 months, it was winter you know cold season and my son is only 3. I had two absences that I was told would be excused because of my son being sick. Wal-mart allows 4 absences total in your first 90 days. I had 4.5 absences... 2 my son was sick, 2 I was sick and the .5 because of being late. 2 of those I was told would be waved, however because the manager who had said she would wave it, was moved departments and I was fired. Honestly they were looking for an excuse to get rid of staff after the holiday season."
bad,Don’t care about their employees at all can be very high stress at time with unrealistic expectations and lack of man power or equipment to do your job
bad,"Due to lack of staff, stressful on associates that do come in to work. Management needs to take more responsibility and provide their employees with the tools needed to complete their jobs. Hardest part of the job is having to stretch ourselves thin and get stressed handling multiple things at once because we are low on staff and the staff we do have is barely capable. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people i work with. I am lucky to work with capable coworkers that make the work day bearable."
bad,"The typical Walmart type of job experience you would expect. Low pay long hours, terrible management, awful place to work if you have any sort of intellect at all!! Nothing makes sense, Leadership is lacking of knowledge on how to do their job, as well as lead their ""team members"". NOTHING is as CORPORATE states in printed materials, computer training is extremely outdated and has nothing to do with how things actually ""work"" on the floor. On the floor ""training"" is a total joke, you are taught by people who don't even know what they are doing, and don't care. Lots of gossiping, back stabbing, so if you like this sort of environment, then you'll love it there!! Otherwise take your application elsewhere, don't waste your precious time on these idiots!!"
bad,Typical temporary job. not a lot of room for advancement. management unwilling to work with people concerning life. management wait for people to mess up to fire.
bad,"Working at Walmart is an incredible stressful place from upper management to the newest hires.  The lives of the associates mean little to nothing for the overbearing corporate machine. At Walmart, you will be reprimanded for taking care of your ailing mother."
bad,"I only had one good manager in 3.5 years."
bad,"If you get a good manager,  walmart is a fun place to work. Unfortunately none of my managers were good. They were average on their best days. They have a new attendance policy that will affect your myshare (THAT YOU WORK HARD FOR). If you never call out you will receive 125% of your myshare but if you call out once you are at 100% and more call outs equal less myshare until you hit 5 points and are fired. They do have protected PTO for days when you need to call out and so you won't get a point. Only catch is that, the amount of protected PTO you earn is a joke."
bad,"They need more CSM’s up front to do price checks etc. for cashiers so the lines don’t back up. They also need more workers for when there are busy times and there can be multiple lanes open for customers,"
bad,"They expect too much out of you in the few hours that you're there. Policies stress you take breaks and lunch but management will have you working by their side until a task is done regardless. You'll be moved around in different departments and no pay raise. Very hard to move up even with 5 years experience but that varys store to store. I wouldnt recommend unless absolutely necessary. They never hire full time unlesss you're getting a management position. Favoritism, the personnel are no help and direct you to management."
bad,"Be expected to do other associates jobs and do other unpaid job titles. If you tell the managers the problems you have with other associates for example, if you are a victim of harassment or other associates leave a spill in you're work area, the managers would either yell at you or just ignore you and shrug it off. Favoritism  is very common in this company. A job in this company should be viewed as a temporary commit and not a long term commit."
bad,"not the best place to work, its walmart what did you expect? managers at my walmart are hypocritical and tell you to do work, but do none themselves.."
bad,"the management was terrible, when i started i told them i needed my wedding day off at the time they said they would work with me when the time came they refused to give that day off to me there is no job advancement you are treated very poorly"
bad,"If you work in the receiving end of the store, you are not compensated for work you do. It is a lot of hard work unloading trucks piece by piece and case by case for $11 an hour."
bad,The only thing i did like was the coworkers that worked in the deli department. Then when it was time for me to clock out the CSM would take forever to come relieve me and whoever I worked with. I worked as a self check out host.
bad,"Taught me Great Customer Service, Typical day at work would be just making sure the Customer is first Priority. The Managers were always understanding. I think the hardest part of the job would be sometimes communication, there would be a lack of communication with coworkers."
bad,Not too many people take the job seriously with no fault of their own. Managers like to hide and schedules are a mess. Undeserving and unqualified people are promoted while if you are a good worker you probably stay where you are so  they can keep you working to finish tasks promptly. If you can find better I recommended that you do.
bad,"I enjoyed the customers, and I was never given any opportunities. I was seeking benefits, and it took me 9 1/2 years to get full time. When you give 110 percent to the customers, it is hard not to be recognized by the management team. I felt that I was playing tug of war with the management because I did a great job with the customers and I still serve them in my new jobs."
bad,"I moved up to CSM 6 weeks after starting. But, no proper training and learning on the fly is no way to be successful at your job. Too many chiefs and not enough Indians. None of them are on the same page. One tells you to do something when another comes up and says what are you doing?! No no no no we don't do it like that. And when you open your mouth to say well so and so told me to they say well so and so is wrong without ever correcting the other so and so. Blind leading the blind. GET ON THE SAME PAGE!!"
bad,"Just like the title says, they say they care but they don’t. It’s a shame considering how much of a mega corporation they are. This place is very demanding and very tiring."
bad,lack a managers doing their job !!!!!!  keeping a eye on wrong people & not knowing how to manage their store along with being lied to from any & all managers including store manager !!!!!
bad,walmart has great things to offer however they will work you with little to no return your not allowed to keep your overtime they expect you to uphold a standard that management doesnt uphold
bad,Worked for Walmart for four years and had to earn promotion but it stopped after the first one. The management there is really bad at communicating with employees about the day to day task and they expect you to work in a busy department by yourself that requires at least three people. When asked management wouldn't supply us with the tools we needed to do our job.
bad,"Working here as been one of the most stressful jobs I have personally ever had. I work what is called Fresh Cap 2, so I work 1 to 10 every night and am expected to do so much more work than I can physically do, usually by myself."
bad,"The company does not care about people anymore. Its all about managing a score card. They don't care how you get it done, no excuses just get it done."
bad,Too many bosses. The manager will not work or have knowledge of the department. Too many employees that steal especially the younger kids. Too many employees just walking around. High turnover over due to theft.
bad,"I worked in Cap 2 which means I was an unloader. We had at least four people on the line and that was on a good day because the managers always wanted someone on pets, water, or going out to get the carts when there isn't a cart runner working. The managers expected us to finish with the GM truck at a certain time when we were down four people."
bad,the management here is easily the worst ive ever dealt with. they would sometimes make us break company policy just for their benefit and then they would yell at us for having broken policy. the environment was negative and employees were more rude than customers sometimes.
bad,"It does not matter what role you have at Walmart, it is strictly who you are friends with.  If management did not like you, they pull you from your department to work in other departments.   It was worse than High School, they way rumors where spread.  I am proof that if they don't like you for whatever reason they will even lie.  I never worked Sundays, yet they fired me for leaving keys on the counter in the photo lab or electronics, that was January of 2016. They hold no value to Walmart was originally built on."
bad,Walmart is a slave factory as far as in shipping and there is no raises for the hard working person.Mechanics just got a 2.60 raise but as far the people who work their tails off they gave us a 70 cent raise(A SLAP IN THE FACE!!!!)I would encourage nobody to apply there.
bad,"Management was poor, I was left wondering around not knowing what to do. They wouldn't give me a work vest. I still haven't been paid for the time I was working up until the time i left."
bad,Poor Management. Does not apply rules to everyone equally. Managers bully associates they don't like and coddle ones they like. Inconsistent enforcement of rules.
bad,They are geared more to stock holders than associates.  Currently phasing out employees with 10+ years of experience and replacing with temps. 2 breaks on 10 hr shift with no lunch.
bad,"I mean, the title of the store is pretty self explanatory. However, if you are willing to put up with some of the nastiest customers ever for $11.50 an hour than go for it."
bad,"Anyone who falls somewhat short of the expectations of walmart are nearly immediately cut, with little to no time to improve on ones abilities, and very few of those who do manage to become favored by management receive raises regardless of the additional tasks and duties they require of you."
bad,The managers did not care about there workers. when you ask them a question that they would not get back to you. The managers are more worried about the customers instead of there company.
bad,"This job was fun at first, especially since it helped me start learning about food and all. I noticed that one race was heavily favored not just in deli/bakery, but throughout the store it seemed. I was told that I would be a cake decorator after I learned the basics in deli, but in the four or five months I was at this store, I did not get trained at all in any of bakery. We kept getting new assistant managers and no one would tell us. A couple of the favorites associates will talk down on you and belittle you like there is no tomorrow! The store manager told us that we need to leave at our scheduled time to do so, but those favorites associates would make me start something before I had to go home and wouldn't let me clock out until it was finished, which would be 30 minutes to an hour after I was supposed to leave. Do NOT work for this deli/bakery!"
bad,They changed the policy recently and updated the new schedules. Most of the employees are not happy with the new schedule that home office has put out. The fulltime employees don't get the hours they need and the part time employees get the hours. They also updated their absence policy and if you call in to many times you do not get the quarter bonus that the store makes by its sales.
bad,Managers play favorites and the drama is similar to that of high school with a lot of coworkers talking behind peoples backs and forming cliques. Occurrences (calling out due to illness or clocking in early or late/leaving early points) seem to only matter if management doesn't like you. Otherwise they will approve your occurrences or ignore them if you go over for an extended time.
bad,They want the work completed with very few employees to handle the workload on a daily basis.There are not enough employees to work any one department.
bad,"A great place to start out with for entry level people wanting to learn how to keep up on basic maintenance on their own vehicles like oil changes, but not a place to actually advance your skills on repairs."
bad,I wouldn't recommend working at a Walmart store to anyone. At least the store I worked at management was horrible they wouldn't allow overtime but you had to be at work anyways to show you were on time.
bad,"Walmart offers advancement opportunities but when it comes down to actual advancement it never takes place.  The management team is very culturally selective o who they advance."
bad,"Essential departments are paid lower wages than less essential, overtime hours are punished but required for most positions to meet goals, upper management shows observable disconnect from everyday activities and lower management shows extreme stress from the latter. They have low hiring standards. Half the people you work with won't know or care about what they're doing, leaving the rest to pick up the extra work. This results in high turnover. They hire new batches of employees frequently yet they still manage to be understaffed in every department."
bad,"Company is based on who you know, not what you know. Favoritism is shown on a daily basis. Upper Management bullying happens on a constant daily basis. Terrible company to work for as they do not take care of their associates."
bad,"I’ve worked with Walmart for over a year and at every level of management, everyone is for themselves. We’re supposed to be a team environment but instead the employees are legit mistreated and disrespected by upper staff."
bad,"If you are lucky to have a great boss you can achieve what you want, if you don't you are screwed."
bad,Can’t rely on anything they say. They have no idea on how to run a business. Yes they been around for awhile. But it’s all about upper level management getting all the money. I don’t recommend shopping or working for this pathetic company.
bad,It was an okay place to work. The management at my store was absolutely terrible. The only reason I stayed for as long as I did was because of the friends I made.
bad,"Management did not handle their roles very well, some were very under qualified. The culture was not aligned, there were cliques and favoritism among scheduling and placement. Employees constantly complained, there were no praises from management or compensations. I was provided the role of being a cashier then told that if I worked in Customer Service, money Center I would receive a raise. I never got a raise nor any recognition for going to that department with out any training or knowledge and completing tasks to the best of my abilities."
bad,"good people to work with besides the managers, its a job to get you by you wont move up in the company unless your sucking up to the bosses doing your job and showing up will not get you there"
bad,"Under no circumstances would I recommend working for the Twin Falls Walmart."
bad,The company throws you in with little to no training and then gets mad when you don't work fast enough or to their standards. They do give two 15 minute breaks and an hour lunch however I wasn't even informed of that until my second week out of training.
bad,It would be a better place to work if everybody would mind there own business and just get the appointed job done. To much drama for such a simple job.
bad,"Management constantly is breaking policy on returns and allows things to be brought back that are used. Anything from pregnancy tests to $500.00+ items without receipts. The hardest part of the job is not knowing if I'm going to be fired for doing the right thing. "
bad,Employees aren't paid high enough for the customer service issues with customers and the work they have to complete on a daily basis. Its like working in a prison with all the rules.
bad,Unable to keep a team set for a task and keep that team in tact. Due to attendance policy unable to keep new people for long and people that had been there a while got different treatment
bad,"Under the new format of Fresh Cap 1 there is never enough time to do all that is expected of each associate in a shift. When it started there was to be eleven workers per shift.Now there are four, and still the same amount of work or more.Management is hostile and rude.Quality and customer satisfaction have taken a back seat. In place of it, is protocol and payroll. It used to be an enjoyable job,hardwork and pride in what you achieved.Now, you wait to hear what you did wrong each day no matter what the circumstances were."
bad,Waste of 7 months of my life. Management terrible and not willing to help struggling staff. Raises were non existent and supervisors/management were brought from other stores not knowing how to operate the store at all.
bad,It was very slow and not very organized. When I needed help there were managers around to help me. If you wanted help you were going to have to search the entire for managers even then you might've not found any.
bad,"Usually go in to morning staff leaving majority of the work undone, managers will blame you after you clock in. If something doesnt look right they chastise you even if they dont know what your department works like. Managers act superior in every way just because they're managers and the store manager ignores it like its not an issue that everyone hates half of the managers only because they act entitled. The managers will fire you behind your actual managers back for something that is meant to be a write up like call outs being 1 over and make you feel like your nothing. They'll then rehire someone who called out 24 times in the same amount of time but say no to you. Also if they feel like it they won't give you a bonus. I worked there long enough to get the Christmas bonus and they never gave it to me.instead they fired me a week before christmas."
bad,"Hours were always either to long, or to short. manager was to lazy to actually manage, we were all self managed due to this, and no one seemed to care."
bad,"Walmart is notorious for being a bad company to work for. I'm sorry to say this review will not be changing anyone's mind. I have worked for Walmart for the past two years. I began as part-time, working 20-30+ hours a week. After about nine months I was able to finally secure a full-time role with the company. My hours only occasionally hit 40 per week. Most often I worked 32-36 hours a week. Sometimes, though, they dipped as low as 20-30. Over the past year that I was supposed to be ""full-time"" I've worked more weeks closer to 32 than 40. To make matters worse, they often gave me short shifts so I was working five days a week, but only getting part-time hours. Walmart jobs are not for anyone who is serious about earning a pay-check."
bad,Wal-Mart is not a great place to work. Your expected to do the work of 3 people but they only want to pay you half of that. No overtime allowed. You don't always get 40 hours. Management is horrible and it's hard to advance. The pay and benefits are not enough to live off and suck.  You have to deal with rude people both customers and co workers
bad,"I fill orders that were placed online for grocery and other items. "
bad,"Very stressful, working as a truck unloader you work at a breakneck speed. There is no recognition for hard work performance. My stores managers were rude and I don't think the money was ever worth the effort."
bad,I've been working at Walmart for 16 years alot has changed their hours and the way they treat their employees. My family and I cannot live with 16 hours for a week that's unacceptable and I am unable to provide like I need to for us.
bad,The open door policy is just for show they will schedule you against your availability and they want you to do the work of 5 people so they can save money
bad,It can be stressful at times but great customers can make a days work worth while. As it is a very team based environment the difficulty or level of stress that is associated with the job can be determined almost entirely by whoever your particular manager happens to be.
bad,I didn't felt like I was wanted at the job. I felt like they was mad at everything I do. Didn't like one bit. I was working to get some money and I have don't ever want to work there ever again.
bad,"Honestly worst choice I made, managers don't care about you they care about PRODUCTION you get WRITTEN UP IF YOU GET HURT. No days off and Mandatory overtime without thought about where your children are going to be or any of that MONEY HUNGRY"
bad,The Walmart company I feel like means well but the overall lack of care for their employees didn't produce a good work environment. A typical day at work was busy and unorganized in the pharmacy. I learned a lot about technician work and I found it overall enjoyable to be able to work with people so closely. My manager was excellent but the people that were over him limited his ability to care. I enjoyed the interactions that I got to experience everyday with each customer and the ability to help them in any way that I could.
bad,Bare minimum staffing and emphasis on pushing products out the door over anything else. The thin veneer of community service and charity is ringing hollow over the rapacious corporate takeover of American small businesses. Wal-Mart is a monopoly and cannot fix it's own major problems without anti-trust law intervention.
bad,"Like most people, I'm working here to get my foot in the door. I'm only here until I find something better suited to my experience and skill set. Being a stockman is a rough physically demanding job. Most days I walk between 13-18 miles. I do find helping with carryouts to be quite rewarding,personally."
bad,My co-workers were very pleasant with me but my overnight shift came with health and safety concerns. There were also severe management issues and it was generally not an appropriate environment for a 19 year old girl.
bad,"Walmart is fast paced with high turn over. They will push people through the training and even have other people take the tests for them. They try to keep everyone part time ,so it's very hard to get benefits and full time. Management is very slow to respond to the front end which in turn exacerbates the situations they are needed to deal with. Different managers will give you different direction on handling situations so it is difficult to know what to do. There is definitely a cliquishness with the employees that makes it  a lot like high school. This can make it difficult for new people to fit in. I also was shocked at the amount of interpersonnel dating and relationships going on in this store, which in turn makes working tere very uncomfortable at times. While through out the training they tout customer first as their policy it is not followed through on at any level in the store. It is extremely difficult to find help or to even get back up doing busy times. This is especially stressful on any middle management roles in the store."
bad,I would not recommend working for this company due to the point system regarding late and absents. no one can know when and mishap will cause some one to run late. if a person falls sick at work and leave work it should no count against them. I feel as far as absents they should be a penalty if it is a unexcused absent. the employees are friendly but the upper management need some work.
bad,worked long hours and was treated like poo not a job I would have people I hate do. the pay was ok but you killed yourself for it. the boss I had was a complete jerk
bad,"learning ground to deal with many issues and people. I have learned many talents working for this company is how to deal with people, how to work as a team with co-workers and management. It has made me confident I can go back to management. This job has taught me how to deal with stressful issues while remaining peaceful,"
bad,"No longer family oriented as it once was. They have went to only running the general merchandise side of the store, we will get two trucks sometimes 4500 -5000 pieces and only 4 or 5 associates to run all freight, clean up and go to grocery side to zone."
bad,"Micromanaged despite hypocritical philosophy of pharmacy ""ownership.""  A new policy or direction was promoted weekly; impossible to follow.  All my efforts and hard work are ignored."
bad,was a good place to work. struggled with the switch of over night managing when they switched every so often. as they would push others to work harder than most. so the not being treated equally was just thrown out.
bad,"My coworkers were fun to work with but when it came to my managers and Walmart itself, not so great. Very strict! I was exceptional at my job but my managers still had something to complain about. Gave me a hard time working there even though I was just part and going to school, which they knew about when I told them during my interview. They wanted me to put my job before school."
bad,"Even though Wal-Mart gives its employees excellent pay, fantastic rewards,  and benefits; the hours are inconsistent and the management is lousy. Work is done inefficiently with little to no communication. Management is disrespectful and retaliates against employees by scheduling outside of availability and taking away shifts even though it's against policy."
bad,It’s really tough to give up my 20 years of dedicated service with Walmart .   Where would I. go from here?  I enrolled myself to take a class to start a new job.
bad,Loved the job I did at Walmart for 10 years.  Then the company started making a lot of changes.  Employees were no longer treated like they were valued assets.
bad,"Didn't feel like they understood or cared that you had a home life outside of work. upper management was very unreasonable. My department manager was rude to older customers right in front of me and it truly was hard to work with. loved my job and what I did, but coworkers were always in a bad mood and hard to work with."
bad,Most of the people who get hired at walmart have no common sense. Most of management are to stuck up to even say hello as you walk past them. And scheduling is horrible and then management gets mad at you when you have costumers are being rude and disrespectful causer they want there stuff now when i have a line of about 7 who also want there stuff now.
bad,"Poor management led to me quiting they wouldn’t pay me for my overtime, would ask me to work let them demand me to cut my hours. No sick days as well. I was yelled at for missing one day where I was in the hospital with kidney stones and had a doctors note."
bad,"Typical Day consisted of greeting customers on a daily basis."
bad,"management could never communicate properly among themselves to get on the same page about where they were pulling employees from and what departments or tasks were being covered. they also used to love working part timers 40 hours a week for 11 weeks, and on the 12th week of working your hours were slashed to 12 hours so they could avoid making you full time."
bad,Co workers of Walmart bash remodel employees just because we are there and say we are in there way and that we are useless. The pay for remodel employees is very low for what you’re required to do. If you are good at your job then they have you doing everything in they need done.
bad,"My typical day had ranged quite a bit. The work was always changing to meet certain expectations. The photo center position wasn't too bad, but apparently I accumulated some anonymous hate mail, which I was later lead to believe was just an excuse to move me to the backroom work. There, I did well enough to be recognized as a good worker by my coworkers, unfortunately my supervisor seemed to have it in for me and worked with the same manager that got me moved before to move me to the lowest station in the store, Maintenance. Where I had the lowest pay grade, had to do their expected work for a janitor, and STILL had to work backroom, as well as run miscellaneous jobs for the other employees, such as running back and forth to collect things from them and assist customers carry out large items, while having to run to the bathrooms and clean them and empty every garbage container around the store. I would consistently be yelled at for not getting to a bathroom, when it was feasibly impossible. Such as during black friday crowds. Or when the ladies room accumulates many users of the facility. Being male, I need to wait outside politely. So I tend to go do my other tasks, and be berated for not getting to the bathroom immediately. I was also frequently sent out to assist the cart pushers bring in carts. I did every job in the store for the least amount of pay possible, and had constant harassment from the management about my job. It's bad when the most enjoyable part is the time you get to spend away from doing any of your actual tasks just to assist a customer with something."
bad,"La empresa no es mala, si no quien la administra, que se valore el trabajo de cada empleado, al personal de nuevo ingreso que sea capacitado las veces necesarias por el lider y subgerente del area a cargo, que generen un buen ambiente de trabajo ya que es una de las empresas con demasiado trabajo a presion y mas en las temporadas."
bad,I didnt care for my job at walmart much. the hours were longer than what i was required to work on many days. Some depatments didnt know where their workers were wha=en a customer needed help.
bad,"Since Sam Walton died and his children no longer run the company, it is a very unfriendly place to work.  I do not recommend it to anyone, whereas I used to.  Sad...."
bad,Most customers were rude and argumentative.  Managers were pushy and made threats if we didn't get our share of credit cards.  The attendence policy is targeted to get rid of a good employee if they get sick or injured.
bad,Management only cares about making a dollar. Being under staff is not a priority. Going to management about your issues is a waste of your time. You just suck it up and keep struggling.
bad,"Not only do they pile on a lot of work on a single individual but management has the gall to literally get angry at you if you don't get the job done quickly, especially if you are working on your own. If something breaks down, and gets damaged or damages property, regardless if it is unavoidable or accidental, expect to be written up. Don't always expect to learn anything either. They will literally make changes to how things are done and will expect you to literally learn on the fly. Computer based learning is nice, but the policies learned and the ones used are completely night and day. Management also, from my experience, has a tendency to gang up on individuals they don't like, finding any little thing they can to get you written up or terminated. Also areas of the store, especially the receiving bay, are often left a mess by other associates on other shifts, like evening, or over-nights. Quite often management will lay blame on the day associates, yet never bother to actually monitor the other associates working different times or even their janitorial staff on the matter. Also there isn't any growth in certain departments. Once you are there, don't expect to go anywhere unless it is getting fired. And don't expect any one working with you to actually go out of their way to lend a hand if the aid doesn't mutually benefit themselves. In the end, the benefits and bonuses they offer are not worth the pain you will go in getting them."
bad,managers do not respect employees at all just push them to work hard. The company offers nothing to employees except their salaries and little benefits
bad,"Only work at walmart if you don't mind customers being rude, bossy, or wanting to complain you don't know how to do your job. It was an okay position, but the company wants you to do so much. You don't get paid enough, and if you're part-time you get no benefits. Almost everyone is part-time, there's rarely any full-time positions."
bad,"Answer back to back phone calls all day, providing status updates and explanations why patients orders are running behind. Held to strict metrics, i.e. actions per hour, calls per day, adherence, quality and customer service survey. Work schedule changes every week and break schedule changes daily. Almost impossible to use PTO, most people end up taking an occurrence. Poor leadership, poor direction from leadership, unorganized and dysfunctional. The culture is not what they preach, and forget trying to network, job shadow, have introductory interviews or meet with your mentors on a regular basis.The restrooms at the contact center are some of the most disgusting restrooms I have ever been in."
bad,Walmart does not care how long you have worked for them. They have taken away dozens of benefits for workers who have been loyal to the company. Their pay is good if you first start but they made no point in creating a differential for those who were working there. Many associates who have been there longer are paid less than brand new associates. They say they have flexible scheduling but it is a lie. It is completely dependent on whether or not their computer generates hours for you. If the computer does not they refuse to put you on the schedule and you are just out of luck.
bad,"I started working a remodel.  I had extensive retail experience but when the remodel was over, I was not offered a job.  I had to go back to them and insist that they did not fit me in as a cashier.  I was eventually put into the grocery department then made department head of the candy asile."
bad,"Often given work for more than one person, pressured to stay longer to get the job done, but required to take that time off at a later date within the week. Never enough people for what the job requires. Management pretends to care about employees until the employee needs them, then they are punished and abused (mentally and emotionally) for having a life outside of the job. Given a certain amount of days to call in, however tormented and punished by not being given hours if you use them."
bad,Los mánager no te ayudan tienen preferencias con otros empleados te exigen mucho para la poca paga quieren que termines un trabajo que se requiere de tiempo en 15 minutos no t ayudan
bad,Management at Walmart is very poor. People are promoted all the time that should not have ever been. Pay here at Walmart is does not even out with the cost of living here in NWA.
bad,There's like 8-10 types of managers and only 2 are actually decent n know what to do n they don't even have the power to do what they need to do. There's no work life balance the place is a revovling door of employees because they don't appreciate their ppl. They mess with ppls schedules too much nothing is consistant  and they can't keep their head on  what policy they wanna follow
bad,"came to work punch in and work your shift then punch out and go home. but there be time we had to work over without be commentated for. Didn't like the 5 hour rule, which cost  me my job."
bad,My experience at Walmart was the worst. I have never seen such poor management mainly coming from the store manager. I felt pressured most of the time and also ver stressed out. Walmart was just a temporary job as I progress to my nursing career.
bad,A typical work day consist of checking to see my coverage.Making sure that station are set up for customer service.Learning how to handle difficult customers is the hardest because everybody is different. Always keeping a smile on my face was the culture friendly help to help.
bad,Was left to close by myself several times. Had to run the deli by myself several times. They would say they were going to send someone to help and never would.
bad,Management always had complaints about the work you do. They always want you to do more with less. They want you to come in on short notice. They change your schedule even after they tell you that they won't. They lie about nearly everything.
bad,"Poor management "
bad,"Always someone is there to get you. Continuous discrimination, harassment and foul language. Management is unskilled. Any favorite or spouse of someone who made it can be manager in training. Poor guidelines for selection of skilled professionals."
bad,"I actually love my job at Walmart, but the atmosphere that you have to adjust to working in can become very toxic sometimes. You have to work so close with these people and for so many hours that you begin to see them more then your real family. The management at Walmart does tend to expect your job to come before your family and your health, which I am not a big fan of, but overall it pays the bills."
bad,"Management treats their employs like garbage, doesn't think of their employees only thinks of their company. Worst place I have ever worked... I do not recommend anyone works there unless they are desperate for work."
bad,"it was an okay place to work, it just didnt work for my family anymore because hours were all over the place, nothing constant worked every weekend.  if the schedule was more regular it would have been better"
bad,The company is slowing going down in the fairness of treatment of the employees.  They are eliminating positions on a regular basis and forcing employees to take shifts not desired to obtain the full time position.  The newer employees are receiving as much as employees that have given years of service.
bad,"During the interview everything is fine. But once you get hired, that all goes out the window. They ask you for your availability and disregard it. I applied for part-time but was given four hours less than what would equal full-time. When I brought it to the attention of management, I was put in the schedule one day during one pay period. If management likes you then they make sure you move around in the store. If you don’t participate in their gossip you’re labeled a trouble maker and they look for ways to make your working there horrible. I watched as three GREAT Customer Services Manager left, while the lazy ones continued to be promoted."
bad,I've been at Walmart for almost two and a half years and within that time period I've been asking to switch departments but always was given the run around about why they haven't transferred over yet.
bad,"mostly stressful, currently inconsistent hours. most stress come from leader ship. work is tedious and pay is almost at a livable wage in the state of Florida. but i mostly frustrated with the lack of advancement available along with the ease of ""roadblocking"" with the slightest ability to put a write on your file with a duration of year too follow before it falls off. outside of that the job is what you make of it."
bad,"Enjoyed dept worked in, dept manager and employees worked good together.  Didn't like they kept scheduling me to work past my available hours on application.  Asked to correct but was never done."
bad,Most of the managers think they are God's gift to the world and everyone should bow down to them. Most of the employees have no idea what customer service means.
bad,Managment from the CEO to the floor manager in stores are horriable and in professional. Managers rely on associates to do their jobs. The ro ok m for advancement is little to none.
bad,The work was not hard but it was really hectic because of communication.  One supervisor would tell you to do something one way and one would tell you to do another way.  The good things are that my co workers were all friendly and worked together really well.
bad,"Longest and most stressful years of my life were spent at Walmart. They work you to death with no one to help. Extremely short staffed. Promises of advancement that never happen. Management too concerned with ""coaching"" everyone instead of giving helpful feedback that could improve employees."
bad,Cashiering while providing excellent customer service. Learned how to work a cash register and different till options. Work pace can vary throughout the day.
bad,"Not a healthy place to work...no raises"
bad,"Each management change, less hours given. Management isn't on the same page, one manager would tell us to do one thing and another would come around and tell us to do it differently."
bad,It was fact paced and hectic as soon as you log in your register form scanning the groceries and ensuring the customers don't leave there bags of items.
bad,"A typical day at work was productive, the job itself was challenging with room for advancement."
bad,"I arrive at Walmart. Take a quick summary of how the front is running where breaks are for cashiers customer service money center. I then begin to run the gambit of trying to find who can cover what break. I run around crazy and have to stop what I am doing for every approval needed on a return or a complaint about the lines from customers. Or anything else they want to complain about. Then you have managers above you screaming about this or that that needs to be handled. Is it all bad no. I love my customers who are kind considerate and understanding. There are a few good Managers in every store. If you are able there is friendships and compadres but be warned they will through you under the bus to save their own skin. Walmart is a dog eat dog world where only those who are favorites will move up. You are never thanked. (except by customers.) Dont expect any hand holding in any position you take there is none they throw you to the wolves."
bad,They treat you like you still in high school not fair with everyone they go by favoritism not understanding with school schedules threaten your job titles false advertising always has attitudes.
bad,This location in particular is horrifically under staffed and most of the managers (at least when I was there) don't have an idea how to run the store. Associates constantly have to solve issues that their department manager should have been dealing with and when not dealt with in a timely fashion are written up or given a verbal warning. There is barely any way to move up in the store unless you are someones favourite. The people that work here are the best people around though. You would never be alone considering everyone else has something to complain about how the store runs versus how it should be run. The hardest part about being at Walmart was watching this store slowly start to crumble under itself while the managers would give little guidance due to lack of training or lack of a motivation.
bad,"Terrible store and lackluster management, Treated as a number, if you were forced to work overtime you were scolded and hours were taken away by extending lunch breaks or by being sent home early. As of the time writing this, the store manager I worked for has long since been relocated to another store and then terminated at said store."
bad,At the Wal-Mart I worked at was very cut throat.  And I'm very sorry to have to say that but it was . The mangers were pitting employees against each other all the time
bad,"The only part of working for this company that I felt good about was receiving my cheques. Terrible management, uncomfortable work environment and quite lacklustre pay."
bad,We were not given clear answers to moving and severance from the company.   To many issues to list here. Not best enough space to voice my concerns. You really don't want my true feelings.
bad,"There is favoritism among managers with some staff. "
bad,"I’ve been working at this location for three and a half years, and have tried [multiple times] to move to higher-paying positions, but have been benched in favor of other associates who have worked here longer (even though I’m consistently more qualified for the position). Working in my own department  has been a pain, as I’m too often pulled to work in another area (due to a blatant lack of staffing),  for which I often have little to no formal training. Managers prefer to offload as much work (while offering as little information and meaningful help) as possible."
bad,"Walmart is a company that is more concerned with not hurting anyone's feelings than they are with making it a decent place to work. They will promote their favorites and leave the people who know what they're doing, who work hard every day, who always get their work done, at the bottom of the ladder. It's better to be lazy in Walmart because you're more likely to get a promotion. If you disagree with the store manager, she will make your life terrible. She'll throw extra work on you, give you bad evaluations so you dont get a raise, treat you like scum.  It doesnt matter if you work 10X harder than someone else, Walmart will not pay you more than them. Everyone gets the same pay raises regardless of how hard they work."
bad,"Employees barks commands instead of managers, doean't treat people with disability well, manager gets emotionally involved instead of being professional."
bad,Walmart is not a good place to work they have poor management lack of communication the management is terrible they peak around the corner to make sure you are working they hide in the recked
bad,management may say open door but in reality the door is shut and locked. they didn't want to hear anything you had to say. scheduled outside of availability.
bad,Coworkers were really helpful but the cashier manager wasn’t all that helpful and overall rude for no apparent reason. They don’t work with the schedule you provide them which can frustrate you.
bad,"Extremely stressful work environment, company directive changes from min to min.  Store managers do not know how to talk to associates. Associates are abused"
bad,"most streesfull job iv'e ever  had,no room to move up the ladder,you work your butt off to make a dept. look nice and in stock,the other associates destroy your hard work by stocking improperly not zoning and the store mgr blames you for their mess"
bad,"Working at Walmart was going to be a temporary job. But I got in I liked it and my Coworkers, and thought career. But when my safety and the safety of my coworkers was not a priority for management I began to think differently. Being left alone in the shop, used oil filters on racks falling into staff eyes, equipment not bolted down resulting in serious injury to a coworker, tire work being done while alone in the shop, and customers roaming around in the shop, just to name a few. Favoratism to management relatives, no consequences for bad behavior and management telling you to quit whining and do your darn job is very unprofessional, but it happens and in front of customers."
bad,"Overall there's a good work culture, but management can be very deceiving.  It is especially true for pharmacy technicians being promised of a raise of $2 more if one has become nationally certified after the 90 days probation period.  I was hired as certified pharmacy technician from day 1, but that never happened.  When I raised this concern during one of our meetings, after 3 weeks I was instead displaced and given the option to work in the front register of the grocery department (outside the pharmacy) for 2 months and then they will decide whether or not to keep me.  I was practically ""laid off"" for no apparent reason.  The reason they gave was that the company is cutting hours."
bad,Walmart is a awful place to work at. They managers are very rude and they don’t care about the employees at all. The pay are good and that’s it . They really is not a good company. They have you on a call out rude they don’t care if you have kids or not.
bad,"Managers were able to have little to no influence on the decision-making process. Communication was erroneous when attempting to convey significant information from one manager ot the next. Collaboration was moderate; however, the lack of communication was the primary issue of concern."
bad,"Working at Walmart in the graveyard shift was interesting to say the least. During this time, a different culture of people would come in. It was sometimes quieter at night than during the day,but not always."
bad,Management was poor an the help they have or concerns they have for they’re employees doesn’t matter! Not a good work environment! Doesn’t have family oriented
bad,"they don't care about their employees all they care about is putting more money in their own pockets. they wont hire more people because they get a big bonus by keeping employment down, they just move people from one department to another department to keep cost down."
bad,Management was very poor and rude . The whole store is unorganized and they lack respect for fellow associates . Nothing good to say about this job at all
bad,"I worked extra hard for a year and got my hours cut, wrote me up for the littlest of things, including not working hard enough. They don't care about their employees."
bad,ceci est un emploi temporaire en attendant une meilleure situation
bad,managers don't care if you have kids they will keep you at work they are not flexible if you cant work the hours they want you wont get any and they will keep someone they like and fire the least favorable. and sexually harassment problem
bad,Upper management is poor and unorganized...not professional...associates unhappy but scared of change to get out...its a paycheck..hated by many that work there
bad,I would never tell someone to work at Walmart unless you are absolutely needing a job badly. They don't pay badly but they don't take care of their employees or customers well.
bad,Typical day was 3:00 am- 04:30 pm Senior management always complained about performance even though we were highest performing DC. Mandatory overnight shifts on weekends. Do the math you are getting paid less than the hourly workers because you are forced to work 65-70 hours a week. I would never recommend this place to anyone.
bad,Management is horrible and changes frequently. They give raises and then cut hours. You can advance but you don't even have to speak English or know your job duties
bad,"Overworked,under staffed not willing to hire to help current employees.some good managers who car for there employees but most just cared for themselves."
bad,It was hard to keep up with things constantly changing and the management. The associates and managers seemed to always be on edge and would take it out on each other. It wasn’t a very comfortable environment.
bad,"no breaks"
bad,Walmart is only interested in sales and eliminating competition. The company no longer cares about the well being of their employees. The overall  morale of the company has changed tremendously
bad,Managers take avantage of you and use you so they can do less work. As far for employees we all got alone. Overall it's not a career job just a stepping stone dont get trapped
bad,"management never listen to what any of the crew members had to say really. they would give you an area to work, pull you from that area to do their job then pull you from there to go back to where you was at in the first place"
bad,"I've been an associate since 2002. The work atmosphere was very fun and I was having a good time working. After a few years and after the ceo passed away, the company morale changed significantly. Management had problems and the reliability of other employees changed."
bad,"Evertything is mandated by a corporate guideline, and you have to follow what they say exactly to a  T and god forbid you have anything contrary to say because they ignore you or punish you for it.  put it in way too much work for what it was worth."
bad,Would not recommend this company to anyone you are just another number and they know if they can get rid of you they can get people who will work for nothing
bad,"Awful. Management chooses favorites, lies, cheats you, and is overall cruel. Doesn’t care if you need time off or have a documented emergency. If you’re not in the clique they don’t care AT ALL. Try to open door an issue and they’ll either ignore the issue or ignore you. Might as well go straight to global ethics office before you go to a manager..."
bad,"Walmart will slave you out for hat little 9 dollars. I heard they went up to 11 dollars, thats still not enough. Micro manage but wont help. To much work and no help"
bad,Over the past few months the company has changed dramatically. If you hire on as a new driver anticipate not having an assigned truck for 10 plus years. Jumping trucks at least once a week. A ton of senior drivers have left over changes. The culture that Sam Walton started is gone.
bad,"This is an ""okay"" place to work if you need a part time job to get by before the holidays but definitely not a career that you can make a living off of."
bad,"Not exactly the best in much. They can teach you to adapt, but don't expect to move up higher than just an associate. They want you to work any time, even if you have plans. Example: weddings, birthdays, etc."
bad,"People go to Walmart when they have no other option for work, save maybe the food industry. Kind of like how they shop at Walmart when they have no other option with their finances."
bad,"Walmart is the most depressing place to work. They constantly have to hire new people, but never have enough people at the cash registers.  This makes customers mad even though it's not in your control.  The pay is awful, you tell managers what hours you can work and they don't care. They hate when you call in sick even though you're sick and shouldn't come in, I had a friend get fired for calling in sick. But if you're in desperate need of a job, they're always hiring."
bad,"working there is annoying. they just basically throw you in there with no training. I worked there for 3 weeks and still can't explain my job in detail. there is like 4 people above you, and they all tell you how to do the ob differently. They schedule people to work 7 day straight. This was only a summer job for me and I'm so happy. I don't understand how people work there for 5+ years."
bad,"Honestly Walmart mey be good for first job seekers, but ONLY for first job. not for the long run. management sometimes do not pay attention to their employees, and employees sometimes don't even do their job and it leaves other working with more work. great pay but not worth it."
bad,The management sucks. The assistant managers talk to you like you are a child and they never address any concerns that you bring to them. There's nothing but drama there.
bad,"By far the most horrible workplace experience I’ve EVER had. I worked here while waiting for my security clearance for my dream job to clear & every second of it was terrible. HR & Upper management will talk about how it’s a team environment, but it is a bunch of lies. You are only a number & will be treated as such. The pay was above average for the area (started off at $16.00, ended at $17.55 at 6 months)but the daily stress of getting written up, treated like a robot with no life, gossiping area managers,and raggedy equipment makes the above average pay not worth it. Consistently high turnover rate because they’d rather hold associates accountable for everything and not their ridiculous policies and procedures. The option to purchase stock & education benefits are the only pros  of working for this dreadful company. They claim safety is “number 1”, yet there are no railings on the spurs and boxes continuously fall around the associates feet no matter how it’s stacked. Work here if you’re in desperate need of a job, but do not settle and continue looking for something better. People drop like flies regardless of being managers or associates."
bad,"Walmart was very cutthroat when it came to calling in sick or when one has a family emergency. I understand it's hard to tell fact from fiction, but when they do not acknowledge a doctors hand written note and reasons as to why you were unable to come in on the drop of a hat, then it became a problem."
bad,Honestly the job was pretty standard. typical rude costumers and oddly worded questions. the management were good people. as well as my co workers. they made it very easy to start work at a new place
bad,A typical day is something is always wrong or someone did not come in for work.  What I learned was to do my job at 100% no matter how bad the situation may be. Mind my own business and stay away from the drama and gossip. The work place culture was diverse. The hardest part of the job is having to learn things on your own and no one to train you. The enjoyable part is the customers and making them feel glad they came in the store and helping the customer find whatever they may need.
bad,"unless you are planning on becoming a manager or someone higher up on the ladder, don't waste your time.Low pay, very part time hours,which means little or no benefits"
bad,"El sueldo es bajo tus lideres tienen preferencia,para acenderte a un puesto tus lideres no tienen la visión de tener ideas innovadoras para hacer mas practico el trabajo les falta creatividad, ser pro activos,"
bad,"don' do it, they will try to get you to change your availability to open all the time and then you will work all the worst hours, while their favorites get the good shifts."
bad,walmart used to be a fun place to work they use to preach teamwork and now it is no where near teamwork and everything is only getting worse its all about production nothing more and nothing less.
bad,Typical day at work was fast paced but slow at certain hours.  Learned how to run a register and deal with customers.  Management depended on who was the current manager.  Not always good management.  Workplace culture was clique.  Hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers.  Most enjoyable part of the job was breaks.
bad,Sam Walton had some wonderful ideas.now things have changed drastically. The pay is great but the attitude and atmosphere has definitely changed. Ask the customer about the changes
bad,It was a nice job at the time but it was a lot of work considering I wasn't getting paid that much. Some of the staff are great but other than that it wasn't the best
bad,"rules that are enforced are violated by management. any employee who speaks up about injustice, or prejudism, etc immediately becomes a target for termination."
bad,After working there for 6 long  years. I would never recommend this company  to anyone.It is not a very nice place to work ! The upper management does not treat their employees very. I rly. They Force employees into positions that are not wanted !!!
bad,Enivorment is nice. managers need to have more respect for their employees. Breaks should be 30 minutes according to the positions you have. For example unloading trucks.
bad,"I loved what I did at Walmart.  I worked in the Deli, very fast paced, very big array of things to do. Walmart was very unfair with the schedule and they definitely did not do as promised when being interviewed. The managers were nice enough, but if there was a problem they weren't very good at figuring it out. Walmart is one of the only companies I know that if they don't make a profit, then they take away from the employees. If their profit goes down so do your hours. They will not hire full time."
bad,Management wasn't the best. Had to many jobs for one person to compete on a shift. Told to not socialize with customers as much. pay wasn't the greatest. Put in different departments without knowledge of that said area on whim.
bad,"Working at Walmart in 2013 was worse than I thought it could ever be. Not only was the compensation barely above minimum wage, they expect the workers to take on several different higher-paying roles without any option of a pay increase. They were eager to work around my school schedule at the time of hire, but after that, they would not stop scheduling me during my classes even though they were provided with my schedule. The members of management were constantly in conflict with one another and would blame the employees for acting in accordance to another manager's requests. The kind of stress that alone brought on the associates was not worth the pay. You were lucky to get a break on time, even the pregnant associates that were doing the potty dance after not being able to take a break for 4 hours."
bad,"Managers are never satisfied and some are out to get you. It's stressful and you are not guaranteed your hours. If you are sick which causes you to go to the ER and miss work,those doctor excuses do not count. I learned that Walmart doesn't care about their employees just money. I am grateful for them hiring me and don't regret working for them but I honestly wouldn't want to work for them again."
bad,"Needed a job and the only place that would take me was walmart "
bad,"the entire time i worked here, the CSMs never seemed to really care about their customers or their customer service desk employees, and typically let us take the blunt end of customer anger."
bad,"Management does not support nor listen to staff, does not promote most qualified for openings."
bad,"The culture at Walmart is driven by the management. Management determines who are the favorite workers and who are not. Those who are favored receive the ""better jobs"" and the ""favors"" of management.  When based on promotions, the management will pick and choose who is favored, regardless of seniority or training particular to the position."
bad,Poor management and also didn’t get payed enough for the work we had to do but all and all was a decent inviroment and nice co-workers and good benifents.
bad,"I feel like I work very hard at this job and still I'm taken advantage of constantly, I recently moved to Ft Lauderdale and it's very hard to transfer"
bad,"Good employees or bad, both were treated the same with no incentives to do better. Customer service managers were able to take undo advances towards cashiers and those under them as the ""open door"" complaint policy wasn't that affective or confidential"
bad,Workers are fake and talking to management is a waste of time if you just need something for a little bit then it will do but as in long term i highly recommend not working here
bad,"I've been with Walmart as a driver for 28 years.  The first 27 years I was proud to work there. The company made me proud to work there.  You always had to work hard to meet their goals but there was incentive to meet those goals. As a new driver I was willing to put in the very long hours and sacrifice the family time because I knew that if I did, there would be a long term benefit. They had a large collection of programs that let drivers get home to spend time with their families, once you had accrued seniority.  Set runs, where you ran the same route every day, grocery set-runs where you ran different stores but still got home at night, 5/3 programs, where 3 drivers shared two trucks and you always got the third week off while the other guys had the trucks. Many other programs."
bad,"doesn't pay, doesn't train. but puts a very small amount of food on the table if youd prefer a tiny shared apartment and ramen over a cardboard box and dumpster food"
bad,Walmart has lost it's focus as a retailer.  Lately it has been buying up smaller ecommerce companies in an effort to compete with Amazon while also restructuring it's organization to pay for these acquisitions.  As a result there's been a huge talent drain within the organization through layoffs and associates leaving for other companies with more stability.  I would advice prospective job applicants to be cautious before accepting a position with Walmart.
bad,Stocked shelves helped others stocked other isles hour lunch help annoying drunk customers due to overnight shift. No supervisor until end of shift. So no hlep unless youre done.
bad,I never got weekends off the place was a horrible environment people weren't friendly I just couldn't see myself staying there It seemed like working hard was a bad thing
bad,Job itself was easy but management was poor. The manager was constantly rude and snippy with me and my coworkers. My job was threatened from me as psychological manipulation.
bad,"The company has a do nothing management culture which makes no effort to improve the procedures, equipment, or help the customers.  Management just shows up for work and gets their paychecks.  It is a big organization where the left hand does not know or care what the right hand is doing"
bad,Best retailer around but be prepared to be just a number. Typical day at work is on your feet and busy. Hardest part of the job is angry customers. Best part of the job is the co workers. Management is poor and will continue to be poor since they treat their associates like they are just a number. I learned to not be loyal to a company. Take care of yourself and your family.
bad,"Walmart is a job for an associate that doesn't get sick or have small children. I have been told by management that my home family doesn't exist because the only family they care about is the Walmart family. If you get sick it counts against you, Dr;s excuses are not accepted as a result of missed work. You are expected to stay at work sick by whatever means and go to the Dr after your shift or on your lunch break.I witnessed a dept. Mgr pass out and had to be removed by ambulance and they still counted points against her, It's not fair how the employees are treated. And I wouldn't recommend anybody to employ for Walmart/ Now I can't speak for every Walmart but I can for the location I worked at."
bad,"You never see your manager and when you do you will get a quick thank you or be scolded immensely. They never know what is going on, but they pretend they know better. You will most likely never advance because they have a habit of firing before you finish your first year (prevents you from having insurance)."
bad,"walk in, clock in, move to your station, clean up shelves help customers, print photos. I didn't learn much, management was rude and unkind, no culture, nothing was to hard."
bad,"Assisted customers with sales transactions in electronics department. Assisted customers with cellular phone contracts thru Sprint, AT&T, and T-Mobile.  Pulled merchandise from the back room,  Stocked shelves.  Changed store set up.  Assisted in the creation of the store."
bad,Salary and Bonus is good for full time employees. Good place to relate with customers. You can get excellent communication skills and customer service experience.
bad,"management completely unfair, and almost impossible to promote into a salary position. management can be completely unfair, they will reprimand you for errors many other employees make. but as long as your manager likes you, you never get reprimanded for the mistakes."
bad,This position is good for someone who loves the work and doesn't expect to go any further with the company.  This is the textbook definition of a dead-end job.
bad,"Walmart was ok but it was hard talking to management and handling certain situations, they come off very one sided and unprofessional and often times the work is unfair"
bad,Would not recommend. Very stressful. Managers are overworked and understaffed. To focused on mastercards and not enough on customer experience. Staff are just numbers.
bad,If you have ever worked at Walmart you know there is a manager for every single little task in the store. They are over paid and do not listen to employee suggestions.
bad,"as a former stocker and sales associate, you are told what to do, how to do it, and when to do it and have it done by. which to a point is acceptable until you have a management system that is overwhelmed and they feel their workers can't work fast or efficient enough"
bad,"I have worked for Wal-Mart for over a decade. Values are steadily going down the drain. Management is partial, unreasonable and subjective. Instead of encouraging a positive work environment, cut throat tactics is the culture now. Employees are treated as mere metrics producers, not humans. Every quarter, more help hours are reduced, expectations are increased followed by threatening emails about being fired if the metrics are not met. We're now being told that not being available to work overtime negatively affects your evaluation. Where is the work-life balance? I work full-time and am expected to neglect my children on my days off as well if I desire a fair evaluation! This is how pay inequality is propagated in 2018. Down right deplorable."
bad,Advancement based on relationships and not on merit or qualifications.  I felt very unappreciated.
bad,Walmart could care more about their employees well being since as schedule them the hours they required and not just what they want to give us. If we are full time let us work our full time hours. The benefits in health care doesn't  cover anything that not fair at all. They should paid for doctor visit 100 percent and health situation 2. Etc
bad,They would expect us to work long shifts and even come in to cover the shifts of employees who repeatedly skipped. They never made any attempt at firing those who needed to go and instead formed little cliques that would cause drama.
bad,"They will tell you that they will work with you and your scheduling needs. May it be needed for family time or school. But in reality, when you start they put you however fits them best. I went to my manager about several issues and was informed. ""Either you can do the job or you can't."", ""I don't need to hear your problems"" or ""well what do you want me to do about it?"" This was in reference to needing to be home with my children some nights... Being that everyone knows I'm a single mother. I feel that I was taken advantage of because of my need to work and support my children, and put as a permanent closer for my department."
bad,A bad place to work with and for. Its sad to see the employees be treated so badly and to work like slaves from the management due to poor training and management and pay.
bad,"Poor management and lack of work morale. Associates are not appreciated and underpaid for the work that they do. However, I did enjoy helping the customers."
bad,Where I worked was not very good for anyone who wanted to be there long term. It was hard to be motivated and managers didn't communicate with the workers.
bad,Great training through the academy. Lack of mentoring and training in role. Work/life balance is not good and pay is under market value. Working with the associates is great.
bad,"This company will retaliate if you speak  up,not allowed to make mistakes, and you will be bullied. If corporate gives management a  bad review  they will retaliate, some managers will ask you to work off clock but don't tell  ,they don't like you to report accidents because  it might  mess up their  chances for   bonuses"
bad,When an opening opens up they hire you on who you know and how high that person you know is. Management doesn't do much in the long run in total I think I saw management do their job twice and both times was when they were following me to try to get dirt on me so they could fire me. I cant say anything about other stores around the world but Wasilla's Walmart is one place I will never go to unless I am overly desperate for work.
bad,Upper management and Home Office doesn't care about employees well being. The pay doesn't cover most of people expenses. Employees will get heavy work loads with no help and expectations for employees will grow higher but pay doesn't. There aren't steady hours for most people so work/life balance is tough to do as well.
bad,"Productive,ad intense workplace,some equal opportunity.There are to much walmart relationships, if you are not part of it ,you are not treated well.The opportuniyties are endless"
bad,"In Constant competition to complete my job quickly was told that if my times weren't improved I was fired no mater how quickly or slowly I did my job."
bad,"Mal equipo de liderazgo que termina por reducir la autoestima y motivación de los empleados, procesos de reclutamiento interno sin bases para la seleccion del candidato y  por  lo tanto pocas o  nulas posibilidades de crecimiento."
bad,É uma empresa de grande porte que trata o funcionário muito mal.
bad,"Management was terrible, they tried to fire me for asking to go to the hospital when I caught pneumonia and couldn't breathe. They also never let you use the restroom until break, I had a lot of urinary tract infections working there."
bad,"Low wages, limited room for advancement, cut throat work environment.  Fellow employees will step on you to climb there way to the top and management was in fear for there own positions so they got in the way of employees moving up."
bad,"Walmart is harsh working environment that took time away from person life and school.  I had a very stressful work day that and a lot of responsibilities.  Management was terrible, and very hard to work with."
bad,"in Walmart I was interviewed for one position and got trained for another position. The management at Walmart is very uncaring. Their professionalism is very poor and I wouldn't recommend anyone work there. Walmart in Nottingham, MD"
bad,I had workee there for four years and received no actual pay raise other than what the new hires are receiving.  When you try to get more hours to get more money to help yourself pay bills or so they habe you cut back all over time.
bad,"Walmart management only looks out or themselves. The stress of the job is some days unbelievable with lack of help. Horrible training, just computer work that has nothing to do with your job and the no real hands on training. They will couch you for not knowing stuff that you were not trained to know."
bad,"In my opinion Wal-mart could make sure the food is fresher, and the customers get better treatment. They didn't treat the employees that greatly. The bathrooms could be a lot cleaner."
bad,I loved working with my coworkers and shift managers. The new customer service manager was changing things and making the coworkers quit. The store manager was really nice.
bad,"The store I worked for recently, in Many, LA was an absolute HORROR. The management was poor, the store is in horrible shape, and there was drama at every turn. HOWEVER, it goes to say every store is different, The store I worked for previously that i relocated from, was a DREAM, the management was excellent the store was in great shape and it was a pleasant place to work."
bad,"poor leadership, inconsistent hours and days, lack of advancement opportunities. most enjoyable part of the job was changing tires and oil on a vehicle."
bad,I gave 24 years of loyal service to walmart and they just tell me my job no longer exists. Feel betrayed by them. I would love to have stayed with the company. But i felt humiliated  by the company so I decided to leave.
bad,"Do not look for place of advancement if you are looking for a department change.  Cross training was at a minimal unless the CSM approves, and not by performance."
bad,"The management at walmart, if you are even 5 min behind your assigned task time, you are written up and have your job threatened. It is far beyond stressful."
bad,"If you want drama, poor managment, inflexible hours and corperate politics then this place is for you. They tell you in the interview process its easy to move up in the company but this is false it doesnt matter how hard you work the managment plays favorites for job advancement instead of giving it to people that work hard have the knowledge to do it right the whole atmosphere is stressful and feels like you're in a highschool popularity contest when you're up for a promotion"
bad,"If it didn't help profits, it didn't happen. They do not care about their associates and think they are/should be the most important thing in your life. They wouldn't even work with my school schedule. They started out by saying they would, then they would schedule you to work days your not available anyway and expect you to show up. Good luck getting full time spots and benefits, I've seen people that had been there for 10 years and are still part time; and not for a lack of trying."
bad,Ask around and really payattetion to the attitude of managers and emloyees who are friends with the manager towrds other empmoyees. Managers friends get more hours
bad,Walmart is known as a revolving door due to people getting a job and quitting or getting fired not soon after.  The reason for that is they have the worst management i have ever seen.  The people that run the store should be the ones cleaning the store.
bad,"The typical day was long and grueling,"
bad,"Working for Wal-Mart is not an enjoyable experience. You will hardly ever have a manager that knows what they are doing. You are expected to do the work of at least three people, and are never given the appropriate time to do it. They always cut hours right before bonuses so they are not out any money. They refuse to hire to staff properly as well as recuse to gave appropriate hours. There is far too much favoritism in each store."
bad,"Most days management and customers are RUDE. Not a place to work unless your a brown noiser, or like being treated badly. They will cross train you though"
bad,Working at wal-mart was very stressful. Co-workers were very nice but management was very disorganized. Almost never in one department. Not enough hours. I did enhance on my communication skills through this work place.
bad,Ok job for someone young starting their working life. They only hired me for their busy season but didn't inform me of that until the busy season was over.
bad,"The management and/ CSS at Walmart tend to be more focused on the inside of the store, they are not worried about cart pushers or even if they are overwhelmed with the amount of customers coming in on busy days. The hardest part of the job is when others would call in and you would have to carry a bigger workload. The only time a CSS will send help to any cartpusher is when the store manager see's that the tunnel is low on carts."
bad,It is managed poorly from the top down.  Job expectations are hardly achievable and they are constantly stripping away benefits and making the job more difficult. Employee input on changes to daily operation  are ignored and there is no feeling of job security no matter how hard you work. The management team has no respect for any of the employees and there is constant favoritism regarding discipline.
bad,walmart was always expecting me to do more than my job title was i was always teaching new employees the day to day routines  of working and stocking the shelves
bad,I would say that management is hard to work with they will fire you for the smallest things if your not on your toes there they will yell at u nothing
bad,Walmart's environment is harmful to the mental health of the workers UNDER the assistant managers. It is a very stressful environment and is not somewhere I would recommend for employment.
bad,"Management doesn't exactly communicate between each other, and at times it makes a mess of things. More importantly, many of the managers are lacking in the educational department it seems."
bad,My typical day consisted of stocking the isles of different departments and unloading the trucks. I learned how to become a bit more organized outside of work. Management was difficult because they had too many managers telling us to do different things through out our shifts. The culture was very diverse. The hardest part was unloading the trucks every night. I enjoyed the discounts I would get on my purchases.
bad,"Work overnights not my favorite place to work, not enough time to do the amount of work they required in 8 hours, and not set aside to do cap stones and training on the computer"
bad,When i started workin there is was great but not nomore cause of the bosses play favoritism and i dont like that the people that work their but off get treated than the ones who dont work half as hard as some other people do and some of the bosses are not understanding but they are nice i would like to see them more understanding overall i like workin there
bad,I was going to college and working at Walmart. They new about my school schedule and that I took the bus to and from campus. They still scheduled me multiple times when i would be in the middle of my classes. They believe they should be priority over furthering your education. Never want to work at this location again.
bad,"Assistant and Co managers are worked to the bone.  80 hour weeks are almost guaranteed, and there are weeks that you might work in excess of 140 hour weeks  General managers have it easy, and are well compensated."
bad,"Working at Walmart was a bit challenging with the staff due to attitudes, disrespecting you in front of cashiers and low pay.  I was offered a front end lead cashier promotion which never took place due to me ethnicity."
bad,Stocking shelves is a priority no matter what your title. Training is computerized and generally easy. Employees are friendly and hard workers. There are a lot of managers who overturn your department managers instructions at the drop of a hat. Customer service is the best part of this job.
bad,"Overall, working at the ellsworth Wal-Mart was nice. I like my co workers and my bosses. I did NOT like how erratic my schedule was. It seemed like they were TRYING to keep me from getting a second job."
bad,"Poor Leadership. Not a good fit for me. I need benefits."
bad,"Bad environment, but good for your experience."
bad,"From my experience Walmart does not care about their employees- No tolerance for sickness, I almost got fired when I was in the hospital and have seen many coworkers fired for faults they could not control (i.e. food poisoning, pink eye, flu). Harsh repercussions when I rightfully notified them of my mandatory court date. "
bad,The management at my specific Walmart is not professional or kind at all. They gave me no chance to move up from cashier even though I told them I would leave if I wasn’t switched to another position.
bad,Walmart is a good place to work but have really poor management. Sometimes it feels like they are unfair with the associates .  The don't help those who are in need .
bad,"Decent starter job, Promotes from within, but very slowly and mainly like a highschool. Inner circle of friends it seemed like, work didn't matter, but socializing did."
bad,I applied to be a sales associate and stocker.  I did work as a stocker until the management moved me from working in the health and beauty department to being a people greeter so I took less pay and thought that was a demotion. I sound it stressful helping customers at the door when I was usually the only one and not any employees near by if I needed help with customers other than sending them to customer service while I felt the management was not supportive of me.
bad,n\a do not treat there people well some folk can get away with thing and hard working people get dog out then they step on you when you speak up you get let go
bad,"I like working at Walmart, the pay was too low, the hours were not consistent and working hard and not being sure of advancement made it impossible stay here and try for a career."
bad,hated the dynamics of the who know is how you get your job and positions. the customers were the only thing that keep me going back to work daily. All management is only for themselves. I learned to never trust or believe anyone you work with there.
bad,Walmart has a major issue with wanting more work for less. they want you to pull 214 cases per hour yet they want to take money from you and they also show a ton of favor toward those who bow down to the bosses
bad,You often have to do work that is not part of your job description. You end up overworked and underpaid for your service. We were always understaffed and usually difficult to receive needed help.
bad,i wouldn't recommend working here. The Management is uncaring and heartless. They only care to make themselves look better and do not care for their employees.
bad,I originally enjoyed the cashier position.  I enjoyed helping the people that came through my lane.  Unfortunately some of the customer service managers were unhappy working there and made it known.  I enjoyed working with the customers but there was little or no respect shown to the employees and no one I talked to was happy.  I couldn't work in that type of environment and quit.
bad,"The culture Sam Walton exemplified is long gone though you must learn about it in orientation, it is left there my most."
bad,Favoritism in the work place. Management makes an example out of you in front other employees and out in the open floor where customers shopping. Unprofessional.
bad,"Walmart is great as a part-time or temporary employer, however, I would not recommend trying to make this a permanent job. The environment is very stressful and communication is a huge weak point between management and employees."
bad,"I found working at Walmart pharmacy very stressful environment with a  very poor management in terms of work scheduling,payment,vacations etc. Due to recently changes in its management ."
bad,this is a terrible stressful place to work the employees are very stressed out and not allowed to talk to each other and wrote up if they do so and the management intimidates the employees with their jobs on a regular basis it is a very miserable place and environment to work in...don't put yourselves through this.....
bad,nothing to say. Not enough  to live on by yourself for hours put in. i  really don't care to be made to make my review 150 min characters. I should be able to say what I want and how much of it I want.
bad,Come in. Stocked your isles. Then went to your supervisor and he/she will tell you what to do next. Hardest part was working in or with the freezers. The best part was leaving
bad,Its okay but thing change daily like everyday. Dont train correctly how to do the job you have to get in trouble when thing dont get done correctly. There are less chance you get a interview.
bad,"This place is unstable , managers fight each other's ideas , The next man is your ladder up if your willing to step on him and, they are ! You should keep your head down and not try to climb the ladder because then you become a target .....the whole Walmart experience was an eye opener to the greed and insincerity of large corporate environment"
bad,I enjoyed working at at Walmart overall. But all the job turnovers was too many even with employees who had been with the company for many years. I felt that loyality to employees was not there.
bad,Was not a good place to work at all. Was unfair didn't allow you any time to speak for yourself made you and the staff feel bad about themselves. Thankful for the job though.
bad,"In my opinion this was the worst job experience I had.  I had overnight hours, worked every weekend and the pay was nothing. Management was not very good with its employees"
bad,"stress full place to work, if stocking was done, the manager would come and do it another way, so we would have to start over. refused to pay overtime, unless he needed you to. staff was very friendly and easy to work with. They would do what ever I asked.very enjoyable to work with those people. The manage was the problem.A typle day at work was stocking mechandise, price changes , customer service, building dispalys of merchandise. After 1 year i was made a zone manager wich included the same as above but also supervising sales floor associated. The hardest part of the job was trying to please the manaqers.the most enjoyable part of the job was working with the other associates. they were just wonderful"
bad,Worked eleven days straight with one day off. I came back and I was assigned to work another week straight. Sometimes short handed and don't get breaks.
bad,Not enough staff . And mangement doesn’t like work work around your personal schedule.  Been there nearly three years I think it’s time for a change !
bad,Hardworking place. Most of the time busy. No Thanksgiving day off. Management not good. They’re making way too much money but they pay less. I don’t recommend anybody to work there.
bad,"The management is never on the same page constantly redoing work when new management comes back from days off, get yelled at because it was not doe the way they wanted"
bad,managers do not know how to treat the employee. they do not believe in life and work valance. manager overwork employee everyday on a regular basic...
bad,"A lot of overworking associates"
bad,good 1st time job. they do training well. shifts were a little off for management working until 11pm to be back at 6am is a little rough. however i have heard that they approved the way they work people since i have worked there 5 years ago
bad,"Summary pretty much says it. Low pay, poor management, NO OVERTIME unless the company magically approves it. You get overtime that's unapproved, you are punished, regardless of if you meant to get overtime or not. Scheduling sucks, you have to check every week if you have the same days off cause they will switch it up on you with no notice. People will call out and if you're good at stocking and get good times, they will put you in a foreign and sometimes poor territory. During inventory week or when ""big-wigs"" are in the area, you MUST stay late and face the store while they let most the people with overtime leave. Then you get overtime are rushed to finish your area the next night so you can leave and that's if they let you. They may or may not approve your overtime."
bad,"Upon hiring I was told there was flexibility or a set schedule.  Now if you can't work whenever they want you to, they won't give you any hours, no matter how long you've been with the company or how good of a worker they deem you to be."
bad,"job is ok for students or someone wanting to work parttime, not for grown people with families.  doesn't pay enough to pay the bills and the medical insurance is too high to afford."
bad,"the job itself was okay, work days pretty much are the same. I have enjoyed working with the public and meeting people. The management at Walmart are pretty much yes men to corporate office.  And the biggest majority of them do nothing but walk around. They do not make good decisions and do not follow company policy. Unless you are willing to work a open availability and split shifts you will never get anywhere with this corporation."
bad,i was working for walmart for 3 and a half years and never seen any chance of advancement and no full time positions so always on the edge of being cut back and never making enough to live
bad,"This place is perfect for those that need work experience in customer service, cashiering or stocking. It is also a great job to keep you afloat until you can get a legitimate job."
bad,Wal-Mart doesn't pay on a fair scale. Most mangers don't lift a finger to help you even when in front of customers. The raises are given on bias and the most you can get up to is 50cents
bad,"I worked for the company for over 10 years.  In the ling run, in the store i worked in, you only move up in the ranks if you know the one who does promotions. Work skills, and work ethic really dont get noticed."
bad,I didn't like the management. The scheduling was all messed up. We had nobody to cover our shifts. Nobody showed up for work. A lot of drama between co workers.
bad,"When they first hire you, you are not told, things never stay the same at Walmart, they only get worse. After almost 10 years, when I was reaching the top of my Department it was like I had the Plague and Managers were always saying I had complaints or was not doing my job. I was the top performer, trainer and communicator in my department and my last Review in March of 2017 was excellent. Nothing could ever be proven against me, but management is always right."
bad,The working hours are not good for a working person. Good for kids only or living with a person and don't have a life.One of the management just sits and watches the employees work the whole internight. Follow you to the bathroom every time.
bad,if you need work and you don't care about the work environment you can go for this option. But I had a horrible time working in the company and I would suggest you go for anything before this.
bad,Management was horrible and I would recommend someone to work at Walmart just not the one I worked at. Everything was all fun and games until the managers started to act in such hypercritical ways.
bad,"My experience is that Walmart is a company that conveniently ignores policy and creates a hostile work environment of dishonesty and retaliation for anyone that worries about the customer. I had to put my job on the line, because a District Manager ordered me to use a meat slicer that was chipping metal into customers food. I contacted Walmart's Global Ethics, only to have them tell the store management of the situation I was causing and was forced to endure retaliation in the form of harassment and hours being cut, until I could no longer bring myself to work for the company. Colorado department of Labor deemed that I quit due to what they see as unsatisfactory work conditions and received unemployment payments."
bad,"Management did not care about the staff & a lot of the time the store it self. Pretty much all the associates are part time with little to no chance of getting a FT position. The hours are erratic split up in such a way that it makes it extremely difficult to get a needed 2nd job. You may get 30 hours a week but some days you will work 5 hours other days only 3. As soon as they would find out that you have or are even looking for a 2nd job, you are immediately dropped from the schedule, or they cut you hours down to less that 10 - 20 a week & will spread those out over 5 days & various shifts with no consistency. This way when you finally are pushed to quitting, they don't have to pay unemployment."
bad,"Typical day would include clocking in, reviewing orders, speaking with management and preforming straightening and facing shelves. I taught myself the inventory, layaway, and instore pick up processes. Management was inconsistent. Workplace culture was depressing. Often scheduled to work a six hour shift with no lunch break and told to clock out before the shift reached six hours so you would not be required to clock out for a lunch. If you did not clock out you were penalized for not taking a lunch. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers. Hardest part of the job was never seeing my family due to evening shift. Was passed over several times for positions on third-shift or first-shift. Harassed by pharmacist due to appearance. Not given a fair chance for advancement."
bad,"The overall job at Wal-Mart is about what you would expect from retail. The problem is that management keeps you down, you get no hours, and the opportunities for advancement go to friends of management first. No benefits available to part timers and no spots available for full time."
bad,The management at Walmart is bad they don’t understand life happens and that my job can’t always come first yes I understand I have a job and it has to get done but same time they need to understand if I have a medical problem or a family emergency then work isn’t going to come first
bad,"My review at Wal-Mart was overall alright but the managment was very rude, disrespectful to the employee's. You go to them with concerns they don't care"
bad,"This was by far one of my least favorite places of employment. Long hours, with very little compensation. The expectations are crazy high but you are not rewarded for a job well done. Management was only worried about making sure they looked good and hit their numbers, not about the employees. I would not recommend anyone work here unless they absolutely had to."
bad,"a typical day at work would include a little of whatever was needed."
bad,fast paced. high volumes of customers/inadequate pay. expectations beyond the job description/breaks were inconsistent/very poor treatment of employees
bad,"I go in at my time,,  5 pm,,person I am releving leaves at 5. no time to catch up on the day of whats going on.  I have a line at the register, no help, a customer wants a 20 lb propane tank. have to walkie to get  help,,,sometimes takes a long time, Next customer wants a ton of wood pellets,, Now I have to walkie for a spotter for the forklift and or a cashier. Not many have license for the forklift. I do. When thats done you have customers waiting inside for help., Try to calm them down as u tell the person that is runing the register thanks for the help, Now right back where I started from, Starts all over again. You cannot ;leave the main room where the register is AND you have to watch the door for theft,, when its busy.  cannot do. I consider myself a real good problem solver, but when short on help and mangt does not care I have to bite my tongue. I have never blown up in front of a customer.  Then finally the frieght comes down, Now have you have to stock and bin the stuff that does not fit on the shelves.  Take care of garden center returns,, then trash and cardboard, getting the place ready for next day.  MOST days impossible. Punch out got home.  At the end of the day, I sit and reflect hoping I have helped some customers. I hate telling customers,, im sorry we dont have that, but you might try,,, then i name of a company down street, just so I know they got it."
bad,Worked there a lot while in highschool but I felt like I was working full time. Constantly was called in on my days off and had to work a lot on the weekends just to get a good paycheck every 2 weeks. Almost missed my senior prom because they wanted me to work that day even though I took off purposely. Horrible management too.
bad,"People at walmart want to better themselves, and it takes a lot of hard work to accomplish that. It takes effort and commitment to be a fit at the corporation."
bad,"lacking employees on night shift, causing more work for individual. Coworker took lunch when it started to get busy, nothing done about it from management."
bad,"I work part-time, I used to go in to work with a smile on my face, but it really changed in the last year.  I still enjoy the job itself, if management would let you do it in peace.  I like everyone that I work with and enjoy being in their company.  I like the customers and I like helping them. "
bad,"managers are too arrogant and disrespectful. work is stressful and very few workers at a time, leaving few people doing a lot of work at a time. pay could be more for all that work."
bad,Typical day consisted of scanning and doing inventory for part of the day and unloading a truck the other part of the day. I learnt how to operate scanners and how to unload a truck in a timely manner while keeping the backroom tidy. Hardest part was having to deal with the poor management. Most enjoyable part was seeing all the progress I made in a day. Management was very poor and did not care about their employees.
bad,"Review on the walmart central pharmacy in orlando, fl. Not the retail store. This central fill pharmacy is not operated good at all. The moral on the 2nd shift is the worst. The managers running it is highly biased towards certain individuals and is extreamly a sneaky to everyone. They writes up only people they dont like, and others get off. Makes up rules that walmart would never allow. Dont get me started on the pay, the shipping side employees get paid more than a registered pharmacy texhnician. And from what i know the supervisors get paid not even a dollar more than regular pharmacy technicians. Where do they get these managers? Smh. The central pharmacy needs a major change, but we all know it's harder to change behavioral characteristics. So that means you better not be on their bad side if you work there. If your not liked, they target you here. Dont recommend.  The worst technician pay ever. Gone to prime and got paid way  more."
bad,"The company itself is full of immature people of whom  have gotten the title ""manager"".  Its a company full of highschool drama, and i would never work there again."
bad,"stocking, quotes for tires, inventory."
bad,I have nothing good to say about this company. They treat their employees bad. Have no care or concerns about how they abuse the employees or treat them
bad,I worked in layaway.  I had to override items all the time.  I always needed a management key to put items away which took forever to get.  No one manager knows that they are doing.  I got a concussion while working there and they still tried to get me to go against doctor's orders an unload a truck.
bad,"Bad Managment, Bad pay, bad hours, bad work,  Wal-Mart does not treat there workes good, you work low pay and very few hours a week, and you are complained at for anything and everything by the incompitent management,"
bad,u get shown how to do something one time and then expected to be able to have it mastered not to mention u dont get enough hours especially on overnight and the managers were very rude
bad,"Lack of drive and ethics honoring the associates and customers who keep their business adequately advancing. The management are rude, unorganized, and incompetent individuals. Who lack good ethics and human understanding. There is no real team work. Bullying tactics and manipulation were the key chosen tools used by this cooperation to complete daily tasks and workloads. I removed my self from this negative company. Anyone with respect for themselves and their families would also do the same. I Would never visit or recommend this company again with the state it's in."
bad,"Easy to get a job here, but the longer you are here the less hours you get. Make sure when working here you know your rights under canvas labor laws, they try to insinuate things that are not at Liberty to insinuate or threatened. This is written by somebody the dean as rehireable."
bad,"First and for most I like to take time to say I've learn more aout working with retail and customer service. I was sold a dream only to get the opposite. everyday work was stressful, I was put through a lot of unfair situation and covered almost every job for only 10 dollars an hour. you was forced and pushed around places you was unfimiliar with and if you messed up you was written up or terminated. the list could go on and on."
bad,"too many changes, job never stays the same, STRESSFUL, you work under a strict eye ball, push push all the time, its all about production, people don't matter"
bad,"In my personal opinion Walmart is unorganized and very poorly managed. This could be different somewhere else, but at my store managers would often delegate, but they'll forget about who matters most; which are the customers. They'll consistently put you on the schedule on the times when your availability sheet clearly says not to."
bad,Poor senior leadership with no drive to help individuals advance and grow in the company. The senior leadership micro manage individuals until no end.
bad,Everyone is very focused on money and fast paced sales with little regard for workers. All staff were very unhappy to be present there and there was little to no hope of being moved through positions to relieve pressure of being a cashier all day.
bad,Management lies and breaks rule. They expected more of you than you could give. Management was better than the associates. they would not socialize with them an the night shift was always left out when it came to Christmas parties and other functions the put on.Management had way too much favoritism. If your not in there click then you got no respect.
bad,The managers do not work in sync and will tell give different orders than a previous manager and won't take no for an answer. They do no care about anything as long as you never stop working.
bad,Mi evalúacion mala ya que ni siquiera uno tiene tiempo para descansar y no hay anillo de los jefes ni los compañeros.
bad,"I worked over nights and it was short staffed and we were rushed."
bad,"This job was a mistake. Never again would I accept a job working at Walmart.  If you are one of the few employees who actually attempts to complete some work, you will be loaded up with the jobs of several of your co-workers."
bad,"Don't set yourself up for failure. Only use temporarily until something better comes along. They promote who they want to have a position, not the best qualified for a position."
bad,Beginning of shift consisting of all workers in the department leaving the floor as soon as I walked onto the floor.  I was left all the work that 2 or more employees were doing to finish on my own.  I also had to service the customers in three departments since I had no help.  I was frequently denied breaks.  Management were busy doing other things so nothing was done about it.  The hardest part of the job was having to do the work of three people and help customers at the same time.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction of the customers.
bad,"Walmart has a culture of job first, family second. They go through many cashiers at the store I work at, and are cutting not only Phamacist and technicians, but store management as well."
bad,"I have worked at Walmart more than once. The first time I worked there, everything was great. This time, I am getting less than 20 hours a week, and my management is in no way understanding at all. I almost missed a very important family gathering and they did not schedule me for seven days this month. I would have never come back if I had known this is what it would be like. I will not recommend anyone to work here."
bad,"It is not a good place to work. Employee turnout is too high, No staff retention policy. Staffs does not look motivated. Store manager's only target to meet sell target. Managers are rude to employees."
bad,"Wal-Mart was a place that kept us busy and pushed us to the brink. I couldn't quite balance school and work in this facility, but it was a job that paid the bills. It was an overnight shift that I worked, which made it all that more difficult."
bad,"Bad management, even worse dept. managers, terrible pay, horrible hours, the environment is kind of like oh well i dont care im just here for a paycheck, unfriendly associates, benefits were awful"
bad,"Manager made clear who the ""favorite"" was on the team, allowed some people to just no call no show while writing others up for calling in or showing up late, and crazy hours. Went from over 30 hours one week to having around 10 for the next few weeks, then back up to over 30. Wal-Mart does not take Dr. notes for call-ins, just assigns points when calling in."
bad,"15 hours of work should be done in 4. They would give you the amount of hours in your department, whether it be 15 or 7, you had to be done even if you worked alone."
bad,The overnight management team now doesn't care about their employee. They view their employees as expendable and that you are easily replaced. There is no communication from them about any opportunities to advance in the company.
bad,"i worked in 3510 Walmart for almost 2 years, i worked under the old management team and it use to be good until they changed the management team. there a lot of favoritism, unqualified people becomes managers, and plenty of the good associate quitting or stop  caring. The store is falling apart, and the environment is not good as it use to be."
bad,The money is not ideal cannot make a living income. I work everyday minus two and every other weekend because of school and barely make enough to pay my bills let alone live on my own. Otherwise they are very flexible on hours which is nice if you have a busy schedule.
bad,Very Stressful mangers are inconsiderate. The mangers could careless what you have going on in your personal life they want you at work at all times but they make sure that their home is taken care of
bad,Worked as an overnight stocker. Provided customer service also stacked items to the shelf and organized before end of shift. Also switched over to becoming a cashier.
bad,"Worked here for over 2 years. Managment is the worst, little to no chance for advancement, extreme favoritism, and too much expected of you. Okay first job though, teaches you the basics of customer service, and do’s and don’t’s. If you’re shy, get ready to be put out of your comfrot zone immediately."
bad,You had better make friends very quickly at walmart if you  plan to survive for very long. Its  takes a team effort to get the job done. Dont make management mad or they will ride you.
bad,"While the benefits aren't bad, the low pay makes up for it. Managers usually have all their information mixed up, one says one thing, the other says another. Don't count on too many managers standing up for you if they tell you the wrong thing and you get in trouble for doing something the wrong way."
bad,"opening a can of baked beans with a plastic spoon is easier than getting the help and support of the assistant manager or above."
bad,"raises are once a year if the company decides to offer them"
bad,Management does not respect its associates and consistently schedueles on non available days expecting you to come in or get written up. Only care about the money being made and think its associates are robots
bad,The store i worked at was a joke. I advanced quickly but upper management did not back up the workers on the sales floor. Wouldnt recommend to work here.
bad,"For your salary and all the drama you have to put up with. This job is not right for most people. If a customer has a problem and it's not your fault, you still get blamed for it."
bad,"I was told this when I had been working there a couple years when I went to the doctor for chest pain.  Apparently it was just the stress of the job.  There are departments that I do not think are like this but in the Finance pillar I do not know of a many individual areas/departments where this stress, pressure and lack of work life balance are not a significant issue."
bad,I didn't find it to be a positive experience. I didn't get enough hours to make a living.My hours kept being cut to the point of not being able to sustain myself and family.
bad,Very little hourly wage. Always short-staffed so they would always need help to fill shifts. Multiple managers to report to and few managers to find when there is an issue.
bad,"My job was to scan items, bag them, and collect form of payment which could have been cash, card, or check. The best part was when the costumers would tell me how much they appreciate me on a daily basis."
bad,Impossible demands on time and work. They pile more work on you when you can't complete what is already in your job description with no compensation. The schedules are all over the place with no set days off so family time is impossible to schedule.
bad,I liked working the night shift as a stocker because i could work at my own pace to put stuff away and there was not many people in the store at night.
bad,"The culture is based on getting the most from the least."
bad,Used to be a great place to work. Many new people in upper management have been hired and they have made a lot of  changes and none have been good.  The dispatching is horrendous but local management has no say in anything anymore so whatever the computer says is what your doing.  Slowly every good thing that you earn by seniority is being taken away. Your time means nothing. Cost and productivity is factored into everything but home office and the dispatch center can waste millions of dollars and it doesn’t matter. If you are a true professional driver I would not recommend you apply with Walmart they do not treat anyone in the private fleet well enough to make the sacrifices for the job worth it anymore.
bad,There is a lack of experienced management.  They give more tasks than what can be achieved in a days work.  Too many managers giving out tasks.  Never have time to do the job you are required to do because we are so understaffed and we are always behind on freight which causes the morale in the store to be down.  I love most of the people I work with.  The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help customers find what they need.
bad,Would be a great company if Management actually cared about their employees. There are no benefits for part-time employees and the employee discount doesn't even cover taxes.
bad,Please do not apply to this job unless you plan on focusing a career in retail  because this job is for very few. Disclaimer I did work in the Apparel Department however other jobs are okay at Walmart.
bad,"No hay un buen ambiente de trabajo siempre te contradicen en todo "
bad,Muy buen ambiente laboral tranquilo y acondicionado todos los sectores
bad,"Fast paced, communication sucked, if you work front end, you were told when to go to lunch and breaks. Some managers were good, then there were those you absolutely hated and they hated you back. For the most part, it was laid back."
bad,"I worked Electronics, the store manager was breaking rules.  As an Electronics associate you know that you cannot return a used gaming console when the serial numbers don't match the box.  She returned a dusty, non-matching serial number.  We also cannot give money back for games, cds, or movies if open.  A few times the management allowed opened games, cds and movies to be returned."
bad,if you need a job sort term its ok. can be ok hard on the mind and sole . some management is ok others not so much .so people like it the it was ok for a bit but wares on you.
bad,It's an open door it's for young adults looking for work right out of high school. The hours are ok if your full time if not you get about 15 /20 hours
bad,"It isn't the local management's fault,  but the hours at Wal-Mart are absolutely ridiculous. Some weeks I would get 35 and some I would get 22. Days off are inconsistent as well as shift times. The only thing consistent about that place is the rude attitude from at least one customer a day."
bad,it was ok there were things that i didnt mind but once they new about them the would make you do it all the time insted of you regular job that you were hired for
bad,"poor pay, very unprofessional, being that I was an overnight stocker I had no social life; would not recommend to mother's of young children, also management gave no regard to your personal matters."
bad,"It's a job. Not much else. Management was bad, the hours they give were not consisitant. I wouldn't work here again. Coworkers were not great to be around all they did was complain."
bad,"The job is as you imagine for a job that deals with customers. Most days are pretty routine, and the tasks are simple and easy to accomplish. Prior knowledge of the products is necessary. The most difficult would be dealing with unpleasant customers or problems."
bad,"I was promoted quickly. I am very good at Customer Service. aside from that, most of the managers have favourites within their and other departments. These people basically do what they want and no one says anything and then if your not one of them and you mess up or don’t do enough , your the one getting in trouble."
bad,"to be honest, the walmart i worked at was no better than working with someone who did nothing more than crack the whip as he watched his crew members labor away. supervisor picked favorites and was excessively verbally abusive towards others, especially new recruits."
bad,"Walmart is always short handed and that leaves those who work , to work like dogs. Management is dull and do not respect the associates. Co workers were great, customers were fine but the work environment was bad. too much work and never enough help."
bad,"The hours are terrible the managers are terrible. The associates for the most part are great to work with. Walmart will try to avoid paying vacation after approving it with pay, it is a battle to get your money. Walmart screws up paycheques regularly and never pays what you are worth. you could basically run the entire store without the title of manager and they will still pay you barely over minimum wage."
bad,"the manager stephanie was superb and nice,was a nice place to work had down falls but most the managers where excellent and helpfull to all.wouldnt work there again"
bad,"This is not a place to work at long-term. Aside from perhaps the pharmacy and vision center you won't find any type of fulfilling work here. The benefits aren't bad, but those are the only good things about working here."
bad,Working as an unloader in Walmart was a taxing job physically. The pay was not up to par with the amount of work that was given to us. As well as the fail of management.
bad,supervisors are always hiding and the employees smoke weed on their breaks and nothing is said and if you do not kiss their butts you do not advance in the company
bad,Worked throughout a lot of stores for Walmart and the one thing i always saw were the more in the click you were the better positions you would be eligible for the bigger your pay raises you got
bad,The grave yard shift is not fun first off you are very shorthanded. Most of the time we had big isles to stock and rotate where as it should be one per person. Management was very unorganized which I did not expect.
bad,"My co-workers were amazing and fun to be around. The management were not fair with the employees you have to be a brown noser to get what you want to do, and the hours were a joke, the store is always running the store with a skelton crew and trying to move up is a joke like I said you need to be a brown noser and be good with the managers."
bad,Every time an associate would clock in for his or her day a small piece of their soul would be stolen from them by the establishment.  Most associates were not equipped with the necessary tools to complete their tasks and projects. While Management were reluctant to understand the simplest machinations of the differing departments.  However most associates were willing to help each other where they could when they had the time.  The few times I enjoy working there is when my fellow employees and I were able to complete tasks together while staying within policy.
bad,"Management never backs you, they never support you, you are pushed in a negative manner and the expensive benefits they offer, is way too high for what coverage they offer."
bad,"Would not recommend walmart as a place to work. Managers (store and assistant) think the own the company and call all the shots for the store they are at, they even wont communicate with eachother on taskes to be done in the store."
bad,"Buen ambiente laboral con compañeros, trabajo divertido"
bad,"if pregnant don't bother trying to work here, anyone is willing to turn on anyone, very rarely do people get along working together here. very strict about safety which is good but kind of irritating since if you even jump a tiny bit to grab something you get fired. Managers have been known to steal from your drawers which can lead to your job loss."
bad,Había un mal ambiente entre empleados y se ganaba poco dinero y se laboraban muchas horas y hubo errores en pagos
bad,"The only upside i had with working for this company was, meeting new people everyday and helping them by answering questions for them, or showing them where products were in the store. management stinks, and advancements was impossible to get. from day one i requested to be moved to a different position, and they never honored my request."
bad,"Having very little work experience at the time, this was a first real job that I had. There was really no day management for maintenance, but there were two others that work that area they were really gunning to get that position. The other employees at that time were no better. There was one time were I was the only maintenance person on and there was a lot that needed to be done, the bathrooms needed to be cleaned and the cart returners needed help. Part of Maintenance job is to help return carts,while I was the only one on I could only do so much and I remember that they had to get two or three cashiers to go help return carts and one of them looked at me and said ""This is your job"". That really hurt. I would not recommend anyone working here even of it was the last retail job that was out there."
bad,i worked  at the begging as a cashier and then moved to the food production area. i enjoyed the deli over cashier job.  I cleaned and worked hard and was promised a raise and didn't get one till i left samsclub.
bad,Very face pace job too much work for how little you get paid management doesn't really help if u have an issue with something work related. Been there 2 years and people that just started making more then I do without any more experience then I have. They don't go by seniority.
bad,I would only recommend this job if it is your first job. Very room for advancement and the positions that are open are very cut-throat competitive. If you can get into a management position however you are very well off compared to other jobs you can get without a high school diploma.
bad,There was no advancement here I has complications with a pregnancy but seemed tgey did not care most of the staff was friendly and willing to help management seemed like they did not care
bad,"Working for this company is becoming a scary issue. A typical day was extremely busy with direction changing constantly. The one thing I enjoyed, was the people!"
bad,The boss that works for Walmart distribution is a very rude person she curses at you and very smart mouth she will talk to you like she looks down on you
bad,It is a stressful place to work.too many demands for the pay.they pick and choose who they want to advance. There is a lot of unnecessary rules and way to do the job. The managers are not on the same page of doing things.one day its ok to do this then they change their minds.
bad,"lack of communication between managers and associates, very backwards company, managers give task and expect you to know how to do them, too many managers and not enough associates"
bad,"Numerous requests for time off to attend church services were ignored for over 3 months.  I was the only employee that I know of that had to work every Sunday."
bad,"I liked my role at my job, just hated the way that management ran that location. I was taking 2 hour bus trips to get to a job that didn't appreciate any of us. Never had enough people at the other registers so it always put an extra burden on me & the other cashiers. Coworkers and supervisors were great though."
bad,worked in the hardest working the department and no recognition for the work that we completed in the time frame everyday we were only offered 21 hours a week anything more you got written up for it horrible experience.
bad,"Coworkers are nice but management stick to themselves and are always hard to find especially when needed to assist at a register. Breaks are given either unnecessarily early or ridiculously late, never on time. Speaking to an assistant manager counts as your break as well. "
bad,"Wal-Mart is where I was introduced to the Human Resource Field."
bad,"Working at Walmart is difficult and exhausting. You must work on your  feet your entire shift, and the work is manual and hard. Heavy lifting is expected of you. One is constantly being pushed to accomplish more in less time. The Home Office is always changing how to do the job, and it becomes confusing as you try to remember how to currently do your job. Managers give conflicting instructions and tasks. Work schedules and benefits are being cut."
bad,"I felt like I was back in High School with this company. Management had their ""golden boys and girls"", and if you weren't in their elite squad, then you didn't matter. "
bad,"Management is horrible. You can never find a manager to do anything for you, mostly because they hide and fight over who is going to go help. The company is more concerned about their money then the customers or employees. Employees are threatened with write ups for minor issues in turn preventing employees from moving up in the company."
bad,"not a good place to work at.  Management is to busy cutting hours, to keep expenses down to get there big bonuses at the  end of these"
bad,"I've never been treated more poorly in any place than I have been at Walmart.The managers were unbelievably rude and seemed incredibly unprofessional, the employees and supervisors were worse. There were only a couple of employees that were cool and friendly towards me. Overall an unhealthy and painful experience."
bad,A typical day at walmart starts off with no equipment available to start my job. I learned that it doesn't matter how hard you work you wont move up. I have learned how to run a team and train.Hardest part about my job is dealing with management throwing you off process.
bad,A typical day at work involved running a cash register for 8 hours. You get 2 15 minutes breaks and an hour lunch break on a normal 8 hour day. I learned a lot about interacting with the public as well as how to solve many problems encountered with the workplace itself. Management can be somewhat challenging to deal with. The workplace culture was very diverse. The hardest part of the job is maintaining a professional composure even when you are physically and emotionally drained from working that day. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to interact with people and having people who appreciated you for what you are doing.
bad,I was a cart pusher. I was constantly running errands for everyone while working in the heat while being encouraged to not take the breaks I needed to hydrate and was reprimanded for stopping to get water or just to breathe for a second.
bad,When I worked in Walmart I tried to advance on my job but the manager at the time didn't allow me to.  The manager at that time didn't like me and wasn't very helpful.
bad,"other then my summary. i hated working at walmart. they treat you like a robot. They don't pay really worth it. and all the childish behavior that goes on is ridiculous. i tried to advance but never "" got the chance"""
bad,"Walmart would be a better place if the hourly managers didn't treat the employees so poorly. Not everyone receives the bonus in the full amount owed and no one tells you you have to work a certain amount of hours to receive it. Have to work holidays and do not receive holiday pay because of said ""bonuses"". I worked Christmas and Thanksgiving but was not paid for it because I wasn't eligible, and was not told I would not receive the money owed me. Other employees took home money that I earned and I had to miss the time with my family. Hours keep getting cut because they keep hiring more and more employees. Went from working a 35 hours to working 25 hours in a week in the span of 2 weeks."
bad,I never had a set schedule when working there. It's great for summer work as a college kid for some spare change. They just won't work with you for hours in the summer.
bad,"not much people to help on a day, lean how to do the job as a cart pusher, the hardest part of the job is keeping up with what you need to do. the most enjoyable part of the job is working with your friends."
bad,This is your basic low paying job that you go into work and know that management considers you replaceable at any moment. The pay was some of the lowest I have seen and while you could push for a management position the amount of responsibility was not equal to the pay. They seemed to actively push for a divide between the management and the employees.
bad,"doesn't feel like you are working as a team, pretty much every man/woman for themselves. its more like someone is trying to babysit you instead of getting their own work done."
bad,"a normal day on the job you stock shelves,"
bad,A typical day at work was being given tons of work to perform but not enough people or time to complete it. Management is non communicative with each other which results in you getting different instructions on how to do one project. The hardest part was all the heavy lifting.
bad,"the group leader, from the district managers to store managers show no respect to their employees, they treat people like their slave. they expect one person to do work that requires more than two workers to do."
bad,"Walmart does not care about the people who work very hard for them, cut throat!! I would not recommend it for anyone to work there I remember being yelled at for something I had nothing to do with because I wasn't working at the time. Always had me working off the clock and would call me at home to do problem solving. Had no respect for my time as long as I helped them!,"
bad,Typical day at work was just helping customers non stop. I learned how to use certain work systems. Management was very awful. They would blame us for issues we didn't cause. They were pro-management and didn't care about their associates or customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the other associates and the friendships you could make.
bad,"workers are not treated fairly"
bad,Management was a joke. They were more worried about  money and not the people. No one followed the procedures when it came to handling food or when it came to cleaning.
bad,Did not enjoy working for this firm.  Hiring incentives did not come through as promised.  Personality conflicts between other employees became too distracting.
bad,"A few rules in the policy should be changed. If you are strong willed person,  this job is for you.  Adjusting shifts to adhere to store changes. Overnight is made for a machine that never gets old."
bad,"Very little advancement options. They hire a lot of Veterans, but that's not a bad thing. But when they hire a veteran to do a managment job that I have to train them to do instead of just promoting me, I have a serious problem with that."
bad,"Long hours with less then minimum wage. No benefits such as medical, dental or family insurance. We were held responsible for other peoples work or lack there of."
bad,Walmart is Walmart.  If you are not looking for much more than a paycheck this is your place.  Management is bad and treats you like cattle. They don't care about you and makes sure you know it
bad,"Honestly, walmart taught me a lot of positive experiences and skills with how to handle customers in different situations. Management really just needed improvement."
bad,Employees are a dime a dozen and treated as such. I finally got to work overtime and the next week they gave me 12 hours! flexibility is not a strong suit unless you have been there for 15+ years or 100 years old. the managers might as well have certificates from clown college.
bad,Arrived and had to wait a while until let in the building.  Learned about retail and that it is not for me.  Management seemed to make the rules up as they went but learned the powers that be were changeing them to suit.  Worked every weekend and had no social time with my family.  The best part of the job was the friends I made.
bad,Minors shouldn't work at Walmart because management isn't understanding and flexible when it comes to school schedules. Walmart feels like everyone doesn't have a life outside of work and work was getting in the way of school.
bad,"Sometimes you take whatever job you can, and just go with the flow and hope it leads to something better, and at the least you gained more knowledge to get you farther in life."
bad,The management was less than stellar because they promoted not on ability but on the length of time you were there.  Their pay was very low for the work you had to do
bad,"It was just a job, the people i worked with were nice but as for the pay, hours, and reliableity it was bad. they latterly layed off all the backshift people because they didn't need them anymore and some of them were working for over 1 year they don't care about there employees just about there money and that is it."
bad,"This review is based solely on experiences at Walmart 01036. Beginning pay at Walmart is higher than almost any other place for new employees, but the company does not care about it's employees anymore. Employees who have been with the store for 10+ years receive the same pay, or slightly more than new hires. The store does not accept doctor's notes for medical emergencies (miscarriages, heart attacks, death in the family, etc. The store cuts hours by more than 20 hours unexpectedly. The managers show favoritism toward employees (some employees are denied raises for invalid reasons, while other employees with same circumstances will receive raises). There has been unaddressed reported acts of inappropriate conduct by managers. The store powers down the A/C and heat at night, disregarding the comfort of third shift employees. However, as opposed to the three strikes you receive at other stores, at Walmart, you receive 9 strikes before you are fired. An employee meeting giving a brief overview of insights and freight numbers and employee departments begins a typical night at Walmart. Then, employees are sent to designated departments to work 1-15 pallets of freight, depending on the truck load that night. Employees are given two 15 minute breaks and one 1 hour lunch break."
bad,"Walmart is awful. Between the lines and the crazy way everything is set up, I do not understand why people shop at Walmart. People only ever complain while they are there anyways, I know this because people would yell at me as if I was at the Customer Service desk and I wasn't. I would get yelled at while cashiering and while helping other customers. I left the place after management was trying to force me to apologize to a crazy lady who was scream and cursing at me for not helping her while I was helping an older gentleman look for an item, the gentleman was standing next to me and even apologized for her behavior. The only time I enjoyed working there was actually everyone elses least favorite time, Christmas time."
bad,the management team was awesome. i enjoyed what i did and had fun doing it. but they dont care about their employees. or their work schedules. they wouldnt work with my schedule.
bad,"Coworkers are the best part of working with the company. Managers don't want to work, usually hide out in their offices. Understaffed and not willing to allow you to change departments when jobs become available."
bad,"Not a good place to work, Managment is terrible, and they rip you off on your bonuses. They do not do drug tests, and your doing the job of 5 people. No paid holidays."
bad,"it was ok when I first started there, then as time went on the store I worked at began to really suck. management never communicates effectively with associates and they only care about the dollar and never care about the people who work there. and above all Walmart is the worst company I have ever worked for in my life."
bad,"This is a job that is good if you're still in school. If you're wanting to make a living off of it, it is not the best. If you are doing extremly well at your job and they see it, they will fire you."
bad,This is one of the most unorganized companies that i have ever worked for with managers that dont always know what is going on in there own department. I was never fully trained in the position that i was in. I needed to fill out work mans comp. but the manager thought being on his phone was more important.
bad,The management team was bad all they do is talk about people and they would not give you your bonus when it came time.They would tell other workers that they didn't give you your bonus.
bad,expected to do the work of multiple people working the same job in the private sector for much less pay. Very indifferent to your needs only care abouty therebottom line.
bad,the attendance policy at Walmart sucks. I was a hard worker and I feel like my hard work went unnoticed. Management doesn't pay attention to employees. Overall my team was good
bad,It's a good job but sometimes scheduling is a bit of a problem because it isn't a set schedule every week is different. However if you have an emergency and have to leave early if you let them know in advance they are very understanding
bad,The 2 years employed with Walmart wasn't the best . The Benefits are being taken away. They DONT accept doctors notes even if you have a serious condition. The managers aren't trained which means the crew isn't either.
bad,"The csm's were never together. They don't come with your change when you need it. they're late with giving workers their lunch breaks, and they try to get mad when you tell their manager on them."
bad,"The managers didn't want to work with me. Even when I put I could only work 25 hours because I was a full time student they wouldn't work with me on the days I needed off. Also they would constantly pull all of apparel out to every other department and only leave the person at the dressing room there. I didn't have a problem with that but then they would yell at us for not having our department clean. On a typical work day I would be handling the jewelry counter or sales floor, organizing stock or tables and racks so they looked up to par. The hardest part of the job was constantly redoing what was just fixed because a store is always busy. It could look perfect and you ask a manager to come look for approval, and by the time they get there it is messy again and it looks bad on you. But you can't tell people not to mess it up because they are customers. The managers don't seem to care, they want it always looking like no one has walked in the door."
bad,When you are hired they tell you that they treat their employees like family. That is the furthest from the truth. I spent over 10 years of my life there to just be stabbed in the back.
bad,"I was an: 'over-night stocker, third (3rd) shift cashier, moving from one (1) section of the store to the other all night long. Stocking merchandise throughout the store,"
bad,They will walk pass you and won't open they mouth that included the store manager too just sad and horrible it's just sad how you can do that to the people that work for you can't take your vacation whrn you won't they always say no coverage but they take there's just sad
bad,Not very good! Management needs to communicate much better with employees and respect and care about them much better!! They make u feel not important enough and don't treat you fairly and don't give an equal opportunity for advancement!! They play very much a favoritism game
bad,Some the managers don't know how to talk to the associated  they  would yell  and be. Disrespect to others and they rude to customers and  managers don't treat everyone the same way and that not fair to the other 2000 something employees
bad,Most of the coworkers were wonderful. The management on the other hand most weren't that great. Pay was alright horrible hours though. If your in a tight spot and need money not bad otherwise last resort
bad,It was not an enjoyable job. Management was not supportive of their workers. I did not feel like I was appreciated. I learned how to work with others.
bad,Walmart is an okay place to work but the pay isn't that great I had a kid and needed to get paid more and the management were very unorganized and at times it was very slow and had nothing to do.
bad,"My experience at Walmart was horrible. In the beginning, they try to make it sound like the experience will be nice and easy paced, but give them two or three weeks and you'll see how things change. After the month of working with them, I was being harassed at work by CSM, which is a supervisor, and managers didn't care about the situation. Not to mention they carry the work environment like a military base. You cannot talk to your coworkers while at work or multitasking, managers make the rules as they go, and basically blame their associates for doing things they aren't supposed to do even though associates ask them first hand. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers."
bad,Just didnt like working for this company. Many of the people that worked there were rude and not very nice. I wasnt treated very well while i was working there
bad,Wal-Mart is a world wide store that should be able to run their business more efficient and effectively. This comapny tends to give many people their first job or their job after retirement.
bad,Better management. Also when conducting orientations they should specify more of certain topics. Should train employees better until they really grasp the way a job should be done and answer any questions regarding their job title
bad,"This was a dead end job with no benefits and minimum pay. I worked extremely hard every day dealing with difficult customers and usually short handed and busy all day. I didn't mind the work but the management was not good, they didn't care about their employees at all."
bad,lazy workers no help from others nobody knows whats going on everyday there is changes in the store everyone is lost nobody really cares negative energy
bad,"No employee appreciation, laid off Just two days before Christmas​ and was told they won't pay unemployment. Did nothing wrong, they just had to lay off so many which is the worst kind of company in the world."
bad,"not a very associate friendly place,management tends to use the hard working most knowledgeable people to their limits and slackers slide,accountability isn`t across the board"
bad,"The pay is great, but management is completely bias and hypocritical. Don't expect to get acknowledged for all your hard work unless you look like a homeless stray that kisses tush. You will have to do tasks multiple times before management decides to clarify what they'd like you to do. You will have no privacy and each adult gossips like childish teens. The elder employees are the pettiest. Oh and nothing is confidential. Policies are constantly broken."
bad,I truly enjoyed the customers. Being a cashier was fulfilling in that I could make a difference in our customers day. Mgmt was slow to assist when needed. The hours I worked were all over the place. Difficult to adjust.
bad,"you cant have your own opinion and if you dont kiss managements butt often and enough you get blamed for anything and everything even if you werent at work when the issue came up. Get reprimanded for someone else's mistake but nothing happens to the one that made the mistake.  "
bad,As a customer service associate I learned to work with Money Gram and returned items. The job was part time and the people I worked with were pleasant. The most difficult was the shift change without notice. I was also a cashier when people did not show up for work.
bad,"Life sucks at Walmart. Store is run by people who own stock. Daily harassment by outsiders who come in and harass store managers and try to intimidate constantly getting staff fired and overseeing their investment."
bad,"	Cashed payroll and government checks"
bad,It can be fun but management doesn't treat employees right. They take advantage of you and don't pay you fairly. I dislike working for a company that treats the employees the way they do
bad,"As a driver, one would be expected to be paid overtime at the  ""driver rate.""  You are paid as if you are working inside the store and then a ""driver's premium"" is tacked on. Then if you run into overtime on the road as is frequently the case your overtime rate is not calculated on the driver rate but as if you are working inside. Ripoff!"
bad,"It's a bad work environment and the management is not good .great customers, bad hours not enough money to take care of one's family . Staff are hatefull"
bad,Overall Walmart is a decent company.  The management team at my store is hard to deal with at times due to downward pressure to cut hours.  Its the easy way to lower cost.  The solution is easy they need to work with their employees and either train or get rid of the bad workers.
bad,Didnt really like it the people out there are  rude to the customers and couldnt stand how they treat the customers people they dont smile to the customers and it seem like each of the bosses is on their period or something
bad,Walmart does not treat employees  well. Management is a joke and not there for the employees.  No raises and no motivtion for employees. Benefits are not very good either.
bad,"They tend to treat you like a dog there. They would never praise you for doing good, and would get on your case if you did mediocre. They never made you feel like a valued employee, and would commonly threaten your job. No place will make you feel like your job doesn't matter more."
bad,Most of the managers could care less about the employees under their charge. Get the job done and don't make any waves. Pay raises are minimal when I did get a raise it was a dime an hour as maintenance crew leader.
bad,"es un lugar donde es facil que te contraten, pero no respetan tu puesto, pueden contratarte para ser cajero pero te traen como de limpieza y quieren que hagas lo mismo que otros puestos pero te siguen pagando lo mismo."
bad,"This is an extremely busy and stressful pharmacy to work in."
bad,I worked seasonal and it was okay. Good pay ansand quick advancement. Friendly staff. But I was only there for the summer and moved on not long after.
bad,This job is great if you have a free schedule because they have been known to keep people WAY over their scheduled time (specifically on the closing shifts). Student beware.
bad,I've been working here for the past 2 years and pay is decent but the way they treat their employees is awful if you want to make money and suffer this is your place
bad,Its a job! Nothing more! Its not the friendliest place to work. Depending on the store and managers you work for your experience at Walmart maybe great!
bad,"Management is not on the same page, dont get along also bully employees and have no consequences if you report them they will make your life miserable"
bad,"Probably the first and worst company I've ever worked for. Started here out of high school instead of going to college and was that a mistake. Managment was always on people for small things but never for big issues. Intead they blame the person who complains about the issue instead of actually DEALING WITH IT!! They higher employees with the idea of how expendable they are instead of how useful THEY CAN BE!! The only part I enjoyed working here was getting my foot in the door for some work experience, if any, and my manager who taught me a lot. The culture there is very mixed with emotions strangly running high and the hardest part was dealing with managers complaining about work not being done, which they did EVERYDAY!!"
bad,"Staff is friendly and welcoming, management is not on the same page as the employees. Very unorganized with stocking and pricing. Say there willing to give flexible schedules and schedule you when you're not available."
bad,"The pay was decent, management however, was very off putting. When having a issue with other employees, management only fixes the issue if they favor you. My biggest suggestion to walmart, fix your managers, they need to learn people skills."
bad,"management is terrible , work place and culture was also terrible did not enjoy a single day working for that company it might be just the location of the hotel"
bad,My typical day working at Walmart was just ringing people up. I stood at a register and that's all I did for hours. I learned how to use a register and have good customer service skills. Management at Walmart didn't want to hear your input on things. It was either their way or no way. I didn't like that. The hardest part about my job was standing in one spot for hours at a time. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting the many friendly customers.
bad,I worked at this Walmart for almost 5 years. This location not saying all of them but this one by far was the absolute worst. The management was horrible. They constantly belittle you. You are not given the tools needed in order to successfully complete any task given to you. The work environment is very stressful. They find every way they can to cut corners.
bad,"Working at Walmart you experience a lot of things. Some days are good some are bad, but you have to make the decision of what kind of day you will have. Walmart employees have different kind of personalities but you can choose how to accept them. Overall Walmart is a great company to work for"
bad,"The job was fun, and some managers was nice some were not depends on the person, some sexest management that don't think women are not to work on cars like the guys."
bad,Things are misplaced or items are wrongly stocked the 15 min breaks are pointless in a way since walking to the break room depending were you at takes up most of it
bad,"This is a decent place if you just want to have some customer service experience on your resume.  Unless you have connections with upper management, advancement is hard to attain."
bad,I loved working with the people but not so much the customers mainly kids running around nocking things off and making messes in the store. I was only temporary for the holidays but the time I was there they would work me to the last second and I was still in high school so by the time I would get home I was exhausted. And when I had school events to attend they wouldn't give me the days off so I would have to miss out on commitments I had made with my class because Walmart wouldn't let me take the day off.
bad,"Thought it was a good place at first but the harder you work the more they put you down. "
bad,Csm do not like trading you .... they are rude and. They embarrass  you in front of customers if you need help on a mistake  try to force associates into other depth or give you an ultimatum to do it or get fired.... cut out hours make your do more than your on job'
bad,"You will be told you can advance, you likely will not ever get the opportunity. Schedules vary so you can at times have a mere 8 hours between shifts."
bad,"Either hate it or love it, and I did both."
bad,no rest for the weirdie. a lot  of heavy stuff to lift and easy to get hurt.i don't really know what else to say about it. the job is in the past and that is where i want to leave it.
bad,If you choose to do as little as possible and still be compensated in some small way then walmart is for you! Love doing job duties outside of your pay range and don't want to get paid for it anytime soon? You guessed it walmart is for you.
bad,Worked there several years always came to work and did what was asked never. The pay is minimum and every two weeks. Never could get requested time off
bad,The DM should be required to have a Pharmacy background! The work is easy the moral is horrible but the patients for the most part are very understanding
bad,The job environment is very unorganized. Management isn't properly trained and don't communicate with each other at all. They aren't considerate of family emergencies or health emergencies.
bad,"loved the part of going in getting job completed "
bad,"If you are just high school pass and start working at age 16 & 18 then this is a place for you. They don't need any qualification to promote you to managerial positions. All you need is tough talk, disciplinarian attitude and fear mongering. If you are white even better."
bad,"Walmart did nt compensate me for overtime hours worked. When it was brought to HR's attention, they were difficult to work with in trying to find a resolution and compensation."
bad,"I don't see any chance of moving up in this job.  I would not want to go anywhere else in store, because i have seen the way my fellow co workers are treated.  They don't have a full staff so they are pulled from their area to where ever they need someone, then they are expected to take care of their area plus that other area which is impossible for one person.  Being a cashier i get to see and hear everything that is going on.  I enjoy talking to customers and fellow coworkers, they have a nice break room with refrigerator, sink, microwave, and two nice lazy chairs to rest in on your break."
bad,"I loved the work and my coworkers.  Way too stressful for the pittance I got.  You were held responsible for EVERYTHING that ever happened."
bad,A lot could be improved but I guess that's how the managers want to manage their company. The managers are alright sometimes. Just do what you suppose to do in order to avoid any hassles from the manager.
bad,You will spend all of your time here. Nothing that you do will be good enough. Management has no respect for associates who are underpaid for the work they are expected to complete.
bad,"i did not like working there. i didn't like the hours, the pay or the management it was so unprofessional and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone!!!!!!!"
bad,"When I first began my journey with Walmart I started in Los Angeles, and after a couple of months we found out our store was closing. I decided to stay with the company and transfer out to one of the store in Downey. It was probably one of the worst mistakes ever. The store manger was always rude and she didn't seem to care about any of the employees."
bad,"A typical day is getting your assignment done in a timely manner.i learn how to stock the dairy, meat wall,frozen section and water aisle.  Management was horrible. Not a good culture at all everyone was out for themselves. The hardest part was having so much work without help and they want in done in a little amount of time."
bad,Very good employees to work with. Management is unreasonable. They have 10 people doing the job of 30. They do not accommodate your life. You have to accommodate to them. Very hard place to work at. Doesn't matter all the good you do if you make one tiny mistake they will fire you. No job security
bad,"A typical day at work includes doing all leftover work from the overnight shift. Which Includes pallets, sales floor is also empty and returns. This is to all be done within the confines of your shift no matter how much it is. Management has very poor leadership with favoritism at its best. Workplace culture is the okay it is a melting pot of every race and some are compatible with each other some is not."
bad,I hated my job with this company. Management expects WAY to much out of just one person. The workload is insane and the compensation is NOT worth it..
bad,They were very unprofessional and treated people very rudely.  I was never told that the position that I applied for was a temporary position and let me go right after the holidays.  I was raising a child that was 3 years old at the time and recently married so I needed the job.  I was making decent money as was my husband at the time.  We were a young recently married couple starting out in life.
bad,If you are vocal you won't get ahead here. You have to blindly follow their horrible policies and not mind getting treated badly. If you get sick it's 9 points and you're out no matter the reason or how long you've been an employee.
bad,No hay oportunidades de ascenso y la jefa de linea una persona arrogante
bad,"I do not wish to comment on the quality of this company. I am grateful I had a job to pay my bills and keep food on the table, but i do not feel comfortable discussing my issues with the company."
bad,Checking customers out quickly and Efficiently. Helping customers find what they are looking for. I learned great customer service skills and how o keep a smile on. The managers were nice and demanding.
bad,Walmart should be your last resort for work. This company is horrible as an employer. To much responsibility  on the job no benefits and pay is minimum. Management is corrupt no values or morals.
bad,"They do not care much for employees. Came in with Doctors note saying I could not work for 2 days. Pretty much said it still counts against you. It is a chronic condition and could have gotten worse if I worked. But they didn't show any concern at all. Good starting job, but no career or concern from higher ups. Makes you feel unimportant. Not worth it."
bad,working for walmart is like playing russian roulette you never know when the do do is gonna hit the fan and your at the bottom of the pile best advice?? make sure you always carry a umbrella
bad,"The management is horrible. They're not understanding, and they expect way too much from you. They're completely understaffed because people quit because of the management. When you start, you're paid the same as any other position."
bad,Working at Walmart I learned a lot about the company itself entirely. Also a lot about myself and what I can push myself to do. Walmarts a really great company if you like repetitive work days and seeing alot of faces.
bad,"I can only speak for myself and the store that I currently work at, but I do not like working at Walmart because of management. They are rude, expect too much out of its employees, and do not care how well the job was done(not all managers, but some)."
bad,"this job is very hard on the body, store manager changes every year, the turnover rate is crazy, don't look to make it a career, management is not the easiest to talk to"
bad,"poor supervision and training"
bad,"Management not very understanding, time off is an understatement for this company. The way they go about things is unprofessional and they need better structure."
bad,"one one seemed to be on the same page, alot of work for one person, no team players management walked around as if they didn't see you, no one pulled from other depts to assist, but they would pull you to assist with other depts and expected you to complete your job before leaving"
bad,"Terrible just terrible!"
bad,Terrible management which cuts every corner for production even if it violates safety guidelines. Would force overtime one day at the last minute then ask you to take a long lunch the next so it eliminates the overtime.
bad,"good for a temporary part time job, or for anyone seeking stability in hours. depending on the store management could be better, very flexible on scheduling for students."
bad,learned to interact with different types of customers and it was interesting. I didn't like the lack of hours fulltime and lack of job security each week
bad,Eu acredito que essa empresa poderia pagar mais aos seus funcionários que realmente trabalham bastante.
bad,I am putting up freight half the night then I am trying to get all of my maintenance dutis done the rest of the night.And I am short staffed 3 days out of the week.
bad,"I worked 3rd shift and was required to stock shelves with products for the next day's customers. Never moved you around, never gave you the potential to move up or learn new opportunities."
bad,Have worked for walmart for too long. Management have no communication skills. Most of them are also very unpleasant people to work with. Co workers are alright. Don't get a job here unless it's just a placeholder to get a better job. Would not recommend to anyone.
bad,"Being a cashier was great, but being a student and working there was hard. Management also messed up my schedule and I would get written up for it. They received my school schedule twice but continued to schedule me for work during class. I shouldn't have been penalized for managements mistakes. Some of the managers are also very rude and they do not care about your well-being."
bad,I learned a lot about working on some cars.. I worked with great people who were ASE certified mechanics.. They all quit due to management and I became one of the senior techs.
bad,I loved working for Walmart. But some management issues are a problem. The associates are over worked due to people calling out or quitting and not being replaced. Shifts aren't staffed properly. Weekend staffing in the fresh area is very minimal you cannot properly run a department when you don't have coverage. As a department manager I was still working as an associate due to lack of staffing or call outs. There is always a lot of people out. Orders don't come in when they should the warehouse has to many outs and replenishable items don't replenish fast enough. Management has made associates cry and not like the job they have.
bad,Working at walmart your hours will have to be open all the time usually to get hired and a must to move up anywhere.Always expect to be called in on your day off due to call offs.Also you almost will never finish on time and be required to stay later but if you do have over time don't  expect to keep it.This will be like any retail job always work holidays and near the end of being there 20 or so years expect to be laid off or fired for someone that does the job at half the price.
bad,To be honest and fair I must say I no longer shop at Walmart because I used to work for them. So much of what you hear in the media is so true about this company.
bad,I worked for Wal-Mart for 10 years. You have plenty of opportunity to advance but directions from upper management can be very unclear. Be prepared to deal with a lot of stress.
bad,kept telling us to do a job that takes 10 people when we had 3 and the things we had to do for the money we got was Bullcrap. the management had there heads up there butts they mostly never had any idea on that each department dus
bad,"Rarely an opportunity for advancement, inconsistent hours, unexpected cutting of hours, unreliable and disrespectful management."
bad,"They cut your hours all the time. Management doesn't care about you. If you're lucky enough to get a good manager it's a great job, but so many managers are unskilled and have poor temperaments for leading teams. Pay is better than other entry level jobs, if you care more about a little money than being treated like a human being you may like it here."
bad,"Very disorganized. Management rarely ever knows what to do when approached. They really want Walmart to be your number one priority in life. They try and pull fast ones and take advantage on teenage employees, important to know your rights as an employee. My manager admitted To me she did not know how to work in my department (one she looked over). It's very messy place to work."
bad,"Constantly having issue with upper management changing everything and going back on orders. Support mangers tried to help associates, but constantly had to deal with upper management causing trouble."
bad,What can I say? It's walmart. I did not enjoy working there. The pay and benefits did not foster an environment where I felt I could thrive.
bad,Comments withheld. Prefer not to answer. Very disorganized. Management divide the workers and do not encourage personal interaction. There is no motivation to advance.
bad,"For the sake of brevity: Game of Thrones, without the murdery bits......yet, as far as I'm aware. Still the closest place for late-night grocery runs."
bad,Too many people playing boss not enough hard workers. They did not help when I was big harassed by a manager. They didn't care my child came first before them. Several times threaten with lose of job if didn't do something that I didn't believe in doing.
bad,I loved the job but the people I worked with wasn't respectful. The job was easy I loved coming in the morning and leaving around 2
bad,Working at walmart was not an entirely pleasant place to work but I'm glad to have had the experiences working there. I learned quite a bit of customer service tips and tricks.
bad,Customers make this job great. You can not go a day with out a crazy minute. If you have the right mind set you can make it great. Days go fast because it is almost always busy. I learned so much in my 16 years and worked with great people that it would be hard to start with one thing. Associates flow in and out so fast that it is hard to know if that was a good or bad thing. I loved meeting every one but the training and retraining was crazy.
bad,Wal mart wouldn't be my career just temporary. Wal mart doesn't care for there associates.  Wal mart would be a good starting job .... If u can work at wal mart u can work just about anywhere
bad,"show up clock in, get everything i need to do my job work quickly and productivly. hardest part was having to pick up oty her co-works slack and it going unnoticed."
bad,"Era un infierno no me daban mi lugar como jefe de farmacia."
bad,I dont get schedule much so im not able to finiacially help my family. I do the samething everyday when i go to work which is once every two weeks.
bad,"A typical day at Walmart consisted of cleaning, organizing and stocking your department. The work was very hard, lifting over 35+ lbs boxes, pulling large loads of merchandise and standing on your feet all day. Management was non-existed, they were very hard to find. Co-workers were diverse, some hard workers, others showed up for work but didn't want to do the job. The hardest part was lifting heavy boxes and pulling flatbeds with heavy loads. Enjoyable part was to actually to be able to put all the merchandise away that was delivered to your department."
bad,"A typical day consist of you be continuously being micro-managed by supervisors and being coached on how to do a job that you do everyday. I learned nothing while working here. Management is very unhelpful, arrogant, and lazy. The co-workers can sometimes be annoying but as long as you find one or two people to converse with on a daily basis it makes the job somewhat bearable. The hardest part of the job is the minimal pay with no benefits, no vacation time, and management constantly being on your back. The most enjoyable part of the job is conversing with coworkers when it is permitted."
bad,"When I first moved to Mesa, Arizona, WalMart was willing to hire me--This is the est thing I can say about working for WalMart."
bad,"Sometimes it's fun to work but not so great. Some are lazy and don't do their work and I use to have to do it for them, and the manager would blame you for something they did."
bad,"I suppose it could have been the particular location that I worked at that was an outlier rather than an accurate representation of Walmart as a whole but, my experience there was less than pleasant and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
bad,"Ok place to work, but not if you want a career. Sometimes there are rude customers but the overnight managers are worse they are horrible. I would suggest anyone to try to get a position on day shift but working days you will not get many hours. Working overnight is very tiring and draining, I would not refer anyone who want a easy job to work overnight."
bad,"I hated working at Walmart.   The customers are horrible and so are most of the coworkers and managers.  Too easy to get fired.  Somehow pays better than most other retail/fast food, but still bad benefits."
bad,There isn't much to say about this company. Pay is decent. One big con is there is no positive reinforcement. I do miss my customers and most of my co-workers.
bad,"A typical day at work is stressful."
bad,"There always work. But they are into your petsonal life"
bad,"Walmart wasn't bad for the most part, but I started there as a cart pusher and then left due to an emergency surgery when I came back they switched me too maintenance. There was nights where they would pull me outside to help push carts even though that was not my job."
bad,"The Job in itself is not very difficult, Co workers have been very uncooperative, Management was unresponsive, No respect for the fellow worker, Great Job in All, only problem was Management and their inexperience to handle rush and crowds."
bad,"Nope. They suck. Low pay, no way to advance. No one notices your hard work because they will just replace you in a heartbeat"
bad,no good there many other jobs that pay better with less head ackes trust me. i had a very bad experence at the walmart in white plains ny. i am sure it might be better at other stores
bad,They don't care about employees or work with employees so we can have a family life. Breaks and lunches are not consistent.
bad,Extremely time consuming. you don't have a chance to do anything in life while working there and you barely have breaks while working there.Don't recommend it.
bad,The management only cared about themselves and did not care about the associates. When time off is needed and you put in for it they will not look to see and schedule you anyways. When you have an emergency they get mad.
bad,"It's Walmart...What do you really expect? If you are lucky, they will want to over work you until you can't stand it anymore. If you are unlucky, they may cut your shifts so far down you will be unable to continue. There are some good people to work with and I have made some friends. The management is another story. Favorites are played and if you are not in, you are out. The employee discount is nifty but probably not worth the abuse. It is standard procedure for management to tell associates they must do things one way and then force them into situations where they must complete tasks conflicting whatever has been explained to them not to do. Totally standard for associates to be expected to perform tasks as needed, not as instructed."
bad,"Wal-mart didn't care about it's workers just their bottom line. I do, however, recommend that everyone works there at some point in their life simply for life experience."
bad,I've worked for Walmart twice and I started out liking it until I get scheduled for full time hours when only part time.  Had problems with getting certain days off for appointments. Request to not work with a certain person and wasn't getting switched. People don't teach you how to use equipment including phones. And getting yelled at for it when you mess up. When it's there duty to teach you how to do all things.
bad,"Typical day at work is normally busy. Sometimes it gets too busy and we are 90% of the time understaffed, and mostly when we are understaffed we do not always get to take both or even 1 single break. Managers here do not like to listen to the employees and often aren't around when needed.The co-workers are quite friendly (for the most part) and are all great workers. Normally the hardest part of the day is dealing with the customers that believe they know everything about the store and get anxious/upset/angry and decide to jump into my face about small things. However, I do quite enjoy having my own little area that I can work with and get to basically call my own."
bad,Not a bad place to work but not a good place either.  Managements attitude can improve. There's no communication. Not enough people scheduled when busy.
bad,"Well they don't pay all that great, and they have a lot of drama in the business and if you weren't on board with them, or that particular person then you are out of luck for advancement."
bad,"Stock merchandise, greet customers, cashier, etc. I learned the being an employed with this company that you are just another number to management. The managers are unappreciative and rude. Some of the co-workers work ethic was much to be desired. The hardest part of the job is the stress that comes from management putting a ton of workload on you. The Employees were the most enjoyable part of the job."
bad,"Management at Walmart is not organized, very segregated and does not value employee input.  Co-workers are very disoriented and not motivated to perform to improve work environment.  Hardest part of the job is knowing that pay is equal to those who do less than half-of the same work you contribute."
bad,typical day is get on the register and stay there til your done and breaks are never on time. what I learned was they don't care about you as a employee. hardest part of the job was getting my breaks on time and dealing with management. there is no enjoyable
bad,"Avoid if you can. Employees are overworked, under paid and underappreciated. If I could do it all over again, I would choose to be a little more patient and not agree to work here."
bad,It wasn't the best experience that I have had. The managers wouldn't listen to you and when you would need to talk to them they won't take the time to listen to you and or talk to you. You would have to wait for like a year to get certain benefits in all it wasn't that great.
bad,"Walmart, is a job unlike any I have ever experienced. I have learned a great deal about myself as a manager while working there. The staff are an amazing bunch of people who are trying to do their best daily."
bad,not an employee friendly place to work . the mangers treat th e empoyees very poorly and talk down to almost everyone. Most of the people there took the job because there was nothing else available
bad,Acredito que as lideranças de um modo em geral devem ter capacitações no que diz respeito a gestão de pessoas.
bad,"WALMART  helped me to improve and develop my public communication and public relation skills."
bad,"The managers treat you as if your slaves. all benefits that are promised end up either changing or being way below what was promised, insurances and things of that nature cost you to much to get them and still be able to support a family."
bad,"As much as Walmart claims moving up and advancement is easy, it is not. If you don't know the right people, you won't have a chance of moving up. Company is also very unorganized."
bad,i stocked shelves an unloaded trucks then took product to its location where its supposed to be i liked what i did i just didnt like how we were doing same stuff over an over again i rather be doing something different everyday
bad,"There seemed to be more friendships than coworker relationships, meaning some employees where favored due to their relationship with management, In my eyes all employees should be graded on their performance not on their friendship with said person."
bad,"Walmart should pay there employees every week instead every two weeks and the managers should lend a helping had some times, I was a really hard work and I don't think Walmart appreciated the hard work I did and did understand that I need time off for my kid"
bad,"Walmart has declined in their attitude and view on customers and associates. The company they want to present is a lie to the public and the people who work for them. Walmart is more concerned about the bottom dollar instead of providing great customer service. Home office dictates what they want to happen but with little or no understanding of the ramifications that will take place. A typical work day is usually dominated by being forced to work alone in customer service while the line continues to grow with customers becoming increasingly upset. Also, in order to avoid dealing with a customer one on one, managers will have associates go against policy to keep the customer happy and make the associate seem as though they do not know how to do their job. I would not recommend that people apply to Walmart or even shop there."
bad,"They didn't understand if you had a family emergency or was feeling sick, they don't pay good enough, they don't give enough benefits to the employees, etc."
bad,"A typical day of work at Walmart was just standing at tills all day, and how long you worked determined how many breaks you got. I learned the produce codes there is a lot to remember."
bad,I wasn't trained at all. My manager was very disrespectful and mean.They were very unorganized. My manager didn't make me a scheduled.
bad,I did not like this position because of the job that i was hired for i did not ever get to do what i was informed. I would never refer anyone to work there
bad,"would not like to work there, hard on the body standing in one place, csms are poor, poor management, coworkers have same complaints.  customers complaints because someone doesnt move fast enough,"
bad,"I worked overnight and on days. I couldn't stand it either times. We were frequently understaffed and had to cover all the extra ground. For the majority duration of my pregnancy I had to frequently cover 3 or more departments. It wasn't until the end when I was given just one light work department. Once I had my baby I went to days and the hours weren't bad. Once the new manager for cap team on board everyone's days off split even though before they were together. I pleaded with the manager to have my days off together because that's when I caught up on sleep when I wasn't caring for my baby. Alas it wasn't enough, the sleep depravation grew to taxing and forced my hand in voluntarily separating."
bad,a typical day at work involved unloading trailers i learned how to palletize  at this job i also hurt my back at this job and received no help my co workers were alright at first and then began to harass me  there was no enjoyable part of this job and the hardest part was going to work everyday to a crew that had to respect  for you
bad,So working at Walmart seemed like a great thing at first but after a little while i realized something wasn't right about the Company. The Managers were often negligent with myself and their Employees/Associates and you often had to track them down just to ask a question or get certain things done. They were good as far as getting you your check on time but there are many other areas that they need to improve on. I'm not going to put the Company in the dirt completely though. Working here taught me a lot about dealing with people and working in Retail but they should just learn to treat their Employees. Oh and they were NOT organized much at all.
bad,"About what you'd expect, although more enjoyable in terms of the coworkers and variety of work.  Dreadful managers with no formal education and very little competence or professionalism.  Cheap pay."
bad,"Checked out customers"
bad,"The job itself was great and my coworkers made working there fun. I learned how to use different types of equipment to assist me on my daily tasks. My department manager when I started working there was wonderful, he taught me everything about the job and I am glad to say I consider him my friend. The hardest part about the job was the demanding physical labor that they expected of you each and everyday. Aside from that the job wasn't too bad, I enjoyed helping people and being around flowers and plants."
bad,"...constant mid-level management churn, over-the-shoulder work ethic...upper level management on a remove-and-replace tear..."
bad,"I loved the clients I got, they loved my work. I was the manager, I really enjoyed it. But I was tossed into the role with no clue what to do. The area manager that was supposed to train me was no help, and didn't care about me, the store, or my clients. She would never show up on time, and if she did, she  would be on her phone the entire time. I contacted head office, they didn't care as well. The company had the potential to be great, but lacks motivation."
bad,"it was night shift had to stock shelves, unload trucks, mix paint if needed, help customers it was only part time with no benefits to the job but enjoyed being around people"
bad,your on your own environment... no teamwork at all not understanding of your outside life at all. the only thing that keeps me going is my co workers
bad,"I felt that the company didn't care about me or my family. They make everyone except a handful of favorites work on holidays and weekends. The do not build you up they put you down. They set you up to fail. Its amazing that Walmart can afford to give away $20,000 plus in gift certificated to people on The Extreme Weight Loss Show and they have people working for them that need help. They only give the employees 10% discount and 20% during the Thanks Giving holidays."
bad,"The entire store was horribly understaffed the entirety of the time I worked there and the management team refused to hire more people. Instead, they would assign workers to do other workers' jobs and then get angry when workers couldn't finish their own assigned duties."
bad,"Although I had it easier than some here, I find that Minnie F. had continuously abused her authority on several employees. I find the pay to be not as great as it could be seeing as Wal-Mart is a billion dollar company."
bad,When you are working cleaning shelve and restocking managers would tell you to go back to work even though you have a new product that you are putting on the self. The factor that they tend to terminate employees on their final day of probation.
bad,"would rather not have to work at Walmart ever again, 7 night shifts with 2 days off then 3 nights for 2 more days off. Above reason is why I would rather not work there again."
bad,It's very repetitive and can get frustrating at times. Long hours. It's good for those who do not have a family and they pay is good.
bad,Management at both Walmarts that I have worked at continue to belittle associates making them feel inadequate. Forces associates to use broken equipment thus endangering themselves and customers. Along with threats of write ups for going to slow as they follow the safety rules and threatening there job security because they didn't do a job they were never supposed to do or were even qualified to do.
bad,"Very inconsistent schedule, liked to work everyone at random times so you basically had no life outside of work.  Management was very uncaring and didn't understand people at home lives.  Asking for days off got your hours cut basically in half.  Would not suggest this job to anyone."
bad,"A typical day consists of:"
bad,They don't think of their employees when doing scheduling. Want us to do a job with less help than required. Will have you cross trained in multiple departments without compensation.
bad,no matter how hard you work you will never be good enough. they have no consideration for you as a person. trying to move up in the company is difficult. youll work long hours for very little pay. one of the worst jobs i ever had.
bad,"No one does their own work, and all work is put on one person. The pay IS NOT worth the stress AT ALL. The management sucks, no one listens to any problems you have, never mind actually caring. They expect you to do impossible things in the time theyve given you, and no one has EVER told me i've done a good job, they just criticize."
bad,Walmart is a very faced paced environment and as one of the busiest retail stores in the world it keeps you moving and gives you a chance to develop good customer service skills in a many times stressful environment.
bad,"Staff was great to work with for the most part. Management was one of the worst I have ever had to deal with, They don't understand that you can not control certain things nor what a family is."
bad,"Make 30+ cake orders, train employees and management, unload trucks pallets into freezer then restock in freezer, check inventory, take cake orders in person and over the phone, answer phone calls about stock questions, order equipment and inventory, clean, fill and organize sales floor, write on cakes, transfer calls to deli, computer work, fill orders and backups, cut and clean produce for fresh desserts, help with bread and donuts when needed, take photos of work for portfolio"
bad,"honestly all Walmart cares for is the bottom dollar ,it can care less about the employees ,they use and abuse all good workers ,change there schedule at the last moment with out your permission ,I get personally cursed at multiple times a day I get told to take my lunch after only being there for only two hours ,no breaks ,and there is no unity with the other workers and ,and as a company they will not tell people no ie ,customer bought a full set of tires from us like 5 years ago never provided proof of rotation and balance and also bought the wrong speed rating on the tires so they refunded his money back."
bad,This job treats their employees like slaves and require them to do unethical and illegal jobs. wouldn't work there again.
bad,The management was not nice at all. Some acted like they wanted you to fail. My co-workers were very nice and helpful. The tv in breakroom was always in and out. Didn't even need to be there if we couldn't watch. Refrigerators were always nasty.
bad,"When I first started working for this company I loved it, then as time went on I saw that it was like high school nothing but drama, gossip, and groups. people talk about others and always complaining about everthing. I go in everyday and do my job but now I feel like my job is at risk because of others and I do not like that. I feel like this company is not fair and does not care about any of their employees."
bad,"Having to stand in one spot every single day was not appreciated. Very busy, constantly, due to the mass of customers. Managers would forget about you and it was obvious I was not an asset."
bad,"I love my job however I do not like the company I work for. There is way to much negativity and drama involved with the other employees and Managers allowing it to happen freely. I'd much rather work where I'm valued, appreciated and respected."
bad,The store manager is rude and at most times unprofessional. Most of the people that work there cannot stand their employment at this particular location.
bad,It became very evident to me early on that Walmart corporate and store level managers alike share a distinct lack of value and compassion for the hourly associate unless favored by those managers. The most enjoyable part of my job quickly became interacting with the customer base and working in the solitude of the dairy cooler where managers seldom went.
bad,"The Csm are rude, the managment is clueless, the customers are non appreciative. They are very unorganized worse place I have ever worked EVER....."
bad,"pretty good pay,good people to work with but  need better management though.i learn that we need better management in the store.my co workers were ok but need to be organized."
bad,"Hours fluctuated a lot so had to be on your toes. Never knew if the day was going to be busy or slow sometimes it was a combination. CSM's were sometimes not able to quickly respond to action codes, and customers sometimes were not polite or did not know what they could afford."
bad,"The managers at this location play favorites. Their favorites can get away with practically murder when it comes to doing their jobs or doing things against protocols and policy. If you are not a favorite they treat you like dirt. If you work hard you have to make up for the slack of the rest of the team because they  get away with slacking, but if you do they write you up or give you verbal warnings etc. This place also doesn't care about medical accommodations, I had some approved and any time I tried to use them I was told if I couldn't do anything more than I was doing then I needed to just go home. I was only treated well when I was accomplishing working multiple people's job. This place expects you to pull of a 4-8+ person job by yourself. The assistant managers love to sit on their butts and be scarce, only time it is different is when the store manager is on premises and keeping them jumping. I wouldn't work at this location again if it was the last place to work on earth. Oh and you were told you had to take your breaks, but if you did and you weren't able to get all your stuff done because the work load, customers &/or physical/medical restrictions you were told you had to stay late and if you didn't you got a write up."
bad,"Busy, always something to do. Friendly co-workers. looking for new challenges. It's time for a change. I don't want to say anymore, I've always been told, if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all."
bad,Entre os colegas companherismo. Tem hora para chegar mas não para sair. Porem as gratificações são muito boas.
bad,"Work/Life Balance:  I got 40 hours a week which was nice, but I worked overnight so that is expected. Good luck getting a night off though. The managers don't take kindly to that and you will be reprimanded. 1/5"
bad,"It was a typical cashier position, i handled money, dealt with customers, and maintained a clean area. I learned how to deal with angry, unpleasant customers."
bad,I was one of the worst jobs I had. just a horrible job and brings in the worst kind of people and over all it was a big Joke. I could go on forever about the cons about this job but I have better things to do.
bad,"I worked for Walmart in 2010 and 2012 at two different stores unloading trucks and managing inventory. The turnover rate was very high and we were rarely fully staffed. Despite this, we were expected to unload trucks in the same amount of time as if we were fully staffed. Usually could not take the first break until the truck was finished."
bad,Overall my customers are great and fellow associates are as well. Management no so much. I've learned to be proficient and to show up to work 2 hours after I get out of the emergency room. On the other hand I have great survey reviews from customers who have had my services with the company. The only time I was happy is when working with great associates.
bad,"The environment was kind of crazy, always busy, busy, busy! Which is one thing that I enjoyed about working there, never a dull moment."
bad,"Busy environment.making the work day move quickly.physical work, management had extreme expectations. Well known company."
bad,"I only worked at Walmart for one month, but of that month, I got exactly one day of training. I was shown how to zone, or rotate, the stock, and that was all. Very few people actually did rotate correctly, and there was some favoritism."
bad,good schedule and hourly rate but no hours to match they cut hours anywhere they can. i make 19.85 an hour after 3 years on the job but i only get 25 hours a week.
bad,"Learned skills to take to my next journey in the workforce...Hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult co workers...Most enjoyable was helping customers with purchases,returns and other services...I enjoy customers."
bad,"clock, find where you what register you were suppose to be at. Log into the register and start your shift. It is an ok place to work. Hard to find managers. Just a member and as an employee you know that."
bad,"There is no structure or balance to the job. There is no acknowledgment for doing well, only discipline for doing bad. I learned that even at a huge company that makes billions of dollars there is still a ridiculous amount of drama within the management level. I enjoyed working with most of my immediate team for the Front End operations, but as far as trying to be a team with the entire management it was hopeless. I enjoyed working with the people I supervised, a majority of them became like family. I liked resolving problems, especially ones even higher management could not solve. Being a Customer Service Manager has become a catch all position and too much is expected for being so low on the management scale."
bad,"Treated Badly , Underpaid Overworked , Associates Steal , Lie Cheat , Wont Get In Trouble If Favored By Management ! Wil Never Go Back !"
bad,"This was my first job experience back in 2013 I was an Electronic Sales Associate. Which isn't even what I applied for, I wanted to be a front area Cashier, but if they need or want you in a area that isn't where you applied, they'll put you there instead."
bad,"Walmart in Middle island New York is  a horrible place to work. Not enough ladders, telzons and so on. There I no respect for others.  Complaints are swept under the table. No internal primotions. In locations like the Riverhead Walmart they hired a store manager from Target and other managers from outside instead if promoting from within the company.Stores aren't being ran based on Walmart standard. Lots of fraternizing. The team from Arkansas should pay these  stores a suprise visit"
bad,"Employees are under extreme pressure by middle and senior management at (.COM). While impressive on the outside, talent recruitment is very ""hire-and-fire"" with minimal job encouragement and more emphasis on quantity instead of quality results."
bad,this job was just a place to come collect a paycheck. No one cared about what they were doing at all. The management was almost never there. They were only there to yell if something went wrong and only cared if something happened to cost them money. The only time they were there was to yell at the employees for something that got screwed up otherwise they almost never came out of their office at the back of the store where they were just goofing off or playing on the computers.
bad,"As the story goes...Too many Chiefs and hardly any Indians. Too many foreigners that don't know American culture, foods or anything. Never want to give weekends off...unless your a manager. They make their own schedule. PAY SUCKS...unless your a manager."
bad,"A typical day at work usually involves either being the one person in your department, or having to zine a large area of the store, and then being expected to freight out 3-5 pallets in a short amount of time. I really enjoyed my coworkers, and there were a few members of management that were just amazing at their job. However, many managers either micro managed or had impossible expectations. I learned how to multitask better, however, so that was good. I also learned how to use a cash register, which I believe is useful. It was a learning experience, but I really hope I don't have to work there ever again."
bad,"Walmart taught me how to deal with difficult customers."
bad,"My day would start out  with no communication,no work ethics,no heads up for the next person.Management was always doing favoritism to certain employees."
bad,"Management not able to use discretion in making decisions, lack of knowledge on backroom and sales floor, not caring or helpful to associates.  They are not able to properly use associates as assets.  "
bad,Walmart is an okay place to work if you are a college student or in need of a second job. They don't pay enough. The customers are the best part of the job.
bad,"Very all over the board scheduling"
bad,I don't really want to say much other than the have continuously gone out of their way to stop me from achieving any goals. I have set for myself during this point in my life. Overall I am disgusted with the entire situation.
bad,"Since working there for about 4 months I have done the job I was hired to do for two or three days during the holiday season. Other than that I have not been moved to the promised position. I get berated for not having a job done, that to do it properly requires three times as much time as they are willing to give me. Then I get yelled at for the job not being done correctly."
bad,The store I worked for never did anything to encourage community giving by putting up food or school supply donation bins and refused to donate fresh food to schools or other agencies to help feed members of our community in great need. My co-workers were awesome. Great folks and worked very hard. Some in management were downright verbally abusive to their workers and store management did nothing to help the poor workers being bullied.
bad,"long hours."
bad,"Walmart used to be a good company to work for but has gone downhill fast. Expectations and management upheaval is constant and positions are changed or eliminated left & right. Frequently you will be supervised by someone who has little to no training or understanding of what it is you are doing. Most upper management are ghosts and simply operate in ""CYA"" mode 24/7."
bad,"Walmart is a terrible place to work ! .  Low  pay ,and when you apply , you undergo an orientation session ,where they promise you the world! . not true at all . And now it has gotten a lot worse since I have worked there .  For me you have hit rock bottom when you work at Walmart ."
bad,"Ranger les articles sur les étalages"
bad,Managers messed things up a lot and the employees had to pay for it and the company was constantly changing things but not training the employees to the new ways
bad,"This is a company that really believes they are doing best for the community, but when the recession hit, they showed their true colors - they upped productivity requirements, claiming that's what they always had been (when they changed it), they started firing people for no apparent reason, and they will outright lie to you, saying your wage is higher than people working for other companies in your position, but they're actually lower."
bad,Throughout the day I'd just clean my area and organize it if not assisting a customer with checking out. I've learned more costumer service wise and a bit more about the products
bad,Good place to get your basics of Networking and how to operate in a fast past administration. Worked on the Distribution Centers for Wal-Mart. I enjoyed the co-workers I worked with. Management was ok but there were too many road blocks to get anything done.
bad,"supposed to work as a team, not! Not enough people on schedule on busy days, meaning not enough associates to help out customers."
bad,A typical work day envolved detecting and detaining shoplifters. I learned how to solve problems while keeping everyone happy and staying inside of the rules. Management was unprofessional. The hardest part of the job was trying to excell without the support of your management team. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people and being able to change their perception on shoplifting.
bad,The management is mean and will not allow the right people to move up. when the right people can move up they are turned down for less qualified associates. The overnight Co. manager is belittling to associates as well. I wouldn't recommend working for this store.
bad,"Working for walmart is very unpleasant, good work goes highly unnoticed. Some associates do move up towards management after quite a while, unfortunately these people have had no prior management/supervisor experience and are not properly trained once promoted."
bad,"A typical day at Walmart includes but was not limited to a fast pace working environment and tasks that had to be done by the end of the day. I had wonderful co-workers but support managers and department managers never helped out and some even harassed me. I learned that even if you have a hard working team, the team is only as good as the manager allows them to be."
bad,"-Count cash, coins, checks, etc. "
bad,Not a professional environment to work at. The store is run more by high school politics than professional management.
bad,This is not a good olace to work at. This is a job for college students. I hated it. Everyday I worked my behind off ringing up customers.
bad,"As far as work life and the location of the Walmart I work at it is poorly managed. For the most part I kind of do my own thing unless they tell me otherwise. I will make sure the customers are satisfied and my department is well managed. I will make sure my service area is clean, and will clean my aisles located within my department. I also take of other departments within the store because the schedules are a mess and the mangers could care a less. I will say I have learned a lot by myself and by other co-workers. I learned how to use the bailer, unload trucks, do claims, order merchandise, manage work and time appropriate. The hardest part of my job is dealing with my managers sadly to say. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting the satisfaction of my customers needs puts a smile on my face."
bad,When I started at Walmart I enjoyed my job but as the years progressed I found that the associates were merely a means to an end.  The management staff are pleasant when one starts but as the years go on I found that the management staff would find those they liked and cater specifically to them and had a tendency to overload those they did not deem worth their time.  Ideas brought to the management staff were thrown into the trash or said management staff would take credit for them.  There were some good aspects to the job as in there are those that still care about proper customer service and who are willing to work with their fellow associates to strive for excellence but those numbers are dwindling quickly as the upper management implement ideas that are not very helpful to the associate or the customer at all.
bad,It was horrible working there a cashier and i will never do that again. Customers were rude and some would bring buggies full of price checks. That mess took hours to get one person out the way because they wanna save a penny.
bad,wrost place to work. due to bad management. I would not go back here to work. I do not have much more to tell about this company.
bad,The work was difficult but satisfying when it was done. My only grievances were that some of my work associates were unprofessional and the work culture was backwards some of my work associates would make rude and racist remarks about other employees the harassment was so bad that I had to quit. The other problem with the work culture was that the mismanagement was systematic throughout the entire store on top of that the high turn overrate led to labour shortages and management tried to do a lot with little labour only to put blame on employees and threaten them with termination.
bad,"I was promised the options to move up in the company with no results. They were telling me I was always next in line to move to management, however would offer the job to someone else."
bad,The best thing about Wal-mart was the co-workers. I loved my co-worker even though I currently don't work there the friendships that I gain. My biggest problem was the amount of respect that was given to me as an employee. I didn't feel like I matter or was value amongst the company
bad,"Just horrible. Too many managers. Completely micromanaged when you become a department manager. Turnover is high, people work for peanuts."
bad,Working in the apparel department keeps you busy and on your feet all day. Never a dull moment. Will build great customer service skills and patience working with so many people at once. Only downfall is the pay. You are expected to do a lot with very little pay.
bad,"Horrible, mean even angry management all the time and employees were trash because of treatment. Unrealistic expectations in the time given."
bad,I had a family member pass while i working at walmart i was told i could take up to 3 days off for the funeral and get paid so i did and wasnt paid like i was told before i left
bad,"Management only there for themselves, hours where all over the place, pay wasn't great, when asking for days off they never get approved even if it was months in advanced."
bad,"Productive environment with a great team of workers."
bad,"Typically, I enjoyed my position. I enjoyed the fact I could finish my job and get cross-trained in other areas. Management wasn't very helpful. I enjoyed my co-workers. There wasn't anything really difficult about the job itself. I enjoy working hard. I learned a lot during my term at Wal-Mart."
bad,"The manager I had purposely threw her work on me when i finished my tasks, it was like she was getting paid for doing nothing in our section of the store."
bad,"Walmart promises advancement in career but no one ever moves up."
bad,"I worked for Wal Mart for over 5 years. It seemed like a dead end job, every time I tried to move to another department or advance to a higher position they somehow found a way to not let it happen. Never was appreciated for my hard work. I would go in there and do a job meant for 6 people all by myself and try to get it finished before my shift ended. Management was a big reason why I decided to leave. They were not personable at all. Co-workers were alright. I mostly kept to myself and just did my work. Hardest part of the job was that I felt like I wasn't getting paid enough for everything I had to do in the day. I felt unappreciated and underpaid. There was no enjoyable part about this job."
bad,"Great bonus if you get them, however if your store doesnt do well you wont get em, management will.  The store works you very hard."
bad,"A empresa possui diversos procedimentos internos que se seguidos a risca por poucas pessoas, que é o que acontece normalmente, provoca uma reação negativa em todo o funcionamento. O reconhecimento do profissional é quase inexistente."
bad,"As a Cashier there was a lot of pressure to get credit card applications, stock candy, most of management passes job tasks off to other people."
bad,Working  and helping customers was awesome. Its makes you feel good to know you help someone that needs your help. The benefits was great not too expensive. Great sales most of the time. Great to know your others workers you work with.
bad,They overload you with more work than you can accomplish in one day. Management is afraid to get their own hands dirty. Very few actually pulled their own weight. Most of the ones that did are no longer working for this establishment. They don't care for their employees. When an incident happens they'd rather fire you than give you the benefits you deserve. Overall a terrible place to work. Money hungry management is all there is.
bad,"Failed to work around school schedule, hours were not flexible, no benefits, bad environment. I just didn't feel safe while working here; I also had to perform other job duties. I was a cashier(female), and one particular day I was told to go outside and push carts back into the store!"
bad,No respect for the employees and the compensation is a joke for the amount of work accepted. They will work you to the grave.
bad,"Depending on which WM you work at determines how good your experience is. The management is really hit or miss. I enjoyed my time there, all 10 years of it, but I wish there could have been more."
bad,Love my customers. Some managers are great but most are not good management team. Coworkers are okay. No support from management or corporation when it comes to rude or threatening customers.
bad,"I help costumers find what they are looking for, cut their eat and cheese for them, I clean, and answer phone calls. My co-workers some times slack off leaving me to try and do everything. The hardest part of my job is keeping everything up to date and filled. The easiest part is helping the costumers with what they need. Management is good about trying to help with your needs but sometimes you cannot find a manager to help you with what you need help with."
bad,"In this position you were required to complete tasks that were not part of your daily assignments and then reprimanded when your daily tasks were not completed."
bad,Do your job to the best of your ability and make sure the customers are satisfied by all means necessary. Go in with a positive mindset and come out the same way.
bad,"management should be better , and should accommodate employees schedules more and also let us go to lunch on time and breaks"
bad,"The job was good but the experience i had with the company was not what i expected. i never got benefits, or a discount card like they said I would. They worked me hard because of my race and felt a disagreement with me for an unknown reason. I took it for almost 4 months and quit because no matter how hard I worked they threatened me that I was going to be fired."
bad,Reasonable place to work until you figure out what you want to do in life. Helps develop interpersonal skills and time management.
bad,"The people you get to know and work with is awesome, you meet a lot of unique people. Then comes the management piece, horrible i never have not liked my managers but here its horrible they treat you like your little babies and just to make there lives easier they make you feel bad about yourself and how you do your work to get it done right. i will never ever work for Walmart again."
bad,You come into work and you're told your task for the day and then you pretty much have to figure out on your own what to do then they complain about the work nothing is ever done good enough but you do have some great co-works to get you through the day but the Managing Staff deal to much with their own personal feelings instead of listening to co-work's when they are trying to let them know what is going on they are just plain horrible
bad,"not very understanding when it comes to your family and home life,not enough hours or pay.they are very bad with giving breaks and luches on time also reliveing you of your duties so that you can go home when scheduled"
bad,Hard job and but very rewarding at the end of day.  Goal setting each morning and accomplishing the goals made the job a rewarding one.
bad,Working at Walmart was not at all hard. just very flustering. The management there was a joke. if the managers were not lazing around they were threatening to fire everyone. you could find a more productive group of managers in cages at your local zoo.
bad,"Its a fun place to work as in the interaction with customers most of the time. Coworkers were usually all great and willing to help each other out. But the hours were bad, scheduling was bad, management wasn't around when you needed them, and there usually wasn't enough associates on the floor to help all the customers in a timely manner and so its the associates who took a lot of verbal abuse from angry customers"
bad,"I currently work there and I'm trying to leave as soon as possible. The managers are rude, they don't like to work with you if you need time off for an emergency or anything. I'm in school as well and they BARELY like to work with you with that! They don't care about you as an individual. Yes, there are plenty of employees, but they love to overwork you."
bad,"While I enjoyed the exercise that the physical labor gave me as a stocker, I did not appreciate anything else that came with this job.  The usual work loads were doable, but due to the skeleton crew that the overnight shift typically ran on, time was of the essence just about every single day.  Thus, management was typically very stressed out and not very helpful if any problems arose during the shift.  Many of the tools needed for our job, such at pallet jacks, hand scanners, and hand printers, were broken.  Supplies, such as plastic wrap for overstock pallets and wires for making cardboard bales, were sparse and restocked inconsistently.  The turnover rate was very high throughout my time at the store, especially on the second shift.  As the second shift was responsible for bringing the freight out to the sales floor for my shift to work, they too were running on a constantly dwindling crew.  They frequently could not bring all the new freight out on time, which then burdened my shift as we had to spare time we did not have to help them.  Respect was practically nonexistent.  Even veterans who were with the store for decades were treated just as poorly as new associates.  The job benefits were barely noticeable, and frequent, month-long schedule blackouts made it very difficult to use any vacation/personal hours one accumulated at this job.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend working for Walmart at all unless you were absolutely desperate for a job of any kind."
bad,"Wal-Mart has no stability in management or employee the turn over rate is so high. The schedule and availability changes with out any notification from management. The way things are done is so unprofessional which causes good people to feel unneeded and appreciated. There is no concern for family or loyalty. Co worker are always upset and sad because of the treatment they get from management, you do your best and your best is over looked and simple things you didn't do are noticed fast like you stop to talk to customer or concern employee and they think you are goofing off. "
bad,"Walmart, as you can imagine, is a very filthy atmosphere with very rude customers and management that doesn't care about you or your needs as a person. There is absolutely nothing positive I can say about my experiences here. The pay is close to nothing, the co-workers are not people you'd want to spend too much time around, and the very atmosphere sucks the life out of you day after day."
bad,you are only a number to Wal-Mart and they could care less about you. the pay is bad and they know it. you work hard and they don't want you to work another job to supplement your income from there part time hours. they don't want to pay you any kind of benefits and they lie on national tv all the time about how happy there employee's are. It's a h#%^  hole to work at.Its a hard place to work because its all about putting it on the floor in any manor. I didn't learn anything and the people were back stabbers. Management had no one's back and would sell you down the river in a minute. Co-works were phony and the hardest part was dealing with them. the most enjoyable part was leaving.
bad,"Actually allows for advancement, but may take time. Great group of individuals, also much better now that they raised minimum pay rate."
bad,Was always walking around to customers all over the counter. I learned to be very observant. Management told you what you had to do for the day. Barely worked with co-workers. Hardest part was closing by myself for the night. The most enjoyable part was the customers that wanted to give me a hug for making their day brighter.
bad,"I worked with Walmart for 2 years, during this time I had a mental breakdown because of how much I worked. Of course, I had no medical care, because the benefits are so expensive I could not afford to sign up. I have never been happy to leave a job before, I think I actually skipped out of the place."
bad,"A typical day at work was very varied since you don't know what will happen to you at the workplace. I learned that we are self-depend and we need to learn everything at the own. Co-workers some are very nice and some can be backstabbing. The managements are very chaos...some knows what they are doing and understanding, some are just selfish, and some are useless. I have hard time with getting the management to the cashiers. I enjoy being with friendly people."
bad,You cant really have a outside life. hard to get days off even if you request early. management needs improvement . But you will meet a lot of cool co-workers and make friends
bad,"I wasn't very fond of this job, if Walmart management team treated their employees a little better it would be a great work place."
bad,"customer service and cashier, stock and clean. Didn't learn really a lot except opportunity to work in bakery. Management overall is okay and co workers were fine."
bad,"Walmart was a great company at one time. The company is so disconnected from it's associates and their stores. The best part of the job was the people I worked with. The hardest part was dealing with untrained managers, and unrealistic expectations."
bad,working here was a very trying experience they are not as friendly or helpful as other co workers everyone is out for oneself here even if you are a new associate
bad,If you can get full time the compensation is tolerable. I recommend putting as much of your paycheck as possible into the stock option.
bad,"The management team at walmart is a joke. Either some guy who has a power trip and is just a terrible person or some one who can't stand up for them selfs and gets pushed over , it was never stable at walmart. Moral was always very low people were miserable. Some people have ben there for 10+ years and are only making 10.00$ an hour barley making it buy in life. A raise every year of 0.40 cents isn't ever going to cut it. No union to help hear you out and no manager to ever ever listen to work place problem. My time working at walmart has made me hate the whole compony all together"
bad,"Every night, management would give the directives and disappear to the back. On the floor the employees struggled with the workload."
bad,"The job was not glamorous. The pay was okay. I was not treated poorly. Although, I was let go because they claimed they could not afford to pay me."
bad,"I have learned that Wal-Mart cares nothing about you or the family you're trying to support. if I have to call out because my child need to go to the emergency room, if you're not there that counts as an absence. even with a doctors note. If you're not dead, they don't care. They give you four and five hour shifts."
bad,"Everyday you have to expect the unexpected. Nothing was ever organized, so I couldn't get to what I needed to do until I cleaned up after associates from another shift. I learned that all Wal-Marts have something that effects their business production and efficiency. Management was not reliable. I was always sent from one manager to another. Only problem with co-workers were the lack of responsibility. Hardest part of the job dealing with managers. Being told one thing and then having to undo something I just finished. Wal-Mart was able to work around my schedule."
bad,"- it'll make you hate people"
bad,"This all depends on your ""position"" in the company... But The management sucks, they talk to you like you aren't a person, break times are given when they think it's ok. The health benefits SUCK! They under pay us and over work us. They don't have enough help for the customers"
bad,"The company treat people, who willing to give a helping hand, like livestock. I leaned that this is a dead end job. The management need more leadership development classes mainly personnel management. The problem with co workers you don't get time to get to know any co-workers because they are not there long enough..  The hard part about the job is clocking in. The most enjoyable about the job is writing my two week noticed. They go on this marketing or propaganda campaign claiming that they care about their people but in all reality; they care only about their quarterly reports to their shareholder. How do they meet the goals of the shareholder; by sticking it to the stakeholders; there helping hand."
bad,"i like helping older people becouse they appreciates what do for them,like helping them shop.i like working with my department manager also like working to some csm."
bad,"there is no fun with this company. this is the first job that I had, that I did not desire going to work. I quite this job because the pay was way too low for what I was used to. also the managers were not friendly or professional. once I was overdue for my lunch break, I had been working for 6 hours and the system locked me out. instead of my manager sending to lunch, she logged me in under her number, and mad me keep working while she clocked out and went to lunch. what kind of moral is that? once I had to close at 12 midnight, but was scheduled to come back in at 6am, I didn't even get 5 hours of sleep."
bad,"Days consisted of working with other employees that didn't want to be there, that complained about their personal lives, and that didn't want to work as a team. Management was very hard to work with."
bad,it was the absolute worst place to work this location. they are rude the managers talk to you any kind of way and the coworkers treat each others bad. it was awful working there.
bad,"before walmart had a complete revamp of the way it ran the business, you could hardly ever find anyone on the floor. now its about a thousand times harder to find anyone in the store to ask for help. the managers are cranky and mean. the coworkers are gossipy and nosy. the place is a disaster and no one cares enough about anyone because turnover is so high. the best part about the job is that you receive your schedule 3 weeks in advance so you can plan your life around your job."
bad,"I typically changed people's oil the majority of the time, and learned that customer service is important. My co-workers and managers were enjoyable, they were pretty easy to get along with. The down side is you could work a different shift each and everyday. One day you could close at 9pm and the next morning turn right back around and opened at 7am. That 's the hardest part of the job, but the most enjoyable part of my job was all the hands on work."
bad,Very low wages for what you have to put up with. Lack of management with any skill. Lets Customers talk to you any way they want. Hires anyone. Large turn over constant rule changes.
bad,they work you to the  bone .managers sometimes make the wrong choices. to me this is just a job that gives you money to  survive a little bit unless you work crazy long hours .to me this isn't a career just a job .if you are looking for money a lot of money this isn't a six figure job.
bad,"Typical day required me to stock product that was usually 7 - 15 hrs worth of work during the 7 and a half hours shifts and they expected it to be done, which I was able to do most of the time, or they were not happy and usually wrote you up for it. Some days i was put into different departments that i was not hired for which required a lot of heavy lifting and i rarely got help. Also I was trusted with the electronic keys on several occasions or I had to work in the backroom to help put overstock away."
bad,"by far the worst job i have ever had. i missed three days of work due to having a surgery and was written up upon my arrival back to work. even though i had notes frm the doctor, hspital , and urologist."
bad,"Overall work environment is decent the culture that the owner initially  started his company was to benefit consumers , but as corporate culture over powered his vision it went down hill ."
bad,"It is ok to work when you are desperate looking for a job."
bad,They work people to hard for the wages they give them. standing all day sometimes with no breaks. the only time they have enough checkers is during black Friday and Christmas. Management doses the best they can with what they have.
bad,"Working for Walmart isn't for everyone. My experience wasn't the greatest. Being paid minimum wage and work is more than unappreciated is unacceptable, especially when being 1 of 4 people who work in the receiving area and the tasks demands more employees.. I harbor no hard feelings towards the company. I would prefer to be a costumer rather than an employee."
bad,I don't think this job is very fair there is also alot of harassment an management is awful. I would basically just do my job then leave
bad,"No help, they want you to do everything, and some people don't have to do anything. You have to be friendly with Management! At this store any way."
bad,"My typical day at work is extremely busy and sometimes very hectic.  But with that, time flies by quickly.  Management varies from  shift to shift."
bad,"I enjoy Wal-Mart because of all the different walks of life that I cross daily.  I Really enjoy all the departments they have and that you could cross train to.  However the policies suck and the management is worse than that, to put It nice.  No one gets paid half of what their worth either there making way too much for the lil work they do or they or severely underpaid.  The part time hiring status really needs to change or increase the pay"
bad,unfair. no justice. they only focus on one culture. not understanding at all. worst management team. don't care abut their employee they treat their employee like slaves.
bad,"A typical day working at Walmart was not as great as I expected. Everyone was always in a bad mood, customers included. I did not learn much from that position. Management was never around, or if they were they were not happy being there. My co-workers were very to themselves and never socialized with fellow workers, even in the break room. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the cranky people throughout every shift, mainly the employees instead of the customers."
bad,Lots of hard work with little benefits. Mangement does not care. Just a horrible company to work for. Customers are rude and company treats you like slaves.
bad,"Wal-Mart is a terrible place to work at if you are striving for a career in my opinion. Advancing in the company can happen, but only on a very small scale to the average employee. Possibly moving up from cashier to cashier manager with a small pay increase if any pay increase at all. The customers are just like customers anywhere when working with the public. Some people can be rude and others are nice. Overall, I learned that there are enjoyable parts of the job but making a living is very hard with this job."
bad,"You will be hired on for minimum wage and work part time four hour shifts so they don't have to pay benefits. If you're a student angling for spending money, that's fine, but if you have bills to pay you're wasting your time. Most of the employees qualify for welfare."
bad,"As an overnight stocker I had a very important job of getting merchandise to the floor in a timely manner. Except my managers loved to me across several different departments a night. Rarely was I able to get done with done department. Instead of leaving me in an area that I knew best and knew how to work, I constantly thrown into different and received no training. I only got trained my first day. The lady who trained quit two months after I signed on. Along with four other people. Management did understand our jobs, had high expectations that were not realistic and did not know how to talk to us. They were very cold and impersonal and expected us to just know how to work different areas. I did not this job, I only took it for the money and even that was not enough to keep me there."
bad,This place was great at first then new management took over. Being here was great wiush that i could be manager. I have learned that the grass isn't always greener on the over side
bad,"A typical day at Wal-Mart was coming in and hunting down the supervisors and getting them to tell me what I needed to do. Then I would get started on my tasks of the day, and go on my way. The coworkers I had were nosey, and wanted to know every single detail going on in your life. Management for the most part was lazy and only came to check on what the regular associates were doing like once or twice a day. The hardest part of that job was dealing with my fellow coworkers. The easiest part was dealing with the customers themselves. I learned a lot from working there. For example, I learned one must have patience when dealing with people, and everything will not go your way. The most enjoyable part of my job was probably meeting all the different types of people."
bad,Working here wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the management that shows little to no care about their associates. They work us like slaves and very little pay!
bad,"Honesty Wal-Mart ranked among 1 of the worst jobs i ever had it was not the job itself only the money,managers, the hours, did i mention the money."
bad,"Walmart is hard to describe. The facility i was employed at seemed to not have their priorities in order. The hiring process was flawed, i was hired for one job and was preforming duties completely unrelated to the original job description. Promotions and job advancement practically do not exist at that facility. When inquiring about another job in the same facility it is likely you'll be told the position is open and then suddenly you'll see some new faces around the facility. Customers usually managed the facility, Managers left early leaving front end associates outnumbered with a plethora of customers and problems. Scheduling was flawed and unpredictable. Employees were usually scheduled days back to back leaving them with only one day off before the next pay period began. Overall score is a 2 out of 5. Walmart is strictly a last resort in employment."
bad,Wal-Mart does pay you very well when your in the management program but you have to work for every dollar you earn. If you are a salary memeber of managementmyou wont be able to receive holiday pay.
bad,"Clean bathrooms top to bottom thats it, used to be clean bathrooms, change trash, clean up spills, clean break room, the management is not the best but i cant change that the best part of the job is working with some of my coworkers"
bad,"I was not happy on pins and needles"
bad,"Seasonal, Not for me.. I have people and office skills and though they were a great team to work with I couldn't continue.."
bad,"Busy and you have no time for your family. But you can make ok money."
bad,too many inside issues.  some mgmt are great and others not so much. no job security and seems like theres lack of caring for employees.
bad,"Cleaned and Organized the back room with electric pallet jack & walkie stacker, did Modular's, set self caps, did counts."
bad,Does not care about it's employees.Overworked and under paid
bad,a typical work day is showing and presenting great customer service and always being an excellent associate with always helping out anyway that i can
bad,They do not appreciate there associates. Management is awful. One cashier on the register everyday. They have cashiers stocking shelves and doing inventory.
bad,"I enjoyed working with the customers, also working in different departments and my co workers were very helpful if I ever needed help with anything. I learned that no matter what the customers come first and you do everything you can to make sure they are satisfied."
bad,"Stand and/or lift and/or climb for entire shifts while being paid as little as possible. Management was great when I started, but apparently that was just because he liked me. When new management came in, I and others in my area were treated horribly. If you have a family, they don't care. Best part of the job was break time."
bad,"Walmart is an interesting work environment. Through the hiring and training phases, it seems like a great place to work (for minimum wage that is). It is only after one starts to look to further themself in the company that the problems start."
bad,"Like any jobs, some days are good days and other days are bad days however most days working here are bad. Management does not worry about you as a person only how you benefeit the company.Lots of the fellow employees are wonderful to work around but other that them there is nothing good about working here."
bad,i didn't like walmart they were unorganized and rude it was horrible my co workers were acted like kids and kept up drama. the only part i liked about work was getting off and clocking out to come home
bad,"A empresa era conhecida pela sua rotatividade de funcionários. Não havia reconhecimento. Assédio moral. Fui demitida sem maiores explicações. Funcionários eram favorecidos de acordo com a afinidade pessoal de alguns gerentes. Desigualdade na forma de tratamento para com os empregados. Muitos gerentes, desorganização, o trabalhador não sabia a quem se reportar, um gerente te indicava para um trabalho, o outro gerente te tirava para fazer outro, os trabalhos ficavam incompletos e o funcionário q era questionado pela culpa da falta de entendimento entre os gerentes. A cultura teórica da empresa não tem nada haver com a prática."
bad,"A typical day at Wal-Mart was going aisle to aisle and fronting all the items to the front to make it look full. If an item was out of stock we would go to the back and restock that item on the shelf.  The management wasn't very good.  There was a couple of managers who would go around and make fun of the new associates if they did something wrong, they would never help.  The co-workers were the best people to work with, very nice, and very helpful if you needed. The hardest part of my job, while I was working there, was going to the back and trying to find any items that needed to be restocked on the shelves. The most enjoyable part of the job was being sociable with the customers."
bad,"A typical day at Walmart for me was either going to the Electronics or Photo area of the store. I would promote customer service while performing other duties expected of me from management. These included working out freight and high ticket merchandise, cleaning/zoning the department, keeping our prices up to date, keeping the shelves stocked."
bad,manger treat you bad. no respect they will change your hour on you.
bad,"you get treated like a number and not a person, as long as you are standing behind that cash register they don't care about anything else the turn over is huge, very physical and you have to deal with unhappy customers, coworkers some excellent some horrible. best part of job happy customers that treat you with respect and are grateful management will walk right by you and not even acknowledge you are alive"
bad,"Enjoyed co-workers, most managers, job was easy.  Easy to get employment.  Computers are the managers."
bad,the overnight associates were fun to work with but the assistant managers were doubled standards.
bad,Too little pay for too much work. You get treated like dirt beneath customers/managements shoes all day everyday and are still expected to keep that jolly attitude. Reminds me of high school with all the drama and gossip among management and employees. Very corrupt corp.
bad,Punch in work short staft and be complained to because everything is not done
bad,"A typical day as a sales associate at walmart is basically running all over your section fixing things that get moved around. "
bad,The management wasn't willing to work with your schedule.  There was never enough help on registers.  Customers would complain all the time.
bad,"Every day I came in and worked hard to impress my managers, and every day I was treated like dirt. The managers are not flexible with your hours, even if you have a fair reason. The amount of work you do is not worth it for the amount of pay you receive. I lived far away, so I asked not to be scheduled for four hour shifts multiple times. I was promised it would change, but it never did. When I got a new job I offered to stay for my two weeks as long as my hours were changed, I was told they would be but it never happened. Some days I would show up and they told me I wasn't allowed to work because they changed my schedule without telling me. They also only enforce the safety rules that help themselves, and do not enforce the ones that keep you safe."
bad,"I come in and ice cakes, i didn't learn much, and the management was terrible. my co workers were somewhat poor characters and the hardest part was dealing with management. the most enjoyable part of my job was getting to see customers faces when they were happy."
bad,"They are only in it for the money and nothing else. No compassion for employees, even the good ones."
bad,Take care of customers ringing them out with cash credit cards/debit. Also doing returns and answer phones and doing payroll.
bad,"I enjoyed working in the Electronics department- but the management was awful- they treated their workers like dirt, and were very mean. If a customer complained about you- even if they were lying- the managers would NOT listen to your side of the story. You would be blamed, no matter what, and get in trouble for things you didn't even do. The coworkers were pretty good, but they came and went very quickly because of how low pay was, the horrible minimal hours, and the terrible treatment. The hardest part of the job was going to work knowing my feelings didn't matter- of course you have to try your best at work, and be professional, but the managers shouldn't have the right to scream at you in front of customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with electronics and my coworkers in that department."
bad,Walmart has a poor system for pay and compensation for your time at work. Management is set up so there is little to none advancement opportunities unless you have friends in high places. They expect way too much of the associates and pay too little.
bad,They were having me lift boxes off of a shelf I had to use a ladder to get them.
bad,"Cashier"
bad,understaffed and overworked for the pay coworkers are cool makes the job go faster. Pick merchandise and stock all night
bad,"When first arriving to work I would check the store case to see what needed to be put out for the day for the customers to purchase. After the case was filled with everything in its mid, I then had to check to see if their was any special cake orders to be filled. Once all of the cakes were done I was responsible for making sure that the bakery was cleaned thoroughly. I learned allot from working in the bakery, I came into the job with no prior decorating knowledge. Even though I didn't have any proper training, my co workers were more than willing to help me learn. With constant practice and watching my co workers I quickly picked up on decorating. Management was horrible. The bakery's department manager quit in my second month of being there, so for a while it was just coworkers in the bakery. My coworkers were really nice, if it wasn't for them I wouldn't know anything about cake decorating. I really appreciate everything they did. The hardest part about working in Walmart's bakery is the lack of professionalism. There is never a reason that i BAKERY should run out of cupcakes!!! We would run out of icing, cakes anything you name it! The most enjoyable part about working in the bakery was definitely the actual cake decorating. I love seeing peoples reaction especially when it was a little kid."
bad,"A typical day for me at Walmart starts with an hour of zoning a certain area of the store. After that I'm typically approached by my department manager so she can tell me what to do for the day. Not long after that my assistant manager comes along and gives me a different set of instructions. Some times either one of the co-managers or the store manager will come along and give me something else to do. "
bad,"Counting money from 40+ registers, create deposits, search for register overages or shortages. assist customers with lost receipts."
bad,"Co-workers were great, very fun and friendly.  Management could use improvement.  Hard to stand in one spot all day.  Most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the customers."
bad,"Working for this company gave me a chance to enhance my skills in a cash office payroll related environment.  The job involved updating and performing transactions payments for previous and new potential customers.  Other duties included inputting data, typing letters, handling cash and attending with customers over the phone. Also assisting customers with needs pertaining to purchases and returns; another duty is recording information from products in the claims department insurance also.  The majority amount of the work was spent on the computer, face to face and over the phone providing them with quality customer Service."
bad,"I don't know if it was because I was at a ghetto Walmart but it was horrible. Management had horrible attitudes. Example: I had a manager, when I worked in the front as a cashier, that would repeatedly get reported how she kept her job is beyond me. I transferred into the pharmacy and become a pharmacy cashier and it was the worst mistake EVER. The Walmart I worked for had pharmacy techs that would be on the store phone for 10-15 mins at a time while not doing work. No one wanted to help in the front and the customers was extremely rude and inconsiderate. They would see you working with someone else while trying to get you to find their medicine like you're some type of superhuman. My pharmacy managers were very nice and helpful. I would do cashiering duties and bag the medicine in the pharmacy. I was a cashier in the front at first but switched over to a pharmacy cashier. DO NOT do it! Your pay will be the same but you will have to deal with and do way more. It is very stressful, especially when you have lazy co-workers that would rather hide than help! Very poor experience and would not recommend."
bad,Not very family oriented place to work. Very stressful work environment.
bad,A typical day would consist of constant standing and customer interaction. I am naturally a people person so I don't have a problem in the customer service area. It was the job instability that made it hard to stay with the company.
bad,"Walmart is a wonderful company to work for if you don't have an opinion or any intentions for attempting to expand the company. Those in management have forgotten that their decisions impact the way associates must perform their jobs daily and then were upset by the job impact caused directly by their actions. Front end registers must always be kept ""up to plan"" but those in charge of scheduling people for the front end never scheduled enough associates to cover that plan even without any call outs. Their policy and image detail a live and learn ideology but employees are fired for simple mistakes while their supervisors are kept despite making the same exact mistakes."
bad,"A typical day at work was spontaneous, you never knew what to expect.  I learned a little on the human resources side of the job.  I loved my co workers and learned new things from them.  The hardest part of the job was never knowing what to expect and the most enjoyable part was dealing with the customers."
bad,I typical day included avoiding management to preform tasks. Communication was lacking and associates were often left in the dust.
bad,ok place to work u learn a lot about food and handeling it management was ok they teach u ok cowoworkers were ok hardeswt part of the day disgruntled customers most enjoyable part of the day closing
bad,"•I cannot Judge or Generalize"
bad,Management was difficult to work with at times. They wouldn't show how to do or work things. Other employees were the ones to show how to work it.
bad,"I clocked in and immediately began stocking shelves, building sales displays, and helping customers locate merchandise. The hardest part of my job was when most of the work was finished and there wasn't many customers to help because I really enjoy staying busy and helping customers. I learned many things such as better people and sales skills. My co-workers and I worked together well as a team and management rarely had to step in."
bad,"Work Work Work, i learned how to be a better judge of character ,management was a joke,co workers disoriented, dealing with corporate,Going home & my paycheck i will never work for Walmart again!"
bad,This company does not care about the ones that have families.  You only get Christmas off and your work schedule is very stressful. When it comes to managers they only care about their own jobs and nothing else matters.
bad,"The job was honestly boring and made me feel like I did not do anything all day. I would pick between 7-8 orders a day of herbal drops to be shipped out, the rest of the time I would clean and clean some more even if it was already cleaned an hour or so ago. My co-workers were young chatty n texting all the time. Management as I said I do not speak about. The hardest part was learning where all the differnt roducts were located."
bad,"Arrange breaks according to schedule, fill in gaps if needed to keep breaks on schedule, I spent a lot of time covering the self check out because that is one area I can leave to help cashiers with over rides at their registers and other challenges. I learned how to calmly handle no win situations, I had been praised by my co-workers for having a thick skin and letting the negative things slide down my back. Management varies, with their schedules rotating sometimes the one over your department has no experience in it. My co-workers miss me because of my ability to see the bright side of chaos and because I took a sincere interest in their success.The hardest part was the lack of support from all levels of management on customer/ employee service. I can sincerely say I was the only supervisor who's motto was ""Yes First"" and not ""Cover Your Rear"". there for I was the only supervisor that helped to train future supervisors that may have been over looked. This is what I enjoy most in life, One new associate had helped me a lot with closing registers as we talked it turned out he had a lot of experience and even though by walmart standards employees are to be in their department for six months before transferring or promoting, I implored him to apply for a department Supervisor position and he got it. Another associate was feeling unappreciated and was going to leave for a lesser job I urged him to learn all he could about certain areas and he is now a Department Supervisor. I really enjoyed the re pore I had with repeat customers,too."
bad,Most my co-workers I still talk to to this day others if I told you about what happens when some of these people do when their supposed to be fixing your food. Lets just say you wouldn't like it. Management didn't seem to care about anything.
bad,"A typical day at work is binning and picking items from the outside trailers, it keeps me busy and active."
bad,"The work itself is easy.  But I like to call the management ""Predatory"", because if you are a good worker, the managers will jump on you and work you to death and hold you accountable for everything, all the while saying this will move you up and your creating opportunities for yourself, while they take all the credit and you get no where.  I can't tell you how many times I overheard a manager take credit for hard work that I had done, saying things like ""Yeah, I took care of that"".   If your a worker who just does enough to get by and stays under the radar and makes it difficult for the manager to get you to do anything, you'll be good, because it takes to much effort on there part, so, the best thing to do is just make there job as tough as possible and they'll leave you alone for the most part."
bad,walmarts had bad management! Bad hours! Greeters could not use the bathroom during working hours if there wasn't someone to take your place..greeters were sweared at by customers.One greeter messed in her pants & worked 8hrs because they said she could not go to the restroom.
bad,"While working there, I improved my social skills, but trying to work there, go to school full time and have time for anything in between was difficult. I ultimately left because of this conflict plus a nasty allergic reaction I got while working around certain products I had to stock"
bad,While Wall-mart is the biggest retailer in the world they treat the sales reps really small. The mangers where not functioning to the best of care and would wait to the last minuet on a lot of projects forcing the employes to rush and do a less than great job.
bad,The cashier schedule is created by a computer and is never accurate to customer needs and busy times
bad,"there is a diverse group of people that work here. you get to meet new people everyday (which if you are a people person) its entertaining, but the management is very unorganized and will tell you different things per manager, the scheduling is terrible never enough people on evenings and to many on days."
bad,"Im over weight and to stand for 8 hours a day is very painful. If stools were provided to the employees who are required to be in one place all day, the work day would be much more tolerable."
bad,They do offer a lot of learning experience but it can interfere with your personal life. Hard to make a living because of the pay.
bad,"Fast paced, multiple assignments daily. Management lacks a bit but there are good workers there. Hardest part I would say is not being recognized for a lot of work and not having the opportunity to move up in the company and if so it requires many years."
bad,There's not a whole lot to commend about Walmart. The store I worked at is constantly understaffed and over managed.
bad,The hardest part of this job is coming in to work and finding out that your department is short handed and the mangers acting like they are not even concern.
bad,Well if you try to work at your fullest and exceed standards you get well known around the store but as soon as corporate thinks theres to many workers they don't care who you are you get terminated as a whole. They will hire up to 25-30 people at a time then they will terminate 25-30 people at a time after they work 90 days so they don't have to give any benefits.
bad,A great place to work if you like needing food stamps to survive.  The place has friendly people to work with and some of the customers are nice.  The job is easy but you don't get enough hours to make ends meet and the pay is low.  The management is very stupid but they are not a problem for long because the replace them every few months.
bad,fast-paced work environment. Company deadlines must be met.
bad,"Only reason I worked there because it was the only job going.  Managers are horrible, customers are horrible, and employees are horrible.  I don't shop at Walmart because of working at this job."
bad,I clock in go to work and lock out. I learned its not about how hard you work its about who butt you kiss. Management is a joke they dont work and never wanna help. Co-workers are co-workers. There isnt any hard parts. The enjoyable part is clocking out.
bad,"treated like a slave, work on holidays, managers talk down to you and let you know your replaceable."
bad,"The work for walmart was decent, however you don't get that many hours (19 hours average) unless you are overnight or a cashier. I worked in electronics and it was fun because the people you work with become really close knit."
bad,"Taking care of customers, how to handle slicers and registers, management was hard to find to talk about an issue, co-workers never came in for their shifts"
bad,"No matter how much work was done it was never enough. Half of the managers there had no clue how to do thier jobs ie would over/under order products, and half the stock would go bad, and the higher managers would only look and blame the people stocking. I did make a few good friends, although some did not speak english. The most enjoyable part of my day was when it was time to go home."
bad,"A typical day at work was great no problems very productive as long as you stayed o yourself."
bad,Have no comments about working for this company. The wages arent good and management is even worse.
bad,"Unorganized managenent. ""Too many chiefs, not enough indians."" Expect to use policy and procedure to tell you what to do but only follow it when it suits them."
bad,"My typical day at work will be that I will come in start off the day with what ever assignments that the floor manager had me assign too or I will just find something to do or work on if the manager is not present. "
bad,"The actual job content is very simple and fun, however rules by management is often made up, and changed on a daily basis and is not anywhere on any job descriptions or anything posted around the store."
bad,"The management were not very good at communication, the people I worked with were very nice, but things did not run as smoothly as the could have"
bad,"My typical day at this job was unloading and stocking general merchandise or groceries to the designated area. I learned how to organize, assist customers needs and do things in fast pace. The managers at this job I have to say were very unorganized and never really listened to the opinions of the employees. My co-workers were amazing people. I got to meet a lot of new people some who taught me a lot and some who I've taught what I knew. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the managers. Like I said before, they were very unorganized they didn't communicate with one another. They talked about having a great looking store, but never helped do anything about it. The most enjoyable part of this job was all the different people I've met.I  didn't really have anyone I could actually call friends until I started this job."
bad,"I worked the frozen section on the night shift.  This involved working with frozen freight most of the time by myself.  Many times other people came to ""help"" I was still forced to complete the majority of the work.  Nights where I could count on someone who knew the area were few.  I'd like to say something about the managers but they rarely ever showed up because it was ""cold""."
bad,"It was ok. I worked nights, part time. The other workers were friendly, management was not awful, but could be a lot better. Pay could have been better as well. Just a job."
bad,"only position that create enough pay above the poverty level in assistant manager, co manager, store manager"
bad,"i worked for them for a while, and i hated it. the management sucks, job quality sucks, they treat thier employees like slaves and when you state a problem you are automatically wrong, they don't even listen to the problem to try and fix it."
bad,"The managers weren't very personable. They didn't do a lot to make you feel like family or to make you feel like you could trust them. I didn't feel like I got the right amount of training I needed to really succeed fully in that position. I was great at the customer service aspect but didn't do very well with the technical. I should have tried harder to communicate with the managers about my anxiety due to my lack of substantial training. It was my first job and because I didn't feel the connection with my managers, I don't think I excelled to my fullest potential. It was quite a learning experience. I feel now that I really have gained the knowledge and the discipline to really succeeded in another work environment."
bad,no advancement & lack of pay micro management come in do your work go home and do it all over
bad,"Working here taught me that if you want to run and keep your business successful not only do you need the right people, but you need to keep them as well."
bad,Nothing enjoyable unless you have friends there. Don't like to transfer if you're good at what you were hired for e.g. cashier to electronics.
bad,"Prepared and dispensed prescriptions under the supervision of the pharmacist. Received incoming calls from doctors and patients greeting them in a professional manner whether on the phone or in person. Manually typed and proof read transcribed prescription name and directions given by the physician. Ability to handle moderately complex assignments under supervision of pharmacist. Data entry, handling of large amounts of cash, credit cards and following HIPPA Compliance. Maintained high level of confidentiality."
bad,"management has room for improvement, very challenging place to work"
bad,"Horrible job. Only perk of being there is you get to know your co-workers very well, you get to be a part of a family. "
bad,This job expects you to perform multiple jobs for the same pay rate... With no reward. It's a good place to work when your in transition but I do not see any long term rewards working for this company...
bad,Assembler wasnt that bad at first then black friday and christmas came around and the work started to build up. Would have been cool if i had a lil help.
bad,"working with others, greeting customers, cleaning up, unloading trucks"
bad,Yes walmart is an ok company to work in management but when you work as a normal walmart cashier they treat you like nothing.
bad,This company unfortunately is not a good position for someone who is looking for a career in the long run. The pay is very low for what the employees do. They do not work with personal schedules even if it's with college. They usually schedule employees shorter hours so that they are not eligible for benefits. The employees are very pleasant to work with.
bad,"Unrealistic expectations, started this job with a set of goals that were to be met everyday and were successfully met but as management rotated the workload would increase and expectations would change without any discussion. The bottom line is do the jobs of three or more people and expect to get paid as one, that is Walmart."
bad,Very bad environment. No appreciation for all your hard work.
bad,"I have never worked for such a greedy company before. They just want more, more, more."
bad,They did not care about there employees at all. Death in the family can't get time off if it were not close to you. It was all about what you can do for them not what they can do for you...
bad,I was not properly trained. At the time I was employed we had no manager and no one working in my department. I still have not been trained properly over four months later. Most managers are rude and take advantage of associates who are honest and do as they are told. The employees use my area of the store to hide their belongings and avoid binning merch in the back. Everyone quits with no warning. It's not Walmart as a whole but just my position and coming in at a very rough time for my store. I get blamed for every problem that goes wrong in my area but the area was messed up long before I arrived and I did not have training to know if anything was wrong or not. I do not get paid enough to do what I do everyday. Mind you that not all departments are this way. Most run smoothly since we got a new store manager.
bad,"Unloading trucks of merchandise that was filled up in the truck that was not on pallets, and stocking shelves.My co-workers were great to work with.I had good days and great days at work."
bad,Your always feeling pressed. The management always gave people more stuff than they can handle. I feel like walmart do not treat their workers right. The pay rate should be much higher & better benifits should be provided
bad,"Walmart was definitely the place where I developed the thickest skin. My co-workers were like family and the customers came in all personalities. The pay was horrifyingly low for how much work I did, the hours were never the same; I'd be on a closing shift one day, and an opening shift the next. The management team never communicated with each other about anything and my pay went up by 30 cents after being there for a year. Did I mention that everything that went wrong in a customer's day always seemed to be our fault? Walmart shoppers are rude, ruthless, and don't have a single nice thing to say to a cashier."
bad,"Low low pay. Bad scheduling, lack of good management. Large turnover which meant not enough personnel on shift, or to many which made for very long, boring shifts"
bad,management was always changing they picked favorites and where always trying to find ways to get rid of long term associates
bad,"Average work day would consist of 2-12 hours. I gained a great deal of skills; such as inventory, loss prevention, and patience. There were "
bad,"I can never know how many hours per week I will work, it varies from 7- 25. This is not enough to even call myself employed and it makes it hard to have a good self-esteem when I do not feel gainfully employed. The managers do not know anyones names who work under them nor could they  care less."
bad,"Working at Walmart requires a certain type of person. In my experience of working at walmart, I have encountered countless thieves and disgruntled customers who will insult you directly to your face over something as simple as a pricing issue. In the case that the associate decides to defend themselves, they are terminated rather than management defending their employees or their company. The management is also very disrespectful to their employees as well. There was not anything very enjoyable for me working there."
bad,Management had no clue what they were doing and refused to listen to associates who knew their areas.
bad,Working at Walmart was not my best career path. Difficult work schedule and management lacks people skills
bad,"Working at Walmart was always so stressful for me but for other people it may be a great work place. I learned how to take inventory, stock shelves and organize products. As far as my co-workers, they weren't very friendly and nice. Same goes for management. The hardest part of the job for me was that I was the only one in the back room unloading trucks and getting the frieghts out that needed to go out onto the floor. The most enjoyable part of the job was that at the end of the day I got to go home and be with my family."
bad,I like learn new things so when customers come in and give me interesting  information about new things.
bad,expect way too much from employees. not enough pay for the work required.
bad,Supervisors were not easy people to approach and always seemed to have an attitude. Hard to deal with the fact that the public was always trying to get products at reduced or no cost.
bad,This job would have been cool if it was not for the messy coworker whom seem to want you to move as if u were super woman. the management would place you by yourself and expect you to complete a 4 persons job in 7 hours. They dropped my pay rate from 8.65 to 8.00 and on top of that i was trained for a position they didnt even have...beware the walmart on Marsha Sharp FWY in Lubbock Texas
bad,I did not like working at Walmart due to the fact that the hours are terrible and upper management does not seem to care for their employees. It was a very stressful job.
bad,"Working at walmart was hard simply because they expect an extreme amour of work out of everyone but the pay does not reflect the work that we do, you get penalized for working overtime even if scheduled for it. Unhappy coworkers always complaining. the hardest part of the job was getting up and going every day."
bad,Not very employee friendly.  Long hours and no employee feedback or evaluations.
bad,Worked as a cart pusher and made minimum wage. Hard work low pay. Good people. No room for advancement
bad,"punch in, work, punch out."
bad,me dejo mucho que desear pues yo daba todo mi tiempo por mi trabajo y hay empresas como esta que no valoran que sus empleados tengan dedicacion al trabajo. son despotas y sobretodo te tratan mal
bad,its a well known company since it is the largest retailer in the world it is also a challenging but fun place to be.
bad,"Long and tedious."
bad,I learned very quickly all the functions of running the cash register at Walmart. My co-workers were very friendly and helpful when needed.
bad,"this was a busy and challenging job. Walmart is working on weeding out the long term employees that may be salary capped and replacing them with part time temp help. it got to the point the hardest part of my job was showing up every day."
bad,"Arrived at 3pm, unloaded and downstacked products on pallets and took them to their correct departments."
bad,After working as an overnight stocker for 6 months I took and passed the manegment test and was given the position of recieving supervisor and excelled. With this being said when yearlt bonuses were attained I with so many others recieved a $4.94 bonus and uppermanagement recieved 20% increase to me thats not acceptable.
bad,"I really did not look forward to work at Walmart. It just was not my scene of type of work. I could have dealt with that though since it was money that I needed, but my hours were never guaranteed, they would constantly change and i was moved down to part time work and only 20-25 hour of work a week. The management there was not very good I had problems with CSM's everyday and the slogan that Sam Walton made for Walmart was not being kept at that particular location. I felt like bad morals were being incorporated into that work life and I was looking for something more positive and not so hipacritical. I did enjoy my co-workers however they were all kind and nice to me and our customers and tried to get things done as best as they possibly could. The most enjoyable part of my day was seeing how kind all the customers were to each other and even to us."
bad,"I was there for ten years, it took them over 5 to promote me to dept. Mgr. Then blackballed me where I had to step down back to cashier. Even though my entire time there I constantly had to train others whom eventually stepped higher and higher over me. I'll never respect walmart the same anymore for this personal, indvidual treatment. Getting to know my customers, who all pretty much became regulars, and fellow co-workers was the ultimate pleasure of the job. As well as the fact of continuous work."
bad,Checkout customers and assist customer with where products are in store and Service Desk
bad,Great for college students. You have the ability to move up but the politics can over shadow the hard working and knowledable associates. Associates are under paid and degrees and certificates are not considered as a base of pay rate.
bad,"Its not that bad, but management could be a lot better. I just want to be with a company that I can move up in, I have out grown Wal-Mart in want to better myself and also with better pay."
bad,"Wonderful coworkers and flex scheduling are the only positives I can say about Walmart.  Management is petrified of higher management so nothing they say can be trusted.  In Walmart, there is no such thing as a ""Livable Wage"" until you become an Assistant Manager.  The best annual hourly raise you can receive is .60.  Benefits are offered but you pay substantially for them.  Customers are rude, mean, and uneducated.  "
bad,"Terrible place to work. Coworkers do not work as a team, management is absolutely horrible. They so not work with you on your work schedule and ignore you if they don't wanna answer you questions."
bad,Wal-Mart isn't a bad job I never consider being there long term that's not a career job for me personally I feel as if the medical field is my home
bad,"The hours were good, they were almost always short staffed and the "
bad,"Walmart is hard pressed to find management that cares about the employees. Most only care about the bottom line, and do not care if you have a life outside of work, or if you have bills to pay. Most managers play favorites, and people that do nothing are rewarded over and over again."
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the smiles on my customers faces when I know I've did a great job in serving them and we know each other by names and not just faces! I loves interacting with my customers and coworkers.
bad,The management seems to be favorable and unfair. Not enough employees to help cover departments. Drama is 24/7.
bad,"It was not uncommon to have 4 or 5 people working directly over me whose commands sometimes conflicted with each others and there wasn't a clear cut hierarchy of which supervisor takes precedence over who.  A typical day would include enhancing customer shopping experience by directing customers where they could find what they were looking for and by answering any questions they had. I was in charge of doing all the cleaning, zoning, pricing, signage, returns, and claims for my department, (Hardware), as well as several others including furniture, housewares, and domestics.  I also would unload merchandise from trucks, create displays on the sales floor, and trained over half a dozen new employees.  I was also in charge of making keys, selling hunting & fishing licenses, and mixing paint after helping customers choose shades.  I was also trained as a back-up cashier as they often needed help up front.  While mentally it was not that difficult a job, physically it could be quite taxing.  It was not uncommon for me to relocate over 20,000 pounds of merchandise from the warehous onto the sales floor, where items were in separate boxes that had to be opened one by one and carted around throughout the store. Multi-tasking was a big part of the job.  It was not uncommon to have several, parallel projects running at the same time, with supervisor's having you stop mid-task and change to performing another task.  In my short time there we had 5 different store managers, who rarely spoke to employess, and always had two assistant managers during any given shift.  Then there were the"
bad,"É uma grande empresa de bom resultados, aprendi muito com todas as pessoas que fez parte do meu dia á dia, a parte mais difícil é atingir as Metas e apresentar resultados. O mais agradável é a oportunidade de estar sempre aprendendo coisas novas, Não tive muito contato com a direção do grupo , nem gerencia não saberia  avaliar esse item."
bad,"Okay place to work, but the environment lacks structure.  Hour varied from week to week, and the wages are low."
bad,I have worked at WalMart for three years now and am still in a part-time position.  I don't feel there is any room for advancement at this particular job.
bad,"Being productive member of a team, assisting co-workers of break down and down stacking of department freight. Knowledge of product rotation and checking for out of date products to pull from shelves to ensure freshest product for customers."
bad,"never have enough staff working yet expect things to run as if there was, no real benefits don't even get discount at Sams Club {thought they were the same company} everyday threat to be written up {like a slave whip} no advancement or possibility to transfer if you happen to be full time and a woman. Let people steal or they will fire you for stopping them but you get talked to if you do nothing. good workers leave ASAP. most of the time its a hostile environment your working in if your trying to make Walmart a career unless your part time and just don't care."
bad,"18 years with the company, and I can see that over the years, Walmart has gone from being like family to a hostile environment, where Managers use and abuse their employees."
bad,they would work u to hard and bad employees management not professional
bad,Stock merchandise and help customers. Maintain clean dept.
bad,"I am just not satisfied with Walmart anymore. My store has management that just do not have the same values as I do. In my opinion, customer service is no longer important as well as associate respect. Too much pressure on things that don't matter anymore."
bad,everything over here is under poor review to me working conditions are bad not good to work for
bad,"Day started with clean up the front end cause all the overnight cashiers had to stock not enough people on graveyard.   I learned a lot.   I can run the front end of the store, do schedules, take care absents and evals.   Can offload a truck with over 1500 items in less then three hours.   Management is as good as they are trained.   If you have a hard nosed person the ones he trains will be to.   If the person really care for his people and care for his company he will be like that manager.   My co-work workers were ok.   Some were there just for the money.   Some were there to see how far they could climb up the ladder.  But a lot of us were there to work, help people, and have fun doing it.   Must of us kept busy do thinks to keep the front end clean and safe for customers.   For me the hardest part of the job was going out to get shopping carts when the bays were empty.   Two reasons for that no cart pusher or really busy day.   The most enjoyable part of my day was seeing people smile and joke around with you a little bit.   It made the day good fast."
bad,"As a staff pharmacist at Walmart, I am supervising 6 to 8 technicians at a time while the pharmacy produces 600 to 700 prescriptions in a 12 hour day. The work load is very heavy and the phone rings non-stop while the customers come at you from all directions. The company requires pharmacy to interview and/or hire techs from within the company before looking outside the company for more qualified or trainable persons. The pharmacy currently has a staff of 12 techs, 2 are high school drop outs and none of them are nationally certified. Several are transfers from other departments within the store and they are very nice people but simply do not have the mental aptitude to be quality pharmacy techs. There is no advanced tech training or incentive for techs to become certified or gain extra knowledge. Walmart has a CYA company culture and therefore has more policies and rules than any company I have every worked for and does not support pharmacy as a profession or pharmaceutical care whatsoever. They do not allow professional judgement or any decisions to be made regarding what, how, when, how much to dispense to a patient. The computer system is better than PDX but not nearly as fast or user friendly as competitors computer system and there are not enough computers, cash registers, no counting machines, robots or baker cells. Prescriptions each take a minimum of 10-15 min and the workflow is very labor intensive and frustrating. Techs are obsessed with 15 min breaks and 60 min lunches like no other pharmacy I've worked for. It's almost a union mentality with all the rules and breaks."
bad,HIgh turn over in assistant managers. Hours cut for everyone.
bad,"You'll spend 45 minutes or more completing your application accurately, only to be rejected via email minutes later after taking the assessment questionaire.  it's like losing before you even get out of the starting gate."
bad,"I would have to say that I assumed WalMart would be a better corporation to work for but it seems they are not. I made better paydays working for fast food corporations than for WalMart. Mainly because I am only part time, I have had to wait now 2 years before ever getting a paid vacation plus no sick time for part time people. Over the two years I have worked for WalMart it has been a slow downhill slope. It keeps getting worse with even more work always being had and fewer people to do the work. The managers always claim that we have low profits when that's not the case. It's a big corporation with a little heart for what makes them so big."
bad,"Minhas sete horas e vinte de  trabalhada era bem dinâmica e me proporciona cada dia um novo aprendizado, nestes quatro anos aprendi a fazer pesquisa, operar caixa ,rotinas administrativa , tudo o que envolve a gestão de abastecimento , desde  quando solicita o produto ate a hora que o cliente leva para casa, fiz grandes amizades algumas que levarei para minha vida independente de continuar na empresa ou não, e sei que sentirei saudades de minha rotina bem como das pessoas se sair da empresa , mas preciso sempre evoluir e as vezes esta evolução esta em um novo desafio o qual estou procurando incessantemente."
bad,I stocked 1-2 departments a night.  managanment would vary on how they wanted to treat there employes
bad,"Good people and nice co-workers. However, management doesn't plan ahead very well or make very intelligent decisions. Decent work environment but very little opportunity for job advancement."
bad,"A typical day would be unloading trucks."
bad,i work the register and different departments when needed.
bad,"this is the second wal mart store i have worked.  I was so excited when coming back to wal mart i thought it was going to be like the store i had worked in years before..this was not so..the wal mart i now work for is full of lazy management, there is dishonesty among all the management team starting at the very top , the store manager, they treat you as if you are children, job loyalty,team work and going the extra mile here is not rewarded...it all depends on who you know here.  our department manager works whatever hours she wants to work and nothing is said to her because her husband that also works here and get away with stealing is the store managers sons little league coach..they have cut all our hours in the past 2 months...i now get a whooping 15 hours a week and i have worked there 3 years and only make 8.60 even though i have scored above average on all my performance reviews.  Management is not held accountable for anything it all gets thrown on the associates .  At this particular store they put a hold on supplies in the ad office so that the store manager gets a high bonus.  So things we need like hand soap, gloves, dish detergent, hair nets etc we can't get in for weeks at a time because there is a block on ordering. We are told to write down supplies needed in our area to perform out job then after doing so the DM tells us we don't need it and refuses to order it...therefore we then have to cut out 10 inch rounds out of half sheet cake to make 2 and 3 tier cakes and cutting half sheet boards in half to provide the board for 1/4 of a sheet cakes. or my personal"
bad,it was a good job but the management not so great there nice to you when they need you and snotty to you most other days it was a good place to work for the time being but id rather be working more on the phone customer service
bad,"Scheduling caused shortages in work forcing a heavy workload."
bad,The managers dont listen to employees and the customers can be very rude.
bad,I enjoyed working for Walmart in NC. Management is difficult with no support from corporate. People are discouraged to report what is really happening.
bad,"Hostile working environment, terrible management who shines ya on if you have a problem.  co workers were okay people, the hardest part was faking my soul crushed smile, the most enjoyable part was leaving."
bad,"Would show up at 9:30 pm to get there early I start at 10pm  stay for meeting then look around the store to find a pallet jack they are hard to find because most are being used or broken. Then go to back grocery recieving to down stack freight on carts then stock all boxes on all my carts, clean up isle and zone shelves , throw trash and cardboard out then it would be close to 7am the time we have to clock out.also sometime I'm in charge of features which I would be pulling freight out all nigt to fill,replace,or set up features."
bad,Compensation is very low. No benefits and annually raises are very small.
bad,"Working for Walmart could have been an enjoyable experience if adequate was available. "
bad,I would not go back to work here. Most of the managers have a chip on their shoulder and treat the associates like trash. Good luck ever getting benefits or some kind of respect.
bad,"I liked the steady, hard work and long hours but did not like the fact that they would not work with my schedule for college. They wrote on my paper ""not for cart pushers"".  their is a very low chance to move up into a manager position."
bad,What I loved most about Walmart were the employees. We were more like family instead of co-workers. Some of the customers were very sweet and just like to come for conversation. Management could learn a little more about customer service and how to treat employees as well as customers. There was nothing hard about the job it was fairly easy. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers everyday.
bad,"Some great coworkers and managers, some not so great. Gained great customer-service skills."
bad,This company has a problem making up its mind as too do the job one way or the other. 
bad,This particular store was the worst work experience I have ever had.
bad,"A typical day at work would include working several carts or even pallets of freight while trying to help customers. I have learned a lot working for walmart. I learned better customer service skills, management skills. The hardest part of the job is the demands they expect from one person. the most enjoyable part would be the associates and customers that do make the day go by better."
bad,I experienced alot while at work however the levels of stress throughout the management team is pushed through the whole team. I loved the job considering the learning experience however I do not recommend pursuing a job with Walmart.
bad,"At the beginning of work management assigns you to certain areas of the store that she or he was never properly trained in. Incorrect training procedures on the first day of the job. Hardest part of the job would be, learning how to stock and find merchandise without necessary materials provided. Most of Co-workers would complain about how terrible and un-organized management is. Enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers, and recommending certain products for the customer."
bad,I was a cashier who work the floor and other departments as well.
bad,"Management at most of the stores do not care about their employees and ignore most of the employees, some do care and treat their employees good and talk to them.  They will work part time employees full time hours and not change their status so that they do not have to pay for benefits.  This is not for all stores only some of them, some stores will ask their part time employees if they want to become full time before starting to work them full time which is nice and the employees respect them for it. "
bad,A typical day for me is helping out customers and providing service as needed in a timely manner. I learned how to change oil and replace tires and also patch tires if reparable. I rarely come in contact with the managers but if I do they are sometimes helpful. I get along well with all of my co-workers. I respect everyone and we all are very helpful to each other. I would say the hardest part of my job is when I am unable to help someone out that is in need of service. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting a pay check and also working with my co-workers.
bad,"A typical day at work was to make sure the toy dept was clean and well stocked. "
bad,"humilhaçao cansativo e desgastante aprendi a trabalhar com cartoes"
bad,"4 pm clock in go to back room. wait for co-workers to arrive( even on a schedule everyone is always half hour late). wait for someone in management(sometimes another half hour) to unlock truck to start work day. During wait set up stationsto sort trucks for distribution of product for overnight stock crew.6pm 15 minute break then back to receiving to contniue unloading trucks, after truck is completly unloaded break for lunch, then after lunch shrink wrapp heavy loads and using pallet jacks manually distribute (betweeen 50-1000lbs of material to sales floor.After all items are to floor, clean work station before shift is over.Hardest part f the job is being criticized for what an associate is able to do not capable of which wasnt fair because i felt my crew would work their butts  off and we still get yelled at an treated rudely, even when we finished earlier. "
bad,"Terrible compensation, no benefits, co-workers were great, management was terrible."
bad,"Checked customers out with heavy handling of money and "
bad,"being a store standards for walmart canada is a very active job,  running to keep carts in the store for customers, running to answer any calls for a customer carry out, and over all keeping the store in and out in a positive looking stat... more work then time..."
bad,"As a unit, I do not recommend people working there at all. Poor management as a unit. They do not know how to talk you. I was never trained for anything, everything I learned was on my own. They all expect for you to know and get mad when you do not. Some of my co-workers were nice. I liked working with them and they helped me out a lot along the way. The hardest part of the job was trying to sell the different types of television. I actually had to do some research on my own time to know each different brand. I enjoyed helping each customer and talking to them. Normally, when I get there, I put all over the place. Things have to be done and we were always swamped with customers. "
bad,I loved the job it was quite easy. yet the none professional annoying level of my co-workers and even some managers who were not fit for the management career made the drama and work load harder. the unlivable pay is not worth the co-workers.
bad,This Walmart does not respect or appreciate their employees. They show major favoritism.
bad,People were always accused of things that they did not do. Hours were scarce and they would always schedule you against your availability.
bad,"Wal-Mart is not a job to make a career of. A typical day is to meet the requirements of Wal-Marts standards on taking in as many customers as possible on scanning customer's purcases, processing payments, bagging items, answering inqueries, processing credit applications as quickly and efficiently as possible. I learned that the customer is always right. Management need a different method of training rather than computer training. Co-workers are fun. The hardest part of the job was to make sure customers do not leave anything bags behind. The most enjoyable part is meeting different and diverse people everyday."
bad,The job itself wasn't so bad it was all the drama and talk behind everyone's back even mgmt. The job wasn't hard at all and the most enjoyable part was the customers.
bad,Preform basic services to automobiles
bad,Management was horrible and some of the coworkers were very rude it was like being in high school with cliques and everything
bad,Working as a cashier at walmart has been one of the worse cashiering jobs and experiences overall.
bad,Wal-Mart Stayed busy and it was always something to do at any point of time in the day
bad,"Not my idea of a job. It's been very depressing and a shame that almost the entire store including some members of management don't think highly of their fellow associates. Underpaid, overworked but barely even provided with the needed hours."
bad,um lugar onde se faz amizades e te ajudam mas sempre tem os que querem pisar em você.
bad,"Can't really think of a day that went by that I enjoyed. Was responsible for not only my job, but everyone's. Had a terrible supervisor that was lazy. Barely any support from the store managers. Uncooperative floor staff. Terrible pay for very demanding work. Benefits are poor. Management pick favorites and aren't ashamed to let everyone know. This specific location broke many corporate rules of conduct and employee rules as well. Will not ever return to this location as an employee."
bad,-depends on what you do
bad,"É uma empresa para pegar esperiéncia proficional,porem não eramos bem remunerados,e nem da oportunidade ao funcionario para crecer."
bad,Ever since Sam Walton died the company has been trying to find every way possible to save a buck at the expense of the values of the company used to all about. Everyone is expendable and no one is happy.
bad,I like to know what I am going to do and not be surprised when I arrive
bad,"trabalho não falta, aprendi diversos setores, expõem demais o associado em frente aos clientes, meus colegas eram legais, a parte mais difícil era quando esqueciam de me mandar almoçar e a parte mais agradável foi o aprendizado.."
bad,it was good because i dealt with people but management made it a poor place to work
bad,ok pay
bad,Its a ok place to work if you dont have any kids or dont plan on doing much with your life. I learned alot of different things how to run alot of different departments. Management are no good they think they are better than and can talk to you anyway they like. Some well most fellow employers are ok to get along with. The hardest part of the job is working with rude and disrespectful managers and supervisors. The mos enjoyable part was helping people.
bad,"não tenho mais nada para dizer, eu pedi pra sair isso já diz tudo..."
bad,"Ringing customers out until breaks , non stop, then sometimes forget breaks but still going on with my day"
bad,gostei muito de trabalha no wal mart la mim tonei uma pessoa mais responsável aprende a lidera as minha atividade
bad,A typical day is very busy even if there is no customers. I learned that you have got to have the right personality and attitude to work with the public. Most of my co-workers were enjoyable to work with.
bad,"After punching in I had 3 minutes to get to the front to sign in to register, but usually I had customers stop me to ask where they could find products, so didn't always make it on time. Customer is always first a priority. After signing into register I had to go up and down each register to check for things that didn't belong (customers are always deciding they don't want something and just sitting it down anywhere). Then I had to zone the seasonal section, if we were busy I would have to get on a register to get lines down. When evening cashiers got off I had to get on register. I had freight to stock up front at registers, also 2 nights a week I have gum and candy to stock as well as check out customers. If zoning didn't get finished at registers and seasonal area I had to work that in while stocking and waiting on customers. If we had more cashiers that night management would pull 1 cashier and csm or more to stock in the rest of store, leaving me and maybe 1 cashier and csm (customer service manager) up front (most of the time I was by myself) The csm and cashier had to put up returns (returns are things people have returned and things we have found where they didn't belong) in the dept where they went. Returns are coming up all night from managers and associate's finding things in their area that didn't belong. So on a normal night I was covering the whole front end by myself. If everyone was out stocking I also had to sort the returns and put them in carts or back in the bins. Most nights I would have a radio to call someone to front if I had a line, otherwise I had to"
bad,"They will tell you that they are very family oriented and concerned about your health, however, they are just the opposite. Getting a scheduled day off is sometimes impossible no matter what the reason and sometimes the managers are just a tad bit ridiculous to even deal with in serious situations."
bad,When I was there and I did Cart/ Courtesy Associate one of the managers was really annoying always on me more than any of the other employees I worked with and I really didn't like that job after I met that employer or supervisor.
bad,Worker there while I looked for a job in my field. Met lots of nice people. The hours were hard as I had to get up at 3am to do the baking.
bad,"Cashiering, stocking shelves, sweeping floors, helping other dept. when they needed help. I learned you can't depend on breaks of any kind being given on time if ever. Cashiers are ignored by the CSM's until they wanted to acknowledge your need for their assistance. Most co-workers were great to work with but there were several who didn't have to pay attention to their jobs so the rest of us had to do their jobs too yet they kept their jobs with nothing ever being said or done to change it. They were the ones who always got a promotion even though they didn't deserve it. Being made to feel like a 2nd class citizen which I'm not nor is anyone else. The most enjoyable part of my job was the customers. Meeting and greeting them. Some customers would get to know you and would wait just to come through your checkout line."
bad,"Wal-Mart is not a company to work for as they forgot the values that were started by the founder. The company states they encourage you to go to school but some managers actual will dock you hours if you request certain days off to attend. A co-worker had started the nursing program and only needed two mornings off but could work afternoons and evenings on those days and she was full-time employee, the manager actually cut her to part-time and had her only work one day a week - she dropped from school but did not get her full-time hours back."
bad,"Worked a CSM and than took a job as Dept. Mgr. Very rushed and always moving . I enjoy always moving and learning different things, and I had a good zone manager who taught me alot of different things that I learned as Dept. Mgr. . Co-Workers, some where really good and of course some where very not good."
bad,"I worked overnights, learned alot about customer service."
bad,"High pressure job, not noticed for youre accomplishments. have to work on christmas"
bad,A very busy place to work. I enjoyed being a Cashier because I was able to meet a diversity of people.
bad,"12 hour days, learned a great deal about managing talent, and wished I had a manager who cared more about her people...Co-workers were the best part of the job. The job was challenging, fun, and full of accomplishments. The hardest part by far was dealing with an overbearing and disconnected manager."
bad,"Walmart's overall culture despite its pretenses is one of disempowerment and subsistence/dependence; one is only given enough hours to be able to shop there in order to afford to live, therefore the money never really leaves the company. They are staunchly anti-Union despite being one of the largest companies worldwide. Ever since the economy has become difficult, they have cut back their staff and now expect a third of the staff they once had to run superstores. It's near to impossible even hitting the ground running."
bad,"The store was unorganized, management helped the employees that they liked. Half the time we were very short handed, and we had to pull double the weight, but others could team up and work together. We got an hour lunch and two fiften minute breaks which management and their favorites could take all the breaks they wanted for as long as they wanted. There wasn't any team work unless you happened to be working with the popular group. I used to love the job when I first started, but that didn't last long."
bad,"I would stock and unstock the merchandise.Start getting resdy for the day at work.. I learned how to work the register work the debit and credit card machine..also learned how to do inventory.. etc./management was a good team. my ex coworkers were awesome they showed me everything i know today in that work type of environment..the most part of the job i enjoyed was meeting ,hepling new people. giving them the customer service they deserved/..."
bad,A typical day is usaly bussy.
bad,"Overall fairly easy job mentally some stress dealing with difficult customers, ok management, horrible hours/not enough hours."
bad,They do not take care of employees. If you are injured workmans comp will deny you and you will have to fight them. The instantly begin rumors around facility about why you are no longer employed. They keep secrets to protect others jobs.
bad,Men seem to advance more quickly and get paid more than women. Not many hours are given.
bad,Basically they don't treat their employees with much respect. Management doesn't care if you have problems going on in your life and need a day off here and there. They made me work every weekend and wouldn't negotiate on giving me some off after 16 months of hard work. But i did do my job to the best of my ability cause i'm professional and have pride in my work and self.
bad,"The managerial staff expected way too much from the small stock staff, and the pay wasn't even worth the amount of work. Unloading pallets from the trucks each day consistently became harder and harder as staff diminished. Working conditions were terrible as breaks were short and hardly enough time to rest. The staff only worried about getting product out and making profit. Wages were the worst as they were so low compared to the labor."
bad,"well the started by walking to my work area passing by managers who were rude, didn't speak unless to critcize, not the most conducive environment to work in to say the least."
bad,Didn't enjoy working for this company because they never cared for the employees. They cared about making a profit and making our job harder. They cut our people down to where we were so thin that it made it impossible to be successful at my job. I was passed over for a promotion that i deserved and worked hard for. They gave it to an individual who didn't deserve the job. He couldn't do the job and quit 2 months later. That's why i quit the company and moved to texas to make a better life for myself.
bad,"unprofessiona,l bad experiences, terriable management no one listens"
bad,"This was an awful place to work, a typical day at work I would have to bake fresh bread every hr on the hr and repackage the ones that didnt sell and go in to a freezing freezer just to get stuff to dethaw and stock on the shelves. Management was awful they belittled you. Being told i would be a cake decorater and not a bread baker made me really mad when i had to bake bread all the time and barely learn to decorate cakes."
bad,"A typical day at Wall-Mart was very okay the job was fun some of the customers were pretty unplesent but most were fun to talk to,"
bad,learn a lot of management skills and how to work threw your people. managing payroll and running policy and procedures
bad,Okay job for people who want to work short hours
bad,For a company that prides itself on customer service they do not provide proper training for their employees. They believe in the sink or swim method and most of the time its sink. That is why their turnover is so high. Another issue is that it is very to get time off without get a hard time from Management.
bad,"Love helping customers! My typical day consists of requesting merchandise to restock departments, restock & zone areas, organize products to increase sales, cut & label fabrics, as well as problem solve for customers. Lower level management is a never ending revolving door with most areas lacking in management employees. I received approximately 10 minutes training & was left on my own to figure out the rest. I love a good challenge, and am a self motivated worker, so that was not a problem for me. However, hated to see other employees struggling because they didn't know what to do."
bad,Hard to stay happy and motivated. People on same level as you did not give you respect. Their employees are not a priority.
bad,Management is very unorganized and they are not loyal to their workers
bad,"I work about 36 hours at walmart. Ive learned how to deal with customers and to also make them happy. Ive learned that even if yo are having a down day working around people and customers will get you feeling great! I love my co workers at walmart but as far as the management they really dont appreciate you and all that you do for them. its not really a great place to further your career in. honestly. the most enjoyable part of the job is the customers. being there so much and seeing some of the same people is really great. they are friendly and they make you feel like you are the best worker that you can be. the job isnt hard at all. if you can preform customer service in the right way, the job is a peice of cake!"
bad,"I've never been one to bad-mouth a former employer, but I would not recommend Walmart (at the very least my particular store) to anyone. A typical day at work involved being given more task-time/work (sometimes double or more) than actual hours you were there to complete said work, but still being expected to finish it and punished if you did not. Management was very rude, disrespectful, self-serving and uncaring/unsympathetic to any situation that did not involve them and their needs. They were also very retaliatory. My co-workers, for the most part, were fantastic. I made many great friends there that I still talk to and see on a regular basis. Sadly, many have bonded over the aforementioned poor conditions. The hardest part of the job was being overworked without any form of compensation or recognition and generally being unappreciated. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing my fellow associates on a regular basis. It also happens to be where I met my amazing wife."
bad,not much to say but it really isnt the type of work environment the pretend to be
bad,"I didn't learn anything, the job sucks and the management has no idea what they are doing"
bad,It is one of the most horrible places in the world to work.. The mangers are perverted... The roaches are everywhere.. The rats pop out of shipping boxes.. If you hurt yourself like I did.. You wont go home you have to stay the whole shift..
bad,a typical day at work would be doing customers returns and zoning all aisles. Some days I work freight but the majority is returns and zoning. I've learned alot about UPC numbers and using the telezone gun to locate items. Management is not all that great and the co-workers are friendly to a degree. The hardest part is doing your job and the customers and their kids destroy it so it so your job never lokks completed. The most enjoyable part is clocking out.
bad,"start with a meeting,useless,told what dept to go to,manager stays in office or is sleeping in opffice or trying to pick up a employee,certain employees get special jobs,certain co-worker do thier work while others get away with goffing off,talking ,using thier phones all againts company rules,some even stealing merchandise right under ma,nagerment nise,doing my job then have to help slackers,working with staff that realey do work,having a good time doing our job."
bad,"One becomes aware that as an individual, they are being slowly used up with the company's willingness to discard after being burned up/out. Medical insurance is a sorry excuse for such. Values are good, though not ""stuck"" to. It is all about appearances. Job security is precarious to say the least. Advancement opportunities are good, though the three step coaching process can be crippling and is often used by the company to weed out those they simply don't ""like"". There are few to no kudos/rewards that are merit based. Management is not in your corner, they are simply looking to keep their OWN jobs, and who can blame them. Working at Walmart leaves little room for family. All in all, you best have your ""mind right"" if you wish to work. I have no wish to point fingers at people....just the way the whole company is run."
bad,"The job and work was great, the management was a different story. I learn you can't trust management or co-workers. Hardest part of job was being made to work off the clock."
bad,I worked for this company for 16 years and they are not to be trusted. They had down directions that can not be completed wthout skirting the edges. All they worry about is cases per hour and they don't care how you get it. And when you do skirt the edges then they hold you accountable and their investagations are a joke they only talk with those who will support what they want to find.
bad,"Although they were flexible with my hours when I was in school, there was no hope of moving up, no bonuses, and management was constantly changing."
bad,"- My typical day would be in supporting customers in their needs for cameras, photo development and retail support of the photo lab"
bad,High school atmosphere. Management is uneducated. Treat their employees badly. Quick to jump to conclusions. Their outlook is listen to hear say and fire based on hear say then review.
bad,"my typical day at Wal-Mart was on somewhat enjoyable because of a few co-workers but typically working at Wal-Mart was not what it makes it self out to be for a career or job choice they are not family orientated company at least the Wal-Mart in Ridgecrest,Ca isn't."
bad,"A typical day at work would consist of, stocking products, and produce. I learned that the managment does not care bout there employees only the product getting out on the floor. My co-workers were intersting. The hardest part of my job was zoning which means making sure everthing is were it is suppose to be. The best part was when i got off work."
bad,Working overnights as a receiving associate had its perks and down falls. I learned extreme time management. Some management understood the demands of stocking 4+ pallets piled over your head in a timely manner could be a bit of a challenge. Others did not. I loved my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was working while I was pregnant and not being able to do everything I usually did (which was everything the men did at the site and more). The most enjoyable part was getting off of work @ 7am and having my whole day available.
bad,"lack of professionalism, little to no coverage, extremely high turnover rate, lack of structure and rules and extremely low pay."
bad,"Just work here, if your looking to make some money, while in school. Or just need a pass over job, until you find a real one."
bad,You go to work clock in mingle with your friends and coworkers then it was straight to buisness.
bad,Entry level cashier knows more about how to run the business than their overpayed managers.
bad,"There is a lot of favoritism. If your not on the ""good"" list, you will be harrassed and/or no moving or promotion."
bad,4p to 1a
bad,No matter how hard you try it is never good enough. The upper management will lie to you at every turn.
bad,i love what i do by working on cars but i dont like the pay its only 8.00 an hour and i have a family of four that i need to provide for thats why i want to move to texas and find a better job for my family and give my two kids a better education!
bad,I was not happy working for Walmart there was no teamwork among the co-workers in my department. The store was just new as a Super Center. The management team was never a around when you had questions.
bad,Not a Career Job for a Single Adult. they Dont Train you but Expect you to Help in Other Area's. the Company Does are about their Employes all they care about is Making Money.
bad,It is OK if you like part-time work and you do not want to advance.
bad,"I began my position as an Electronic Sales Associate first at a different store. I was trained by one of my co-workers, who did a very good job of training me for the position; it wasn't his job to train me, it was that of my supervisor, who was rarely around and was very rude whenever mistakes were made when she is the one who was supposed to make sure that my training was complete and that I was able to complete all tasks properly. The co-workers were great, aside from gossip issues, but that can happen anywhere. My department manager was an absolute joy to work with; she was the only one able to motivate me to work given my minimal benefits and mediocre pay. Your experience at each store will vary depending on your management team, coworkers and customers."
bad,"At first it was a great place to work because management cared about you and your family.They picked on and watched people that was full time like a hawk.So they can get rid of them so they don't have to pay benefits.Then they had new management come in and ruined a lot.They was trying to get people to retire who have been their for years.They no longer had picinics,fun activitys for associates,increased costs of health insurance,dentel etc.They pretty much only hire part time which no one can survive on alone.They also changed the hourly rate that you start at which was very low."
bad,The customers were the most enjoyable part of going in to work!
bad,long hours not much respect for employees nice meeting different people from all walks of life
bad,"Management is terrible here, they forget what it is like to be a regular associate once they attain their new title. I did not learn many new things working here, but I did get to sharpen my already existing skills from previous employers."
bad,The most enjoyable part was the costumers I really liked helping them to the best of my abilities. The hardest part was after I came back to work after my knee surgery after getting hurt at work. Most of the co-workers were outgoing and made our day go by faster. I learned a lot about retail and how to talk to people instead of fussing. My typical day was from 7-4 in the plants and loading up products for the costumers and running the register.
bad,I was a cashier and felt at this job that they treated us cashiers badly.
bad,"management is shady, their policies are to favor managemnet over the team members."
bad,"The company has established such economies of scale in the retail industry that its management mistakes are not clearly visible from the outside. As strong as the company is performing, they have significant room for improvement. They need to trust their managers to lead. The company makes employees feel like numbers rather than people."
bad,"Management was the biggest issue. They do not communicate with eachother or with their employees. They never have enough people staffed for any position in the store. They don't care about what you do or how hard you work as long as the job is done. I've worked there for a couple of years and they have never once really noticed the amount of blood, sweat and tears I have put into my working there. I get so exhausted trying to keep up with there ridiculous expectations of my job title that I am just tired of not being appreciated or advancing."
bad,"This company was not concerned for the safety or well-being of their employees. They would work you in any department, wether you were trained for that position or not."
bad,there not good about hours and some of the managent dont treat employs good
bad,Its a stressful fast paced enviroment the worst part is having the mangers stand and watch you giving the evil eye.
bad,"Come in to work, clock in, arrive at my work station, if you get stuck on a task and need help for a customer you have to wait any where from 15-30 minutes for a CSM or another supervisor to show up and then have an attitude because now you wasted their valuable time in their eyes. Learned nothing at all except that in order to advance in the company you have to brown nose and suck up to even be considered to maybe get an advancement. Management is absolutely horrible, only self considerate individuals, and they treat you extremely terribly as well, no respect at all. The co-workers are the only people there that can relate to you and treat you with respect and compassion. Hardest part of the job is having to work at a company that treats you as horrible as they do and not being able to do anything about it. Most enjoyable part of the job, truthfully I can't say that I find anything enjoyable about this particular store that I worked at."
bad,Poor management and not guaranteed hours needed
bad,"wal-mart is not the best employer to work for, the customers are great & the co-workers are also, but wal-marts management team is not so great. I feel wal-mart have a very poor management team & system."
bad,Managment does not communicate at all. contanstly changing thier minds and then yelling at thier assoicates becasue they dont knwo the correct stuff
bad,In my experience in this Walmart I worked for was overall a good place to work and offered decent benefits and advancement opportunities. Just seemed the management as a whole were all money hungry and only worry was to keep hours down as much as possible even though they were understaffed and overworking their employees. They were just more concerned with their bonus checks then their employees. I would not tell anyone to work there.
bad,Depending on location of the store you can have a wonderful experience so unless you know someone there i suggest you get to know an employee for inside information.
bad,"I enjoyed working at Wal-Mart. Friendly co-workers and a full hour for lunch, a definite plus."
bad,I learned a lot in a short period of time at Walmart that was to my benefit but I also learned that there are some companies that do not have fundamental respect for the people that work for them. There is a lot of abuse that goes on from the top down to where I worked at the bottom. There was no organization in many parts of my store and that could be felt by everyone working there.
bad,"Wal-Mart was busy that was the only good part time flew by. On the other hand it wasnt a very friendly workplace, they changed Mangers left and right so half the time you had no clue who to go to with a problem some of them were unfriendly and didn't even want to be bothered with you. They never followed your avilabilty."
bad,I enjoyed working with customers. Who you report to is unclear at times. Some managers insist on lecturing you in front of customers which I believe is unprofessional. Health benefits are to pricey. It takes a long time to move up on the ladder.
bad,Is ok can’t complain but they can do a lot better on treatment and and benefits they lack a lot of understanding and taking care of their associates thats mostly it.
bad,"Doesn’t pay attention to there associate, very rasist . Unfair treatment and accountability. I clean work place. Manager irresponsible and lazy . Lots of work for small wage."
bad,"See how happy the hourly associates are in the store before you apply  They are the tell as to what it is like to work there Every store is different, management teams are different  some stores are excellent"
bad,"It took me almost 2 years to get hired at Walmart. I did everything required on the application and my résumé was outstanding as I am qualified for the floor sales position. The management get along with “who they know” and don’t see your full potential. They constantly send PA announcements and most times, the task was already completed. One employee usually have to get several other employees job done. The communication from management is very poor and you’d constantly have to remind them about things that you’ve discussed with them. The company expects the work to be done but doesn’t not give resources and wants employees to find ways to get the tasks done. The workload is usually way too much at times and is physically demanding.I’ve met some great customers who had empowering conversations with me and made my days at work bearable."
bad,This company like to play favorites with its associates. You get things based on who you know. You get away with harassment because you are friends with the management. This company does not like to have long term employees. Always changing things and loosing great people who have the most knowledge to help the company succeed.
bad,"There is alot of favoritism in my store.   There are alot of really nice people here but,  most of the management does not listen to or know anything about the associates here.  You earn PTO (paid time off) depending on the hours you work.  The management  has been cutting hours of a lot of the full time people and giving them to part time ones.  Causing them to lose their benefits.   The list goes on"
bad,"If you apply as a part time flex this is not for you,3 week’s schedule for zero hours is waiting for you.You dont have any manager to tell your issues.Nobody cares."
bad,"Over the many Walmart stores I have worked for, I have found a common theme across all of them; managers all love to have control over what you can and will do."
bad,"Honestly, at first I was pretty excited to work at Walmart. Until I realized the favoritism that was given to only specific associates. If you are not one of said associates then you will have trouble finding any kind of enjoyment in your job there. If all you are worried about is money, however, then its a good place to work."
bad,"Management only cares about themselves in the end. If you're getting trained to be a cert pharmacy tech it will take you years because you'll be scheduled to do it, but they won't let you go because they always need you up front. Customers are often horrible.   There's a lot more but yeah. Don't work here if you can help it."
bad,"This job is okay, but overall, soul-sucking. As a stock associate we are constantly told we need to stock more carts and pallets. The work load is impossible, which leads to managers always threatening your job. Managers are ridiculously unprofessional, and wont get fired because they have been there so long. Associates are nice though."
bad,"Over the past year, Walmart has put me through good scenarios and bad scenarios. Some such that I come to work the next day feeling energized, but most such that I don’t want to go to work the next day. The environment is not as good as I expected. The position I hold is very repetitive and energy draining, and the supervisor and/or managers don’t associate with our jobs as much."
bad,"I worked there for quite a while and it wasn't bad once you got in the swing, management was terrible and corporate would not help with valid complaints but that was to be expected. This is not all but just the one I worked at, the coworkers would make up things about you that some things if you have any self respect for the person you are I do not recommend working here."
bad,While employed at Walmart I was a cap two.employee responsible for unloading a grocery and general merchandise truck alongside a few other employees. After the unloading we were also responsible for stocking the shelves in a timely manner. We were often rushed to do tasks while we were under staffed. The pay doesn't match the work load.
bad,"Walmart has unrealistic expectations of employees with health issues. Even after having doctors notes for all missed time due to severe health issues, employees are still terminated due to the point system."
bad,I wish my hour rate could raised but don't know when.I am not make much good money.walmart really take care of there associates well but less hours when they give us we feel sad that's not right.
bad,"One of the managers was super inappropriate, whereas others didn’t seem to care about anything. They weren’t happy with their jobs and some of the workers were rude."
bad,"Well kept clean place and organized, hours can be somewhat flexible. Nice and friendly co-workers. well kept management. Always able use time wisley,."
bad,"I think Walmart is very selfish, they do not care about the employee, or at least they didn't when I worked there, back in 2005. Just an awful place to work"
bad,Good work environment. Lacking on management skills and the way they talk to there associates. Lack on scheduling in areas that is needed. Good associates
bad,"In the tle at Walmart you work in all conditions, and you're the most underappreciated worker at the place. Managers are two faced. You're also more likely to lose your job than any other associate."
bad,The management is rude and so is one person in human resources. They say they are family oriented but not. When you have a dr.'s note and have restriction they don't care they want you to not fallow the dr.'s orders.
bad,Unreal expectations on what an employee is capable of. They are on production schedule and they set production at such high levels its almost impossible to meet. They are very unsupportive when it comes to family matters and are quick to fire
bad,"When I started here I was hired full time but they messed up and labeled me as a minor which then made me struggle for weeks to come because I had to go to the store manager to fix it. Enough said, horrible work place"
bad,At first I could come to work happy. Since going back to school to complete my associates degree I had to change my availability of hours. Still being available 40 hours a week. I was lied to on several occassions and still being scheduled to work during the hours I had requested as being unavailable due to attending classes. I was under the understanding that Walmart encouraged higher education.
bad,"Manager had favorites and refused to acknowledge when she was wrong. coworkers are usually good but there are bad eggs. Benefits are good for full timers at the moment but part time benefits are virtually nonexistent, this should change with the new ceo they just implemented. Turnover is very high on the low pay grades due to good people being forced to work harder than everyone else because they've been there longer and the fact that you are easily expendable and most higher positions come with mounds of stress due to their ""do more with less"" mentality in corporate. unless you are in a position that will never go away (store manager, cashier, sales associate) chances are your position probably will either be cut or downsized to save on hours the store uses/ put more money in corporate's pockets. only get a job at Walmart unless you have high ambitions in the company or you need some cash until you can get a better job."
bad,Take away the point system and the lack of good management and it would be a great place to work. And the customer base is a nightmare with no support from management.
bad,Some of the people were wonderful. But the scheduling and management at times are absolutely repulsive and deterring. Polices are set for a reason. And then for these same policies not to be followed by management is hypocritical and not the correct way to lead.
bad,"management does not care for employees, no benefits unless you are full time which is almost impossible unless you are a manager, they work you to the bone and it still wont be good enough.. no matter how hard you work your butt off, management abuses power, lots of favoritism towards male employees especially in the back,hardest  part about working here is trying to keep up with managements ridiculous standards. The best part of working here is the breaks... you get two 15 minute breaks and an hour lunch. you only get 5 points for attendance within a 6 month period and from the date of your first point after 6 months it rolls off. Supposedly, Walmart employees make an average of $14 an hour but at my store, we are getting paid $11. Heard a rumor that the reason we were not getting that pay was because of new vests. After we received these new vests (which were NOT worth it by the way) we were told that the new pay was postponed. This job is not worth it."
bad,"They have three shifts, scheduled for 9 hours a day, because you get an upaid hour for lunch, your two 15 minute breaks are paid."
bad,Difficult to get days off. Management is too busy with high school style drama. Found myself drowning in work with no help in sight. Work life balance was almost non-existent.
bad,great if you need a job however management is not very helpful. cant beat the pay but hours get cut drasticly without any warning. best to save along the way
bad,"During the two years I was there. I felt that management only cared about making Walmart money. I was a TLE tech, multiple times managment expected me to do tasks outside of my job description. This would not be a problem, if they didn't punish you for doing the tasks they asked you to do. In my case, I was often asked to help run the cash registers in TLE, assist customers, and stock shelves in the store. Then I would receive a write up for doing it. My yearly review stated I spent too much time on th store and not enough time in the shop, however, I couldn't stay in the shop working without management yelling for me to do other tasks."
bad,"1. You will be dealing with customers who have a variety of problems or none at all."
bad,I liked working my job and the people that I worked with. I did not trust the company or management. Most of the stores are understaffed. Management constantly is looking for reasons to terminate you.
bad,The point system is overrated. If you receive five points you're fired. Emergencies happen but they don't care. No matter how good you did you're job.
bad,Very cut throat if in management. Overall it’s a job nothing special or memorable. If you need a side gig or can’t land anything else it’s a good fill in for that.
bad,"I get paid okay to stand at the door and check receipts. The pay doesn’t bother me, what bothers me is all of my lazy coworkers. Constantly having to do other people’s job while only getting paid for mine is unfair."
bad,"I handled multiple duties such as handling cash,customer returns,answering questions about merchandise,pricing,product location,etc. I learned how to develop a thick skin as there are many different types of personalities you will come across on a day to day basis that may tempt you to respond unprofessionally at times and can be extremely difficult to deal with. The management was standard like most minimum wage jobs and anyone looking to work here should expect to have an extremely difficult time getting days off for everyday emergencies and or holidays as it will be held against you to the highest degree and lead you that much closer to possibly being terminated despite your performance. The workplace is pretty standard when your not checking someone through you will be asked to do miscellaneous task around the front area of the store. The hardest part of the job would have to be a lot of the awkward interactions with customers that would come in regularly and the occurrence system it took little to nothing to quickly rack up a few occurrences and before you know it your gone. The best part of the job was meeting nice down to earth people and the scheduling wasn't all that bad."
bad,My experience working for Walmart was educational in a sense. I learned a lot through other employees but mainly by seeking information myself. One of the main downfalls I have noticed while working there was a lack of communication in management and a willingness to teach others through quality time and hands-on training. I am currently ready to explore and expand on other job areas.
bad,"I was content and happy as an electronics associate, for the most part. Then I got promoted to a Department Manager position. That's when my job satisfaction fell into the toilet. "
bad,"Decent place to work at while in school, fairly flexible with hours. Decent pay for the amount of work requested. Good experience and makes a good first job."
bad,"This company is horribly mismanaged! The best way to get ahead is to suck up to an Asst Manager,  or Dept Manager.  I worked in Lawn & Garden, which also handled Seasonal.  There's never enough employees, the equipment is old or broken, not enough rotation of duties within the department. I had to beg for training and still didn't receive it! Frequently I was left on my own running the cash register.  There would be over 20 customers in my line with no help to be had. This company seems to enjoy making their employees miserable. Worst job I ever had!"
bad,The policy makers are out of touch with reality in a busy retail pharmacy environment. Cutting hours and positions at the beginning of cold and flu season makes no sense. The easiest way to have spread sheet reflect a good performance is to cut hours and positions.
bad,"I was messed with by employees and managers because I actually wanted to work.  Was always left to do all the work.  They liked scheduling me by myself when it at least a 3-4 person job, then complained all day because I was not getting anything done"
bad,I did'n feel like my boss appreciated me no matter what I did It was not good enough for her I think she single me out because i had a disabilityThey have  people to clean windows this was not in my job discription i waas not hired in as a Custodian or Mantenace worker
bad,Walmart was a great company to work for about ten years ago. Unfortunately they are moving in a direction that is based more on self service and in doing so are actively pushing out the employees who have been there for a long time.
bad,The company is changing so much and too many changes occurred all at once   Seems like the more you do the more they want   Never good enough  not many happy people there anymore
bad,"This should be the place to use as a stepping stone not for long term, while you look for some thing better or while going to school to get your career started"
bad,"Management wasn't flexible. I didn't see much opportunity on expanding work experience. Very hectic in work scheduling, limit resources on building a career."
bad,The managers had their favorites who wouldn't have to work as hard as some of us. My favorite part of work would be interacting with the customers and having those regulars that you got along with.
bad,The work is good the Managers just doesn't care about their associates.  Walmart is bad about not giving associates training on the company doesn't care about their associates the jobthe job
bad,Walmart pay doesn/t match up to the amount of work the company loads you with nor is the assesment set up for sucess. The academy instuctors doesn't go over the material properly. Over half the class that I attended didn't pass the examine even if it was open notebook. The material wasn't that great.
bad,Forget the notion that there is advancement at Walmart because there is none. They favor their employees based on color which is very discriminatory and they are just downright nasty at times.  Everyone is overworked and underpaid and they are replacing people with machines!  Look out for your jobs!!!
bad,Not a fair place to work not enough money a store greeter gets the same amount of money as me and I have to lift 50 pound cases all day not at all fair need more money
bad,My job currently involves making sure the shelves are properly stocked fully and correctly while providing customer service. This also includes ensuring the aisles are nearly organized and the floors are clear of any debris.
bad,"you unload very hot/cold trucks that are filled all the way to the back and stack apllets with the merchandise."
bad,They dnt respect who you are. They dnt care what you do for them as a employee and the are always trying to reduce the size of people needed to run the stores properly and over work you as an individual. They dont care about there open door policies because they will fire you for bringing it to them.
bad,They play favorites and try to find fault in everything a person thats not a favorite. They also have terrible management that don't care about there employees.
bad,It honestly depends on which Walmart you are working at. The one I am currently employed at is the worst. This is the worse job I have ever had (and I rather go back to dish washing). Management is really unprofessional and favoritism is really common and obvious in the place.
bad,After nearly 20 years at Walmart it has become a company who cares nothing for its people and is concerned with only two  thing.  Moving through it’s senior leadership and PROFITS!
bad,"A couple of the managers were unorganized and often show up to work angry. Other than than that, I have learned a couple of things working for Walmart and want to grow from there."
bad,Walmart was one of those experience that sometimes I wish I can take back and sometimes I don't it taught me alot. and the workers there are amazing people to be around but some people in management was just awful.
bad,"This company doesn't care about the customer or their employees. They continue to cut hours making it impossible to do your job safely and efficiently. Horrible Management, of course they perform accordingly when they are being watched or reviewed. Customers can walk all over  employees and it is just overlooked."
bad,"Only care about making the most money possible. Don’t get hurt, they’ll fire you as fast as they can, legally. Also, be prepared for your body to go through the wringer."
bad,"On any giving day you would have your work an the person before you work. There would be unreasonable time limits. "
bad,As a Department Manager you really have no control over your associates schedules. The Assistant Managers along with the Store Managers write the schedules. You are constantly working short handed and told to get the work done as if you have a full staff. Favoritism is very high so is childish behavior among the older adults. No professionalism! They are always speaking about budgets and uses that as a reason to keep you short staffed.
bad,"When I worked at Wal-Mart I was excited to begin helping others in my community with great deals and excellent customer service skills, but as soon as day 2 I realized Wal-Mart was more into cutting benefits and dislocating their workers. Many things that provided a safe environment for employees were removed and management constantly spoke I'll of the employees as well as the customers. I preferred leaving as soon as I could."
bad,"So, in the most part management is picked by who’s liked, or more so who can brown nose. This usually leads to incompetent management. They’ll usually brush off employee concerns, especially when it’s about another employee-or if a work load has become to much. (Like in the situation an employee is not doing their share of work, causing a section to not get done in time. Or not doing their work properly, etc.) If they would listen to us more in times like this, there wouldn’t be much of an issue  but of course they don’t actually care about that-just that they’re in management and get paid more."
bad,"Bad management, Some bad business ethics also bad about getting equipment fixed and ordering supplies and expect 4 people to do a 10 man job and not very good business or common sense."
bad,Walmart is an ok job. But theres some bad parts about  them too. Management could be way better and treat their employees more better and with more respect. I feel they need to put their selves in our shoes when it comes to people's children. And the favoritism is horrible everyone should get treated the same and we dont
bad,"All Walmart’s are probably not the same environment, however I would Never work for this company again.. One of the worst experiences of employment thus far."
bad,Management could care less about its employees wages where not enough to cover bills for a family of three no paid holidays hardly any vacation time made to feel like you where never good enough
bad,Horrible place to work. Poor pay. Hard to move up. It’s just a dead end job to try to excel as far as a career and to make a living. The management is rude and they like to go off hear say
bad,"They are doing anything they do for themselves. They expect you to run yourself into the ground for them. The first bad thing that happens you are thrown under the bus and any good that you do, you don't get the credit."
bad,I did not like working at Walmart because they dont care about their employees. Also they dont like to work with teenagers who are in school and cant constantly work their schedule that they made.
bad,"i learn how to manage money & deal with customers and there problems, the management there was very poor overall, they would leave minors cashiering by themselves, they would leave the area and not come back for a long period of time, they would also let other people get away with things that arent suppose to be doing, like dress code, coming into work with marks on their necks, dresses, and also stealing time meaning taking longer lunches and breaks. this job was overall very easy but stressful when rush hour hits or the managers not doing their job correctly."
bad,"The job is hard, the support is low, management is unreliable and unethical, but the money is good. I wouldn't recommend working here unless you really have no other choice."
bad,Working at walmart the job is fairly easy until you make it pass the 90 day mark. Management is the main reason there's a high turnover rate no one communications in a professional manner which in turn adds the stress to coworkers. Working at wally world you can't trust anyone.
bad,"I was let go on November 18,2019 due to the fact that I had gotten sick and had to be away from work for like maybe 7days And because my doctor didn't turn in my paper work on time, that made me have those day's of unexcused absences. and was told that I couldn't use my protected PTO"
bad,"Some managers do their job, however personnel is lagging because of only one person trying to run 3 stores. The cutting hours and attendance policy is very ridiculous because you can’t miss i day a month."
bad,The company is phasing out a lot of positions and I believe that I am over qualified for the available positions. I would not be challenged enough as these positions will not allow me to use problem solving skills.
bad,"Managers were not the best people to talk or work with, management cannot or will not help you change a day you come in to work due to personal or family reason. They always say you should have put in that date as time off 6 months ago when it is something you either didn't know about 6 months ago or it just recently happened. Always short handed at departments and have to cover everything and find someone outside your department to give you a break or your lunch break if you're a key holder and you don't have the ability to turn in the keys while you're on that break."
bad,"The company is cutting hours after promising 40 hours. I can not live on the hours they are offering . I live in tulsa and am comutting to skiatook "
bad,"During the time I was there, I never really knew who my supervisor was, different people at different times, and turnover was common.  As I would change departments, it was clear there was no real leadership.  An employee from a larger department could come and pull the sole person from a smaller department to do menial tasks in theirs, and ignore the needs of the smaller department. Poor management then, entirely.  Other department managers would frequently come in and admonish, and yell at employees and take some off the line to other departments then still fuss and yell because trucks were not unloaded fast enough..."
bad,The company is ok their not the best to work for but I won’t speak bad about them. The pay is ok pays a little more then my current job. I’m looking for something better.
bad,"Constant management changes and turnover creates a very unstable environment for a place that already intentionally understaffs so upper management can earn their bonuses."
bad,"Well it’s retail, so it doesn’t pay much. The training is perfunctory at best. The management could be better trained at managing people, as well. HR is practically unavailable for assistance with updating records, and you’re on your own when it comes to signing up for benefits. So I’m moving on ASAP. It’s a fine job for part-time, but don’t try to make a living with it."
bad,Walmart is an ok place to work not the best but not terrible. It really depends on management how good it is I worked there for 13 years and had good and bad managers. The benefits are good but they take a lot of your paycheck for it. They really suck about giving enough hours sometimes only had 16 hours for the week.
bad,Not recommended for people with family. it depends on which store you ended working at. Bad store management will leave you with bad taste in your mouth. It depends on who you are working with. I was front end manager and  within 4 months they also added apparels & home lines to my plate. Your store manager just need someone to put the blame on when the market manager questions him. Store Manger abuses Assistant manager
bad,"I knew going into this job that it would be a busy one but I underestimated it. As a cashier upfront it is rarely quite but that is not a problem so much as that problems with communication and the lack of ability to do things like reprint a receipt for example. If one needed to do such one would have to wait for a CSM to come over and do it, but if they were busy you would just have to stand there and wait. If its really busy they can forget about you for items you need to your break. Training was slightly better than a previous job I've had but as it was all corporate mandated it only covered a broad array of subjects and not details that would come up later. Management is nice but this company will take the word of the customer over your own"
bad,The company is always looking to push you more each day to achieve your tasks  but frankly I think that they want you to work really hard but not pay you what you deserve  I would not work for them again
bad,"Tuve una buena primera experiencia, me dieron muchas herramientas para nuevas oportunidades."
bad,Very poor at helping an employee dealing with domestic violence. No support at all. Call for a supervisor- no one ever came. Management very poor at communicating.
bad,Will never work there again . I use to do more work than my co workers but yet I didn’t get full time because Of my availability. I offered every shift within my availability but that didn’t matter they would still only schedule me 5 hour shifts . I felt like I was being penalized for being a single mom a single mom of a disabled child at that. I just got tired of hearing my manger tell me I know everything is ok when you are here.
bad,It was a good company to work for in employees are awesome was there on time every single day was there on my days off when they need me to be there never complained no complaints
bad,They just keep adding on task that are minmall for people on all-night jobs therefore ending in task incompletion I would use this a a stepping srone.
bad,"If you're thinking about applying at any Walmart, the best advice I can give you is to scope out the place first & pay attention to their work ethic. Without a decent team behind you, this job is rubbish."
bad,"For personal reasons I had to skip a few shifts (I informed my manager) by the time I came back my manager had started the employment termination process and I was fired without any warning, my manager never reached out to me that he was firing me. Other than that the other employees and the work itself was nice."
bad,"Overall it was an alright place to work, but the management was terrible. They were unprofessional and untrustworthy individuals. They only care about the bottom line, not the customer or employee."
bad,"Management didn't hold all associates to the same standards. If you were in a certain group, you could get away with anything. You will be lucky if you perform the job you are hired for. The People Lead, in charge of enforcing policy, shopped on the clock on a few occasions but wanted to get anyone 1 minute over on their break coaches. Just an overall terrible place to work. I'm sure other locations are probably better."
bad,"Rude customers, managers and other employers lots of stress  and people trying to make you lose your job no team work and been left to do all the work yourself"
bad,I’ve had several bad experiences at Walmart and I know several others that had bad experiences to. I know a currently employee that’s having a bad experience. Personally I do not think all Walmart’s are bad I think all of them in the Augusta region are horrible and it’s mainly because of poor management I’ve seen a lot of good people leave that’s be there for years and said that it did not use to be like this.
bad,Horrible management. No advancement. They choose who kisses their butt for manager and skin color. Loved my crew that I worked with but the management team was trash
bad,Always treated like children there. Things are repetitive. I work in shipping. Goals are always unattainable. Rules can be made up on the spot. Be ready to work holidays without any extra pay. They offer an incentive but hardly pay out on this.
bad,"I’m one of the strongest people in that office and I got to a point where I just couldn’t deal with all the stress. For the first couple of years I enjoyed my job, as the work environment changed so did everyone’s attitude and from there the office just got worse. You are not paid enough for what your expected to do and it’s not worth anyone’s mental health to work there."
bad,"People are over worked and underpaid . "
bad,Pretend to be helpful: not. Used to be flexible: no more. One Best Way: one complicated and irrelevant way that makes daily work harder. They pretend to care: they no longer care! Demand hour availability: harmful to long term employees (Do NOT use open door policy = removed)! Not a good company to work for anymore.
bad,"Customers believe they can dominate you and the manages believe they can dominate your life time. The company wants to keep you all the time with them, you don't have time for family or yourself. It is very difficult to ask for days off even for months before. If a situation happens you will not be heard properly. If you ask for have the Holiday off, they will never accept it and you can't call out either because they have a Core hours policy if you call out you will have two points of absences they can fire you. If you start working here, forget about spending time with your family. If you are sick they don't care you have to go to work and management don't accept excuses from the doctor."
bad,"Stocking items pulling pallets and inventory off back shelves."
bad,"Busy , understaffed,  favoritism,  wants you to be there all the time . No family life.  Lack of communication no fallow threw . Clean and busy . Training suvks"
bad,"Walmart is not bad when it come to the wages, but the management that I encountered while working there was, for the most part, terrible. Some managers are great, but a majority of management expects your life to revolve around work and will give you nothing in return. They penalized me for them not adjusting my availability for school, something they were supposed to fix a month before the semester started. Management generally treats employees with little respect, and as a result, has done a few things out of policy to me and other coworkers while I worked there. Definitely tell my friends to go here for work as only a last resort."
bad,"Wal-Mart is a terrible place to work at. The management was the worse they overwork the new hire and try to make your work impossible to complete. for example, when you clock in you are giving multiple tasks and it will tell you how long it takes a person to complete. Keep in mind normal shifts are only 8 hours long but tasks can be 15 hours long by yourself. Also when its humanly impossible to complete a task they make you feel like your the worse employee ever and you can't do anything right."
bad,"Working at Walmart l during my 5 year tenure was challenging to say the least. The work environment is very inconsistent between stores and can almost feel as if you're working in a different company depending on the store you're in. The majority of managers have very low morale and don't effectively manage, but instead, choose to participate in bullying and pubilically embarrassing other associates with their favorite associates."
bad,"Not a good work environment for intelligent people. The dumber you are the better you take their orders and adhere to all company no life mentality."
bad,"Management sucks, a bunch of young girls walking around on cell phones. Lazy demanding older people or coworkers to do their jobs! Would not go back and also force you to work nights even though they need help in the morning!"
bad,"I had to beg to go to lunch after waiting  two hours for someone to come and cover me, barely any breaks because of no covers, I ended up quitting the job there after I threw up blood and my boss at the time who is no longer there wouldn't let me leave to go to the emergency room to find out what was wrong"
bad,Poor management. Lots of favoritism in my store and most of the management was rude. Made one person do way to much on the self check out. There should have been at least 2 people.
bad,Walmart has not been the best working environment. Management was always too preoccupied to help with associate concerns. They cared more about the numbers than the well being of their associates. Employees were often not treated with respect.  This was not a pleasant experience overall. However the flexibility of hours were the best thing about the job
bad,"Worked EVERY position. Worked at EVERY store in the market. ALL the same. Everybody is for them selves, managers are unprofessional, when you finally find a good team then you find out people wanna stab you in the back. Etc etc... all the negatives are true. Used to love working here. I think. But after 7 years you see the companies true colors."
bad,This job will wear you out in a hurry and its a dangerous place to work at some of the people that work there driving the forklifts don't care if your grabbing boxes to put on you forklift they will still try and go around you as your getting off of the forklift and then get mad at you for getting in there way.
bad,"The one concrete positive thing I can say about this company is that it has great full-time benefits. I've heard about management refusing to give employees enough hours to qualify, but I myself never had that issue. "
bad,I’ve been working there since I was 17 I loved it at first but when a neighboring Kroger’s closeted down and our trucks doubled in size management demanded impossible tasks out of employees forcing many of us to quit
bad,"i have no comments about working at walmart, besides the fact unless you make work your life but love always get put last from management or corporate then go ahead and work there."
bad,After you have worked there for a few years they will try to make your day to day work so hard on you that you leave the company so they can replace you with someone part time and lower pay
bad,For me it was a personal issue with management.The management didn't talk to you as a worker more like a your under there shoe.The people there just straight talked down to you while doing nothing for the rest of the day.
bad,"Walmart always hires a lot of people during peak season, they'll get back to you quickly and theres no interview just a paid orientation. They hire a lot because many associates quit within the first week.HR is really unorganized, they always lose checks/pay late. The training during peak is bad they just try to get it over with even if you don't really understand the job. The actual jobs there are fairly simple, but you're just really exhausted at the end of the weeks especially during mandatory overtime. The environment is ok, me being a female many men always bug you during your shift and theres nothing you can really do about it because HR or managers won't switch you out of your departments. The pay is alright for the job, but you're not always guaranteed 40 hours a week they let you leave sometimes at your 8th hour or even earlier when theres no work. Also they don't really care about school schedules or anything you'll still recieve an occurance if you call off. Managers are always a hit or miss there are some who are really understanding and there are some that you will rarely even see."
bad,Not friendly to older associates and don't keep up with maintenance through out the store including restrooms and break room. Foul language and alot of ethnic bias.
bad,Very depressing place to work everyone in the store hates there job. They would cut hours and pay them back in the  bonuses we would get every quarter. Horrible management had a new manager every 2 months the place is a complete mess.
bad,"They want you to work until you drop and are offended when you need your 15 minute break. The managers forget you’re a person, guilt you into staying well over your shift end time. They don’t know how to make a schedule and expect one person to do the work of three."
bad,"Walmart has started a new initiative to curtail some of the old stereotypes. Well,, they’re not trying very hard. They still treat their employees bad"
bad,The money is alright for the area but not great job culture. There isnt a lot of chance for moving up to management but the experiences gained would help at almost any other job.
bad,I hated it the manegment sucked i never want to work for them again the hours were inconsistant the people i worked with were horrible it was just a bad experiance over all
bad,"Management is very rude to the associates and treated with disrespect.  When raises are given, hours are lowered.  Make you work a flexible schedule or they will not put you on the schedule and it also makes it difficult to get a second job, but they don't give you enough hours to survive. If you don't work on Thanksgiving day and/or black Friday then you do not get the extra 15% discount.  You have to be ruthless and heartless in order to move up in this company.  There are a few good managers but, not many. They job itself was fine and my co-workers were friendly and good to work with."
bad,Stressful and they let a lot of people go for no reason other than greed. Very high pressure working environment with very little help . Techs hours are always being cut.
bad,"Let's be honest--there might be a Walmart out there with responsive managers that care about their employees, a job environment that has an adequate amount of associates, and a system that never falls so woefully behind as to be on the brink of failing in some way. But that's not the experience I had in the stores I worked at. training varied wildly or was nonexistent, organizational systems intended to ease the burden and time of tasks were either never taught or simply outright ignored, and communication between levels of management occurred in a way that did not ultimately benefit the associate (ie: I would get several tasks from both my dept managers and my assistant manager, neither would discuss this with each other even when they discussed the needs of the department). Did I hate my coworkers and direct managers? No. Was it ultimately a difficult job skill wise? No. But the level of stress you can get to just by trying to catch up and not fall behind again is exhausting."
bad,Management was very poor they work you to death and you are rarely acknowledged for the work you do so no one wants to do a good job. It’s all in how you manage.
bad,The management at the Clayton store on Hwy 70 were unprofessional. They did not take their employees serious and they were not family oriented. I would not suggest anyone with a family to work there.
bad,"I was at walmart for 2 years and even went to culinary school and even after I was put as mentor and trainer without any extra compensation. I was then passed up for management position by a younger guy, who I did train.after passing management test I was passed up many times."
bad,"It's not entirely uncommon for there to only be less than 5 registers open, the registers themselves are broken and old, and management often forgets to make sure their workers get their breaks or lunches. I have on more than one occasion almost blacked out due to low blood sugar because they would refuse to send me to my schedule meal time. The customers are hostile and selfish, and the products are often spoiled or damaged. I have had to deal with pet food that is covered in maggots, or throw away molded food."
bad,Store manager schedules unrealistic schedule that could be as early as 5am after working as late as 12am. Unrealistic company goals that never get met. Most of the time your time off request gets denied.
bad,"I started working here come ppl were friendly,  then the lazy coworkers got irritated because I was put on a team they said there wasnt a position for. Lots of Internal gossip and bull from man and employees. Poor management with some overnight managers. Some were oblivious to it all. Hires and promotes more family mementos of existing workers. Q"
bad,I loved working at Walmart until they hired on a young manager with no respect for her elders or people with disabilities. She ruined the job for everyone with her miserable demeanor. I have to be kind of grateful for that. It made me realize I was a better person and more qualified than just being a cashier. I quit and found a full time job doing something entirely different.
bad,At first it was ok working there but two months into it my hours dropped  extremely the manager was never there so I was just thrown into it all not knowing what  exactly  My duties were
bad,This company isn’t terrible and if you’re needing a good paying job. Starting out at $11 an hour is really good. The management is a little tricky. You’ll have great managers come and go and the younger new ones seem to stay the longest.
bad,"There's no concern of for individual welfare unless you are viewed as a favorite.  That means good luck on any real advancements, unless you go to ""Academy"" (I have two degrees.  Why would I want to go to school AGAIN?), and very little chance of making ends meet when the best than can be done for a person of my position and RETAIL experience is under twelve dollars an hour.  Encouragement to move forward should be from all members of management, and when I managed in previous occupations, I encouraged them to go after MY position.  That's the way it should be.  But not at Walmart.  Or at the very least, THIS Walmart."
bad,"As a asst. Manager worked 10 to 12 hours a day.  Sometimes many days in a row.  Weekends, overnights, never home. Upper management doesn't care. They act like they do but nothing changes"
bad,"Walmart has become the type of place to seek for last ditch efforts in employment to pay bills. The manager, asst.managers, HR dept., are all unprofessional, rude, loud, and...ghetto. And the work culture reflects this poor work ethic. It's beyond me how some of the uppers landed their positions (must have been major butt kissing), but they lack the knowledge, skills, and abilities that you would expect from the people in their positions. They go out of their way to incorporate a hostile work environment and encourage the behavior from the people below them. This is not how to retain good, hard working employees. The turnover is through the roof and there's nothing really surprising about that. Do not work for Walmart in Georgia. Maybe other places have better management, but you will not find it here."
bad,I didn't like working at the specific Walmart in my area because of the bad management that was hired. It drove a lot of other workers to quit. Other Walmarts might not have this issue but I did.
bad,"The job is easy, they will let basically anyone work there. Some of the workers look trashy, but they’re normally pretty cool people. My manager was great though."
bad,"A typical day would be staying busy helping customers or cleaning and stocking."
bad,I absolutely loved working here in the beginning however as time went on and now present day this company gives no recognition to its employees like they use to. They do not value the hard work and dedication of the employees who really give it there all! Iam so disappointed in where this company is headed!
bad,All lies and back stabbing from the company. Promise you advancement but give you bad evaluations so you can't move. What a terrible place to work. I was told I would never leave. Ha ha ha
bad,"On a typical work day you are pushed and stretched in so many different directions, when you get home your too tired to enjoy family.  You don't get two days off together, you don't feel like you have a day off."
bad,not to good to work for   I am not in no way afraid of hard work .. but Walmart treats it employees like they are robots not humans expects the impossible instead  expecting a good balance of employees who is willing to do a great job and loving to work there …….. employees os Walmart just work there cause its a job .. and you cant make it without working
bad,"Low pay for the work that is required in the backroom."
bad,"It was good for the time, but few people there get full time positions.  I didn't get the team feeling and felt like I had to watch my back most of the time. Worked in an area that exposed me to harmful chemicals on a daily basis.  Pay raises occured, but even though there for over a year I was still making a few cents more than the newest workers.  Most fringe benefits like evening and weekend pay  incentives were discontinued"
bad,"cut hours ,not enough to live on,managers dont help getting more hours,high turnover rates,expected to master a job after a few days., people often quit, very hostile managers who treat you bad and threaten you if you don't finish a job fast enough when there 's no reason to be finished by a certain time.  Was told the managers come in late often and change their time to avoid occurences.  Hr person removed several credits from a favorite person so they wouldn't get fired and the next week were promoted instead.  Hispanics protect and promote only other hispanics. Very hot in the store , you will sweat like a pig and they refuse to give even one small fan for a decent environment.  Was told there are people who brag about getting their occurences removed who should have been fired years ago."
bad,The management here was awful. My manager actually picked on me and threatened to fire me for actually coming to work and doing my job. I only had 30 mins of training before they made me work on my own.
bad,The manager was rude and liked to scream. Equipment was broken and never got fixed. Coworkers were amazing and hard working but we never got the acknowledgment deserved.
bad,Walmart is a good place to work if you are straight out of school or retired. But if you want to make a career out of it this is not the place to work. Management doesn’t appreciate their employees hard work and dedication.
bad,Alot of csms are just terrible always giving attitude and taking frustration out on cashiers.yelling at cashiers and barley was in sight or even around to help when needed
bad,"The work is not that hard, but management under staffs most departments. Many times I was the only one working in my department, and was still expected to finish the work normally meant for 4-5 associates. I took my first vacation after a year and 11 months and when i returned they tried firing me over attendance because they scheduled me while i was on my vacation. I had text messages from my manager saying he took them off. But there is a lot of gross misconduct and most managers were dilettantish."
bad,"Worked as a cashier for 2 years before switching to fashion merchandising. "
bad,Overnight stock sucks unorganized.  Managers click with certain people..fast paced...friendly co workers I had.. always had too much freight to fit the shelves
bad,Poor management. Unreal expectations of associates when they don’t give time to train new hires properly. Lack of proper equipment to perform your job correctly.
bad,"I was offered a position temporarily until a position I was more qualified for opened up. When a position opened up I was not allowed to transfer to that area. I enjoyed working with most of my coworkers,the work was fast paced,but my days off changed to often."
bad,Working there for me was awful. Management was hard to find if you found em at all. No rules applied. There was no training at all. Not too many even spoke English. Bathrooms were always soiled and the associates were rude.
bad,"literally for last resort other than that stay away. management was absolutely horrible. everybody is scared of them, it’s good to be good on management not scare your employees, if trash is on the floor pick it up even if a small paper make sure to pick up cuz they will fire you, not even joking."
bad,If you are looking for a company that could care less about their employees this is the company for you. The job itself was great. The management and other employees could care less to get along with others or actually complete their own jobs making it impossible to complete your own.
bad,Management lacks any kind of common sense. Corporate expects to much out of stores lots of work not enough people to accomplish it. Most extra benefits have been taken away. Since Mr& Mrs Walton passed on and the family took over it's been nothing but profit profit no concern for it's employees what so ever!!!!!!
bad,"too much drama, and many changes via corporate.  UNDER-STAFFING ABUNDANCE. Unless a second job and you don't mind soap operas an ill informed managers with huge attitudes that think they are better then all its a job for you"
bad,Managers didn’t have a clue. It suxed they picked favorites  people wasn’t friendly and we got robbed blind. Didn’t feel appreciated at all.  Hated personal they didn’t have a clue for sure
bad,"If you are fresh out of high school and you are looking for on the job training and how to deal with the outside world. This is the place to be, you will learn how to stock, clean, cashier, fold, etc."
bad,While the management might work with you a little bit the chances that youre going to pay the price for their mistakes is high. They are not very professional and the cons to working there outweighs the pros.
bad,"There were managers, many mangers, all telling you to do different things. Many of them mistreated me daily. I sucked it up and did my best. Dangerous working conditions persisted. I'll give you an example: One manager had to retrieve a shelf. These shelves were in the back room. You had to climb an enormous ladder and climb almost to the top to get them. It was very unsafe. He climbed the ladder and was taking down a shelf and it split his face open. I had similar incidents happen because shelves were stacked on top of each other and not inserted into the wall like they should've been. There was a skeleton crew, meaning you had to do the job of several people. I got hired for the Garden Center and I ended up working in every other department. Not a bad thing overall, but when there's not enough help, it's a very bad thing. They paid me $10.00 an hour which is a joke for how much profit they generate. Back to managers for a sec: There's Department Managers, Assistant Managers, Co-Managers, and the Store Manager. Oh yeah, and Support Managers. Why do you need that many managers? It's ridiculous. Some of the employees are cool. I met a lot of nice people. Most of the customers that come through were friendly, some were not, especially around the holidays. Being a cashier was a boring, unsatisfying job. Working in the Garden Center I routinely had to pick up grills that weighed a lot. Some of these had to be taken down with a pallet jack. It took so long to get someone to help. They didn't train us to use the thing! There was little career advancement possible unless you were ""friends"""
bad,Wal-mart has a very high turnover rate. I believe that this is because most of us that have worked/ work for the company do not feel welcome and appreciated. There is constant threat about numbers and being fired. There should be more constructive advice on how employees and management can create an environment where there is support for those that need it and a sense of team work.
bad,"Manager usually hates you, employees are lazy. If you have an issue with someone(management) good luck they all play favorites. They want someone they can control and run into the ground."
bad,"Been working at the company for four years and it is horrible. Management are bullies, there are days when there are literally no one on the GM side and they think that a random person can run those departments with having been trained. If they ask you to stay to help with coverage they end up forcing you to cut the time at the end of the week because no worked over hours"
bad,"Poor management! Always short staffed! They put you down when they think you’re not good enough for their expectations no matter how hard you work and what you did get accomplished! I was there for 2 1/2 years and was hoping to get moved up. But now they are taking some of those jobs away! And the pay is to low! With Wal-Mart being the richest retailer in the  whole world, there’s no reason why they can’t pay their employees better like other retail stores do!"
bad,"Pay was decent for when I was in school. You won’t hear anything from management unless there is a problem, they are not very involved with their employees."
bad,"I was seriously bullied by my management in the pharmacy and went to personnel and got bullied again by the same manager for going to somebody. I loved the patients, hated the management, I liked a couple of my coworkers, but some of them added in on the bullying. I don’t think all of Walmart was this way. I don’t mind the company, honestly, but I was in a horrible pharmacy with horrible people."
bad,The managers didn’t have their schedules together and made multiple mistakes on scheduling and over hired so had to cut multiple peoples hours and shifts
bad,"You are worked a minimum of 80 hours a week and when you try to have family time or even schedule a doctor's appointment you are told either come in or you will be held accountable for something that another manager is supposed to do. Store managers and up won't support you when you point out a problem they just expect you to make up for the lazy managers in the store and if you let up, you are the one that gets in trouble. The pay is decent at least."
bad,"This job is only for people who don't have a life (as in no family or school work). Any time I asked for a day off, it was never given to me. My manager would yell at her workers in front of customers. No one in my department felt the motivation to work because we were treated so poorly. I'm sure if I  were in a different department I would've enjoyed it more, however, I didn't get a say. There were (and still are) so desperate for workers that they place people anywhere. The process of being hired was weird because the lady pulled me randomly and told me to put in an application and then took me back to HR and I was hired. No interview. Had I not been in need, being as I'd just moved from another state, I wouldn't have stayed as long as I did or even gotten the job in the first place."
bad,"upper management always evolving, job security not there, associates are great people, customers are interesting, processes are not done never enough people"
bad,"Depending on where you are assigned and what kind of manager and co workers you have, it could be tough or fun. Overall, I would say that the management needs to improve their people skills and time management style so they can earn the loyalty of their staff. Some co workers are lazy too, and I don't understand why management keeps them considering that they put cameras every where."
bad,Walmart gives unrealistic expectations. You are normally overwhelmed with freight and a manager who offers no support. The turn over is so high in this company.
bad,Easy to get hired because of high turnover rate but be prepared to not be appreciated or treated fairly. Constantly changing the rules and procedures. Unrealistic timelines.
bad,"What can I say about the Walmart experience that no one else knows or has experienced? The management ranges from lazy to incompetent, there is zero drive within team members, and the overall ambiance of the place is melancholic. No one wants to work there and no one is ever excited about coming to work, but hey, it's a minimum wage job that will put ramen on the table for you."
bad,"If you are trying to make a career here then getting a business AA at least and trying to move up as fast as possible will help keep your sanity in check. Trying to move up through sheer experience will kill you. If you aren't, then what are you doing? Finish your certificate/degree and move on to your actual career already."
bad,Management was not very good. Work the hard working employees hard and the slackers get easy jobs. Management did not help with any problems o the job.
bad,"It’s rushed, not enough staff to get what needs done. No team players...your basically on your own. Work environment is unfavorable. One week your working 40 hours and the next your working 32 hours or less. The schedule is horrible."
bad,"Hard work, on your feet for hours, I felt very uncomfortable because out of thousands of workers u will only see about two or three African American I work in deli out of maybe twenty workers I was the only African American I had no support."
bad,I was hired as part time but made to work full time hours so I wasn't eligible for benefits when trying to transfer due to going to college i had no support from the management team at my walmart location. I wanted to continue working for the company but had to quit and am now starting over looking for work. The management was rude and made me feel uncomfortable when I tried to be moved to a different department I was bullied into staying in the position I was hired for. There is no room for growth
bad,I ended up having to go on FMLA. They fired me while on it. They fired me because I was unable to work while utilizing the FMLA act. It was an extremely stressful work environment.
bad,"Working at Walmart was actually really good in the very beginning, I’ve worked for the company for about a year and a half. I personally feel like the management in the store I worked in. No matter how hard you work nothing was good enough. I could make everything look perfect but there was still always management putting you down. I personally feel that the pay could’ve been a little better . But overall I’ve learned a lot working for the company."
bad,"To much drama, not enough support, no advancement, favoritism, bullying, etc only positive we’re a few people who made it bearable to come in. There attendance policy was horrible. Even when your hard working and go above and beyond for them they still fire you when you’ve run out of points and PPO. Even with doctors notes even with general surgeons. I liked what I did and the people I worked with  but there policies automatically set you up for failure."
bad,"I worked for the company for 4 years, through the time I worked my way to CS manager where I was continuously stressed out the hardest part for myself was the workload."
bad,Walmart is very intolerant of your home life. If something happens with your child you're expected to blow it off. Also they did not schedule me right
bad,"Walmart is a good job to have as a first job or a retirement job. Pay and #hours will not support a family."
bad,Management is really bad and doesn't communicate at all. Hours aren't bad. You never work in the area you are assigned to. You get blamed for not finishing even after you go over your time to leave for the day.
bad,I got let go around holiday season when I needed the paycheck the most all because of absent days that i had written excuse for and never got written up or a warning just left go the following day that I had to work ..
bad,"The position I had was very fun. Did not have a rotating schedule for weekend time off."
bad,At the beginning was excited to work there but after the years and seen management doesn’t care about you and does not help out it was disappointing to see
bad,It's not a horrible place to work if it's all you can find. The pay is better than other low skilled jobs but is still barely enough to stay afloat. Avoid at all costs.
bad,Management really needs to do better at treating their employees properly. They also should work better with school schedules. I started going back to school while working there and walmart made me feel like I had to pick between my education and my job.
bad,"I was excited to work at Walmart. The interview went great. I was given a job offer immediately after. I did have to wait about a month before orientation, which sucked. We basically put all the materials on the shelves and get the store ready by zoning grocery. Easy job right? No! The overnight shift can never keep anybody, which makes work on everyone else even harder. Manager have terrible attitudes and talk to you any kind of way. You can get fired for standing up for yourself, because the co manager and store manager will take your assistant manager’s side in a heartbeat. I’ve seen good people go b"
bad,"Let go because THEY felt I could no longer perform my job due to my disability, however they never had an issue until they hired their 7th Pharmacy manager in 6 years"
bad,I worked at Walmart in east Athens Georgia (Lexington highway) location & was terminated due to filling in for sporting goods section as women were not to work there. Yes I was part of that lawsuit that went absolutely NOWHERE! I would not suggest a job there simply bc the benefits are non existent & you get the same discounts using coupons from online & the hours are grueling & pay awful
bad,If you're good at multitasking then it would be to your advantage because you be shuffled in all different directions by different managers. If you're lucky and have a management team that knows how to schedule and work fairly with associates you will have a better job experience than those who work under management that does not care about their associates.
bad,"You get into a job that feeds you to the wolf's, and they pick on you on your first few weeks before you go to class and say why things are not done the way they say it should be, not putting into consideration that stuff that was left from previous management was already a mess and never was taken care of properly when in the time that this company looks for a new associate to take over that department. They make a class for you to learn the rules and still co-manager and store manager does not follow the rules within the class that Associates go to but set up their department managers to fail within their routine and point blame other than themselves to other associates as well as a point the blames to their assistant managers to eliminate the department manager for failure."
bad,I worked for this company for 5 years of my life but yet they failed to meet or exceed cost of the living raises.when I asked them to meet or exceed current job offer they said no we cannot meet or exceed this offer so I left this company. Because since I already understood they did not care about the person and family of the employee that worked for them. I left with a better job offer.
bad,Performing well on the job is very important and can pay off in the form of various opportunities from within the company and many other places too. So do well and you'll go far.
bad,"Wally is as Wally does. The store comes before family, direct quote from new store manager at #2795. I was told while in a group meeting before a shift: ""There are 3 people waiting for each of your jobs."" You are expected to do at LEAST three people's jobs. But, when the economy crashes, you'll have A JOB."
bad,Alot of good people working their it seams like they want hard workers to advance in the company however they make excuses as why they dont want to advance the good workers or pay the diffrental pay it pays to not work hard their as long as the management seems to think your working hard slackers get promoted easier then the ones that work hard and take charge so no i wouldn't recommend working at Wal-Mart
bad,"Lit tle chance of true advancement, management is very disrespectful and unprofessional,each year doing my time at walmart the paid days off and paid holidays were reduced under new guide lines."
bad,At first they were good to work for it fun to go to work people very friendly they helped each other as I worked it got so I didn't won't to work there anymore and one day it was time to move on. And that's what I did and I wasn't sorry I did it
bad,"Management was very unstable, consistent switching. If you enjoy a heavy work load while your team slacks off and watches you work, this is the place for you. Workers just walk around and barely work, and the managers allow them to do so because they play favoritism. There’s a lot of discrimination, and a lot harassment from the male associates as well. If you report it, more than likely nothing will be done about it, or you will be coached for filing a report. They’ll also have “security” watch and follow you around, and pretend to know nothing of it. Security follows the workers more than customers. If you liked to get yelled at on the floor by the Assistant Manager, this is also the place for you."
bad,"Where I started there the work culture was great but as the years passed it became stressful..pressure more work, less compensations and respect from management for associates."
bad,"All the veteran Walmart employees kinda gang up on you and haze you a lot, so you better watch ur back while you’re there. Management didn’t know what they were doing. They would try and delegate, but had no idea what needed to be done or even how to accomplish the assigned tasks if questions were to come up."
bad,This could be a nice place to work if they knew how to treat their employees with respect. They never would follow the availability that you were able to work. But over all tried to give you alot of hours
bad,"Walmart leadership is very bad because most off management person have no experience from other company so there behave, attitude and treat employees are very poor. Definitely all managers a abuse there power. They retaliate people always because of there low mentality and not enough educated. Walmart don't care and don't respect any religion and don't accept religious accommodation."
bad,"Walmart is a good company, but lately hours have been cut down to almost nothing. Full time people are getting part time hours, part time people are getting full time. Hard to provide for a family."
bad,As long as you do absolutely everything you are told and work like a machine without an independently working mind you will do just fine here. If you have any sense of individuality or have a life that requires some time away from work you may not find it ideal.
bad,"I've been screwed over a lot. Management is unreliable, you get pulled all over the store even when your not suppose leave your area. Late to breaks and lunches all the time. Staffing in my experience is very lacking its almost always bare bone staff with open shifts and refuse to hire anymore part time. They also dont allow raises expect for your yearly review and it's always a bare minimum increase. Only reason I'm currently at this store is because I need a job."
bad,Unless you have no other option I wouldn’t suggest Walmart as a place to make a career. I liked it for a while but I knew my time there was eventually coming to a close. I think it’s a nice jumping pad into something else but I personally didn’t like it there
bad,I would recommend a job at Walmart if you are young and single. Good place to work if you want to work every weekend and holiday. Also need to be able to follow many different directions at once.
bad,"I started with 40 hours and had a great manager for the first 3 months, then a new manager took over and cut my hours to 30 hours a week. I would be told on a Thursday that I had to work on a Saturday and if I didn't work it I would be fired."
bad,I do returns at the beginning of my shift. I know how to do inventory management of back room products ... The most enjoyable part of my job are the customers ..
bad,"I changed tires,fixed flats,rotating,mounting and balancing.I also changed batteries and light bulbs and wiper blades.We often worked spit-shifts and were constantly under-staffed and we never worked more than 35 hours a week so there were no benefits ,I also changed oil and filters."
bad,Hard to move up or change departments. Often work load was extremely heavy with pay that doesn't match. They will write you up if you get injured at work and breaks/lunches are late or never happened.
bad,"a typical work day is really long and stressful, sometimes I was an hour late for my lunch because everyone else needed their breaks before I could take my lunch, so I would get locked out of the register for being so late for lunch, which caused the front end to run slower because I couldn't get on a register."
bad,"No matter how good an associate worked, they would always be criticized or told to work harder. Associates that showed lesser initiative were expected less of than hard working associates."
bad,"In my experience at Walmart, there were too many managers telling level one employees conflicting information. We were often asked to do the exact opposite of previous manager had told us. The job in itself isn't difficult, but you will never be appreciated for hard work, so most employees do the bare minimum. Promotions are not at all about your performance but rather who likes you more in upper management. If upper management does not like you, you will be going nowhere. At the end of the day, you can work yourself to death like I often did but it just wasn't worth it. There was no raise, no promotion, no commendation. In fact you're more likely to be reported at Walmart than promoted, because management is basically just damage control and the departments run themselves. If someone says something about you to management, they do not verify these claims and very little supervision is actually done. The work is easy, the ever-changing beast of the management system is something I never want to deal with again."
bad,"nothing good to say other than i had a horrible experience. I actually fell while assisting a customer , although it was caught on camera, no one offered to pay my medical bills nor was  I  compensated. The entire  process was not explained to me efficiently enough to proceed with medical attention I needed and they expected me to go back to work the next day. hard taskmasters...that says it all. I pray for everyone that works there or ANY walmart."
bad,You have to like retail and people. Your hours need to be open and flexible to get hours. Have to be on your feet. There no sitting. It's a fast environment.
bad,"The issue arises when you have ""people"" in management roles striving to only make a bigger bonus for themselves they'll treat you like garbage especially the management team found at the Hallandale Beach Walmart in Florida literally verbally degrade and abuse you."
bad,"Within several months of working for this particular branch of the company, I was treated to insensitive and racist customers and told to simply ""smile and nod"" and to agree with whatever was said. At the first signs of refusal to do so, I was treated to intimidation by upper management and told that the clientele isn't the issue, but my attitude towards rude customers was the issue. I was told that I can't show any signs of anger, frustration, or sadness at work and that I'm not allowed to outwardly express any ""negative"" emotions or sentiments. I was scolded for talking about current events and lied to about my customer approval ratings as management told me that I was well received, before immediately telling me that nearly 45% of my customers were uncomfortable with me."
bad,"Ive worked in a few stores and while they have there differences, they are also so much the same. So stressful and not paid enough, i was there for 6 years and a newbie on his first day only makes $1 less than me"
bad,"Horrible, cruel to workers, they have no compassion for there workers, or customers. Management don't protect you when your being bullied by other mangers."
bad,management was super unorganized and lost never helped when under staffed the equipment used was super rusty and had broken wheels . permanent staff are super rude and never satisfied
bad,I was in middle management and it was nothing but a stressful time. Your manager would give you a lost of stuff to get done by cob then their boss would also give you a list to get done. You're constantly short staffed and overtime isnt allowed very often at all. You're constantly beat down by upper management no matter what you do and will never let you know if you're doing g ok.
bad,"I got a decent amount of hours while working at Wal-Mart for working the part time job. However they did not offer any overtime, when it came to working the holidays they switched me to a full time position so that they didn't have to pay any overtime. Mind you they didn't tell me about the change in the system. The management throughout the holiday seasons was really poor and made working through holidays really stressful and difficult."
bad,I worked in any different departments in the store I just wasn't given the opportunity to grow because I was older than  some of the workers.....Not fair....if you đon't have a family member or close  friend or kiss A#@...you not going to make it...if they don't like you ( no matter how much you are good in your work performance)...they will try to get rid of you
bad,Not a fan of management. They did nothing to help advancement. And when confronted about it refused compensation for work that they force upon associates.
bad,"-managers were always rude "
bad,The management is not the best. I was lectured in front of customers and I was not properly trained. You do not feel like you have support from coworkers. There was no teamwork.
bad,"Lack of communication  and lack of helping  each other achieve goals. "
bad,Walmart needs a major culture change. Working at Walmart is poor. The management is often lazy and this reflects on the behavior of the employees. Pay is often unfair.
bad,"The pay is okay. You never know what your hours are going to be like, One week you have almost 40 hours and the next they’ve cut you back. For the most part they were willing to work with your schedule. Upper management like assistants and up suck. seems like they were never on the same page. If they didn’t like you, you knew it. Personnel was so rude. Seemed like she just wanted to argue and if you weren’t someone she liked it was hard to get her to do her job and to look at things that only SHE CAN TAKE CARE OF.  Department managers and lower were usually pretty awesome."
bad,"Worked here about 4 years , yet back in the days it was awesome , but now everything was changed since february 2019, they cut off attendence points use to be 9 but now is 5 . also do not forget if you call 2 or 3 times your bonus gets cut .if you call 4 points you wont get bonus. I have been here with no evaluated at all and whether people starts new they get the same pay as you do which is unfair. They look at workers they favoritism at all the times. Supervisor depends who you have. Working here is just stressful and i would not recommend to work here ."
bad,"The only way I would recommend this place is if you have no other option. Pay is better than alot of other places around this area but it comes with a price, your sanity."
bad,The pay was the only good part.  Not only were my customers incompetent but a majority of my management team was too.  I constantly worked over my set availability which made my grades drop exponentially in school.  I dreaded every day of work due to the fact that I was constantly berated by customers and management for things that weren’t even my fault.
bad,"They want to demean at every turn.  Training is not to teach or help learn well, but like the world today, you read and hear a segment on a pc for 10-15 minutes, answer 5 questions.   Employee clicks a button to agree you’ve done the computer based training and they have what the company needs to say you’ve been trained.  They instruct new hires to sign new employee training forms at beginning of any mentor type training, (at bottom of page) which they’ll then say was  received, per signed document.  (They insist on it). Then they are on the new employee to get all the boxes completed.  Often without ever being introduced to a mentor. "
bad,I did not enjoy working at Walmart at all it was the first job I had ever had and I was very excited to start work when I first got here and after only a week I was ready to look for anoth ether job because of management they treat us employees horribly and I just cant take it anymore
bad,Very unprofessional. Management trying to hook up with employees that were subordinates. Management worked people like dogs and only wanted numbers. No flexible school schedule and Management were the biggest gossips. A boy literally died his first week at the job im not sure if t was health related but im pretty sure the conditions did not help. And on top of that how do you only get two 20 min breaks on a 13 hr shifts I can barely heat up food then.
bad,I feel I was treated unfairly I should’ve been fired for months ago accordingly to my manager but never did he fire me for months ago he decided to fire me five days ago absence they hit me for three occurrences for no call no show which I did call I helped out on the front end with the registers they docked me to half occurrences for clocking in early cannot believe it.
bad,They were not interested in good customer service they were only interested in herding people out as quickly as possible without answering their questions cross selling or even being personable. I met my scan rate for the store but they wanted more and more lacking customer service.
bad,"The best part about working there is helping the customers with whatever they need. The hardest part is that it is a very demanding job. I have learned a great deal about myself and my interactions with others while working at Walmart. A typical day there is coming in at 4 am in the morning and see if there is any live freight and complete putting it on the selves. Then go to the backroom and scan items and determine if they need to go to the sales floor. After creating a cart, run the cart to the floor and if the item really is not needed; adjust either the shelf cap or the quantity on the floor. "
bad,The atmosphere is stressful and low morale.  Lots of interaction with the general public and opportunities for various roles within the company but no job security.
bad,"I worked at a local Walmart Supercenter. It was very stressful, CSM's can be sitting around, while Cashiers are busy and have huge lines. There is a high turnover and Store Mgrs have changed twice when I was there for 2 years. This can tell you something!"
bad,"It was alright to woek there they just wouldnt give me the hours that i wanted. I went from being a cahier to self check. Was tired of working 2-11"
bad,Good pay but cut time on the orders so you have to slave to get ur bonus. They stay on top of you job threatening you but then dobt wanna fire anyone. Their reward for hard workers is more hardwork.
bad,"the company ,is a great place to work ,but the salary is too low ,"
bad,"a typical day at work was to be in at 7 am and clean up your areas to get ready for the business day. "
bad,"It is a place that will test your paitence everyday, but u have to always remember that the custoner is always right. It taught me retraint in my day to day life."
bad,"Upper management played favorites with lower management. Everyone from salaried to hourly part time gets over worked. You get told to maintain a work life balance, but get shamed by store manager for not being there constantly"
bad,"If you wanna screwup your sleep schedule, have your hours taken by people working on visa’s, have management disrespect your identity, diminish any sense of routine in your life, then Walmart is a great option."
bad,"Carga de trabajo y rotación de personal constante,con lo que se ve afectada la operación y sin apoyo de dirección o gerencia de zona. Ambiente laboral pesado, horas extra no pagadas y en ocasiones obligatorias por falta de apoyo."
bad,"Wal-mart pays well; when i was hired on they paid me around 10.00 an hour; now they pay a bit more. But depending on where you end up; it's unlikely that you're ever going to be able to use that money. "
bad,I worked for Walmart for 15 years and people just starting makes more than me. They also put people in a higher position that doesn't know anything about the store. I've never had a bad evaluation before until earlier this year and they say I did poorly. I was over 1/82 which is candy and items at the registers and cigarettes and b.c. batteries plus clip strips. But yet didn't have any help to work my stock as other dept manager did. I wouldn't go back for nothing.
bad,"The pro is the company is solid."
bad,"The pay for the job isn’t good enough you under pressure and over worked while  management act like they’re in high school and try to make your life  miserable like them. The benefits are decent  good 401k, they have stocks and life, vision, and dental."
bad,"It started out as a decent place of work, then management changed their attitudes. No employees enjoy working there. In the past week many have threatened to quit."
bad,No comment. No comment. No Comment. Would rather not say. Definitely would not recommend for a place of employment. If you can find something else than definitely pick something else.
bad,"it  was  once ,  15  years  ago   a  fun   vibrant   exciting  place to  work at .  now it  more   sales  business  oriented   and  not   sos  much caring about its   associates  anymore  taking  away  from  the   experiece"
bad,"Never Again. Don't do it. Maybe you have better management. I hope you do. Mine was deceitful and aloof."
bad,Very poor working conditions and unrealistic expectations for cart attendance in all possible weather you get as well as continuing short staffed in bad weather
bad,"I enjoyed the first store I worked at, but when I transferred my new store was a disaster. Management was poor and people did whatever they wanted, hurting those around them. It sucked."
bad,They breed contempt between the different shifts to try to use that as a motivator. Management is overworked there and people that would make good decisions start making personal decisions just so they can go home after a 16 hour day. Nothing really good to say here so if I don't have anything nice to say I just shouldn't say anything at all.
bad,"cut to many hours , and have promised you more ..Lay off, cut times ...find ways to get rid of the tenure , good employees  .they do not appreciate  the good employees"
bad,"Wal-mart is full of cliques. Divide and conquer is alive and well there. The management team is full of friends that hang out in and out of work with little to no integrity towards things like conflict of interest. If you're not friends with the management, you have little chance of joining management because they will feel like you're trying to compete with them and cause them problems. "
bad,It's good for a starting job. It's really stressful because of being understaffed. Management is getting better. Co-workers are amazing people. The job is not hard.
bad,"I worked there for almost 5 years, there were a few managers that were good but most had their heads up their butt. If you enjoy the High School mentality, you'll love working at walmart!"
bad,Top management assigns unrealistic goals and threatens lower management with being written up and extended work schedules if assignments are not met. Favortism and special perks are the norms for certain employees. There is no job-related training for new employees and they are written up for job performance when they do not perform to the standard instead of offering the much-needed training.
bad,"The management at walmart was terrible . Absolutely no communication between managers nor associates ."
bad,"E bom trabalhar, mas a empresa segue a cultura inernacional, isso acarreta o andamento da profissao, e as leis tambem internacional, prefiro segue as regras do brasil."
bad,The managers there were pretty judgmental and not the nicest when I first started.   Some of the employees were pretty nice but a lot of them were also very rude and inconsiderate. Especially the ones who have been there for a few years. They automatically judge you by your appearance and assume you cannot perform the tasks because of the way you look.
bad,Underpaid rude management no advancement as promised or bonuses hard work very stressful not much leadership blind following the blind unhelpful hr and upper management
bad,The only thing that is good about Walmart is that their pharmacists get a 30 min lunch break. Everything else sucks!! I worked there for 3 years and the upper managers were difficult to work with. They seem to want to advice people non-blacks over blacks.
bad,"I worked there for a week. I never wanted the job, and I got scared away when I heard how long people had been working there. They bragged about how they had worked for Walmart for either 18 or 20 years like it was something to be proud of, scared me straight."
bad,Very understaffed and very expecting of you to do extra work but will not approve overtime. Terrible management that cannot do their own jobs. Lazy workers that are very poor at their job as well.
bad,"Over worked they pretend they don't. Know what's going on but they know , if your over 30 don't have a chance to climb the latter good pay but your life is Walmart"
bad,"They are unorganized and fill with uneducated managers, literally, which by it being me cause a lot of problems for me. "
bad,"Horrible job culture, and morale it went from wonderful to horrible within a year and a half of opening. Directors and senior directors act like they have no clue. The center was brought to charlotte to house back office jobs from the store. All of those processes have sonce been automated, now the people that took over those jobs are hanging in limbo. Waart likes to keep people hanging on for Walmarts benefit and then drop bombshells on the entire building at one time. Yhey are now hiring for HR positions which they have now housed at the GBS center but omce they fully get it up and running it will be ahipped to Bentonville... If you decide to apply, use it as a short term stepping stone and be looking for other opportunities in the mean time, because GBS womt be in charlotte too much longer."
bad,"Most of the management staff treat you as though you are capable of doing a 1,000 things at once. They belittle and talk down to their employees and I absolutely do not care for that."
bad,"I work here for almost 8 years and I was not a perfect employee but I did work very hard and know most jobs with in the facility I worked in. there is a 50cent raise every 6 months for the first 3 years and quarterly bonuses. There is overtime near the end of the year during there busy season but the first few months of the year are shaky and random mandatory short days or days off that mess with your income."
bad,"Horrible hours and scheduling, poor management communication. Difficult customers and offensive customers. Not really a good overall experience while working there."
bad,"Empreso boa para adquirir experiencias, onde voce atua e pratica diversas areas dentro da loja."
bad,Honestly this job was amazing till I was targeted by the new manager and his underlings of favorites lost alot in my life over poor management and gossip about personal life
bad,"I worked at Walmart as an overnight stocker during the summer 7 years ago  and am hoping for the current employees’/prospective applicants’ sake that things have changed in the years since. Management was horrible and unprofessional and had no problem openly berating employees. One of our managers—the nicer of the two, if I’m being honest—abandoned his job in the middle of his shift without any warning. Most of the people I worked with were 40+ but they were very petty and immature and liked to gossip and backstab others. We all took breaks and lunches together and it was very depressing, as some employees couldn’t even afford to eat lunch. We were being paid $2.50 an hour less than the stock team at the competitor right down the street. The work itself wasn’t too hard. I worked mostly in the automotive department, which was incredibly quiet overnight, and I didn’t have to socialize much with anyone else because the department had its own ware room.  In fact, solitary work might have been the only upside to this job. Hopefully things are different now but from what I experienced, I don’t recommend it to anyone."
bad,"I worked in the tire lube dept for 6yrs and the ignorance and stupidity I encountered from management and customers was mind boggling.  I mean the problem is their policy of customer is always right, most of the time they outright lie to get free stuff and get you in trouble. I cant u.derstand the audacity of a so called pathetic retail manager that cant even do my job to try and tell me anything about what goes on in my dept."
bad,"Walmart as a whole is a pretty lousy place to work. I only recommend it if you are starved for work. Don't expect to get all your breaks and do expect to cut your lunches short. You can get promoted to management, but you will be basically forced to move if you do so."
bad,Management is poor and sits in the office playing on their phones. They won't help you with anything you need but bark orders when they need you. Customers scream at you for things that are your fault and not even related to your position. Once I had a lady scream at me because we didnt have vacuum cleaner bags in Electronics because a vacuum cleaner is an electronic. Overall bad place to work. Inconsistent hours. Different shift every day. Random days off. Sometimes work 6 to 7 days in a row because of how they split the work week on Saturday. Poor management. Lazy coworkers. Avoid this place. Pay is awful considering you do 3 managers jobs a day while they play on their phone.
bad,Walmart is one of the worse companies have ever worked for. They do not care about any of the employees. Of one em5killed another they would never know or care.
bad,This is not the place to work  the managers get high they sell weed to employees they half way do there job I hated working at the place that’s why I had to leave
bad,"Decent starting pay. New scheduling system makes it difficult for single parents. Very little training. LOTS of drama. Get in, find something better, get out. Management depends on the person and day. Associates are just cogs in the wheel. Keep your head low."
bad,"I enjoyed working with the people but the management was horrible! They pick and choose who they want to promote to other areas, it is definitely not based on your qualifications. Certain managers will do whatever they have to in order to fire you if they do not like you. They tell you to be honest and that you can go to them (management) with any issues and there will be no retaliation but there is always some form of it anyway."
bad,"New manager, hired too many cashiers. ""computer programmed"" schedule where MORE hours are given to new cashiers than old cashiers that have been here for awhile. Really inconsistent scheduling, some weeks you'll work 12 hours or 20 hours or 25 hours. You can never plan anything a month ahead as the schedule is out every 3 weeks."
bad,"This job is sometimes irritating and difficult to handle, most of the people on CAP 2 don't really care about their jobs and don't have the passion to perform. Some also like to compare their old jobs that have nothing to do with retail with CAP."
bad,"On a typical day, I work freight, am 100% responsible for the cleanliness of the department, perform section work, price changes, scan outs, order from a secondary to resist outages, set modulars, plan features, perform monthly inventories, create mark downs, guide an understaffed and undertrained team, appropriately handle interactions from customers and employees, respond to multiple calls by managers over a walkie talkie.  In the months that I've been employed, I've noticed that management does not seem to solve problems effectively.  My experience is that problems that can be easily solved are instead treated as if they are the associate's fault, used as retaliation, or swept under the rug.  Training on the job is terrible, but training at the academy is phenomenal.  Most associates are focused, self motivated, and have a lot of valuable input.  It's a shame that the upper management team does not properly recognize them for their efforts.  I learned many things, but my takeaway is that if you don't want to feel like a slave, don't work for this company."
bad,in my opinion it was a good starting job  management sucked had no care for personal problems. they say they are flexable with your hours but the minute you change your avalibility they cut your hours
bad,"not treated fairly or paid a decent wage. management doesnt resolve associate issues, and doesnt schedule according to actual store need or associate availabilty."
bad,Too much favoritism at work we cannot work overtime they're cutting hours so have to move out of my house now and I don't have nowhere to go because I'm not I'm not too much hours when I started I work 40 hours but now I'm North 2830 not that much hours so don't have to move out of my house and I don't have no house to live in
bad,"So walmarts a tricky sorta job. By no means is walmart hard, for the first couple weeks i was on first and didnt seem to mind it. After a while you just start to hate working there and you have no reason why. I asked a couple people about it have worked there in the past and they say the same thing. After a while i asked to get my shift changed to 2nd and i enjoyed that for a minute then again you get that feeling like you just hate working here even tho my job was very very easy."
bad,"Stressful environment with poor management, no hours to speak of yet they continue to hire more people to screw over with hours. Favoritism is a huge issue. Hours a shifts are extremely inconsistent."
bad,"Schedules are all done on paper and often don't get posted until the same week of the shifts. If you enjoy standing for hours on end, then this is a good job for you."
bad,i hated working at walmart. The managers were horrible beside maybe one or two. They really didn't care about the employees that worked there. They would always cut hours and then complain that no is there.
bad,Inconsistent work hours and job duties. They cross train employees to work in different departments without notice. They offer new job opportunities and promotions to employees first before hiring outside the company.
bad,The amount of work that is required as a CSM is unrealistic. Upper management puts a lot of their work off on the CSMs. I would not mind this if my pay was greater than two dollars over the cashiers. Management would often require you to work late but send you home early at the end of the week to avoid paying overtime.
bad,"Ok so starting off i know this does not apply to everyone who has or who will work here. That being said Walmart has been one of the worst jobs I've had. The management is poor and manipulative, Salaried Management continuously did not approve unpaid time off on times they said they would, or just left it pending until the week of the request no matter how far in advanced it was placed. Hourly management have a power complex and are generally terrible with few exceptions (again in my experience). Pay is decent depending on where you work but rarely enough to pay for basic expenses in the area lived in. As well the management does not work around your schedule for anything other than school (and even then they aren't to good with working around your school schedule) even though they market that they do. All in all with my experience there i wouldn't recommend it as a place to work unless you are desperate for a job"
bad,It's alot to handle the work is steady and busy at times. Short handed badly need more help to make things better work different shifts and ypu have to handle both departments deli amd bakery
bad,There are some good and bad things about this place. I didn’t like being stuck in the same area for a whole day because I like to be constantly doing something but also the way their management team works is by them choosing favorites and if you’re not a favorite they will not do a single thing you ask or even pay any attention to what you need.
bad,Working in cold harsh conditions when I ask to relocate or complain I was ignored. Couldn’t get a good working hours because of school then was asked to drop out.
bad,"Not all Walmart store operator the same. The one in Sumter, sc. is the one to stay away from. Only work at the store if you have no choice. Most of the employee is seeking other employment. Because of the management. They want you to do the job that they were hired for. Assistance manager and department manager; stand around talking with each other and on the phone. Then they have the sales associate do the price changes.set up modular, bin merchandise process claims. Find places for overstock merchandise on the sales floor. The management does not train you on how to do anything. The sales associate also will need to do their job; without any help. Because management does not schedule enough people to work."
bad,It's a very stressful workplace. They dont pay overtime at all and if you do get any then you would either take time off or come into work later the normal to get rid of it. They don't pay enough to really sustain a living
bad,"Single most stressful job I’ve ever had and I was on the bottom rung! The management team of Walmart is abysmal and if you’re not in their clique, you’re dispensable."
bad,"A typical day at work for me could vary radically depending upon my assigned task for the day. The degree of variation certainly was not a negative, however, and served to help round out my skill set as a supervisor. My duties could range from doing accounting work, to freight,to more specialized service roles and even minor repairs and troubleshooting with some equipment in the span of a single day. In retrospect I learned a great deal about planning and coordinating with others and on my own to make a better work environment for everyone. With regards to on the management above me, they do truly do their best with what they have. The trouble with what they have--and incidentally the hardest part of the job--was the overall lack of incentives and supplies to retain workers at the store. Coupled with poor leadership above the store level, these issues compounded to the point where the staffing would be so scarce that the work load would be highly stressful. That being said, I did truly enjoy working with many of the people around me and that sense of camaraderie will be missed. Another enjoyable aspect of the job was interacting with people in a way to help them in any capacity, sometimes even trading jokes and stories with people shopping when they were up for it. I suppose the most honest assessment I can give is that the people I worked with most closely at the store worked diligently in the face of some daunting circumstances and they were enjoyable to be around and work with; the experience was greatly soured by a less than stellar corporate vision and direction."
bad,Do not waste your time. I wasted 10 years with this company and they do not care what you have going on they will not work with you. It is all about the bottom line here.
bad,The goals are set too high so we no longer get an incentive. The work is hard and highly stressful. Would not recommend to anyone looking to breeze by. For the most part the environment is relaxed.
bad,"Walmart is honestly a horrible place to work unless you’re already wealthy and know higher ups in the building. The management is almost nonexistent to you  and anything  you ask or need help with will not be fixed or dealt with .. nepotism is very much alive there! "
bad,"Working from 10 pm to 7 am"
bad,"This review is only for one store REGION 5 store #2667 Dallas Texas"
bad,Don’t get sick or get sent home because you will be fired within a snap of a finger. I got sent home by my department manager for throwing up on the clock in the rash where people saw me and ended up getting fired because I didn’t stay my whole shift.
bad,"Things look hopeful at first, but it will only take an average person approximately one pay period to regret taking the warehouse job."
bad,"My overall experience with Wal-Mart was unpleasant. The workers would gossip about each other behind their backs, the managers would single people out and blame his mistakes on them. They messed with people's fixed schedules and ignore any concerns/feedback given from employees."
bad,Been here 5 long yrs. Don't work here unless you have to.Office politics is crucial.If your not good at that you will have difficult time. Hard work alone gets you nowhere except the lion share of the work. Look elsewhere.Life is to short.
bad,"I adored my actual work at Wal-Mart. And it paid pretty well. However, management routinely turned a blind eye to a specific worker who verbally assaulted other associates. When bringing this up to them, they told me simply to stay away from him and not listen to him. The issue with this is that on O/N Maintenance, we must work closely together. A friend of mine has informed me that this is continuing since I've quit the job. Management also demanded that O/N Maintenance also do all of the Stockman job description, meaning we had very little time for various special projects they also demanded we got done."
bad,"When you call in you are fired no matter what your problem is.( like been sick, or accident ). They using a protect pro only for 24jours if you have it .still getting point for that ."
bad,"The store is poorly ran, terribly managed and employees are very often misused and mistreated. Cheap place to work as they constantly take people from side of the store and put them in another as they refuse to hire more people, then get angry when you don't do your own job. If you're low level you just lose no matter what. Disgruntled customers are everywhere, some will try to get you in trouble for no reason. Co-workers are selfish and unhelpful yet they always expect you to help them. Forced to work despite injuries and call ins can only be excused with an expensive doctors note. Do not work for this corporation if you can avoid it."
bad,It’s not the best place to work in and I work at the Jupiter store. You can barely advance or move to departments that you are interested in and a lot of the managers are really rude.
bad,"A typical day working there was being pushed beyond physical limits to get as much carts inside as possible because the lack of people scheduled at a time. The management was terrible, they treated outside workers differently then inside workers, inside workers treated much better, outside workers were constantly pushed to do much harder work for less pay. When two people were supposed to be scheduled for both sides of the parking lot, they would only have 1 person outside for a couple hours sometimes. Not good. We would be rushed to push carts when the maximum amount of carts that you're supposed to push is 10, but they'd rush us so much we would have to push lines of 15-20+."
bad,Honestly working at Walmart has taught me to go beyond that and find a career where I’m comfortable. It has been a rough experience but I learned from it. Horrible management and pay.
bad,My store manager was rude and only spoke to certain employees. There was a lot of favoritism when it came to hours and who got approved for days requested off. They also don't accept doctor's notes which is insane.
bad,the work culture with other peers is great however managment is always at odds about how to handle customer complainsts and situations. very confusing. a lot of chiefs but not enough indians
bad,"Working at Walmart wasn’t all around bad , I made work easy and customers were always happy with there service the problem I had was with management , the choice of managers were very unprofessional and rude and always talked down to staff ."
bad,"If you don't know about how Walmart treats its people here is a short list. Unless you are in the friend zone with the manager you won't advance to higher positions, they are against unions And they have the highest turnover rate."
bad,Idk where I guys worked don’t sound like Walmart😂😂😂.... in. Wainwright the management is horrible they want u to work really hard and then when you do instead of saying good work today guys they say u could have done more. The worst place to work. Maybe if ur really young or older it’s okay but for anyone trying to raise a family or make any big payments it sucks. Glad I got out of their in under a year worst work I have ever experienced in my life. Getting yelled at all the time by customers for no reason then management belittling people left right and centre made our best guys quit because they couldn’t take it anymore after years of working their. If u have another job option take it!!!!!
bad,"Would not recommend working there, poor management an, poor customer base, plus they always change their rules , so you never know what to follow by.."
bad,"Turn over is high, management is a joke, they switch manager every few months, if a manager dis-likes you for any reason they will try to get you to quit before firing you. They are not supposed to tell others why you leave, but they do tell people many different stories of why you leave. They offer health insurance, but to full timers, but usually hire only part-time."
bad,"I love to provide customer service, when people come to you requesting help is important to think about the time and quality. Try to kip everything how I will like to find. Is important to respect every body."
bad,This is a great place for students who just need a part time job. This is a good place to start gaining  customer service skillsWould not recommend if you are looking for growth.
bad,"Aprendi muitas coisas em relação a mercados nessa empresa, porém o estresse em relação à gerência foi maior."
bad,Decent work environment poor management hard to find managers for customer service leave associates hanging as far as knowledge goes with discounts and product promotions
bad,The managers had the women lifting heavy items that they couldn't do and they will write you up if you didn't do the job they gave you Managers never help you with you job when it was hard for you to do
bad,"Really unorganized, I would clock in and find out i was closing by myself on my 2nd week when I barely knew how to do things."
bad,"I swear the management here doesn't want you to have a home life at all. It honestly sucks working here. They make you work 9 hour shifts and try to compensate you with telling you it's because you get an hour unpaid lunch break. I don't want an hour lunch break. There is such a lack of communication here it's not even funny. The management yells at you, the associate, for their mistakes and lack of communication."
bad,"Management and many employees at the store I was employed at were difficult to communicate and cooperate with. Workload was reasonable, but stressful."
bad,they offer good training but not much chance for real advancement. There are many people working here who have base knowledge that is not utilized. over all not a bad place to work.
bad,I worked at Walmart for 7 years.  I was asked to run 2 departments for no more pay . It was stressful and the management team was terrible. They wanted you to do alot of work for very little money .
bad,Management is awful they have no shame to give a student 30h/week. Salary is total bull compared to the work you have to provide. Shouldn't be minimum. Clients are the most entitled rude piece of trash They overwork you.
bad,My department manager was sexist and often displayed favoritism. No problem yelling at you in front of customers. Very unprofessional with a bad temper. Yelled at employees frequently.
bad,"Walmart is a great place to use, as a stepping stone, in order to gain experience, for a job or a career in the future, because it teaches you the basics."
bad,"The culture in Baxter, MN Walmart is very poor and clicky, if you are not in the click or drinking with the boss you are not in the click, favoritism is rampant, department managers converse many time daily in dead zone so the cameras do not see them, drink sodas and coffee on the sales floor and favoritism of what non company head wear is worn."
bad,"Not just because it was my first job out of high school, but it was definitely horrible. They use favoritism a lot and expect 10/10 but pay for 5/10. Don’t do it."
bad,Qorking at wal-mart was stressful because you never know if you would have a job or not and they are not very family oriented especially if you have kids
bad,"It is one of the worst places to work. Management is terrible, anyone that has power abuses it, and no one even remotely cares about you. Walmart slowly eats away at you."
bad,We only ever had 5 people to do floor and as people left the workload kept going up and we were promised more people and they never hired more and we were left with 3 people and no help at all.
bad,"Management is terrible, and you always have someone on your back, and it doesn’t matter if you’re just out of hospital or death in the family, you still have to report to work. Pay sucks!"
bad,"It was a good company but there were too many evil and angry managers that act like they hate people, I was a great employee, I came to work on time always, I rarely called out or missed shifts unless it was an close family died. Beside that I came to work did everything at the best of my abilities and I knew my job and was very knowledgeable at my position that I had the potential to and knowledge to advance to a supervisor or management role but people just like to say you don't know what you are doing so they can get more work out of you to send you in a early grave because they don't want to see you advance and grow. And manager were just manipulative to make you hate different races by the work they made you do and the treatment they had given. Job advancement were just for those that management favored the most because they just hated seeing particular individuals do better."
bad,"Can invest in stock"
bad,"Honestly I got my start in security there, but it has the worst employee and management engagement. If management did not like you. They found ways to fire you even though. Also if you were a not part of managements click than you had to do everyone else work. While they chit chat with the associates they like. "
bad,Always understaffed. Rude customers. Management doesn’t care about any employees. Part time associates move you our department and often get more hours than the full time associates which is just sad. Only pro is I get paid decently for what I do and my fellow associates are the best.
bad,"Good company to learn many workplace skills, however pay and workload just do not balance. its hard work, you train in many departments with no increased pay"
bad,"Graveyard shift clocks in and receive task with time-limits, lots of hard work with little help most nights. Night managers tried to keep spirits up by providing food at least once a week."
bad,Their rules and standards are not very reasonable. They didn’t flex around my school schedule and it’s always a power trip with the mangers. You have to plea for help for large assignments because you have to stop what you was doing to help a customer.
bad,"Great flexible hours for college/hs students. Management varies from store to store; I had great management at one store, transferred  to another and had the worst management ever."
bad,I like the interaction with the customers. I didn't mind doing the stalking it kept me busy. I was bothered that I never met my actual supervisor. and the complaint they said they had on me was false I couldn't take a check if the check reader wasn't working I never refused to take a check from any customer.
bad,As management you we're over work treated like you're nothing long hours stressful between holidays inventory you live in the company under appreciated.
bad,"Not enough training when promoted."
bad,"Told by management the we have enough man hours to complete all assigned tasks even though we don't.  Management doesn't communicate at all, they are suppose to teach new policies and ways of working the discipline if not followed but they discipline first and don't teach at all.  They pick their favorite workers to do as little as possible, plus the management has no knowledge on how to do any hard work and it takes forever to get assistants from management."
bad,"Depending on the positions available, there are some options on what you might do. There are different shifts available. The job can be somewhat stressful and overwhelming. Management should improve and they should offer more opportunities for growth within the company."
bad,"Been there many years and in the last few things have gone down hill quickly. Managment doesnt care about the people anymore, you basically a number producing a number and they make you feel very replaceable."
bad,It’s nice to work there until you get sick and they say you shouldn't have gotten sick or they have a problem and fire you instead of fixing it. It’s not bad but they really overplay the ‘we treat our employees wonderfully’ card.
bad,"Walmart used to be a family orientated company which cared about it's associates and helped them balance their work needs with family needs, now everyone is just an expendable number on a chart."
bad,"When I first hired in all was well. I really enjoyed my job. I was made full time and signed paperwork for it. It was nice to get plenty of hours around holidays. Then I was forced to sign papers again to be part time after holidays. It was very upsetting. My coworkers and I got along well except for the dept. manager. She treated us poorly, talked terrible about us behind our back, and acted like she was better than us.  There was also retaliation where our hours would get cut if we told upper management about issues which is what you are told to do. There ended up being so much childish drama from that manager that I finally quit. I got a job elsewhere."
bad,"on any given day you need to watch your back, you need to keep busy all the time or you will be sent home, the management does not care about the people who work under them they only care about themselves, you need to watch your back while at work, trying to please all of your bosses, most enjoyable part of my job was my customers that I dealt with when they came through my line"
bad,"This job is ridiculous, first off they treat you really well.  Then after being there for a while they start telling you work in different things you were not supposed to.  On top of that the managers there (except the main boss) treat you will complete disrespect and like total tool.  Then they tell you well if you don't like your job what are you going to do about it?  Then they tell you oh well you can advance and move up eventually.  Yeah when in like 5 year and ill make a whole  2 dollars more?  The stress level is not worth the money this place puts out.  On top of that the drama is the highest i have ever seen between all the employees."
bad,Company and executives have lot of promises they make and tend to under deliver due to budget restriction in every aspect. It definitely avoid this place to work if you are not in a corporate executive.
bad,You do not get paid enough at Walmart to be able to raise a family and when I joined the tle area of the store I made the same amount of money as someone that had worked there for 8 years which is ridiculous
bad,As an assistant manager at Walmart expect to work 50-60 hours per week during non-holiday times. During the holidays expect to work 70-80 hours per week. Position is salary so you are expected to do a lot with little return. Job is stressful and cutthroat. Pay is low for retail industry. Benefits are decent - not great.
bad,Wouldnt go there if i was a young mechanic you will never learn anything. Training was minimum manager's scrached each other's back to cover for each other and would through you under the bus at the drop of a hat.
bad,"no comments work over nights for most of my time at Walmart , Their Refuse to take you off  nights especially if your a great worker and getting the job down."
bad,"Customers are the craziest attitudes you will ever see.  You will see some serious customers that just make you wonder if your really seeing this. Management is not at all professional. WAY TOO UNDER STAFFED. People always calling off, but yet they don’t offer OT at all.  My very first day, l was hired for the Deli dept and the trainer called off and so when I entered to do my job , there wasn’t anyone to train me and there was 3 people waiting in line to be helped and l was the only one in my dept.  l should have ran out the door. That should have been an eye opener for me.  Everyday there are so many call offs and that is seriously why Walmart has the EXTREMELY LONG LINES when you want to pay for a milk and you have to wait more than 20 minutes."
bad,"bosses are terrible and play favorites. The pay is okay but not when you factor insurance and everything else that comes out of your pay check and for how much you pay into the company insurance you dont get any benefits really. you still pay a ton of out of pocket. you might as well not have their insurance at all. you your spouse or another member in your household has insurance and your on there plan and you dont care to advance anywhere in this career then it might not be a bad gig for a little while but if you want a career, dont go to walmart."
bad,"The workplace experience I had working for Walmart, was both a bland, and stressful environment for me. The location I worked at had far too many managers and not enough employees. Some of the managers also had little knowledge of the areas they were supervising or even possible legal consequences they could ensue from poor choices they make. With only exception going towards the manager directly overseeing my department."
bad,"The company as a whole was a tight knit corporate environment."
bad,"Always understaffed, terrible management, bad hours, bad inventory management, hard to be acknowledged for good work, lots of micro management. just bad overall."
bad,"A typical day at Walmart  is helping customers to find items and working the cash register. But either way you deal with angry people who want everything to be perfect and the moment they can't find something or a price is not what they expect, you have to hear all kinds of mess come out of their mouths. Being nice to people like that is tough, and holding in what you want to say back to them results in a lot of internal stress."
bad,"They will work you 40 hours a week, but classify you as PT so they don't have to give you benefits. Arguing with management to classify me as a FT employee was on deadened ears and shoved aside and never addresses"
bad,The other employees very friendly hard-working management not the greatest a lot of miscommunication between the management and the associates. Would recommend Walmart younger people looking for their first job or older person.
bad,Stressful work place full of unfulfilled promises. Management is not doing what they were supposed to do. It took forever to get into contact with HR. They are not open to new ideas very bad workplace WOULD NOT RECOMMEND
bad,"Empresa muito boa para trabalhar, onde os funcionários possuem todos benefícios"
bad,Just ain’t worth it it’s so stressful idk where to begin! Management is horrible they walk around all day giving orders but talking and texting on their phones
bad,"You get on, get trained. Everything is swell. You have a lot of rules to keep in mind and know so that you don't break any one of them. Lately it's someone does something wrong, they will make a rule for that. Someone misses the chair that you can sit on while waiting for a battery change. The action taken is to take away that chair. A logistics store with no logistics. Management is not very good. They do not provide a good moral for the company. There is no appreciation for the work we do. It's the things that are done differently or incorrectly that are pointed out. It feels like they are finding ways to fire you. The most enjoyable part of the job is if you find some co-worker that you become friends with, make it bearable to work there."
bad,Management would not care for employees alot of harassment occurs in walmart. Negative environment forgot to pay me my pay cheque and still haven't resolved it.
bad,"collect customers orders from different parts of the store and take it to their car at their time of arrival. Listen to a meeting about always asking for surveys and using stop watches for how long it takes and recording it on a thank you card. Our mangers would tell us more of how we are doing the job wrong, instead of giving us a way to fix it. They compare us to other associates who do the job better and tell us to follow their example."
bad,"While I do enjoy a fast paced work environment, there is little to no structure while working here. The management is almost non existent  so you will have to depend on your fellow workers to have your back."
bad,"There are many employees the work at Walmart Logistics. And makes it virtually impossible to advance your skills. Walmart Logistics uses the ideology of 'first come first serve'. many employees have been there for more than twenty years, so no matter what skills you may possess, it's highly unlikely you'll receive a promotion, or even move to a different area within the warehouse. The pay is not bad, but working 10 hours a day (for four days) doesn't seem worth it when dealing with so many people and so much noise."
bad,"Managers were very unorganized, very unprofessional and often yelled at employees. didn't treat people fairy. Definitely not a family oriented place. Store Manager only cares about the money you can save him, NOT the quality of environment you work in. only plus side is they HAVE to give you your scheduled lunch break"
bad,"they require way to much for way to little pay"
bad,Long term associates don’t get treated or appreciated.  Cost of living goes up everyone should get a cost of living increase but it doesn’t happen. People that are just starting out or a few years in make what long term associates make.
bad,"For the first few months it was pretty good, towards the end of my time there was a new manager. He was very egotistical, wanted to be the “top dog”, would try to fire the ones who thought would not kiss up to him. Threatened to fire me during my two week notice. Absolutely no overtime, unless the store manager approved which was only during christmas for a week. If you did have overtime you had to “adjust” your schedule or they would do it for you without your acknowledgement, which means they would take out your overworked hours in the time adjustment app. Asked to move my schedule to mornings, they started scheduling me to closing, only given 33 hours or less which didnt help financially."
bad,"When I first got a part-time job at Wal-Mart in February of 2018, I went in expecting at some point to be made a full time employee. I was told that this was the standard for nearly all part-time employees, Indeed having my starting salary at $11.00 was a plus."
bad,"You either work the time they want or you lose your job. You will be punished for taking time off or calling out. The people you work with are the best part of this job, depending on your shift."
bad,"The process was constantly micromanaged from month to month, and any problems in these processes were blamed on employees. Management frequently would single out people they wanted to get rid of and try and find ways to get them to quit, or nitpick their work until they had reason to fire them. There was once a round of hires that were brought on as part time, but were terminated as holiday workers with out being told this was the case before hand."
bad,Management picked favorites. If you didn’t suck up to them they would threaten to demote you. If you state your opinion and one of the managers don’t like it they will make someone get on to you.
bad,Check in vendors.  Make sure bills are correct.  Can have many vendors show up at the same time. Management rarely helped.  Sometimes things get  stressful if errors occure ..
bad,"While i worked there, i was in high school. Was told by management when i was very sick that i needed to stop going to school so i could focus on work. Turned in my 2 weeks that day"
bad,"It is not the best job in the world, but if you need to have your bills paid, it is understandable. Personally, it is very stressful and if you are not prepared to stay in your same position for years, then this is not your place."
bad,"Very poor management,  many complaints about the management. Too many people don't want to come in,  but they still have their job,  got hiring managers,  hiring only relatives,  the employees that do come in,  whether on the schedule or being called in to come when someone don't shows up,  Management is very sneaky. They have lost a lot of good employees because they don't like them... Management is too young or not professional."
bad,"It's fine if you don't intend to talk to management much but ""family oriented"" as they claim isn't true at all. They say things like that to get you through the door. Certain managers at the Neighborhood Market near Meadowlark have such horrible attitudes and it makes you feel like you can't talk to them or ask questions. When I first started my shift, one of the managers looked me up and down without introducing herself and I had to ask other employees who she was. Certain managers will tell you what to do late (if you're new) then expect you to do it on THEIR time despite being new instead of letting you get acclimated to the aisles. Walmart could be amazing if management was friendly and accepting, not stand off-ish, unwelcoming and weird."
bad,Walmart culture is they want to take care of associates but they do not do that. Walmart management will lie on you to get you fired and the investigations that associates are supposed to have to counter those things are a joke. They are investigated by the HR reps that the store manager has known for years and are friends with.
bad,Treated you like an object rather than a person.   Furthermore reaching max compensation left little room for motivation or growth.  Looming job eliminations were always around.
bad,Was totally different company to work for 6-7 years ago. Culture has gone down so much. Not allowed to run our own stores without constant oversight. Not everyone held to same standard.
bad,"No equipment to properly do the job. Sometimes I "
bad,"This has to be the worst place I have ever worked. The management play favorites. Even if you have the knowledge to be a manager they won't promote you unless kiss up. They don't accept doctors excuses. So if you need the time off for medical related issues you better forget it. I have gout and needed to go home because I couldn't put pressure on my foot without falling over and I was told by an assistant manager that she couldn't do anything for me. I witnessed an older coworker fall over because they had these giant clothing racks in the back room that took up so much space and blocked the entrance to the back room. Only then did they replace the racks with smaller ones with yellow tape on them so people could see. I was harrassed by management on a daily basis. Even though I was one of the harder workers in the place. You don't work in just one place either you are forced to be crossed trained in every Department. I was a sporting goods associate and I knew how to do anything except fresh side(grocery). I know what you're thinking that's a positive thing makes you more valuable...not the case they expect more out of you and if you don't get all your work done you get ""coached"" disciplined. Even though they call you up to run register all night. Oh yeah you will be register trained unless you speak very little English then they don't bother you. I have heard every single manager use vulgar sexist language. I have heard them put down employees. If you have an issue with a customer you better forget calling a manager because they will ignore your call. You will never get any"
bad,"Breaks are often skipped unless asked for or they're given to soon. Most managers known as CSM's are not trained correctly. Most cashier's are more advanced than they are. Hours are scheduled randomly by a computer unless you ask for specific time lines. Medical health insurance is not given if you work less than 40 hours. Time off must be asked for 3 weeks in advance or it's declined. Your are not allowed to wear a coat if your cold. Temperature issues in the store often. Freezing in the winter and way too hot in the summer.  Must work holidays, penalized if you do not."
bad,Walmart does not seem to worry about their store level management having a decent work life balance. Managers are continually reminded that they should remember that everyone is watching.
bad,Maganment beats around the bush I wouldn’t recommend working at Walmart for anybody! Same as corporate they do the same when it comes to getting any help
bad,"Employees are treated very poorly. If a manager has you stay past your scheduled hours you will be required to take a longer lunch or leave early the next day to keep you from earning any overtime pay. If you are sick or injured and bring in a doctors note, they do not care, the missing days are still counted against you. Your note means nothing. The pay rate differs with each job title and the pay across the board is poor ."
bad,One of the worst companies I have ever worked for my life. Could not keep cashier's or anybody on the floor never had enough registers open. Management sucked.
bad,"Great place at first but the longer your there the more you find out it’s not worth stressing over. Management has favorites, you have to kiss butt to move up. Way too much drama and gossip between everyone."
bad,"i honestly loved this job i left and never came back only because of 1 manager that rushed me , i was the only one doing maintenance even tho there were 3 hires 1 was always MIA and the other was always on a floor scrubber and i was working my butt off to get all the sweeping done for the whole store i eventually got so worn out that i just never went back from getting yelled at singled out and over worked and working 40 hours on a part time job every week with no benefits was horrid if that one manager wasnt there i would probably still be employed"
bad,"There is no consistent policies within the organization, they are changed based on the individual and there is lots of favoritism within the organization."
bad,It's a job and it's what you make it. I can tell you the management is what makes wal-mart employees job difficult. Along with the new scheduling system. You will be schedule until 11 pm or later and have to be to work at 7 am. As a  part time employee you will be worked up to and sometimes over 40 hours and no there is no work life balance.
bad,"Very poor management.  Company only cares about themselves and does not care about the employee.  Not worth the stress they put on their employees.  They implement changes with zero training provided, allow good employees to leave while keeping employees who do not contribute to the team.  Company keeps taking away advancement opportunities."
bad,"I have been gone for 11 years, But being back in the stores as a merchandiser has let me see the inner workings again."
bad,even though I can say I learned a lot when working for Walmart I can also say that I had a hard time working for them as well. some of the people I worked for were wonderful but the management team were not very kind nor helpful when needed.
bad,"Doesn't matter if you're the best or the worst in the entire store, someone will talk down to you and find something wrong with what you do. They also dont hire based on skill or experience. Moving up in management doesn't get you much of a raise unless you become salaried."
bad,"This company doesn't give great benefits at all and will never, in my opinion. As long as we continue to give this place power it will continue keep its workers under their foot."
bad,"Although appreciate being hired there, I do not recommend working there. It might just be my store but I was very unhappy working there. They never looked at my schedule that I would put in because I was in school so I would have to call out."
bad,"Walmart is repetitive and mundane. Everyday was the same, get chewed out by customers and management. No help from coworkers because everyone else was looking out for themselves."
bad,The culture and environment were toxic. It was draining going into work every day knowing you were going to have to pick up the slack for a lazy CSM. CSMs and the Store Manager did not care about employee well-being at all.
bad,The job was good when throughout the first month or two but the hours were lacking and produce small checks due to lack of hours and I feel that management does not do enough to keep their workers in the store working.
bad,"""Walmart policy"" is a phrase management likes to use when it's best for them. But never follow it. Store managers will be little associates and create a very stressful and watch your back kind of work environment. Unless you are one of the few who can do no wrong according to management, but are always doing something wrong."
bad,In the beginning I thoroughly enjoyed working there but as they required you do more but didn't compansate.  You would do a job but asked to get the title get rejected
bad,Do not get swallowed up into this company. It is quick sand and cut throat. Management does not appreciate associates and the mangement team Never looks out for others.
bad,Walmart is a fun and easy place to work at. On the down side their scheduling process is terrible. On multiple occasions I was scheduled for days off but fond out later that I was supposed to work that particular day. Also due to their company policy you can't receive insurance until you work there for a year.
bad,"Walmart can be a very busy place to wrok. I learned how to be patient with customers and assist them with their needs. The management is poor, They don't really care about the employees concern. Everytime I ask to go to be trained or transfer to a new department they turn me down."
bad,"I worked @ walamrt for 2 1/2 years the Managme t is literally terrible !!! The job it’s self is fine and alright but the management terrible they scheduled me on an unavailable day , & then Made me work 2/3 more days then fired me for it ! When the day wasn’t in my avalibilty ! Then kept other cashiers this Walmart had a lot of favoritism ! & i guess i just wasn’t anybody’s favorite ! But i don’t reccommend anyone working here you will be treated like your nothing"
bad,Nobody communicates manager or team members or anybody they don’t teach you anything they just expect you know even if you’re new and have never done any of that before just a really bad experience
bad,None of the managers talk to each other about other employees mistakes very stressful cause spose to work as a team and they work against each other very confusing when 3 people tell you different ways to do something and the managers don't take the time to show you the correct way
bad,they throw you on the floor and register with no training. never get requested days off. once you finally do learn everything correctly you will have to work every day if employees are short.
bad,Walmart expects loyalty from their associates but has none to their associates.  I was there 6 years and during that time they performed 2 across the board raises and each time the associates that had been there for years ended up making the same amount or in some cases less than those coming in off the street.
bad,C'était mon premier emploi. Ça s'est mal terminé pour des restrictions de transports et des problemes de santé
bad,"Management was horrrible would contradicte what we were told to tell the customer what was policy for us didnt apply to management. Management was very favorable to other associates with paid time off but denied most of us even if we put it in months ahead of time. Management was lazy when we needed to assist a customer by opening a security room door that would take nearly 20+ mins to open so we could help the customer when they were sitting in the office about 20ft away. Forced to work with the flu because it would ""count against us"" if we didnt with a doctors excuse from the emergency room."
bad,"Walmart is cool as far as the coworkers but advancement is purely favoritism based, not talent based and hours are all over the placed, no set schedule"
bad,"It was a total disaster, whenever i would ask for time off it was given with clenched teeth and a passive aggressive tone, I was constantly mocked for my mental disabilities by staff, and not to mention that I felt very unappreciated at the job."
bad,"The managers from regional and so forth expect too much from us Mantaince workers and the managers could care less about what we do as long as they get to go home in time. They sit there and moan and complain that we dont get enough done but turn around and make us do 10 different jobs that weren't aren't suppose to be doing."
bad,"Overall sucks. Worst, most wasted, years of my life. Very few work with you. Seems like all management is working against the employees. There is also a boatload of favoritism. It's sickening working here"
bad,"Walmart is a good company, But they want to push here good workers more and more. You end up spending more time at work then with your own family....."
bad,"This walmart in particular is absolutely horrible. Managment has no idea how to manage, the schedule is made by a computer system that is horrible and has already failed at Sam's Club, and they couldn't staff properly for CHRISTMAS. Produce is a horrible place to work, stay away from Kathy M, she is the most incompetent manager I've ever worked under and I've had a lot of jobs under several types of managers. I had to close by myself after only a month on the job, something that takes two or three people to finish on time. It was always understaffed, there were very few days the whole day was staffed well."
bad,"when i began my career with Walmart i was taught to merchandise and run my department to the smallest detail like it was my own business. under the newest ceo we are micromanaged to the smallest detail and not allowed to make any decisions for ourselves. respect for the individual is dead, along with any opportunities to learn and grow."
bad,"I arrive, check in on both my department and see what the plan is for the day. If i have enough people to cover my areas. If I don't I take action and open the deli or bakery myself with the help of another dept. manager. If I do, I start by cleaning, fill the salesfloor and any hot spots in my area, order what my areas need, start my section work and price changes."
bad,"The place has its good and its bad attributes. The managers are very unprofessional and unorganized. They want respect but do not lead by example. This makes for a very unpleasant working environment. Employees are unappreciated, underpaid and overworked most of the time. It is quite sad. However, the job itself was pleasant and most of the co-workers were as well."
bad,"Its definitely not a place to make a lot of money,but could be a fun place to work at if you need to do something through out the day and if you need some sort of fun schedule everyday."
bad,Not  all Walmarts are bad but majority of them are full of favoritism. The hours are cut and you a don't always have coverage for multiple departments.
bad,Working for Walmart for me was a mistake. Management and coworkers are rude and don’t care. And training is not done how it’s supposed to be done. Just poor work environment.
bad,"They never helped anyone with anything. I was never given a fair chance to improve.All Management did was go hide and it was always hard to find them and they never helped customers they were always put off on associates. its a shame that most customers had to wait almost an hour to wait for management. i have went in with flu symptoms.   "
bad,"Management in Leland was rude. Giving D.Days when associate was only there for a short time, taking a past,. over a year at other location infraction, and turning it into a suspention. very rude"
bad,"I was only part time, but they worked me as if I was full time. They made me work in another department that I knew nothing about. They made me stock. They got mad because I was working slow, they didn't give me details of what I was supposed to do. I was lost when they sent me out there like that. I tried asking questions but the CSM was busy. No other workers were in my area."
bad,"Walmart at the time was OK, but than employees bend the rules to much for a person like me, i follow the rules.  i'ts hard to work in an environment of this."
bad,"This is a very busy store.  Customers are plenteous and lines can be long due to customers shopping for everything from groceries to televisions, you name it.  The workplace culture is pretty friendly.  The hardest part of the job is standing all day (you look forward to the breaks) and the most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction between myself and customers.  I've met some really nice people. A good place to work temporarily while you pursue other goals and objectives."
bad,Worked sporting goods selling guns and sporting merchandise. Transferred to another store to be near my mother. They had me take over the backroom inventory.
bad,"I worked at a dead end walmart in a small town, it was all career employees who had given up on life years prior, including management. Would not recommend as a career, but decent if you need a quick job."
bad,"Typically the day for a Cap Team 2 member starts the second you clock in. Once in the stock room there is a meeting with managers and supervisors with the team. Expectations are discussed, as usual, and any new business. Productivity is pushed excessively. A 15 minute break after 2 hours. Lunch is 2 hours later. And the last 15 minute break is 2 hours later, or 2 hours before clocking out."
bad,"fast paced , high demands at times I learned how to be assertive in what I wanted and what I needed became a great team leader thanks to them and I did enjoy the job but am looking for a career"
bad,"I worked here for 2 years and was crosstrained quite quickly. I was moved to the service desk within a month or 2 of being there but was never compensated correctly. When asking for a permanent position at the SD I was told No so when I asked for a slight raise instead I was told that it wasnt possible. I had been working there a year and a half and new hires were walking in the door making 20 cents less than i did with 1/8 of the training I had accumulated. "
bad,I worked here for a small period of time. I became sick with pneumonia and missed too many days being in the hospital. I was promptly fired with minimal explanation.
bad,No had bad experince laid off. I.was let go .they didnt want to give me a chance.they where mean to me.i worked linening clothes fitting rooms atten customers need.
bad,Wal-Mart hires part time employees but at the time I was hired I was hired and moved up to management very quickly. Wal-Wart does over work the management and does not consider family's. When dealing with a sick a child was denied vacation time and told by store management that to choose between my job or my child.
bad,"I have invested over 10 years in the company. The company focuses more on the ""bad"" employees that those that are actually doing the right thing and being productive. The company seems to be more invested in making production at all costs and focuses less importance on employee retention. 15 managers have come and gone in the time I have been employed with Walmart which further makes it even more difficult to be engaged in the workplace."
bad,"I liked Walmart at first, but than the façade broke down and it became stressful without the worth. There was no opportunity to move up in my cashier position."
bad,Walmart is cutting most full-time jobs in Kearney. In the past year they have treated the employees as an unwanted expense. It seems like they want to be so much like Amazon that they are willing to abuse their employees to get there.
bad,it was a great environment at first but management started to change and not care about and lie to associates. The hours and work life balance sucked.
bad,Many locations lack competent management.  Employees mostly at same pay scale.  No pay increases provided for competent and productive employees.  Often management does not desire valued input from employees.
bad,"I started working as full time, I was then move to part time and then I was given less than ten hours a week with only ten dollars per hour. I then had to move out of my apartment and move in with old friends. I then had to borrow money to work there so I had to quit. I was basically forced to quit."
bad,"Very cut throat, they say there is no seniority,  but that isn't true. There is so much favoritism.  There are some good managers, but the bad ones out way the good. Would never work there again, given the opportunity."
bad,I was a part time but I worked full time hours.  My boss was disrespectful to when I asked her to change my hours from  noon to mornings. And she never wanted to help anyone when they needed help.
bad,"I worked here for 9 months and I met plenty of wonderful people, but I had many experiences with very rude guests who did not care about what was said to them. The systems also didn't help in making things easier and most guests got frustrated and angry with us about this issue. Corporate didn't seem to be really helpful either and the managers would not be happy if corporate got called or was involved in any situation with guests."
bad,Highly unreasonable production expectations and poor training. Advancement at this company is more predicted by how good of a relationship you maintain with management and not by performance
bad,"During meeting management would say things, such as; ""if someone is struggling with a job, it's ok to help them"", but when that situation occurs they would say; ""he can handle that on his own. Also, different managers would tell you 2 different things to do at the same time."
bad,Hrs were good felt like they getting over with the pay though. My check didn't add up to hrs I was getting. If managers were on job I would think about re reapplying.
bad,"Management is always horrible and always changing their minds. My job is great and laid back but not worth it in the end at Walmart. They treat you like you are nothing and ever since my significant other started working there, management made my life a lot harder and they refuse to move me even though I had a yearly review and failed it 2 months into employment."
bad,"The Store that I was working in walmart has favorites, people who are not qualified to do it and advancement is not an option if you are not the favorite. Managers are always asking others to stop what there doing and fix their department, and will not tell the official manager of using the employee and the getting reprimanded for not staying in there department"
bad,"Good as a starting position but not long term. Management did not care. Multiple people were fired for instances that were outside of their control (family, illness, etc.) Not a good company"
bad,"Met nice people there, made good friends that is still in contact with. Benefits are good like dental, 401k and the stock purchase. And bonuses are good, not always fair but good."
bad,"Walmart is only a good job for ages 18-20. It’s high stress, and not very nice to the employees. It’s good point is it teaches hard work and an attempted team effort."
bad,You got to meet a diverse group of people working as a cashier. sometimes was hard to find a floor manager to assist if a problem occurred or a customer needed a word.
bad,"I feel compensation is not horrible but unfortunately the hours and management are, Walmart used to be a family store and no longer is, family is no longer important."
bad,"Walmart was a good job for a high school student.  It gave me experience when no where else would hire. Met some cool people but that was it. Job was messy, management was disorganized and rude. Pay was poor for the work they expected. Vision center was better than other departments but still bad all around."
bad,"uma empresa boa com boas oportunidades de crescimento , dava chance de crescimentos para as pessoas, uma gestão muito boa"
bad,Management is poor here!     Everyone has their favorites!     Rare position advancement!     Promise after promise but they never fulfill wishes.   ...
bad,Quality of the work environment has been steadily declining.  No recogition of a good job & mandatory ot for everyone.  Difficult to juggle family & work.  After being with the company for 20 years it is sad to say it is time to leave.  It definitely isn't the company I started out with or the one Sam Walton built.  Associate engagement is non-existent & it's all about the bottom line.  Many long term associates are finding opportunities elsewhere.  Best part of the job are the people I work with on a daily basis.  Some of the hardest workers & best people I know.  Made some lifelong friends.
bad,"Not a good place to work very poor management. Dirty place to work. Hours very"
bad,"As a manager I worked 50+ hours a week, had set goals to meet, had a semi-flexible schedule, vacation time depends on years of work with the company, advancement is possible."
bad,"Walmart is a good place to work at. However, the management system is a little poor which they need to improve. They would hire a lot of people but would never treat everyone equally!"
bad,"Pays great, jobs easy however it's a horrible place to work. Management is horrible, don't listen to their employees at all, direct work with your boss is fine."
bad,"Poor management, staff members bully each other and nothing is done about it. Hours get cut and they just let people go.Too much work for a low pay. depressing."
bad,"My immediate coworkers are what make being there tolerable.People treat the store like a dump, trashing the place and stealing like crazy."
bad,The was ok to work with but advancement was not easy they don’t tell you if you got the job or not then they stated cutting your hours it was terrible and how do they expect you to pay your bills if you don’t get any hours and management doesn’t care
bad,The whole culture at Walmart was one that was not advantageous or even enjoyable for the employees. That type of atmosphere is not a good one to work in.
bad,"Company has great beliefs and depending upon your geographical location, is a great company to work for. Company is very misleading and policies are not enforced."
bad,"Year by year the policies become more strict and they ask more from you, but do not compensate in any way. Holiday season is stressful as you can imagine, and again, you do not receive any compensation from it."
bad,"My experience at Walmart was not the best. I was working in Soft line which is the clothing and baby care section of the store. As a young person, working with mostly older people it at times was very boring."
bad,No Comment on this job at Walmart.I do not have much to say about this particular company. You can contact this particular retail store at Walmart.com.
bad,"Walmart locations vary, but my particular location had very poor managers, who would undercut employees and con them into thinking that they were full time employees working full time hours, when the reality was we were considered part-time but working full time hours. I discovered this scheme one day overhearing the managers talk numbers. They purposefully hire people who they think aren't smart enough to understand when we are being overworked and underpaid. I cannot say this is all Walmart but this norcross location was drowning in corruption."
bad,"I liked the work I did at Wal-Mart, but quickly found it was more work than the pay or hours were worth. Add to that the managerial staff at the time which was unaware of the nature or demands of the job, and unwilling to accommodate the staff to ensure the job was completed, and result was an understaffed location with under paid employees who no longer wanted to put forth the maximum effort for the company."
bad,"if associates are not considered favorites or clique like they are treated poorly. the more you try to stay to yourself or actually have opinions or concerns, you are considered a threat and targeted which makes your job unsecure"
bad,The people I work with are nice but they dont hire enough people. They expect you to do the job of three people and complain if you can't finish everything while being the only person in three different departments.They promote who they want to positions they shouldn't have then have the person who should have gotten the job help them. They will also drastically cut your hours even if you are full time then try to call you in because there is no coverage.
bad,"The cons and pros are the same the people, at Walmart you meet different kinds. It was awesome to hear that some people would wait in longer lines if they saw you because they like going through your lines. I even had one customer who went out of there way to introduce me to his wife and new born baby. On the other side there are some people who will treat you like your dirt or nothing."
bad,"Management dont listen to associates accountability when they don't provide work. Managers are very disrespectful and micromanage abuse of power, system breaks down and we get occurrences for gap time when it's not our fault. HR does nothing for us we have no support from staff or managers. They say you spoke we listen that's a lie all they do is treat us like garbage. It seems like the managers have no people skills or education they lack respect. 7356 in Bethlehem is a terrible place to work."
bad,"At first I liked working here, but then I was under a lot of stress with this job. Management was terrible and they chose their favorites over those who worked hard, came in on time and did their best to help the customers. Their work scheduling was not very good and it seemed they would punish you if you asked about only working certain days or hours."
bad,"Working at Walmart in my area really depends on the day of the week and how well we are scheduled which unfortunately is not well. Most days I have worked when it's been busy, and it's a known busy day, food stamps, social security, back to school, etc, we are almost always severely understaffed, and associates from the floor are called to the front to help cashiers causing the floor crews to suffer. On the flip side of that, days that are usually slow we have too many people working and are left standing around. Needless to say the busy days when stuff is not done, management scolds us for not working hard enough, and when days are slow and we're all done with our duties we're scolded for standing around. The hardest part of my job personally is getting all of my duties done, even on days that are slow. Customer service is meant to come first in our store, and when we put the customer first, we're putting some of our department duties to the side. This upsets managers and instead of helping departments that may be flooded with too many customers, they tell us that we just need to work harder and faster. The most enjoyable part of my job though, for me, was being able to give customers my honest opinion on products, games and what not and just having general conversations with them about these items. Customer's feel like they have a more personal experience with us, and in my experience, are more likely to come back to the store, buy more product, and even donate when we have donations going on for different causes."
bad,"Walmart is going the way of too many big box stores.  Too much work and not enough people, high expectations and not enough help to get it done. Yes there is the chance of fast advancement, but with that comes lack of proper training and a really high turnover rate.  They're a good foot in the door for someone wanting retail management experience to take with them to bigger and better things."
bad,I worked there for a short time I got a hernia so I had to have surgery.  I informed the company of this surgery and 2 weeks in advance. To work around scheduling but they ended up letting me go before. I got back from recovery and failed to inform me.
bad,Hay muchas tareas para elavorar y eso es bueno para el aprendizaje
bad,"A typical day of work was usually very busy until late night. I learned how to operate a cash register and deal with customers. The other cashiers were mostly pretty great but the upper management was absolutely awful. Management was extremely lazy yet worked everyone else to the bone and would get mad if you couldn't pick up extra shifts. Management was also extra tough on students. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers who liked to yell, however you get used to it and move on very quickly."
bad,"The managerial staff was always condescending and the hours were not fit to live of off. I worked there when I was 17-18 years old and still living with my parents, and still couldn't make ends meet."
bad,I felt that the communication or lack there of between the managers and employees was bad and sometimes non-existent. The work loads were unevenly distributed and management failed to address any of the employee concerns.
bad,I like it at first but I had to deal with some racist customers and employees and there’s was really never anything I could do about it so I was never happy working there and it’s hard to work somewhere if your not happy
bad,"Cons:"
bad,Low Pay. A lot of stress and politics. You had no work life balance. You will need to work horrible hours. Pay could be better and know I believe these jobs are being outsourced.
bad,The do not want you to get overtime and will give you 8 hours for the month.They do not consider your personal life even if it is your kid getting sick.
bad,"Does not reward workers for exceeding, does not work around your schedule. Would ask off for days many weeks in advance for school relations, and was almost always denied."
bad,"While working at walmart I felt as if I was at the bottom of the food chain. Employees were treated terribly by management, as if everything that was wrong was our fault. We were forced to get 14 hours or more of work done in less than 8."
bad,Walmart is a difficult company to work for is a lot of things going on that can be avoided by better management. I stayed only for the money it was decent at the time.
bad,"I enjoyed working at Walmart. The job was good, and I enjoyed interacting with customers. However, at the store I worked in, the managers disregarded their associates. Several times, I would approach them with my thoughts and concerns, only for it to be dismissed or ignored. I ultimately left because of this."
bad,The only thing I found that I like working at walmart is you work four days on and three days off. You never know when your get to u off..you work king and hard on holidays but u do t get holiday pay..it seems like every week they hire ten people but ten might quit and that just makes her to u off longer a d stressful.
bad,"Management is constantly shifted around, therefore it is impossible to really develop a good relationship with your supervisors. No one wants to work at walmart, and that is obvious when talking to your coworkers."
bad,Working at Walmart was the worst experience I’ve ever had the workers are very rude. There is no team work effort at all. Everyone try’s to make them selfs look good infront of the managers by talking down on the other associates “brownie points” the  department managers were no help at all. Everytime you would be assigned a task someone would always come and blame you for someone else’s work that wasn’t completed overall a horrible place to work
bad,"Wal-Mart is a decent place to work at. You get the nice customers, than you get the rude customers. A typical day working at Wal-Mart is tough sometimes. Working here is a learning environment, I learn new things everyday. Learning the policy for returning and exchanging items. How to process returns or exchanges. The management in my store is good. All managers are kind to everyone, treats everyone with the same kind of respect. The workplace environment is good, employee's are kind to each other and to customers. Hardest part of working for Wal-Mart is having to help a customer and trying to figure out (ex. Price check, check if an item is in stock) Enjoyable parts are when you have customers who brighten your day, make you smile or maybe even laugh. Other then that Wal-mart's not a bad place to work at."
bad,"Total verbal disrespect, and physical. Managers will beloeve your life is a game, and will openly threaten to fire employees if they do not ""move"" faster than a human speed. It is a cut-throat environment, every man for himself and horse playing is a norm."
bad,"Typical day was very fast paced, not enough help available, hard to get a manager when needed, called off lunch breaks before break was over,  unorganized daily work."
bad,"I do believe the management team did their very best everyday but they sort of dismissed our needs and ideas as workers because we needed to treat the customers like gods. "
bad,walmart is a good place to work at the people u work with are great an the managers r not bad to work with u also have a chance to get  fulltime by advancement
bad,"You are always over worked with little to no help. Management was always wanting things done and not giving enough time or help to get it done. There was times directions was not clear, management don't know how to do some of the jobs themselves."
bad,"It could have been a great place to work, but a combination of terrible management, and lazy associates, made it a more difficult work experience than it should have been."
bad,"If you don't have to work at Walmart, don't. The advancement is slow, the training is inadequate, the demands are unreasonable, and the health insurance will leave you bankrupt. I'm not someone who was fired and is now disgruntled. I worked there for a short time as a break from my chosen profession. I have an advanced degree but found the back office position to be difficult because no one would train me properly. I asked for training repeatedly. It was given to me after over a year. All of a sudden everything about my job made sense. It was too late, however, and I stepped down. I worked several positions there. Sometimes you get lucky and have a good manager above you, but the hours will be awful, you'll be penalized for taking off time for legitimate reasons, and although the stock options and contributing 401K was great, the health insurance was the minimum the law allowed and left me bankrupt after an ER visit. One of my medications was over $800 with the insurance. Just don't."
bad,If you’re in management you have no life at all except work. Sometimes no days off at all . Other management is out for themselves absolutely no teamwork.
bad,"Can be fun, productive. Over worked and rushed at times. Certain teams have more tasks than others. A lot of favoritism and no appreciation for any work that you do."
bad,"Management team at there can be pretty stressful . They seem to not acknowledge the fact that curtain things take time if they wont it done right. With in my 4 years of being the department manager of Auto and Tire Lube and Express , it seems like the only time i am  not stressed out is when i can focus on running my counter and handling my guys out in the shop. I enjoy them a lot and they seem to make the day better."
bad,"Slowly eliminating more jobs"
bad,I worked years for this company for sub par pay and benefits. The managers are for the most part  borderline unapproachable. Your hours are not guaranteed. If sales are down they start to cut back hours to maintain the store profits
bad,"The grocery department only has 7 people that actually work in the aisles. It wasn't this bad before, instead of the management hiring new people they keep sending people from other departments in the store, they don't know where anything goes so it slow down progress.  I'm usually one of the only grocery associates that's there out of seven others stocking shelves, helping customers and running around the store.  One of the hardest things is tolerating what managers say or ask you to do because a lot of times it doesn't make sense.I'm thankful and grateful for the job but its getting to be too much and they're always telling you things you already know how to do. So I hope I can find another job  more enjoyable and less stressful."
bad,What do you really expect going in. It's a job like any other. Depending on the store you get what you get. Some managers are very nice while others have no idea what they're doing while employees have no idea why they're managers.
bad,Walmart is a good place full of diversity and culture. But hard work does not pay off. There is no room for career advancement and bonuses. Many people who are in management play favoritism so none of the people who actually have seniority or work hard get the schedules or hours they want. The schedules are not flexible with schooling or other jobs.
bad,"The level of professionalism at Walmart is atrocious. It seems that the intention is quantity above quality. It does not matter how often employees air their grievances, nothing is ever addressed."
bad,Not enough hours or benefits. The job was easy and I enjoyed stocking and dealing with the customers.  You have days off during the week so you can get things done that you can not on the weekends.
bad,"The work place was race oriented and, the managers were more concerned with themselves then they were with helping the associates they dictate over. They had no team work it was alway one for all."
bad,Bad management. Favoritism in the work place. Very low raises every year. No madder how hard you work everything is based on a budget. So you won't see much increase in pay.
bad,"Basically pushing us to the limit every night, unloading both the general merchandise (GM) trucks, and the grocery trucks, every night, then stocking all of grocery, and a hefty portion of GM with a team of 7 (on average) all in an 8-hour period nightly, and feeling like the pay we did earn was not worth the amount of work (basically 2/3 teams/shifts worth) that they foisted on us. Management worked with you to keep the peace but it felt like trying to push an elephant over for most issues that didn't affect walmart profits."
bad,Work is stressful because of leadership and management. My actual job is not hard but leadership and management made it hard. Increasing productivity to cut our hours.
bad,"The job is easy to get and easy to preform, but peers being unhelpful and managers playing favorites its hard to recommend this job to anyone. Its a good job for summer or if you are in college but doesn't offer much depth."
bad,"When I first started working at this particular store, management and the job were great. Slowly the turnover rate started taking its toll on the store as a whole with new managers stepping in and making drastic changes. In the 3 years that I was working there, it just kept going down hill."
bad,"Treated like garbage for minimal pay. Virtually no respect around the workplace. Intensive hours, when and if you get any. Generally was simply not worth the time spent employed there."
bad,Several chances to promote hard working associates but instead they promote people for seniority. Didn't even give a fair chance by having interviews.
bad,"This job demands you to work to the bone for minimal pay. The Management in the facility can be very disrespectful to the employees that are trying to do their best to get the work done in a quick and safe manner. Other than a discount you get at 91 days and the bonus which you don't qualify for until your 6 months in the company and their ""instore pathways training program"" is complete."
bad,I did not enjoy this job at all other than some of the people I worked directly with. There are too many rules and catches to being an employee here that you must keep a close watch on at all times. They do not give a lot of opportunity when you are at the smaller chains like I was.
bad,If you are liked by management you can get away with alot. Come in late time is fixed take 30 minutes for your breaks nothing is said not i employee several
bad,Not much training. You have to learn on your own. Promotions are given to those who they want and not the qualified associates.Poor training methods. Watch videos and learn on your own.
bad,"This company is focused on themselves giving no credit to it's employees for accomplishing tasks. Low pay, minimal benefits. Long hours that encompass weekends and holidays"
bad,"never more than 25 hours per week"
bad,Management is very pushy. You as the associate are not good enough. Management thinks that they are above you. Everything that you do is never good enough. There us no appreciation for your hard work. Priorities are never put first.
bad,"It's like any part-time job... it's all in what you make of it. Show up for your scheduled shift, don't make call off's a habit, pay attention to what you are doing to make as few mistakes as possible."
bad,"The workplace culture is horrible.  Employees are pushed and pushed.  Management is back stabbing and vengeful.  Only the favorites are treated well.  There is no communication from management to the employees. The managers take credit for everything that is right and beats the employees down for everything that goes wrong.  Everyone is stressed to the max, they can't keep employees.  I wouldn't suggest this as a place to work unless you have no other choice.  There is no joy at Walmart"
bad,"The management does not back the associate employees.  Customers can steal, spit at, yell at the employee and the managers do nothing about it. Its very hard to work in a place that doesn't take care of the under staff."
bad,Walmart is the place to work at when you are a student and will not be staying with the company for a lifetimes. It doesn't pay most employees enough to be able to afford the benefits.
bad,"I was a support manger for 2 years, we were so under staffed on a good day we had 10 people too work, and they expected us too do what we could do with 20 people, a lot of people were over worked, but the store manger didn't care she wanted more and more done... I could go on and on how bad the store ha become since I first started working there.. I feel sorry for all the overnight people, and lets not forget the bonus was a total joke the last year, this quarter they got a 42 dollar bonus.."
bad,"A stress induced, fast paced work environment that felt betrayal in every corner from almost all management. It is not a suggested place to work in at that time."
bad,"The Assistant Managers are all nice to customers, but totally rude and down talk all the associates. When you could stay away from management and focus on the job without their nitpicking, it really isn't too bad. It is retail, so you do get the occasional rude customer that will flip out on you like you are a councilor and have to listen to them, which sadly, you do. Thankfully I had amazing supervisors that I did get to be around on a daily basis that had really nice manners, and a level way of thinking in stressful events. I learned that I am worth more than what the company could offer, so I decided to leave and stop the misery of working for minimal pay and always having stress from upper management."
bad,Lack of hiring the right people for a position that requires a lot of physical work and customer service. Some immaturity and lack of experience in management positions.
bad,"Hated working here they are don't care about the employees or the customers at all. They say that they do but, don't. Management is driven by threats and cussing."
bad,"Arriving where to meet up they call it the ""walk "" with day manager.updating  me it was different everyday! It's supposed to be a 10 hour day but never is you end up there 16 hour day. Highly stressful and you end up with no family life  You never have enough time or payroll.That the unwritten rule is that associates end up on the salefloor instead of training.  You are constantly busy. Meetings are held and given tasks but NOT given resources to complete these tasks Company advertise they have created jobs, employed so many..... they don't say their turnover is high and they gave them a raise but cut hours!"
bad,"This place doesn't care about you or your health, but if you want to feel like dying every day then sure, apply. I was having seizure activity at work and was hospitalized and they refused to work with me and threatened me with being fired while I was on sick leave. I ended up having to leave myself because of the extra stress they were putting on me and making me have panic attacks while trying to heal in the hospital."
bad,Over worked and under paid. The pharmacy tech job is high pressure due to its nature. The management team and the company itself should focus on improving its relationship with that isolated department.
bad,Walmart would rather have you on welfare than pay you for doing a good job this place was horrible with multiple people with conflicting ideas on how to run the place
bad,I enjoyed working with my immediate  supervisor and day shift boss.  constantly changing work schedule.  would call me and have me come in on short notice or change days off with little or no notice.  Didn't like forced sales approach.  Pay and compensation package not very could and not considered a living wage.
bad,"Every single thing got nit picked, but if we found a way that worked better it was""against policy."" I cried several times due to working here. I'm glad I did it though, it showed me how scummy the public is to service workers."
bad,"Inconsistent hours, inconsistent customer help. People get angry because they’re so poorly managed. There’s much room for much improvement, it just needs to be implemented."
bad,"Was injured on the job and walmart cut my hours to the point i had to leave. Then when i left they made a big deal about it. I couldnt go to my doctors office to get looked at unless i talked on the phone with a doctor of there own over a phone then there doctor over the phone will over the phone let walmart know if the injury is ""real"" or not."
bad,"Walmart is not an enjoyable place to work. They care about one thiing and one thing only, themselves. They were not willing to work my kids life around my schedule when needed. Management was not willing to listen to new ideas."
bad,Don't get ill. Don't get hurt. Does not respect their employees. Horrible management. Hours are very. Don't count on family time. All black Fridays are required to work.  Flexible hours are a joke.
bad,"Depending on the store you get hired at, that will provide your view of this company. Some stores have good management, good employees, and excellent teamwork skills. However, for some of us who weren't lucky enough to get hired at a store with decent management, you have this: A store manager who will go out of their way to sabotage advancement within the company if it will be an inconvenience to them. A co-manager who will tell you to let them know of any problems you have, but when you do, it's suddenly impossible to find them to see if there can be a resolution. An Assistant Manager who will go out of their way to make you feel incapable of your job, because of setbacks you can't control. You get a management staff that will push you to step down because you are too vocal of the obstacles you need help with, ones who just want you to say you'll get it done, regardless of if it's physically possible for you to do it. They will alienate you, degrade you, push you to do things that aren't part of your job. Understaff your department so that you're so busy doing everyone else's job, you can't do yours. But hey, maybe you'll get lucky."
bad,Walmart is a good place to work for if you are in school or want a seasonal job or part time job. the salary was not very good and the work schedule varies a lot from day to day.
bad,"I wouldnt recommend them to anyone because of how poorly they treat their staff. To upper management the staff is simply a number and they treat you as such, They schedule employees outside of their availability and expect workers to just deal with it and they dont make you feel like you matter"
bad,"A typical day consist of the same thing just different customers when working the front end. You might end up getting a full life story including where someone went to elementary school at, or the customer who swears they have enough money in the bank to pay for their groceries. Management is awful ! From the store manager to personnel."
bad,"TL;DR: If you don't mind being treated like a second-class citizen and working for a company who cares very little about you, all on minimum wage, then this is the job for you! "
bad,Company does not care about the hard work you put in. Everyone is for self. No hours people work hard as they can for no respect. When u give your time and dedication to the company they dont appreciate it. They will fire you and have someone in your place the next day.
bad,"A typical day would be just shopping for other people. I learned how to deal with complaints. Management didnt deal with anything. Culture was okay, Hardest part was not having enough people. most enjoyable was two of my co workers."
bad,"For the most part Walmart was ok to work for but it has gone down hill over the years. There expectations for there employees are set high , with no insentive .."
bad,"Un experiencia de trabajo arduo, no permite crecer tan facil"
bad,"Obviously everyone has different experiences, mine however was horrible. I do believe it had everything to do with the lack of management and leadership in THIS particular store. I'm sure its not indicative of all walmarts"
bad,"If you have a family or a life, maybe a child with a disability they do NOT recognize or even care. If they can give you full-time hours but keep you a ""part-time"" associate so they don't have to offer you benefits, they will! They do not excuse if you have an ill child. It is a heartless company to work for."
bad,I dont recommend anyone work here because for the most part people were selfish and lots of the customers would steal and you as an employee cannot do anything about it.
bad,This job was not a place to strive for nor a place to grow. The companies management at the time seemed to not care about the employees or the family but how the company could benefit.
bad,"I wanted to work at Wal-Mart until retirement, but was fired for accidental circumstances.Unknowingly, my fork-lift license was expired 5 days before a minor fork-lift incident occurred and was let go. Wal-Mart should have held some responsibility because HR should have kept up with licensing."
bad,they play to much with the schedule.  they gave me no more then 32 hrs per week. they promise to mobe me to another deparment with more hrs hrs and earning 12 per hr and that never happen. the maneger had problems with one of my family member outside of the job and he took it off on me by giving me less hrs and i had to quit because he gave me three weeks off  and all my friends had to work bt me
bad,i had a good job time work for walmart  i good money  work for thim few year by malf  u know it a good job it has it up and down  but u make rell money so the mmoney rell good u can shpp there so it a good job ilove we n i work there i miss it
bad,Very stressful work environment with very little respect or compassion for employees. The equipment used is inadequate making a production job more stressful than necessary
bad,"The management didn't listen to or accommodate my needs well at all. They did not follow my availability which caused me overwhelming stress. Scheduling is a major issue at this particular location and while I am thankful they took the chance on me having no experience and gave me the opportunity to gather some experience in this field, the scheduling is still an issue. I don't think Walmart is the right fit for me anymore."
bad,Just do ur job keep smiling task timed work can't do what they want u to do task time is provided by computer witch has no idea what's going tell manger it is wrong they say they can't  do anything about it
bad,"Wal-mart does not properly train new hires, and current employees are not treated with respect. There Is no loyalty to associates, and no proper accountability from upper management."
bad,to work hard while other wonder around doing nothing and slacking off . supervisor plays favorites  the hiring is a joke. they hire people who cant do the job fully and expect it to be ok.
bad,did not enjoy working for them. long time standing on your feet without moving around and being bent over scanning in customers purchases. had to have a certain amount of scans in the amount of time you are on the cash.
bad,"Once a cart pusher, always a cart pusher since they lack them. They are in desperate need of cart pushers so there is little to no chance of progressing."
bad,"Not well organized,understaffed,supervisors are not very friendly sometimes rude,or avoid you so don't have to help.need better communication skills and work all as a big team not as departments."
bad,"Se les puede ""olvidar"" asignar periodos vacacionales hasta dos años seguidos"
bad,Did not really like working at Walmart so much. Was not a fit for me. Did not interest me and I woukd like to move to a different job and try better things
bad,Since the management has changed the store has gone down hill. The cashiers are few and far and the shields are empty most times also the floors are filthy.
bad,Could not have holidays off if you worked over night. Made you come in on the last couple hours of holidays like Christmas with no holiday pay. Bad management.
bad,Terrible as soon as u get full time they cut your hours and never get enough 40 hours then they start looking for reasons to terminate you so you can be replaced
bad,Wal-mart treats employees like dirt. The managers are rude most of the time unless you catch them on a good day. The pay really doesn't cover the amount of work the workers do on a daily basis. Unless it changed from when I worked there. No over time is allowed at all. Very rare room for advancement.
bad,"This location has really fallen into the dirt. Most of the management team are really great to work with, it is unfortunate how some people can bring a whole team down. Schedules used to be easy to deal with but they require to much availability for a simple part time job. The pay is as bad as it can get and expect to get your hours cut all the time."
bad,the Walmart's I worked for didn't have a general concept of treating employee's good ! other than that they always had to much product coming in and nowhere to put it because the previous products didn't sale like they project ! the managers are put under so much stress to get things out and the majority of the items don't sale or the items that do sale a lot aren't reordered and are lacking in the store!!
bad,walmart are nothing but drama my employees all was sleeping with each other csm talked about everybody supervisor was never there didn't have a store manager for a very long time
bad,I believe this company is better for someone getting out into the working class and learning new skills. Also has a very complex schedule that does not always allow for much free time or life time.
bad,"It’s was a pretty nice inveronment at times, learned a lot while there management was not good at all, a lot of favoritism but it was overall a decent part time job not a career job."
bad,"My typical workday was repiticious.I did not learn all that much ,again i already knew how to do most all of the work.Stressful. The hardest part of the job was getting a break because the other workers would dissapear, mostly were students."
bad,Walamrt is huge on propganda.  If you want to work you better be pro walmart and be willing to never be sick.  Never have to worry about overtime though because they do not want to pay that.
bad,"Punched in and went to where ever it was I was working at the time. I worked in the photo department and learned that job. Most of management was very good, did have one manager give my name to one of the customers. Being the only one in the area with my last name, the customer now knew where I lived by looking in the phonebook! Lots of volunteers, bake sales to raise money for causes. Hardest part of the job somedays was just going to work. Best part was most of the coworkers were easy to work with."
bad,"Wal-Mart's culture has changed dramatically over these last few years. It used to be about inclusion of ideas and associate benefits, but it has changed in a manner that is very much against the associate. Long term employees did not receive an hourly pay compensation when Wal-Mart raised its wage to 10/hr. they just got a small bonus and years of hard earned raises were all for nothing. It's policy culture has changed to one that is ""values based"" instead of a rules based policy approach  to make it easier for company management to find an associate guilty of something they didn't even do! Associates are treated more like objects than people and the management team culture is one of secrecy, non-transparency, and that they are ""better than"" most associates. The management team isolates themselves and forms a friendship based bond with each other so that even if a manager does something wrong they never get into trouble for it. Double-Standards permeate the work environment and direction is given on an ""Because I said so"" basis. Associates are not recognized for their work and are rarely praised for a good job. It doesn't matter to Wal-Mart how long you have worked with the company or how good your reputation is at your store, you are still treated as completely expendable and replaceable."
bad,I would go back if asked! I like making customers happy !! But not the best company to work for! I went out of my way to come in on my days off but was not appreciated!
bad,I worked at Walmart for 8 months.  It was a very stressful job and my hours where not what I signed up for.  It really got in my way with my personal life
bad,Job started out promising as a cashier in the pharmacy. I was told that in just a few weeks I would be able to move to the back of the pharmacy once I received my Tech In Training license from the state board of Pharmacy. After a long up hill battle of trying to get my boss to let me get my official license it finally happened. This however was after I had to get a extension for my Tech In Training License and it almost expiring also.
bad,Low cost leader through minimum pay.  Little to none leadership and poor examples of management.  The dominant management style is through the use of threats and job security.  Most managers lack soft skills and are threatened by performers.
bad,"Walmart's management worked strenuously to meet company standards, often stretching thin their employees to do so.  Coworkers shared many jokes and smiles, but would gossip and/or slack off and blame other workers."
bad,I did not have a good experience working at Wal-Mart. I wokr their for 4 years without any promotion. Instead I quit Wal-Mart and went into the military.
bad,It was fine at first. However the managers are extremely hard to meet half way with. Managers tend to hide from you. Managers won’t really help if coworkers are clearly needing help getting along. Store manager was extremely rude and will push you off unless you corner him several times.
bad,Walmart is a fast moving company . Always changing management and policys. Needs to improve on how to treat associates and management. No room for advancement unless higher management likes you
bad,"As part of the unloading crew, at most you're only given minimal respect considering it's the backbone of the store. You're expected to know where everything is at and help everyone on the floor; but no one seemed to be able to help out the unloading crew. This seems to be a solid point for lacking management. I've been reprimanded multiple times for requesting Assistance, only to be told ""You're the supervisor, you figure it out"", then an hour later get yelled at for not asking for help."
bad,to be perfectly honest i worked for this company twice in my life . the first time was in 2007 i had a decent experience that time but my second encounter was terrible.
bad,"I've worked for Walmart for 8 years. The pay was decent. Management sucks. They put customers above anything, even if it is wrong. in the end no one has the employees back. I finally had enough. I'm just upset I wasted so much time there. I quit. And haven't regretted it yet."
bad,the position I held was very stressful because I worked the overnights as it is up to the overnight crew to get the store ready for the next day of business while doing everything else cleaning up the store dealing with good customer service also stocking and doing what ever the earlier shift leaves you to do
bad,"Not a good job to work. Management takes full advantage of you, making sure you do three times more work than what you were hired for, with no extra pay."
bad,if you like forever chaning policies and being overworked then this is the place for you. if you love being everywhere at once and doing the job of 4 or more people on any given day with little to no support from management then apply to work here.
bad,Hard to work for company they are not willing to back. They play favorites and ppl who are dependable and hard working are  left to pick up the pieces.
bad,"I requested to work 40 hours a week, but was still only treated as part time with no benefits. It was very fast paced and stressful, you get yelled at a lot by both customers and coworkers."
bad,"I will never again work for this company, the only advantages they have are their proper safety rules. Other than that, you work hard enough to get hurt. But never get anything given to you. A lot of employees barely work as well. Whilst others slave away and do their coworkers jobs as well. I didn't even receive proper compensation for my work. Also, they should really look into better floor environments for their employees in the back room. Constant concrete is not good for feet and back."
bad,This store would of been a great investment if they had better management.  Good store closed because of bad management.  This just my opinion.   I could be wrong.
bad,The typical day communications do not promote empowerment or engagement from employees. The use of one's brain is not something that is embraced within the company.
bad,"Store not clean, lots of employee theft, understaffing, some management are good at their positions, however many managers (CSMs) need additional training."
bad,"To much favoritism at a work place like that,so you have to know somebody to move up.but overall it's hard work and not a good work place because not good pay for the work we do"
bad,i dont like how they dont care about there employees and they put there employee the shift whatever they want event if liike 4-6 hours sleep. poor management in oak harbor wa
bad,"A typical day at walmart was pulling product off the truck, and stocking it out on the floor. I learned very quickly that the other team members at walmart were not the nicest of people. Management was nothing to write home about. In my experience, it definitely could have been better."
bad,Walmart all together is a good company. It’s when you get down to the store level that is messed up. Managers go behind each other they don’t have respect for the associate
bad,"Assisting customers, answering and transferring calls, cleaning hazards, stocking, shipment, markdowns, displays, jewelry and shoe department and outstanding customer service."
bad,"Stocked shelves overnight.  Fell off ladder hurt my knee, worked"
bad,Dont do it. This company does not support its mangers or associate. They treat you like a number but claim to have a family culture. Say they use and open door policy although its always closes
bad,Management was never really too involved. All employees are what made me stay as long as I did. It was a great work environment when working with another employee.
bad,I have worked with Walmart for over a year. There is no real support from management. The store manager in the Wallace store lets everyone of the assistant managers make all the calls in store. The company has forgotten about the employee and only look at the money.
bad,"A typical work day consists of clocking in, standing behind a register for 4 hours, getting a 1 hour lunch break, and standing behind the register until its time to clock out."
bad,Low pay and management frowns on availability changes so one can try to balance work and life....Not many full time positions are open or available for career development....Cannot receive health benefits unless full time status...most associates are part time.
bad,It's a good company based off your location and the location in the store. Manager can be rude and most are definitely don't recommend the automotive.
bad,"Working CAP2 we unload the truck then disperse to sort out other items throughout the store. The tasks given are manageable but people you work with will make or break your experience. Management is never satisfied with our work and will constantly berate us for issues outside of our control. They often encourage you to get things done as fast as possible, then complain about strategies that are taken to accomplish these goals. Also, team scheduling is an annoyance. Some days we'll have 4 people to unload a rather large truck then others we'll have 12 people and no truck will be scheduled for that day."
bad,"Good pay, bad management, stressful, small discount, and nobody really works efficiently. I learned not to get hurt. They give you almost no time to recover, and I was fired while they told unemployment that I had quit. Lame."
bad,they say and teach you one thing however once you begin working on the job you see how many corners they cut out of the companies policies in order to make the manager work load lighter and the departments just have to pick up the slack without getting the pay of what you are actually doing
bad,"Great coworkers, horrendous upper management"
bad,"As with most employers, management has a lot to do with morale and overall job enjoyment. I do not advise for or against working for this company. It is up to the individual to decide."
bad,"Given unrealistic objectives each day, never given all the resources you need and as a hourly manager you were cut hours for your employees and still expected to get all your work completed as if you had a complete staff"
bad,"Bad management,  bad moral,  tried to make it like a military boot camp. I don’t mind hard work at all but they put it to the extreme.  Would hold us over to"
bad,I don't have any thing against them but I dislike the way Walmart is run. They need to have a better and/or more real-life training programs. They have plenty of videos about your job you must watch but you may or may not even get a chance to have a person actually train you before you start your job.
bad,"Managment at walmart will notice how hard you work and how much you are devoted to work. In order to reward you they keep you in the same position, even if you ask to leave! The first year or two seems amazing, and the managers will tell you how you should be part of the management team.. but truthfully they are trying to keep you working hard, because at the end of the day, they get lashed at for it not you."
bad,I was fired from the remodel crew due to getting  phone call  from my lawyer. They told me to leave the floor so i was outside on the phone with my lawyer and they pulled me in the office and told me i cant talk on the phone lawyer or not.
bad,"A typical day at work demanded a lot of standing, fighting with razor-thin plastic bags or the raw stench of customer-provided canvas bags that had undoubtedly carried raw and thawing meat in them and never been washed. There was also countless annoying pushes for get customers to donate to various causes at the checkout."
bad,"I just wanted to say i'm so thankful my time is done with Walmart. The people are mostly good and has a family feel. the rest of the job is ridiculous. No wonder there is a huge turnover rate. now it's $11 hour start pay, i worked over 12 years and was making $12.75. When the new people was getting the $11 Experienced associates got nothing or a few cents more. Really hurt my moral."
bad,"day at work long and overworked"
bad,"a lot of product to stock the shelves in the short period of time of working , not organize the management were not helpful , not enough pay for the requirements they ask of their employees."
bad,My review is based on experiences at two stores which was generally poor; my direct supervisors were great; the customer interaction was atrocious; I was subject to multiple threats of violence each day.
bad,"Hard for managers to remember things that you ask of them, if they can switch your days, can you edit my schedule. Not enough clarity between what they can and cannot due since you will hear multiple answers that will end up confusing you on if you can or cannot do this or if They cannot do this or if they can. Store manager changes almost yearly with none of them being good at there job. Rude to employees but praise customers who they know are in the wrong but make sure to tell you that YOU were in the wrong and not them which 98% of the store would disagree with that."
bad,"i would stock the products that were taken out of the freezer on the shelves, insure rotation and freshness of the products for ultimate quality, keep the area clean and organized with proper expiry dates on each packages, receive and stock new orders in the freezer of the backstore, register all losses and dispose of them accordingly, assists clients with their inquiries and prepare the list of products to be placed on the shelves for the next day. it is a very repetitive job but ideal for solo work with check lists, therefor it offers you independance. as a super centre, with many departments, it may happen that other departments will need extra help, so it is needed to organize your time accordingly, but as a downside, it may also happens that some department will be lacking associates and clients will be needing your assistance for that other department: without walking away from your position and department, you need to help the client as quick as possible and return to your department. as a university student, with a schedule that changes every 3 months, it can be problematic as they want a mandatory shift during the week."
bad,unfair management that discriminates and has favoritism within the staff.  Hours have been cut to under 30 hours some weeks and therefore I may lose my benefits.
bad,"When employed by Walmart. I was an overnight stock clerk, with many additional responsiblities than the average stock clerk. The company is not the best to be employed with. They have some internal policies that are not employee friendly."
bad,You can only afford to live working at Walmart if it's subsidized with food stamps and other government programs. They have an open door policy in which you can speak to management. It is not properly practiced and is just a way to be recognized by management in a negative way. If you need to take LOA for medical reasons it is not an easy process it is not guaranteed and often ends in termination.
bad,A typical at work is pretty stress full. We are hardly staffed half the time which makes my job harder and the CSM's do our best to keep lines down and costumers happy.
bad,"While I worked at Walmart a consistent issue I had was the management. They never seem to be doing anything except look for things to fuss about. They don't want to build their employees up, just tear them apart and run them off."
bad,If you're lazy you have it made. If you are dumb you're have it made and can possibly work your into management. Yet if you work hard everyday they will try to run all over you. Speaking you're mind will never be a problem they are all cowards.
bad,"In my experience, a lot of games are played by management.  Threats are made that if you don't do ""this"", then you will lose your hours.  One manager never knows what another manager is doing, so you are being pulled in different directions constantly.  I enjoyed the job itself, but the stress of the games got to me in the end."
bad,"The company is cutting corners everywhere except upper management and CEO salaries.  The work they expect from their workers is ridiculous.  They don't even build their own stores, the communities build them, thinking they will get more jobs.  they just run other businesses out of town."
bad,"Learned some customer service skills, how to work a till somewhat and how to keep shelves clean. Due to always cleaning and stocking them. "
bad,Rude management was told to literally let my therapy dog starve or give him up. They expect you to do more than what is possible and several people walk around and do nothing without consequence and the ones who pick up their slack get yelled at constantly.
bad,"There always feels like a competition is going on, whether your apart of it or not. Managers show nepotism, especially if you kiss their butt. Inconsistent with pay. Will force you to work unpaid hours for exchange of overtime. Not a comfortable place or environment to work."
bad,"in the department where i worked, had little help, the ones working their got let go or never showed up to work because the drama that would go on everyday with the cake decorator."
bad,managers are always mad about something can never understand or empathize with their employees hours suck if you’re not open availability which is not fair how you need cashiers for the exact time i wanna be here but tell me i might not get hired if my availability isnt open ????? stupid
bad,"Lack of support from management, time off or conflict with hours due to inclement weather, lack of compassion and teamwork. I would not recommend the job in the time frame I worked there."
bad,"When I moved to the area I hHAD to take this job as it was the only one that didn't pay under 10 dollars an hour in the area. Now we are paid the Walmart minimum, with no annual raise this year. I do not like working here. Since my injury, working here has been twice as hard on me, and most days I go home in pain. I was rejected on moving up, and then rejected again trying to get onto a shift with a less heavy lifting position. The only real part of the job that is enjoyable are some of the other 3rd shift associates. I feel trapped in this job, and have continuously looked for another since I was hired. Sadly there are no better paying jobs in the area unless they are factory jobs."
bad,"It was stressful, as a student in college i had almost no flexibility. The work was never ending and the pay was almost cry worthy at the end of the 2 weeks. I recommend only working here if you are absolutely desperate for a job."
bad,"A typical day at work was pretty relaxing, somewhat fast paced. Management lacked communication skills amongst other managers. The hardest part of the job was lifting boxes that were nearly 40 to 50 pounds. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the holidays because all employees received holiday pay."
bad,"Suppose to work 10 hour days, come in and get told 11+ hours. Take advantage of people.  Bad communication between management and with communicating with associates. Production is too high to get."
bad,"Working at Wal-Mart is an easy job but the compensation for a cashier was not acceptable. You are not just a cashier there is other things that you do such as cleaning the areas, stocking, placing groceries back."
bad,"Wal-mart's management is largely uncaring of what happens to their employees unless it in some way impacts the company  - negatively, that is. Some managers are supportive, but it varies by location and department. Most just don't seem to care at all while there are a few who play favorites and hold grudges. Just one bad manager can affect the whole atmosphere of the job. "
bad,Rough cliental and no compensation. Very bad pay for the work and very little staff to get anything done. Dangerous environment depending on your location.
bad,Walmart was a just a job for me. There wasn't opportunity for advancement that would offer better pay due to the shift differential. They hired me at a lower rate than they are hiring new employees and did not raise the current employees to the rate that the new employees are receiving. There is no benefit to having seniority at Walmart.
bad,"Once you hit a salaried role with Walmart essentially there is no going back, you are forced to either suck it up or quit.... I choose the quit route which many of my friends have chosen to do as well."
bad,Not understanding if their machine doesn't work you are held responsible.  Immediate discharge.   I was disappointed.  I thought if you went the extra mile for the company they would be understanding and fair before they let you go.
bad,Working at Walmart was unfulfilling. Most associates are poorly trained and only know part of their job roles. We are constantly asking supervisors or mangers for help because the team of coworkers are not full trained to handle the tasks at hand and deal with the customers appropriately.
bad,"Empresa boa para trabalhar,equipe boa,ambiente de trabalho bom."
bad,"The list of problems with the work environment of this company would take hours to write. Management is either being overwhelmed by their supervisors to deal with the dysfunction, or they flat out lack the assertiveness to do so."
bad,I’ve worked for Walmart and the managers care nothing about the workers what so ever they have all the rights to be disrespectful without consequences and talk to you any kind of way
bad,"Managers are incouragable. When theyre questioned they get butt hurt & someone loses their job, & its not them. God forbid you have an opinion or think for yourself, theyll find any reason under the sun to fire you.  Doesnt matter that you do your job and you do it well, they just want minions that do what theyre told. They set ridiculous unattainable goals and expect you to do it with no help."
bad,working there for 8 years i enjoyed the work but the people they have upper management do not care for the customer. It is all about the money and not customer service. To me customer are the boss and should be treated as top priority not the last thing to worry about.
bad,"there is a union mentality at Walmart-I've been here longer and two things come to mind.1)you've been doing something incorectly all these years and you don't REALLY know what you're talking about.But you made middle management on a personality contest or your aunt is a dept mgr."
bad,"Very poor management and there is no structure.. To many managers that don't consider are appreciate what you do to keep their jobs are make you life easier. the schedule is open and you work a different time every day, Does not give you any balance for your life..."
bad,Management is horrible. No communication. No matter how hard you work its never enough. Its good for the affordable health coverage and the overnight differential. That's about it.
bad,"Daytime employees were hard to get along with and also very hard to advance and grow with company. Didn't receive enough hours, very rude employees and managers"
bad,"I put in 3 years at Walmart. Yes there was good days, but there were also bad days. And by bad I mean HORRIBLE. The management team is terrible. The BEST manger I ever had quit after 6 months and he was AWESOME! He made work fun he encouraged us. But the other management didn’t like him so they forced him out. But the truth is you may apply for one job but once it’s all said and done you end up working the whole store. My store was ALWAYS short handed. Didn’t allow over time. Expected you to just “know” how to do your job.. (very little training was giving). So if you want to work at Walmart, then good luck if the management is bad the whole experience is bad."
bad,Long days as a manager in which good is never good enough. Upper management says one thing then does the complete opposite when it comes accountability.
bad,Don't want you to clock in early at all ever and don't continue to help a customer if it will put you over your time to clock out. Don't like to give you hours
bad,"We are always being told how our store is different than any other one. No customer service, not enough employees on the floor, management is rude and doesn't care about customer satisfaction. We don't even have bathrooms most of the time, and the store smells and isn't clean. Customers complain to management, then to the home office, the health department, and even on Facebook and Twitter. Some have called radio and TV stations to complain, but nothing happens. Several employees have reported to the ethics office of Walmart but again nothing changes. Maybe it's just our store but it's hard to support these conditions."
bad,"Working at Walmart can go one of two ways: You enjoy it enough to stay, or you despise every second of working there. Unfortunately for me, the work environment was very toxic. The management was awful, coworkers were disgusting, and the types of customers that come in regularly are horrible."
bad,A typical day is stress filled due to lack of staff. Always busy but never anyone to come when help is needed in certain departments. Having to do more then 1 position at a time.
bad,Walmart was a very crazy unorganized mess most of the time management most of the time had very little idea of what was going on. There are good people that work at walmart but it was family used to. Be the Moto but it hasn't been the case in the last few years
bad,"It doesn't matter how hard you work it only matters if u show up and look busy."
bad,i think walmart is a okay it could be a better job. Its not what i see myself in 5 years. the pay is good but the  manages a horrible. the  environment is great to be in tho.
bad,You get meet new and different people everyday.  I enjoy helping each customer that is in need of my help.bringing a smile to people give me great joy.
bad,"trabalho muito puxado por ter que trabalhar sábado e domingo, não havia descanso para corpo e mente, extremamente cansativo"
bad,"Dissolved job and did not care how it effects the associate. "
bad,"If you need a job, then I can't argue with applying here.  However, if you want a family life, a schedule you can live with, clear direction at work, management that actually listens instead of shouting at employees, then you will need to look somewhere else.  Hours are never the same week to week, and can be changed the day of, which will incur an un-excused absence - 4 occurrences .  Get 9 and you're gone.  There is favoritism rampant in my local store.  Those that aren't buddy-buddy with management are pretty much screwed from the start.  Those that are kissing rear end with management will advance, to a point.   Also forget about any overtime.  If you get overtime, you are expected to take a long lunch on Friday to remove it.  If you don't, and have overtime you WILL get written up."
bad,"Long story short I was ""one of the best produce person"" but due to a big snow storm I called out and they gave me a a full point for calling out of a 4 hr shift."
bad,I worked very hard.  Much harder than most.  I learned that it was unfair to watch others walk around on their cell phones all day and not do any work or the bare minimum and they get away with it.  I have a strong work ethic and very disciplined.  I respect myself and the work I produce while others did not.  Managers turned over often. I was recognized for my strong work ethics and promoted.  I did like to do inventory.
bad,"Working for Walmart has its benefits but it has more cons than pros. Management clearly has favorites. Walmart promotes people that do not deserve to be in managerial positions and frequently overlooks people that work hard. As a matter of fact, the people that do work hard often get treated the most unfairly and the people that do very little are often promoted and praised. They have taken promotions from people that do not deserve it and worked extremely hard to earn their position. They change rules as they see fit. You make a lot of friends. Customers are rarely pleasant."
bad,it was so much fun not rilly the hrs where never rite a lot of the time your schedule was always all over the place never get off win u where supposed to
bad,It was a great company to work for but unfortunately it took a turn for the worst. There was a lack of accountability. It was very rewarding to see the results of working from MTM platforms; patients would come back to thank us for the improvement in their health (test results).
bad,My particular location did not provide sufficient management and showed little empathy for employees. I would not suggest working there unless you had no other option.
bad,"Walmart is one of those jobs that people work when they can't find anything else. They tell you that you will have many hours and the pay will go up quickly, but it's all lies. They will lower your hours and take your benefits away saying you don't work full time hours so you don't get full time benefits."
bad,I like working at Walmart. I kept me very busy. There was always something to do. The pay was not so good. The management was not very good either. The discount was ok.
bad,"A decision to classify the majority of employees as ""managers"" if they are involved with an area of the store is very misleading and makes it difficult to tell who is actually in charge or has authority over a project until you get to know everyone, if even then. People who work in a given area of the store are called ""managers"" even if they have no subordinates or authority. They manage an area of the store. Everywhere else, these people are called associates."
bad,"I was insulted many times by management. When I would perform quickly and efficiently, with a smile on my face, I would be taken off of the floor to be told of my horrendous performance when I was one of the quickest cashiers. I mentioned my autism, and that just made my work environment worse."
bad,"Management are beyond some of the worst people I have ever met in my entire life. Somehow the only people that are worse are the cascade of stupid and rude customers that you will deal with on a daily basis."
bad,Everything about Walmart's are true in ways but from my experience with mangers & higher up management was just upsetting. Discrimination against people with disability's was always a number 1 priority for a corporation like walmart. They are nasty people but there are some good workers/Mangers who care about the lower degraded workers.
bad,only allows 3 sick days in 6 months or you get fired do i have to say more. they give bad hours and treat you like trash to throw out when  they are done with you
bad,"This company is ideal for a person who needs a part time job during the time they are going to school or other situations. However the other side of this coin is very dark. There is really no guidance given to in store management and communication from op to bottom, is almost non-existent."
bad,I believed Wal-Mart was an excellent company to work for until the past 2 years. The management team does not show any care or concern for their associates. They no longer communicate with their teams about important things that would directly involve their team.
bad,"Awful managers, never receive hours or scheduled in days you are not available. Typical work night is you clock in, work freight until 5am, zone, and then go home."
bad,Retail. What can I say? Working at Walmart was horrible. Your treated like dirt and required to be polite to horrible customers. Thank God it was only a temporary job for me.
bad,The managers barley knew what they were doing. Disrespectful to there employees by swearing at them or giving people write up for no reason. And just a very toxic environment.
bad,it is a big company but sometimes manager dont  take care of their employees that are the ones that  makes the company what it is .. also they want to give good service to costumer  but dont want to have the group of people that is neccesary
bad,"With the retail industry hemorrhaging for money they have gone the way of reducing the number of workers, inserting new process after new process, and telling the few workers who remain that these processes will make the same work doable with fewer people. You are expected to do more, in less time, and are rarely rewarded for your effort. The pay is competitive but still not worth the abuse from the increasingly volatile customer base, or the Management team that would rather throw you under the bus than deal with the reality of time not making sense for the job they want done."
bad,the work can be hard and small amount of benefits. Job security is very low. Pay is low and hours are low. You need to be in and out of this place. You may need another job as well.
bad,to many young managers and to many young kids working front of house so more dependable older workers have to fill in when kids take day after pay day off
bad,We all know Walmart and what they provide and what they lack. There really isn't too much to say other than just don't work there unless you have to and its the only job you can take.
bad,"Clock in have start up meetings as to where you will be placed for that day from your managers meeting, the hardest part of your job is making production/being productive enjoyable part is taking your breaks"
bad,"open cash office, count down previous days money, set up front end and service desk, make deposit, handle armored car service for deposit and checking in monies ordered, make all cash bags for next day, order money, do paperwork, write schedule (when applicable)"
bad,"If you had a good manager the night was relaxed."
bad,"I was hired as holiday help in a college town. I didn't last long lets say. The training was very long and continuous but I thought that was pretty helpful. "
bad,"The only way to do that is by completely opening your schedule, otherwise you get the dregs. To make matters worse, hours were cut, so you were lucky to get what you can. Low sales, heavily impacted by people not coming in, being short staffed, or poorly thought out schedules. Having a full house during the day, but only one or two people to close in Apparel means nothing can ever stay clean or organized."
bad,they didn't want to work with you on any thing the customer was always right you had no say in any matter. Working on the phone was not so bad  that's all i have to say on this matter.
bad,"Typical work day involved clocking in and beginning shift with left over work from previous shift while waiting for supervisor/ dept. manager or usually co workers to arrive late. "
bad,Walmart es una buena empresa solo que no mantienen firma su cultura
bad,It was a third shift job and required that I stock shelves on my knees. after awhile I couldn't take it. I asked for a job change but couldn't get one.
bad,Walmart is not a bad place to work for young kids in college. Walmart doesn't offer career options and only hires part time there and they honestly work people to death.
bad,"In Public, Walmart is a pretty good place to work."
bad,"despite of being boring & tedious, wal-mart was my first job. however, i learned a lot about working hard and being consistent every night no matter what."
bad,"This started out as a summer job, but when I tried to leave when school started back, they liked me and a summer job, turned into 6 years.  I was there just for pocket money, but learned a lot while there."
bad,"I was in the meat department in Wal-Mart, this is the hardest job at the store. The pay however is the same as a cashier or door greeter, they really should pay more for this dept."
bad,Most of my time in Walmart was spent working without anyone around. if you plan to be an overnight stocker at Walmart don't expect to have much company or a job that will interest you.
bad,"Me personally, Walmart isn’t a bad place if you can manage to get on first shift. Second and third isn’t for my lifestyle because of my family and I’m needed to be home during the night."
bad,"Been working for Walmart for 6 years now. Just recently ,7 months ago transferred to Walmart 6088. I really feel that the production is way out of hand. We are asked to unload trailers with only hand jacks but Freight weighs to two 300 lb pulling and pushing it in and out trailers. If we had better equipment to work with maybe production wouldn't be such a problem."
bad,Employees made inappropriate and rude remarks which made working there unpleasant.  Several threats were made toward me in regards to my position that made me me feel uncomfortable.
bad,i have nothing to say about walmart . i got hurt on the job and when i had to be moved to light duty they treated me differently although i told them i was fine and even worked four hours not being fine because we was low staff that day and as much pain as i was in those four hours i acted fine because i loved my job and managment is terrible.
bad,My problem wasn't really with the people i worked with but the company its self. Worked at two different stores and at each one management would under cut the employee. Management would tell you to do one thing than turn around and right up that action.
bad,"I would not recommended working for Walmart or go back to Walmart. The reason is you can not balance working and having a family really well, the stress is really high, the management do not communicate with each or with you well, and when your think your doing something right you get chewed out for not doing it right. I tried to advance my career when I did work there and always got excuse why I could not or got told that I can have then got told that someone else got the position.The only go thing I got out of was the benefits and money ."
bad,"cant be sick at all or high chance of losing job lots of standing and working on hard flooring, management sucked, other workers were cool though. hours were okay."
bad,"First of all, expect to be treated very poorly by customers. And depending on the store, by the management as well. The first store I worked at was tolerable due to supportive co-workers and a positive management team. The other (last) store I worked at was unbearable because everyone was burnt out and didn't care about anyone but themselves anymore (including management)."
bad,"When I came into Walmart, I clocked in and went to the apparel section first. I would keep the section I was assigned up my whole shift. Folding clothes and assisting customers in finding what they are searching for. Then, when we got busy I would go to a register and help customers get a faster check out. I handled large amounts of money and needed to have a positive attitude. (which was not a problem! :))"
bad,Typical day started at 6 am and ended at 3 pm. Management was never really in communication with the workers or other assistant managers. The workplace culture is okay but a lot of gossip goes around because people love to stir up drama. The hardest part of the job was trying to do the job without having all of the equipment I needed at ant given time. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with the vendors and drivers.
bad,The work environment can be stressful and overwhelming but the work can be broken down if you have the patience to learn. If you set your mind to it you can get promoted fairly quickly. In this job it is best to keep your opinions about anything to yourself.
bad,What I learned at Walmart is how to stock shelves and zone departments.
bad,If the store I was in followed process it might not be as bad. Mangers try to make you feel guilty when you don't stay past your regular time. Also they don't make in effort to stop all the drama so hatered  festers in the store.
bad,"management is poor at this store, entire management team needs to be replace with new managers with the capabilities to ensure employees are taken care of."
bad,"I would recommend Wal-Mart. Wal-mart was always good to me. I learned a lot about who i am by working at wal-mart.Pay was good, but wish it could have been more for what I was responsable for."
bad,"Worked 3 different times at Walmart, management was very young there seem  to be to many of them, stocking  over-nights was rough but was able to transform organize the Infant Dept.allowing more room for new items. Pay was poor for Over-Night work."
bad,"Walmart pays a little better than most retail but they show very little concern or loyalty to their ""associates"". The job came when I really needed it and I am greatful for it, but over all the experience has be disheartening."
bad,"Because of the bad management this job was stressful and difficult. Management was rude and difficult to work with for employees and customers alike. Out of all my different workplaces, this was by far one of the worst of them."
bad,The company itself would be better if they care more about their employees. Management isn't very nice to the other workers beneath them. They should understand a little more about family and family things happen. They are disrespectful when you're nice as can be. I liked my department that I worked. But just no room for advancement unless you know someone.
bad,"I enjoyed working at Walmart only because of the other employees."
bad,"very poor, too ,many chiefs not enough indians, management sucks, they overlook employees who have more to offer. i do not encourage people to work here who are looking for advancement,"
bad,Not the best place for a first job if you have bills.  Have to constantly beg for hours unless your on cap 2 or overnights. Other than that horrible job.
bad,You work hard all the time.  Day in and day out.  You will need to be as cut throat and a very hard driven person with a thick shell to succeed.  I did this job for 25 years successfully and was rewarded with having my job eliminated.
bad,"if youre not a people person dont try and if you have a lot going on in life or college dont try it , not good for their target age group. they are not good at working around your life style"
bad,I can recall m typical work day as stress ful at times the supervisor was unprepared and spoke unprofessionally . they did not care whether customers heard you being addressed in that fashion. You had to walk on eggshells because you never knew which supervisor would be snapping at you. the assistant managers were less than compassionate when a complaint was made about a supervisor. management stuck together against the associate. If you were not liked your chances for promotion would be very unlikely. Your ability to get the job done was not what mainly mattered. Who liked you and your character determined your climb up the corporate ladder. The hardest part of my job was to get all the chiefs on one accord so I could fully accomplish my work for the day. Too many chiefs speaking at the same time.  What I learned to cope was to confirm what I was assigned and begin doing it as soon as I could. I learned a great work ethic about time and attendance.
bad,The way Walmart has declined in the past few years I would not want to return there in any capacity. The closing of multiple stores and low wages are meant for part-time high school kids with no responsibilities to manage.
bad,"I was a cake decorator. I loved doing that job but because I was the newbie, they had me doing things that were not in my job description and refused to pay me accordingly."
bad,"Any position has its pluses and minuses, but;  Walmart is a cult that drives you perpetually through many unnecessary hoops. Walmart is a CULT. You will pray aloud to Walmart each and every shift in a group setting. I would avoid that place like I would a leper colony. I have much respect for those trapped in working there as they obviously have a high tolerance for BS and nowhere to go. Need I expound?"
bad,"Unprofessional environment with poor leadership and culture. Leadership is demeaning to everyone below them and find fault with everything. Company does help with growth and development unless Directors like you. People are not promoted unless they apply for open positions where selection process, as well as evaluations, are very subjective and biased, if they like you. Communications are not consistent and associates are often misled or lied to in order to control them."
bad,"If you have a family to support I dont suggest working here. They dont hire full time. Hours are all over the place and you wont ever have a weekend again. Like holidays? Forget it, and dont expect to get time and a half for working a holiday either. Need time off, make sure you request it 3-4 weeks in advance but there is no guarantee that you will actually get the requested time. It is a good job for someone in high school just trying to make a little cash. Not so great when you have bills to pay, if I werent married and having the help of my spouse I would be homeless because I dont make enough money to support myself and I get scheduled such weird hours finding a second job is next to impossible."
bad,There is no job security. They expect you to do all the work of 10 people. They don’t train properly. They won’t help you grow and learn to become the next position needed.
bad,"Walmart is a large busy retail store, if you plan to stay long and work hard you can make it up the ladders with this company. If you work as employees in the store there isnt any paid vacations. only good to stay with them if you plan on heading that career path. Upper management in this company make really good money but it is still fast pace for them too."
bad,"Poor systems and competitive business environment,"
bad,Very poor management that will not support you. Will ask you to do work that you have not been hired for and that you should not be doing. Employees with many years of service do not give any help to new employees.
bad,Unprofessional environment and culture with poor communication. No consistency in policies. The management are always in meetings and never available.
bad,"You don't get to spend time with your family during the holiday season.  They work well with college students and their school schedules, but don't expect to get approved time off to see your family during holiday season if you are from out of town and just in that area for school."
bad,"Walmart was very stressful, the people their are very rude and they don’t care if your sick or have school! Management only really care about their self but no matter what i always went to work with a smile on my face and made sure the customers were happy and had everything they needed."
bad,"This company is regularly cited for having poor management and an inconsiderate culture, so I will primarily leave that alone. The biggest problem with this company is the inconsistency in promotions. The company regularly gives promotions to people simply because they threaten to quit. This is not an exaggeration. One of the corporate measures for a store is the employee turnover, and because of this good employees are often taken advantage of and given nothing while mediocre employees are handed promotions. The pay is also unreasonable. It is far beyond common to have 10 year employees making the same amount as people that just got hired. Raises are annual, but the amount is negligible at best."
bad,"This workplace fits the stereotype of too big to fail. Management barks unreasonable commands at the supervisors who bark it at the associates. As an associate, it is nearly impossible to move up the ladder. It almost seems like the company doesn't want you to get a raise. No matter how hard of a worker you are and how much you work by-the-book, management will always find faults in your work."
bad,"they didn't treat you with respect "
bad,When I worked at Walmart all I wanted to do was leave. I hated every single part of being there. The managers where always b*tchy and always picked favourites.
bad,I would go in everyday and put up with stupid question. some people really know how to ask dumb question. I didn't have time for the stupidity that was going through that place so I had to get out.
bad,Overall the place to work was not the worst. I think they need to work on having a better relationship between employees and their managers. I did not feel like I could go to them for anything.
bad,"Working for Walmart is very stressful. The pay is good, but they fell like they can treat you any kind of the way. The head management talks to you and kind of way. And they do not treat all people equally."
bad,Management picked their favorites and treated the associates like they were not human beings. They acted as though they were better than you. Only a few management were great.
bad,"Walmart's just culture is a farce. They will stab you in the back any chance they get, even if your the roll model employee. Management is all about CYOA mentality."
bad,"Working here was a lot fast. Management was very poor and it felt like everyone was working off of, "" I was told to do so&so and I'm only going to do that."" Careless, Mindless, and heartless mentality. No one really goes out of there way to help a customer or employee."
bad,Wal-mart is a good job for someone out of high school to work while in college or other type of schooling. The pay was not great when I started out at overnight stock.
bad,It used to be a great place to work and advance but within the past 4 years it has become all about politics and the bottom dollar for the company. The employees are seen as nothing but a number and are not valued for the sacrifices they give the company.
bad,start off as cashiering have about 8 years of experience before working at Walmart in feel that they could of started me off with pay a lot higher then went into accounting then got a 10 cent change in pay.
bad,"The management staff is unfair and shows favoritism. The scheduler makes many mistakes. Employees are not all treated the same. I liked my fellow associates and we tried to work together as a team, which management said they wanted us to do; but in actuality, management did not allow true team work."
bad,"I have worked for Wal-Mart twice and both experiences have been underwhelming at best and hair ripping levels of infuriating at worst."
bad,"It's Walmart so its pretty much exactly what you'd expect. If you're a people person you can deal with the rushes pretty okay, but honestly some customers forget that it's a Person on the other side of the counter. Leaning or sitting down are considered ""unprofessional."" By whom it is considered unprofessional is never specified. Employees are nice to each other (dry humor abounds) but everyone is Very vocal about how much they hate their jobs and makes it very difficult to try to stay positive while in the work place. Walmart does provide solid hours and decent pay. They make for a good reference, especially if you've had a ""gap"" between jobs. Walmart is always hiring."
bad,"It was an easy job and I didn't mind it but the pay is very low and they started me off with a full time schedule, then once they raised our pay from 10.50 to 12.50, they cut my hours to where I was only working like once or twice a week"
bad,"Wal Mart Super center hires anyone that applies for a job."
bad,Depending on your needs in employment it can be a good job. You get to be a big help to some people but other things such as communication between manager and employees could improve as well as benefits and just they way they treat hard working employees could improve entirely
bad,"They have long since taken off since I did not pursue them after my internship ended.  Now that Amazon is on the scene, things may be change at Walmart."
bad,"The management was the worst part about walmart for me, constantly wasting time having everyone run around the store only to redirect you 15 minutes later. The situation was very unorganized, and you would constantly be berated as a team when something wasn't done, regardless of if it was your fault or not."
bad,"They would work around almost any schedule, but when you were at work, they would make sure you worked every moment you were there.  If you did not, you can expect a manager in your face within 15 minutes."
bad,Sometimes Walmart needs to consider the associate before making changes in policy and procedures.  New changes have not been better than the old ones.
bad,"Walmart is a great company its self but when it comes down to ""working""  it may not be the very best place. Its sad when you have children and you have to choose stay at home with my sick kid and possibly get fired or go to work and leave my kid home alone sick.."
bad,"Walmart advertises itself as a place you can work to be part of a team. They claim to offer advancement opportunities, but too frequently work is placed on the shoulders of only a few and promotions are given to the wrong people."
bad,The management at the last store I worked at was bad . From the vision center dept manager all the way up to the store manager .I wouldn't advise anyone to work for that store ever!!!
bad,"I can't speak for all Walmarts... but the management at the one I worked at was AWFUL. They would stand around talking or just not even be on the floor when an associate needed help with a customer. And it's very obvious managers play favorites. They talk to each other on Snapchat / Facebook, a line that should never be crossed to be honest. It doesn't matter how hard you work. It's just a matter of how much they like you. Oh, and if you're sick and need to be out for a few days, sucks to be you. They don't excuse doctors notes. I guess you have to lose a limb to even get an excused absence."
bad,"Check products for quality, identify damage or expired goods, set oven temperatures and adjust temperature controls, pull the floor, prep the bread, pull bread from the freezer to prepare for next day, maintain clean work space, and prepare labels."
bad,"In my experience working for the Walmart Distribution Center, we had long hard hours daily and if anyone was hurt, they were blamed. Associates were mistreated. Within a month we had six of our best employees leave due to poor management."
bad,"I will keep it brief. Until WalMart gets rid of of the Ops Managers, there will be no improvement there. "
bad,At the time I worked for Walmart the store was going through major upper management changes.  This created a very stressful environment. It was not possible to meet the expectation of all management.  After I left the company almost all upper management was replaced.
bad,i worked a lot and very hard for not a lot of pay. a lot of workers on my team were mad about that. i had to do do the most work there for only $10 an hour and it was not enough.
bad,My review of Walmart is that it can be a great place to work if management would be far and follow the policy and procedure it could be a great place to work. I think if you don't kiss management tail you're going to get terminated. It's too many clicks in management and associates not professional at all.
bad,it was a great place to work to meet new people but as far as management it was bad. the managers picked favorites and it would affect how others work day went.
bad,Es una empresa multicultural donde no han sabido utilizar esta herramienta de forma adecuada.
bad,Management was terrible. They were very pushy and love to micro manage. When needed they take a really long time to respond then complain on being called.
bad,Transfer never happened and was wrongfully terminated for it. Will never work here again. I will never recommend this to any one. Never ever. I hate walmart.
bad,"I believe Understaffing issues negatively affects all parts of their business. However, Walmart has increased their minimum hourly rate with hopes to attract more committed employees, and retain better employees. I know Attendance is huge to this company as is all businesses, If you do mess up your chances with Walmart you will be asked why you quit or got fired from the number one retail store and thatwould look bad on the employee."
bad,if you like having one boss to tell you to do something then another come by and tell you to stop that and start on this then the first one comes back and wants to know why you havent finished what they wanted done so you get wrote up then the second one comes by and does the exact same thing
bad,"Just a stressful job they expect you to do your job AND the job of 5 other people. You hardley ever have the proper tools to do the job the correct way. And the new scheduling system isn't helping you at all, just helping the corporate. They really dont care about their employees"
bad,"I was an department manager. My job in its self was fine but dealing with the upper management was a chore and very difficult. They treated you badly and expected you to be there when ever they call. I was told once that my family is not important, only my walmart family was important!!"
bad,"Walmart uses a point system that is integrated with your sick time which I highly disagree with because in the event of an emergency, if one does not have ""points"" then a person would be conflicted with taking care of ones health or going to work.  They also pay the unloaders terrible.  10 dollars an hour to do back breaking work while people in the front on cash registers in customer service make about 12 dollars.  Even a deli associates are making more than the people who are the reason why the store has product to move.  I was told I couldn't leave my position because I was A: good at it and B: they needed to find someone to fill my position.  I waited 3 long months and it appeared that no one even remembered my request, so I put in for a transfer and still nothing.  I was told so many different excuses before another employee and myself just found other jobs and left.  They won't give out overtime and you're technically working a 9 hour shift, you just get a 1 hour break.  Also, you can't have the PTO you worked so hard for if you don't stay for a year, so it's practically worthless unless you plan on staying a while.  Also, my raise was only 18 cents.  It's a shame how employees are paid and treated."
bad,"Every day I had to track my departments sales and know the top 10 best selling items sales vs last year, perform price changes, assist customers,stock all freight from the nightly truck, conduct satey sweeps, put anti theft devices on required merchadise, clean and organize the department, scan any low merchandise and remove from back to fill the shelves, correct the counts on all merchadise, place any overstock in backroom using the correct prcedures, review schedules,help other departments as needed, make sure all price signage was correct and displayed in the proper manner,order low stock items, attend meetings, complete daily scan reports and turn in before leaving,and everything else needed to track and sell merchandise."
bad,"A typical day at Walmart is stocking the shelves, watering the plants, running the cashier, pushing carriages, and carry out orders from the department manager. I learned how to properly help customers. The hardest part of the job would be pushing carriages in the parking lot due to the potential hazards."
bad,"Too much to do, not enough help. Lots of gossiping. Some co workers are not team players. Managers do not take complaints seriously and don't take care of problems."
bad,"During my 5 years at Walmart I worked 2 positions. The first was inventory processing and the next was training coordinator. Overall working for Walmart isn't difficult work to do. However, management makes it very difficult to get anything down. We consistently had to change our daily routine to compensate for which manager was on duty. There was no communication between members of management."
bad,"Unless you are full time or a manager this place will run you into an early grave, Overworked, understaffed, extremely rude management staff, lack of communication, so busy there is no time to have good customer service"
bad,"it was ok. very chaotic and fast paced . didnt really learn anything. management was terrible, not understanding or kind at all. workplace was hostile and unclean."
bad,going to the doc and if your sick actual they need to rasise the point system cause you never know whats going to happen in life and you don't need to worry about loseing your job in the process
bad,This job isn't very good. Managers are very unfair people and the workplace environment is unrewarding. A typical day at work everyone wants something and you are the goat who has to go do it.
bad,"The work itself is easy, most customers are relatively pleasant. The coworkers are unbearable. Only work here if you're desperate, and make sure to always keep your items locked up. I've had coworkers steal items from my coat pocket in the break room and the store couldn't do anything about it. Expect to hear statements against minorities on a regular basis. Supervisors also got away with harassment and favoritism with no penalties, and many employees took 30 minutes on their 15-minute breaks. Holiday discounts and bonuses are decent, though."
bad,"I worked in the vision center and enjoyed my co-workers.  The pay was entirely too low for the expectation of the position.  Employees who work in sensitive areas such as health and wellness, who could potentially face fines or criminal charges if they do something accidentally wrong, should not be compensated the same as the people who work at the jewelry counter.  Regardless of education level, Walmart still won't pay higher for better educated individuals which is really sad."
bad,It was a nice place to work I loved to go to work everyday when I worked there from 01 to 07. Went back to school. Worked other jobs then I went back in 2013 and it was a horrible experience it went from great atmosphere to power hungry management . I didn't feel the same caring about their associates place it seems to be just about is profit now.
bad,"A few things I was able to take away from this company: being a servant leader means more to your people than you know. You learn how not to act from customers and associates alike. You appreciate certain holidays more than others, only because the crowds aren't as terrible."
bad,"I enjoyed helping different customers and meet with new coworkers. However, the management was not as good. there are some supervisors and managers that were not qualified, they had a negative effect on the work environment."
bad,"A typical day at work for me is very structured. I have specific instructions to follow and am allowed a certain amount of time to complete tasks. At Walmart I learned how to work at a fast pace, and stay focused on the task at hand. The management at my store isn't terrible. However, there are some people in management that act very unprofessional, and don't always do the right thing. "
bad,"They have more people picking groceries than they do dispensing groceries so it gets really busy trying to dispense. This also makes it so many people don't get their breaks and lunches on time if they get one at all. There are few benefits and mandatory holiday labor but there is no holiday pay, over time, or time and a half."
bad,I would not go back to this company ever. They did not pay well they worked your hind end off and the people you work with are about the only good thing about the place.
bad,Bad experience overall stressful place to work at and too many problems with managers not treating cashiers right.not being fair and just being very rude and not understanding
bad,What can you really say that hasn't already been said.  Walmart views its employees as disposable and you can tell. It is a job though and its better than not having a job.
bad,"If you bust your butt at work and have a great work ethic, do not waste it here. Advancement is hard unless you are friends with management. Their friends get first pick, even if you have previous manager experience and education backing you for the position. However, once they are aware of how hard you work and your work experience, they will use you with the promise of advancement to get you excited and then it does not happen. Also, you can work full time hours and never be bumped into full time to be able to receive benefits."
bad,"The job its self was great, a little stressful at times. Most of the people were nice others not so much. Poor Management. No over time or it got taken away."
bad,Many things I have to say are very identifiable. Consistently had vacations denied. Far too stressed out. Expected to run a half of a store. Not always fully trained for my job. Had a difficult time with a select few customers getting too aggressive for things out of my own control. No weekends off at all No holidays off.
bad,"What I learned is that the adage is correct - ""if you must put your values up on the wall, then something is terribly wrong with your culture"". The valued resource is meeting the Street's value, not the associates."
bad,"Is not a bad place to start, after completing your pathways in 6 months is when you start gaining benefits, you get 10% discount on non groceries, 401k, medical, vision and dental. If you're a full time employee. Depending on the store you get work, you'll possibly see a bonus."
bad,"-A typical day at work is ok at time but feel like upper management can't be please."
bad,"little to no room for advancement, inconsistent hours and scheduling, poor management non communicative with little review, not a comfortable work environment, poor to no training,"
bad,"I learned how to manage more than 20 workers at one time, being I was in charge of an entire section. This has helped me in terms of how to manage individuals properly."
bad,"-you are constantly required different things"
bad,My experience wasnt great there. Theres no advancement. No benefits at all. It just seemed like they had there picks there of who they wanted to move up. They try to take advantage of you. Its the worse place ive ever worked at by far
bad,Used to be a great place to work but the corporate culture is quickly changing from associate focused to penny pinching. My position was eliminated two different times and while I was offered a new job at the same pay rate it feels like the rug is always being pulled out from underneath you.  Poor management has always been a problem as well and the managers are always passing the buck to lower level associates.  I was constantly doing tasks that were specifically management jobs.
bad,"Very stressful, management is too afraid to hold anybody accountable for their actions so there are a few good associates and a lot that they let get away with almost anything. They push the good workers harder and leave the ones who don't work alone. As a mid-level manager"
bad,Fitting room position was a very stressful job. There were at least five sales floor associates but there were still carts piled high with clothes for days at a time.
bad,a typical day at walmart is good the expectations for the day are set depending on the second shift associates or by management. management tends to only follow what they see its right to them some dont follow the companies standards. they tend to have favoritism over associates.
bad,"Been with the company 3 yrs. no holiday pay, no paid time off. Only time you get paid for days that you’re not there is when a family member dies & they have to be IMMEDIATE family. You get in trouble for EVERYTHING. Only See About 27 Hrs A week. If You hurt yourself lifting heavy cases you’re gonna Get in Trouble right Away. Just Not a Good Job If You have a Family. If you get sick you can’t bring a doctors note in or hospital note because that’s not a good enough excuse."
bad,I enjoyed my department manager there but the store manager is not good she plays favorites.. I enjoyed the department I was in and was doing good. It took me forever to move they say u can move whenever big lie.
bad,"Great Experience because how i was trained in as my store was getting a produce section. But shortly after, managers sucked and the good ones left to better jobs. They started looking for any reason to fire people and the environment got really sad. Soon everyone was replaced and promises of raises were only 3 cents every three months. So I left to pursue other things."
bad,"The managers are so rude, and they take forever when you need them. Everyone acts like your boss, terrible scheduling system, hectic environment. I can't wait to get out of here!"
bad,Me gusto el ambiente de trabajo pero muy difícilmente le dan oportunidades de crecimiento a personas con un grado de estudio superior.
bad,"Managers didn't give the unloaders enough help. They expected a small crew to unload a full truck in a short amount of time. One person talked all the time, but nothing was said to him. They tried to the others to make up for his lost time."
bad,The company is very stressful to work for. Managers treat employees very badly. No follow through on policies. Managers have favorites and clicks. Company does not pay good and expects employees to put job before family. Bonuses go to managers and upper executives within Walmart not to the employees who do the work.
bad,horrible management and they have no flexibility whatsoever. 10/10 do not recommend for students who cannot work full hours. I worked full 8 hour shifts on weekdays and weekends because they literally did not allow me to work 4 hour shifts.
bad,The location I worked at were filled with people from small towns. It was a very petty environment. People argued over positions that were assigned from higher ups. When reported to higher ups they did not do much to discipline. Because I was new I had 10 hour shifts was not allowed overtime and would actually get written up if you stayed later or left lunch a little early. Worked from 11am to 9pm or 8pm.
bad,"did not like the position or management, menial tasks,busy work,register work floor work no specific position or department,no management,leader,always changing staff department manager if one on duty. not firndly management but friendly co workers,display change and dept moing was confusing for staff and workers."
bad,Wal-Mart was hot every summer. Any other store in Cottonwood would be cool but not ours. Apparently the local managers had no control over the thermostats. It was all done from headquarters. It was particularly hot at the cash registers since there were 3-5 pop coolers within a 2 step reach of the cashiers.
bad,If it's your first job then Walmart is right for you but it's not a career choice. I would not work there if I didn't need the money for my children and house hold
bad,for a fast paced place like Walmart you would figure they would compensate their employees and pay them to what they do for the corporation. no real advancement unless you have been there forever. pay raises suck too.
bad,"This is a company thing, as a salary manager I was forced to work around 60-70 hours a week standard.  This was also highly stressful work and actually caused me physical and mental health issues.  Combined with very poor pay, especially considering the hours forced upon you, I just can't recommend this company to anyone."
bad,"Greeting people, stocking the shelves and assisting customers needs make up the working day, the best part of my day is interacting with the customers."
bad,It’s an okay place to work I wouldn’t recommend working there long term but it’s a good starter job and so on. They pay okay but don’t treat employees well
bad,"Company took away too many things from drivers no such thing as seniority company turning into a freight company too many live loads with substandard delay compensation before you were going no further than a 350 mile radius making very good money now you run into utah,Colorado and Wyoming it cool during summer months but who wants to drive in those states in winter month in ice snow on I 80 or Donna pass putting changes on company drop new hires pay to 38 cpm and theirs activity pay. Drivers looking at other companies I am leaving in a couples days the fear of them getting rid of the private fleet.The company has this notion that they want to slip seat all drivers.A lot of the new drivers and some old drivers are very nasty and dirty who like sleeping in a truck after another person.The company claims the changes are happening because of Amazon kicking their butt.The drivers are having accident every other day now no unity anymore it sad but this new era of things is expected.one more thing drivers think before coming on abroad 2 days home time no work life balance here and you will be slip seating no compensation at vendors until 45 minutes you give up for free than you compensate 14.00 hr that is slavery money the CEO don't give up free time when he is at work why should a driver. Walmart is not the place anymore to drive for."
bad,"Walmart is an alright place to work, But honestly people slack off on their jobs, the management is childish and they are biased against certain types of people. They pick their favorites and they are the one who get pay raises and such, Even if they are Poor workers."
bad,Walmart is a terrible company. Everyone treats their employees like trash just cause they work there and the staff/management is even worse. They don't care one bit about their employees just getting money from customers. And the customers are the worst and so trashy. They are so disrespectful. NOTHING was good about working at Walmart
bad,"Company not Bad. Management can't follow Company Programs. "
bad,After working third shift for many years I got to see a varied group of the populace.  Management was undertrained and under-enthused to help you or customers.
bad,"I don't like working for Walmart because of the varying of different shifts and long hours of standing. This place can be very stressful especially working at the door checking receipts and customers sometimes disrespecting you, that get old after a while. We are not appreciated in what we do, not even a hand shake from upper management."
bad,"Honestly, ive worked at 2 Walmarts and its disappointing how bad it got. Management was awful and wont show you respect, even if you know what youre doing"
bad,Walmart is terrible. where I was working the management was awful they do not care about they workers at all I did not get a raise while I was there. They will work you if you are sick and they don't take doctors notes at all
bad,"Walmart is an extremely stressful and unrewarding place to work. They're always under-staffed, which means you'll be working ten times as hard to do the work of multiple people by yourself. At my location I didn't receive proper training in my department, which meant that when I did something wrong, it was blamed on me despite my never having been taught in the first place. Additionally, upper-level management is a joke. The managers lack basic communication skills, and it shows. I often received conflicting orders from different managers simply because none of them have a clue. The workplace culture is a lot like that of a high school, because there are cliques and rumors and drama at every turn. The hardest part of the job here is working up the motivation to go in in the morning. The most enjoyable part is leaving at the end of the day. That being said, I wouldn't recommend working at Walmart to anyone with sense or better prospects. If you respect yourself, don't even bother applying."
bad,im not a fan of working there amd thats why i am looking for a new job. managers are really difficult understanding when things are happening to people and there are a lot of people that leave walmart because of the lack of support.
bad,This was tough job with a lot of walking and tough hours. Very fast paced environment and tough managers. No vacation time paid.  You have to move very fast.
bad,"Working at Walmart as an associate is pretty easy.  You don't get paid well and you don't get full time for a year or so.  As a department manager was better pay and better hours.  It could be stressful because there is always more work than help.  As a support manager was insane.  Walmart has such low margins that they really try to force every last ounce of work out of every underpaid, overworked employee they have.  I think the problem is Walmart cuts so many corners so the shareholders can make their profits.  It's basically one large pyramid with those on type living off the exploitation of those on the bottom--a metaphor for life in general."
bad,Overnight team was like a family- daytime team didnt communicate or follow what night crew needed done: resulting in lots of rearranging and wasted work hours.
bad,"Department manager did not help through training period. Sink or swim work style. Other employees leave to find things in the back for customers, never to be seen until it it break time. Store manager was always helping wherever he could."
bad,Scheduling manager was very rude when asked for specific days off and showed no sympathy to emergencies. When it came time for me to quit they did everything in their power to fire me. Not worth it unless they have a better managing team.
bad,"Usually a stressful day."
bad,"I would suggest walmart if you are desperate for a job. you barely get any hours. management sucks, pay is okay DOE. even being full time i dont get my 40 hours."
bad,I really think this place is terrible. The work culture is awful. Workers are cattle. Management would try to get all it could from its employees. Calling off was nearly impossible.
bad,The walmart I worked for was a poorly ran store. I was fired for self defense. Management didn't even investigate the situation just terminated me. One of my co-workers showed up to work under the influence and was allowed to keep their job.
bad,"I proactively set up all the registers i need for incoming cashiers, directing traffic to even the flow of customers. Filling change orders for front end registers and throughout the store.Completing multiple register overrides and audits. listening to and addressing  customer complaints and concerns.Supervising money center and service desk associates to ensure policies are followed. Supervising maintenance associates to be sure the customer has clean facilities and store to have a pleasant experience. Checking the parking lot and vestibules to be sure shopping carts are clean and ready for customers."
bad,"I was pregnant and they made me work over night lifting heavy boxes for weeks at a time. I had children at home as well. I never got sleep; I was pushed past my breaking points. I worked as a department manager for 2 destroyed departments, no help and was fired for hitting my 5th hour too many times."
bad,"For me, Walmart is a decent job but it felt like no matter what I did it wasn't good enough. I would rarely get recognized for all the hard work I would put into my job. It gets frustrating after awhile putting in so much hard work and not getting recognized for it."
bad,"i recommend no one come to the front end , it messy, very unprofessional ,  need better csms, everyone is lazy , no one there likes to work , im just being honest."
bad,They are not flexible with sick days regardless wither you have a doctors note or not. And will not give you the days off for family grievance unless you have 1 year or more.
bad,"You can learn a lot in Walmart as there are a lot of good projects and opportunities to work on those projects. "
bad,"If you want to be able to spend time with your family on holidays, or paid time off when you want or need it, look elsewhere. If you love doing other peoples jobs for them because they are too lazy, getting no recognition for your hard work, not being appreciated for what you do, and being paid slightly above minimum wage to do the same amount of work as a minor with no work experience or work ethic, then this is the job for you."
bad,Walmart is not a place I would recommend to work at. When i worked there they didnt offer their part time associates any benefits and they were not accommodating to schedules and families.
bad,"Typical day: Previous shifts leave their mess for the next shift."
bad,Management at my current walmart is terrible. They expect you to get the work of about 5 people done in a matter of an hour or so. Would not recommend if you cannnot work at a fast pace you will be fired or moved to another depatment if they want you.
bad,"You get to work, nothing was finished by the other shift, your manager is angry that nothing is done even though you just got there 12 minutes ago and are dealing with customers, and it's your fault that you can't do 6 things at once while still dealing with customers."
bad,"Management was terrible and only came around, at most, once a day. They are also quick to set you up to fail so you quit before they have to terminate you. Management will falsely terminate you and when you appeal and get your job back they act like nothing happened. "
bad,"Walmart is an interesting company to work for. If you work hard you will move up to various support positions. However, once you get the management level there is an unacceptable culture of working more than what is healthy for a work life balance."
bad,As a cashier I was constantly stressed with the registers that always broke and the constant adjustments that were required from the CSM's to make any sale correction. The time it took for a CSM to come and assist was never quick either
bad,very busy place the hourly pay is not worth it at all. the managers do not know what they are doing sometimes you do not get your breaks or luches on time. you have to work different departments.
bad,"On a typical day it may start off okay, but lack of communication between managers and associates. The hardest part is having hours cut, but i enjoy my customers."
bad,it was the worst place I have ever worked they wanted you to bend over backwards for them but they didn't do the same and also promoted people by who they were not by the work they do
bad,"lack of career advancement, been employed there for 10 years, role model associate. Political favoritism, harassed, never promoted. Very stressful work environment, had job responsibilities of, every area within the store, always short staffed, Management did not knowhow to speak to their people, or support them in any way. I learned job tasks of the whole store, auditing, cashiering, self check outs, accounting, service desk."
bad,Management treated all employees like they were dirt only there select few picks was the only ones that could do anything I just could work for people like that
bad,"Your job is never secure. stay on your toes, must be always on time and on point. don't call out too much, it can lead to getting fired. talk to management about hours if needed not supervisors."
bad,"The managers allowed discrimination and treated the employees as though they were replaceable by threatening their job on a daily basis. I can remember going to work every day and thinking that, that particular day might be my last day on the job because of something that the manager said or did."
bad,"If you looking for a job, this is for you.  If you are looking for a career, this is not for you.  To move up in this company based upon the location is very hard."
bad,"worst Job ever, very fast pace, managers do not help they rather take the side of he customer even if they are wrong. NO fixed hours, all over the place. hated it here"
bad,The company does not value its employees. They want to minimize overtime at all costs and don't want to pay benefits which is why they hire more part time employees.
bad,"I learned a lot at wal mart I know how to read floor plans,work Fork lifts and electric pallet jacks thanks to the training at Wal Mart I also know Invoicing and ordering"
bad,Working at Walmart is a transition job for me that I undertook because I like to help people in general. It is a perfect job for transitioning until I can find a job where I can fully utilize my skills and experience for a bigger impact.
bad,"Job was very boring, typically got lots of weird customer complaints.  Very low pay, and no paid time off.  Not very fulfilling job either.  Managers were hit and miss."
bad,Management team was very disrespectful to other employees never had help with any job tasks and the scheduling was unorganized my experience there was horrible
bad,"Management did not care about employees.  Management would not allow time off to attend school, nor would they be flexible with their schedule to accommodate employee."
bad,"It's just what you would think. Paid very little, offered terrible hours, and no hope of advancement. I would only consider working here as a last reort."
bad,"Pays extremely good but all the stress and drama isn't worth the pay. The rules are pretty forward, other then the whole wearing a vest thing and the credit card limit ."
bad,"At best this is a stepping stone job, management lied excessively about what was going to happen during and after remodel, especially about the amount of time you would be employed. Management at the store was very negative, discriminatory, and definitely not friendly for single working parents. This is not a family friendly job."
bad,"The atmosphere was pretty relaxed which gave some employees the thought that they didn't have to work, which left extra work for other employees. This made the job become stressful."
bad,"Its alright, ok hours, hardly any chance to advance, hardly any raises. Overall, very greedy.........."
bad,"Working at a walmart pharmacy is exhausting and I can see why people burn out. Compensation for pharmacist can seem fair, but I don't feel that it is based on the workload."
bad,"I loved working for them , till I got sick and couldn't make it to work because I was in and out of hospital for my own health problem . I got fire while  under FMLA . The option to part time or relocation of position wasn't afford to me .  Heart broken after 12 years giving them my all . It all got taking away like if I didn't matter but life goes on.After i while I wasn't really bad any more because it is retail and business till have to be run."
bad,Everybody is more concerned with judging you than concentrating on improving their own career. Most people including managers would rather talk behind your back than get some actual work done. I found it pathetic.
bad,"I was cheated out of last check. I was not informed until it was too late, that I could take an intermittent leave. They changed time in closing, my position and pay was lost."
bad,"When you think you're doing good, you get in trouble for not being fast enough. I worked in the back and had to search for product to go out onto the floor. It was very unorganized, it took way too long to find a certain product. It was way too complicated to work in the condition it was in. "
bad,"I was expected to do my job, which was call new clients for interviews, do background checks, and send them out for drug testing.  When hired, I did all orientation, all computer training and had each one lined up for on the job training.  I handed all their paper work, did new folders on each individual.  Handled bulletin boards with updated information and answered phones.  I was the Trainig Coordiator and I made 11.10 an hour."
bad,"Walmart used to be a family friendly business. They have become far from that. They aren't concerned with the needs of employees especially if you are full time and have benefits. They have been getting rid of older employees, or those who have benefits all to save a dollar in my opinion. They promote often based on who you know. There are times when they get it right. They had been hiring part-time workers who don't care about their jobs. So customer service slacks and other employees are over worked. There is job security if you come to work on time and don't call in."
bad,Managers do not take the time to know the employees. They switch managers too often. Expect people to work holidays and get little to no time off. Would not recommend.
bad,"fast and easy going, multitasking under stressful situations learning different tasks,clean ,neat,theres was nothing hard about the job, sastifying all my customers."
bad,The culture is terrible. Managers are expected to work long hours and seldom get days off.  As long as you are willing to sacrifice your everything for Wal-mart  you can advance.
bad,the place i worked was not great everyone was gloomy customers were rude and mangement didnt care about the workers at all! THey dont care about you life outside of walmart if you scheduled and you start school they want you to give priority to walmart and use excuses like if you cant balance work now how will you in the future! even though walmart is a stepping stone for most people onto greater and better things.
bad,"Never had all the items needed to stock shelves.  Managers were not cooperative about requested time off, even with over a month's notice.  Had to climb ladders on top of sheets of ice."
bad,"It's Walmart what can I say, people bounce through there all the time, I had some great supervisors and I had some not so great supervisors one of whom I did not get along with and was ultimately the reason for my leaving the company"
bad,The managers are horrible and not trained properly. Very uneducated some with no ged or high school diploma. Very poor people skills. Unable to properly supervise employees and too emotions. No care for employees safety.
bad,"a tyipical day at work consists of being given a set of tasks to perform through out the day based as need arrives, and unloading trucks at scheduled times, multiple supervisors with the same level of authority, and no clear upper management. tasks that were given to associates were often overridden by tasks given to the same associate by a different supervisor."
bad,I wouldn't recommend Wal-Mart as an employee based on the store I work at. The main issue is that they have a management vs associate mentality followed with complete neglect towards the company's policy. Unregulated discipline and short breaks combined with drama in an unprofessional manner. The only good from the store I'm at is the pay and benefits. They do offer better pay than most and benefits are good. Even with the good pay and benefits I would still consider better work environments and would only consider Wal-Mart a temporary solution.
bad,A typical day of work for me is coming in early mornings on time and start the hardest work first to make the rest of the day a little less stressful for the time spent there. I usually get a team mates help to knock out as much big work as possible in the most quickest productive way. Once work is done is checked and rechecked to make sure it is done correctly. The hardest part of the day is mornings or so often during evening time when the business is the busiest. This includes lifting concrete bags continuously for 3-4 hours back to back. Can be a little rough on the body. Specially on your wrist. The best part of any job is always making the customer happy. Seeing them smile and thank you for the time spent helping and giving time out of your work and day to just helping someone is something you just cant put a price on. Its priceless. :)
bad,"Overall not terrible, but the wages could be better and some management could be as well. People were fun to work with for the most part. Benefits weren't bad, but retail is working most hoildays and weekends."
bad,"I would say that overall this company is a job that you take simply for pay. They pay decently compared to other similar jobs but they do not create a safe and tolerable environment. Management is the sole issue in the fact that every decision made is not interpreted or passed on effectively to the next person. Anytime there is a mistake by a member of management, the store gets hurt; while anytime an associate makes a mistake, that associate and other associates are the punished. This company has policies set up to diminish shrink and this store will not flourish as long as it contains a store manager who blatantly disregards them. Among the main issues lies lazy workers, lazy sub-management, workers with substance abuse problems, and an ""Us VS. Them"" mentality among ALL workers."
bad,The management at the store I worked at reminded me of high school bullies. The store manager would never speak to anyone. The other managers weren't any better they had their picks and if a position became available management would give it to a friend instead of the most qualified person not professional at all.
bad,"got hired on and they mixed up the papers with another hire, sent us to different departments then what I was hired to do and then got fired for not knowing my job."
bad,"It was a decent place, but disrespectful managers. Okay people to work with, but lazy and slow. They showed favoritism among employees and treated the employees they didn't like trash."
bad,Os gestores tem q que ser exemplo para seus funcionários não se pode trabalhar sobre pressão isso interfere na vida pessoal e profissional também..
bad,"Wal-Mart can be a very fun place to work at you meet all sorts of different people, you interact with them to ask if they need assistance. Plus Wal Mart has everything you will ever need I know I shop there almost every other day."
bad,"I worked in several different departments. It is Walmart, it is a bit like working for a cult, the pay is not great, there were no benefits and I was glad when I found something else."
bad,"Overall, not a good place to work. They have very poor pay, worthless benefits and so many people hired in and out. If you want to be paid poorly for minimum amount of work, then this is the place to apply at."
bad,basically just a valueless cog in the wheel.  Treated like you are still in high school and yes they really do the walmart cheer at the beginning of your shift.  No consideration of the employee.
bad,Working for this Wal-Mart was very stressful and one of the most unenjoyably jobs for me. Management really didn't assist when needed and the store was very dysfunctional and unorganized.
bad,"Don't care about employees, pay is not enough for what is asked, management is terrible and does not listen to employee concerns, very hostile atmosphere"
bad,Constant strain on the body.  Management at the time was not respectable nor cared for employees. Too much work for little pay and benefits. Coworkers were friendly and helped when they could.
bad,This is a place to get money that is all.  The management people I had to deal with were horrible.  Only one person who in my opinion was racist.  I did have one great manager in the meat department and that is all I can say about it.
bad,This company does not give hours.  I got 4 hour shifts and tried ot transfer to a closer store for over a year and was refused.  I finely gave up and quit.  Overall this is an easy job and I did like it but I can not live on 4 hour shifts when it costed more in gas to drive there and back 4 or 5 days a week.
bad,"Wasn't happy with the work environment, training at this store was poor, was almost injured by coworkers carelessness twice.  Was working there temporarily."
bad,Job was alright over all but management didn't know what they were doing half the time. Maintenance position was about team effort but the people there didn't know what that meant .
bad,The employees are nice but anyone above CSM is on a power trip. The pay is okay the hours are nice but the hours in which you are scheduled in are extremely random and getting a day off is almost impossible to do. Attendance is handled by a broken point system that will get you terminated unless the manager likes you.
bad,the place is nice to work in workers are nice management needs to be replaced constant harassment on workers pressure intimidation and persecution most enjoyable part of the job in that place is working alone in the afternoons without a manager driving you nuts.
bad,"I  would get to work get my register do a count and people would be standing in my line already fussing as me to hurry,I did learn how to be patient with people there and that has brought me a long way,management was awful,and workplace culture wasn't good at that time,the hardest part of my job there having to report on a fellow co worker for theft,but my enjoyable part of my job was being able to help others."
bad,working for Walmart is ok I think they can do better with the hours make them flexible to other with school and other with kids. I feel everyone should get a chance to move up in the company not just mangers and everyone should  feel appericate in the company and she be able to get rewards for there good customer services and for the good work
bad,Not enough staff and tired of working as if I'm 3 people. They don't care if you have a doctors note they will still hold you accountable for being sick.
bad,"El ambiente laboral es pesado no hay mucho trabajo en equipo, los jefes no prestan mucha atención ha su equipo, el tiempo extra es obligatorio."
bad,"Era agradável apesar das jornadas duplas sem bater ponto, o desviu de função e sobrecarga horária. Associados mal treinados."
bad,"Typical work day included dealing with uncooperative management staff, poor quality training environment, constantly moving vehicles in a timely manner, and handling customer complaints"
bad,"I love being a cashier but working at Walmart was one of the hardest jobs. The management doesn't care all that much for their employees. One night I drove into a ditch and when I called in, the first question was not, ""Are you okay?"" In fact, talking to one of my managers that was never asked. Several people hit on me and nothing was ever done nor did anyone ever speak to them. I had surgery done to remove my wisdom teeth and was so swollen and in so much pain and was unable to make it to work, and Walmart almost counted it against me!! Not a friendly place to work."
bad,"You will never advance, they will not classify you as full time yet will work you 39.5 hours a week just so they do not have to provide insurance to you."
bad,"I did not enjoy my time as an employee at Walmart. I was a student during my employment and had a nearly impossible for schedule even when i was told they'd work with my school schedule during the hiring process. Breaks were unusually short for the long work days. Sometimes a 10 hour shift for horrible pay, $7.75"
bad,Always worried about whether or not you'll have a job the next day. Managers always choose favorites and the job is unfair to those who work hard vs those who don't
bad,"greeted customers, assisted customers, and answered phone questions. built end caps, floor resets, and stocked product. provided customer service to customers."
bad,"For a lack of better words, Worst job i have ever held. The managers are all arrogant extremely angry people. And dont even think about asking for a day off."
bad,"A empresa Walmart infelizmente não cumpre com o que ensina em seus treinamentos, tendo uma liderança  de carrascos que constantemente humilham seus funcionários na presença  de clientes  e terceiros, proporcionando um péssimo ambiente de trabalho  e prejudicam o estado mental dos funcionários."
bad,I would not recommend anyone who is looking for a career to work in the Walmart I worked in.  Hours were not stable and management made decisions without consideration for staff even though they talked about the team concept.  Team concept didn't exist.
bad,"Working out on the parking lot was fun.  But once I moved up to inside the store, it was difficult to deal with over a dozen different managers who all wanted different things.   8.00 an hour for a department manager position was not worth it."
bad,Management only cared about the bottom line they didn't value their employees. They played a lot of favoritism games and did not take employee complaints serious enough.
bad,Working part time is a fine position for a high school or college student. Working full time is laborious for low compensation. Middle management was often criticized and took there frustrations out on associates.
bad,"The company don't value you as an employee, they treat you with no respect. You cant request time off for important family events. worst place someone cant work"
bad,"This company has a terrible corporate culture. I have worked at three different store locations, and each one is the same. The old saying of stuff rolling downhill is 100% accurate in describing the management structure."
bad,A typical day includes having a long list of impossible tasks to complete by certain times and also with short staff. Management breathing down your neck all day and nick-picking about every little thing. There's so many rules and restrictions. Very little pay and high demand and work load.
bad,"Managers was fond of blaming employees under them to their superior when tasks were not done neglecting to tell superiors that they were giving employees the work of 2 people, manager tasks included. They don't care about your scheduling needs, they demand open availabilty. They will only give you part time work so they don't have to give you benifits."
bad,"I loved working there."
bad,"Although it was pleasant to work there one the first month, after a while promises that were made to me during hiring were broken, and work became unpleasant."
bad,"The store I had worked for was alright, there was a lot of favoritism, so if the managers didn't like you there was no advancement even if you were a hard worker, and the hours were not ideal if you have a family. if you absolutely need a job, go for it. I worked there until I found something better."
bad,This place treated you unfairly completely . you were spoke to rudely by management. some coworkers were mean and caddy . people were lmiserable there. definently overworked and underpaid for what you were doing. they fabricated things to write you up. i worked their twice and hated it .
bad,"The only good thing I like about Walmart, is they work on your schedule other than that i cant say anything much in particular...."
bad,"ever since the management shift up there the place just dropped in quality no one enjoys their jobs anymore it is just a chore, the management is ridiculously strict and demands everything from cashiers while giving nothing in return i would only return if completely desperate"
bad,"overall managers were indecisive, confused and  didn't talk to each other which left you doing things multiple times to suit multiple managers as no 2 wanted it the same way. coworkers were nice and often informative. liked the hours I was given."
bad,Stress filled hectic and no one carries about you they demand results now. they love to B!t** moan and complain about everything you do wrong and say not a thing about what you do right
bad,Although I will say Walmart does pay pretty well compares to most other retail companies that is THE ONLY thing I will say positively about this company. It is a company that is all about the politics. All about who you know. Very unethical.
bad,"I like to work with customers, every day I keep learning something new about the job.  Like to help others and keep everything in my area clean and organized."
bad,They show Favorites and have negative and nasty attitudes...they try to set u up for failure..pick and try to provoke you...talk bad about everything and everyone..I hate this job!
bad,Walmart is a fairly chaotic place to work. Management is somewhat clueless but all of the cashiers were super nice. I found it to be a depressing environment in the store but it is a great entry level cashier job. People are very accepting of you learning as you go. The training was good as well.
bad,you don't get paid well for the things you put up with it not the best to work.. but if you need to get a quick job then yea its the a ok place to be just don't stay there to long
bad,"I worked for Wal-Mart for only about a month and not by any choice of my own. The job itself is easy, come in, do your job (whatever that may be) and then clock out for lunch, go back to work, clock out, leave. The problem with the company is that it's policy with sick leaves is terrible and they don't properly train people for what to do to properly file for a sick leave. Because of this, I lost my job."
bad,"I applied for a management position, but it seemed the management program favored younger workers.  "
bad,"At my location, promotion was hard sought and rarely rewarded. At the time, there was no cohesiveness, some bitterness, and little show of companionable togetherness among the team. It was rare to receive full time unless you worked night shift, so you can obtain benefits after you've been there several months and years, depending on the type you need. Turnover was high, management was hit-and-miss communicating or helpful, depending on the person. Not a lot of togetherness or a feeling of teamwork enforced among the group, but we made do on our own and worked as a team to make ourselves more efficient. Eventually we got more inclusion managers and departments worked well with us. I really enjoyed having a lot to do and learn, helping out managers when I can do to their turnover and need for more hands to lighten the load. Overall, a worthwhile experience, ups and downs are a given anywhere, but more than likely you will have to make your own job satisfaction."
bad,Falta de comprimento com as normas da empresa....nao tinha bom trabalho em equipe.
bad,Turnover altissimo gerando clima de insegurança e insatisfaçao.
bad,"At times customers can be very rude and  at times hostile. Management is often times inconsistent in adhering to company policies, which encourages customers to act out"
bad,"There are times its a easy night, others can be hellish. There's no way of knowing when you walk in to start either how its going to be. All you can do its hold on and do the job."
bad,"As long as you like dealing with grumpy customers all day then this place is great. But I just wasn't feeling it here. For the most part the coworkers are tolerable, but the whole time I was employed here, there was maybe only a handful of occasions where the customers made me feel like I was worth anything."
bad,The management was not very helpful when it came to any problems. They did not provide me with a place to pump after I had my son and most of the people that worked there were always miserable and rude.
bad,"Walmart makes the job more stressful than it has to be. Management is terrible. Not willing to work with you and retaliate for something as simple as a call in. The good workers are treated bad because they can only do so much but the managers expect them to pick up the slack for the bad workers. Got rid of all incentives (not that they were great anyways. Example: free donuts every week, but old donuts that were stale. ""Cookouts"", food was burnt). Would not recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"i worked at wal-mart for three years before being let go. in my time there i have never encountered any other management that cared as little for its employees as the mangers who ran the store i worked for. having heard them talk about employees as though they were merely tools to be used until broken then discarded for new ones i cannot say anything good about working here, the only positive about my experience here was that they did offer a livable wage with the potential for raises based on yearly performance reviews. however that is far overshadowed by the complete lack of empathy towards the crew they hire to work in their store"
bad,Walmart is a job that you get when you are just getting out of school. It's not a job for people with families. Most people that work for the company have to work other jobs
bad,Days are long and stressful with rude customers as well as management. They show a lot of favoritism and hard workers usually go unnoticed. Understaffed and underpaid.
bad,There is room for improvement for the company. Since day one there has been a continuation of policies that have made this company no longer enjoyable to work for.
bad,Tiene sus pro y contras buen plan medico buena empresa dedicada a la comunidad el problema son las q la manejan en P.R.
bad,They give you a set amount of time that your can take off from work every 6 months. They don't take doctors excuses. They barely approve your days off that you ask for. Any time i had an emergency and needed to stay home its a fight trying to get the day off without getting fired.
bad,Walmart wants life to revolve around them they always expect availability to be open for them if you don't play politics you will never move up in the company and if a manager decides they don't like you they will find a reason to fire you no job security and don't expect to get benefits because they wont make you full time.
bad,"A typical  work day with this company is very busy and the customers are very enjoyable to talk with. I learned how to properly read upc labels, stock shelves, and read a telxon pricing gun. Some of the managemnt can use some more training in how to treat your employees.Wal-Mart is a melting pot of culture."
bad,Please spare yourself the drama that is Walmart!! From the managers to your co workers they all are the spawn of...... And the weird part about it is that I got along with everyone but all they had to talk about was the next person next thing you know two of our co workers fighting in the meat cooler lol not only did mgmt basically do nothing but they were making light of it in the break-room!!!
bad,my opinion about a typical day work is that I clock in and then find out what register I will be at then go to that register and start my day. I have learned a lot of the customers are nice and some are not. management at Walmart is ok they could work on how they treat their employees in front of others. I do not know what the hardest part of the job it but I would have to say it depends on what your job is. And the most enjoyable part of the job is for me is that I clock out and go home.
bad,You can have job security if u will really try to stay there even when there is so much pressure and that is because of lock of personal to work in every department areas.
bad,There is supposed to be a dress code for all Walmart associate but you'd never know it it's not inforced and management doesn't care !! Poor place to work
bad,Walmart is an extremely disorganized company. Management has no idea what is going on. The pay is terrible and they could care less about the job family balance.
bad,Promotions are based solely on how you manage yourself to upper management regardless of your job performance. A perfect fit for someone who can only talk the talk.
bad,"I was surprised to find that I would be making as much as I did as an hourly associate at Walmart.  Working with customers who need assistance may seem daunting at first, but is actually the most fulfilling part of the job. "
bad,Stores are cutting hours which makes it difficult to work a full-time schedule (very little OT is available).  People come to work wondering if they will be told they don't have a job anymore.
bad,They do not schedule the man power needed to fulfill the job required.  They hire you part-time but work you full-time hours so that they do not have to offer benefits. You will work EVERY SATURDAY if you're a Cap2
bad,"Management does not resolve employee issues.  Problems are shoved under the rug and ignored.  There is no foundation for communication, and not much respect for those who work hard. No consequences for employees, especially managers, who do nothing and pass off their responsibilities on to others.  There is especially  no consequences for managers who constantly disrespect their employees and make them feel unappreciated.  The pay is not fair for the amount of work that is expected and especially given the amount of money that Wal-Mart is worth! Some departments are paid more than others for doing less work.  That makes absolutely no sense.  While I am grateful for having a paid job, by no means would I ever recommend this as a place to work.  Perhaps in the mid-west where people are just overall friendlier, but not in Southern California.  Most of the employees are lazy and rewarded for such behavior, while those who deserve praise get left behind, and the customers are needy and cranky and have a false sense of entitlement."
bad,"pharmacy managers were always different, hardest part of job was working with a slow pharmacist who took his time and didnt care how long it took to finish the prescriptions, as well as having angry customers because medicines werent covered, most enjoyable were the coworkers and the regular customers"
bad,I worked there part-time while a full-time student. The pay was lower but the hours were flexible. Management possibilities existed but my career goals were not management.
bad,"My time with Walmart was rough, to say the least. When I started I was promised to have Sundays blocked from my schedule, as well as promised a guaranteed time blocked out of my schedule for a wedding I was to attend... SEVERAL MONTHS OUT. In both instances I had to fight for what I was promised in the very beginning, and after I was finally hired and I was assigned to my department, in both cases I was treated differently by management after my case was won ( with Physical Proof!). I was continually told no when I asked to work on my learn Modules (of which I was shown in the handbook that they CANNOT tell you you can't work on them unless there is a situation.) so I could could eventually move up the rung. Sad enough, my problems didn't end when I quit. This year when I went to file my taxes I found out that Walmart DID NOT withhold all the money for federal taxes from my check, so I got hit with that after I did my taxes. Listen, I have great appreciation for the time I work for and was provided for by Walmart, but this was one of the most difficult jobs I've ever had to work for not because of the work, but the company and the management it's-self."
bad,"I would have to say it's the second worst job I have ever had. Management doesn't listen to you. They never tell you when you do a good job, even if it's WAY beyond standards. The only time they want to talk to you is to tell you when you have done something wrong, any other time they are busy and will ""be right there"" or tell you to catch them a bit later."
bad,"Over the last almost seven years I have worked for the company I have never felt more degraded and used as I have working there. A typical work day consists of doing your job and being criticized doing as you are told too, as well as catching attitude and being blamed for the mistakes of your co-workers. I have learned from this job many good things as far as customer service, to do as corporate requires as well as my job title but doing more will not get you anywhere. I would not recommend working for Wal-Mart to anyone as a long term goal. No matter how hard you work, how much you put into the job, how much you change your family and personal life you are expendable and not going to move anywhere unless you kiss up to management. Which is something I’ll never do. The hardest part of the job was trying to figure out which day was going to be a good and productive day and which one you were going to get yelled at for someone else because they said you did something you didn’t do. Even when the camera’s proved it wasn’t you. They are not accommodating to you home life as well. You have to be there when they say. If you need a day off there is never a guarantee you’re going to get it. They deny and approve as they see fit even when it’s an important doctors appointment. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers I had the pleasure of serving, they made the job tolerable and made my day brighter."
bad,Management sucked. When I needed help the CSM would take forever to come and help. Would stand around and talk to other CSM's. Terrible at helping new employees.
bad,"Working at Walmart was not as horrible as everyone says it is, but the management does not seem to understand the amount of pressure put on the associates to get too much work accomplished in too little time. Having been through three assistant managers, two co-managers and two store managers, it seems like the way we are told to do our job is constantly making things less effective. Not only that, our workload seems to keep rising."
bad,"Walmart is a good place to work  if the management team was different "
bad,"Little respect for efforts of workers is shown. Massive turnover is common. Earned vacation is very difficult to obtain. Schedule is erratic, usually reduction of time. Can't get insurance through company because of lack of hours (time required). Emphasis on safety is a plus for all concerned. A discount card is issued after required period of employment. Job is not difficult to perform, there is plenty to do in order to stay busy."
bad,Started out fine but quickly became clear it was a toxic work place. Negativity was the main focus with bad management staff. Bad employees were rewarded with promotions simply because they were friends with the management not because of skill/quality of work.
bad,"Horrible management, wouldn't work with my scheduled with college like they said they would, just treats you horrible till you want to leave.  i would strongly not recommend this to anyone."
bad,Glad to have the job but too many workers within department slow and did not carry load...I felt that others could have helped the other at times but only worried about their tasks and caused me to have to help them get finished with their work..
bad,worked the construction and set up crew for a store moving from neighborhood walmart to a super center. the supervisor for the set up crew was very lacking with safety concerns.
bad,"Pour avoir passé 4 ans chez Walmart, je peut vous assurer qu'on peut en devenir vous. L'organisation n'est presque pas présente. Aucun avantage sociaux ou autre. Pour une grande compagnie comme Walmart, on nous offre 10% de rabais sur nos achat. Malgré ce que vous penser Walmart mets BEAUCOUP de pression sur leur employer pour obtenir un rendement et ils trouvent toute les raisons possible pour ne pas récompenser ceux qui travail fort constamment."
bad,"Too much stress during shift. Managers always demanding  unreasonably demands, on a minute by minute bases. Always treated as a second class citizen with no respect from upper management. More backstabbing than positive feedback."
bad,"Management prefers that we don't discuss Walmart in public.  Work 35-40 hours a week, days.  Have a great assistant manager who works with us.  Hardest part of the job is dealing with customers with attitudes."
bad,When I did work there it was all about maximizing the amount of shifts one person could work and put them up to the max amount of work. Even if you are part time and cannot work the maximum amount by law.
bad,management gangs up on associates to push and pull them wherever they please and also suck at communicating and have no respect nor motivation towards their work companions.
bad,"Wal-Mart uses propaganda and coersion to keep employees in line. Management claims endless opportunities, yet very few are actually attainable. Zero work/life balance, and inconsistent scheduling lead to exhaustion and depression amongst the vast majority of employees. Hard work is rewarded with harder work and higher expectations, yet no advancement opportunities. Promotees are selected before interviews are ever conducted, giving false hope to hard workers. Hostility and disrespect are commonplace with most management, yet both are specifically forbidden in policy."
bad,Walmart is a big business. I felt like I was just another number. I had difficulty managing work with life outside of work because my employers were not flexible or understanding of life circumstances.
bad,My boss be cool sometimes but this a job that shows alot of favoritism fr they overwork us nd under pays us that's why I'm looking for better opportunities than this company fr
bad,Worked there for 5 years and the store saw 3 new store managers in a 2 year period and the floor level managers never were there for too long. They tend to not know what they are doing and one will assign a task and another will assign a different task and they will both chew you out when both tasks are partially completed. Before i left they reworked the attendance and paid holiday/vacation system.
bad,They had great pay and benefits but the fact that there was to much personal problems with workers and management not doing there job that it got so bad that the cm's was interfering with the work place.
bad,"Wal-Mart is a fast paced, productive store. With hard working employees not getting paid properly for all that is required or asked of employees and management."
bad,The management at Walmart always had unreasonable expectations of what they needed to get done even before factoring in the amount of customers to help. they never assigned enough staff to the sales floor and kept reducing the staff further or bringing them off the floor to be cashiers. everyday was a challenge and management never listed to requests to assign more people to shifts.
bad,"I had moved to Roanoke, Va. to try and find a better job which did not work out. Ended up at Walmart and was promised the moon, but they never came thru."
bad,Every quarter there is a new org structure. Clear bias for certain section with too much tribal politics. No HR review of talent or efforts to retain.
bad,"Despite the fact that it is a better-paying job, and I work hard to earn my living there, it does a complete disservice for me, as I feel that I am not moving on anywhere when working with Wal-Mart."
bad,As far as associates go working at Walmart wasn't good at all. The managers are lazy and all they dud was stood around and talked all day. There were some good managers but my overall experience with Walmart leadership was horrible.
bad,Busy and poor customer service. Management does not back up their employees. Working here is what you make it. Learned most of my most challenging customer service skills here.
bad,Walmart used to be about taking care of their employees. In the 3 months I've been there I have seen a shift in this ethic. They are not understanding or considerate of the health of their employees.
bad,If you're looking to move up the company this is not a good place to do so. The work day is long and you will be over worked and under paid. Management only looks out for themselves.
bad,"did a horrible job of training employees and expect us to work on the floor after 1 day of 4 our training."
bad,"Process oriented workplace, not overly people driven."
bad,managers lack capacity to take advice from workers or correctly assign number of workers based on workload. may have too many or too few workers but almost never the right amount. low paying jobs storewide so most managers have never had any power so it quickly goes to their heads. often time 2 to 3 managers would come watch as we were undermanned in the backroom unloading a truck. they would sit and watch and talk about why we were taking time instead of leading by example and helping us.
bad,The new manager is rude don't speak the. People and i agree they need better cominication. Skills and work with us some help us as needed. Need some new managers
bad,"Walmart normally overworks and under pays.I carried 3 departments(impulse and front end merchandise, candy and cigarettes, and liquor) and didnt receive any assistance from any of the CAP teams..."
bad,"Walmart has mainly friendly and supportive people working for their company with strong rules and ways of the job. Management is nice, although they don't always go through with what they say. Average hours per week are workable, but poor shift lengths."
bad,Managers will give you whatever hours they want you to work no matter what you put in for. Benefits are not even worth it. Managers are super disrespectful.
bad,Worked for 10 years and most management was clueless to departmental needs.  Always shifted from one area to another without any knowledge of products or coverage for area I was supposed to be in.
bad,"While there is much opportunity to learn, the atmosphere is tense and difficult to deal with on a day to day basis.  Life/work balance is not a consideration."
bad,Schedule is predictable and job reliable. Management was a bit bias. But I knew what I should be doing every day. I would. not recommend this place of employment.
bad,I wouldn't recommend working here unless you absolutely need a job. It's not the worse place but it's not the best. Don't expect much. The managers are under qualified and won't help you.
bad,Management is blind. Advancement is only by favoritism. And pay raises are a joke. Mechanics with 20 years experience are paid the same as the kid who just left flipping burgers.
bad,Glad it was a tempoary thing. I even shop there less now. I was astonished as some people got away with murder while others were thrown under the bus for nothing.
bad,They use you and over works you then cuts all your hours down to nothing. You cannot live off of their wages. They expect you to be able to work every hour they need you instead of working with you like they promised
bad,"Lots of room for advancement in the small positions. Not enough focus on development of staff. Great to learn customer service at fast pace. If you've got a good manager, it's a great place to work"
bad,Emotionally and Physically draining place to work. The pay is better than most of the company's peers. But that is becoming the only good part about working here. Many coaches and supervisors play favorites. We are losing the ability to see family for holidays. Very limited break time.
bad,"I was happy working in Stocking department, keeping shelves neat and organized, restocking merchandise.  I was less than thrilled with checking customers out as a cashier.   As I wasn't sure of myself giving correct change back, Wal-mart knew I wasn't secured with handling cash  but still they pulled me and put me in an uncomfortable situations."
bad,"So I know saying ""don't work here"" is kind of silly because it's unavoidable for some people, but unless you work your way up to store manager, your life is going to suck while you're there."
bad,The scheduling is not good. It's does fit the life of parents. it's more for adolescents or part time seekers. No minimum hours guaranty. No fixed schedule. you become very dependent of the job.
bad,"Workplace usually not clean when I come in for my scheduled time, don't attend to customers and managers don't allow associates to move up into a better position"
bad,I didn't mind the work place and it certainly taught me better communication and customer service. It was a basic minimum wage job that gave me the opportunity to grow with the company for about a year.
bad,"Walmart has adopted the management strategy of pressuring employees to get work done within shift time no matter the size of task. However, they are cutting their number of employees working in their stores to bring down operation costs. This creates a skeleton crew which has to do the work of two or sometimes three associates making it impossible to meet time requirements to get merchandise on the floor. It also creates poor customer service and frustrated shoppers. Workplace culture has deteriorated over the years and morale is low. The hardest part was meeting the managements impossible standards. Most enjoyable part was working with a crew that had pride in their work and faith in the company. And being there to help the customers. This review may not apply to all stores, just the four I have work in as an associate and later as a vendor visiting these stores."
bad,Walmart is  a good place to work if you need a short time job. As a long term job no. Very hard to improve yourself and your work. If you do get to improve they ask more than one person can do.
bad,she was always rude to the employees. She would walk around only when her boss was there. Also fired people for having more points than they were suppose to and called them liars after they tried to tell her.
bad,"I usually always first help out in the fitting room. I fold or hang up clothes and then put them back on the floor where they belong. I also help out in the fitting room by letting people into the fitting rooms and answer the main phone line for Walmart. I will then either transfer the call to the correct department, page that department to let them know they have a call or use the walkie to let them know. I then will either zone all of the apparel departments or process apparel freight. I also help some of the department managers do price changes and set new mods. When needed I am also called to be a cashier or door greeter when they are busy."
bad,"a typical day would be coming in checking my task and seeing what all, I needed to take care for the night .i learned to work at Walmart that if everyone does not work as a team, nothing will get accomplished. I enjoyed coming in and seeing a few of my co-workers I work with. an enjoyable work environment will make it a lot better for everyone"
bad,"I have worked at Wal-Mart for over 2 years altogether. The ability to advance is a small chance. Customer service jobs are busy, and there are many days when employees have to handle conflict situations with customers while still maintaining store policy. Management is hard on all employees. They expect their employees to work harder than possible with a small amount of pay. It is very common that one employee will work harder to make up for other employees for the same pay as everyone else."
bad,"Management parrots each other. ""Culture"" cited as a major advantage, it is just the opposite. Due to recent layoffs, even the most devoted associates are now job searching."
bad,Any benefits you work to get can be removed with little to no warning such as being left without insurance. None of the store's sections are staffed properly so the day is spent funneling employees to the registers and leaving the few on the floor with a far increased work load. Management is only seen when they need to point out any flaws spotted then they return to the back office. When management assures seasonal employees that they will be rehired after the season no one gets called back. So banking on the assurance of a rehire you're suddenly out of a job.
bad,"I worked on cap team 2 (truck unloader / stock)"
bad,"For starters some of the managers at the Walmart I worked for were not professional at all, their attitudes were nasty. The company isn't for the associates. Although the pay and hours are good I don't thibk i'll go back."
bad,"Management was terrible (at the time). Unorganized workplace and overworked employees. I would usually have to stock 3 different departments on my own, every night whilst management complained about how swiftly things needed to get done. If it weren't for supervisors harping on employees, the job would be decently enjoyable. I enjoyed helping customers."
bad,Good for student part time job. They offer flexible schedules and they are very understanding towards student lifestyle. They dont pay much and every year you get 30cent augmentation. Every year you get a bonus depending on customer satisfaction and sales.
bad,Overall was okay but could've been better. I worked there a very short time but it still could have been better. Managers need to be a little more professional
bad,"The only thing good about Walmart was the customers and co-workers, excluding management. They have managers that are not personable have no formal training, and frankly are down right abusive to their subordinates. Only thing that makes Walmart kind of ok is 401 and stocks if you can shift through the chaos and make it long enough to become fully vested."
bad,Change is slow.  Behind the times in regards to efficiency and technology.  Growth is slow.  New Senior Leadership has great ideas.  Management in the building likes to keep you beat down.
bad,"Rather Stressful day at work. Short handed. Management should go back to training on how to treat their fellow employees. Hard work which I did not mind. Everyone had way more to do than normal understaffed, expected workers to do the job of two or three people. The only thing I enjoyed about work were the few friendly works and one manager that was friendly."
bad,"If you need a job, take it. Typically take you to multiple departments you don't work in and teach you nothing about it other than how to be another body. Corporate always has an ignorant comment about the employees and demands cross training and proper operation of food areas while nobody actually knows HOW to operate the food areas properly. Ask managers. Ask a store manager. They can not tell you."
bad,The problem with wal mart is that they do not new employees adequate training .  It is a good idea to find some in the department you are working in to mentor you.  Management cannot seem to get employee scheduling correct.  If you have a problem it is best to go up the chain of command start with your department manager all the way up until you get the problem solved.
bad,"Walmart seems like a great company to work for but in reality they don't care about their employees at all. They hire you as part-time but want you to work 40 hours at times (not always, other times they'll cut you down to 16 hours a week) just so they don't have to give you benefits. Some managers are good but others have no idea what they are doing."
bad,"The management is very bad no respect from managers to associates , suffering when asking about rights like when you to take vacation pay time off or when you to transfer to another department."
bad,"Fair place to work. Gave vacation days competitive pay. Friendly environment. Learned a lot. Management showed  appreciation. Willing,to promote within"
bad,Managers need to be reviewed by corporate office on giving employees thanks for doing a good job instead of criticism all the time.  They need to look into all issues employees are having with management.
bad,"In this position at Walmart, I learned that if you're really good at your job, management expects you to do 4 other people's jobs at the same time while also trying to maintain your own. There was definitely favoritism and unfair treatment in regards to how some of the managers viewed certain employees. Benefits and breaks were provided. Normally taking vacation wasn't a problem, but during the holidays it was war for everyone who worked in a high demand area; ie. toys, electronics, photo center, etc. I definitely didn't expect to make as many friends working there as I did, but it just shows that there are all walks of life coming in and out of positions there as well as the customers."
bad,I feel as though Walmart is the least positive environment I had ever worked at.  The management seems to only care about their workers they are friends with.  There is not an equal distribute of labor and at times their expectations of certain employees are unrealistic.
bad,"I was constantly accused of coming back late from breaks and lunches when that wasn't the case and in addition to this, I was blamed for the register being short on numerous occasions to cover up what other people were doing wrong."
bad,"Every day was a different day, however the company cannot seem to hire management that can properly run things. Nearly everything going on amongst employees was informal and in no way professional. For $10/hr it is definitely not worth it."
bad,They are not a place I would recommend to work for.  Not always there for you. Corporate doesn't care about its employees. They are out for their selves. Making new rules all the time and that is why they having such a large turn over.
bad,"Job is easy, customers are crazy, but mostly fine. Management is horrible they just don't care about you. Co workers are like family. The pay was bad, but I've heard it got better."
bad,Management is not very interactive with employees.  Employees' schedules constantly changed without the employees' prior consent and/or knowledge.  The break schedule is bad - for working a 7 hour or more shift you are only entitled to one 10 minute and 1 unpaid 30-minute break.  If you work 6 hours or less you are not entitled to any breaks.
bad,This company is ok to work if you need to make some extra money or need a close job to home. They dont treat there employees good and wonder why there always leaving.
bad,"it can be a good place to work if the Store manager is a leader not just a boss. When the store manager manages by fear and intimidation it can be bad. The Store manager sets the tone and the assistant managers follow the store managers lead."
bad,"Did not like it whatsoever. The management was not up to par as well as the pay. Customers always believe the saying, ""the customer is always right."" In a lot of cases that is not true. I would never tell them that directly though."
bad,Not my favorite place. Some workers aren't bad but the way most employees treat customers I do not agree with. Customers should be helped with kindness and a friendly hospitable manner.
bad,Great people to work side by side with. Co workers are friendly  and very helpful when needed.  Will go out of the way to assist you if necessary or if you have questions.
bad,"There was too many jobs that were expected from hourly supervisors, and not enough people to do it.  Told to do different things by different managers, there was no communication.  People were always miserable and there was a negative atmosphere."
bad,"Lazy managers That Bark orders and sit on their butt. Underpaid employees that would rather stand around and talk then do their  jobs. if your lazy this would be a great place for you! The company does not care about their employees."
bad,Going into this company you learn quickly that you're pretty much left on your own with little to no training. Associates are expected to do the job of 3 people with little to no appreciation.
bad,Depends on the day. What kind of day I had at Walmart. If the customer is in a good mood. I will have a good day. If people in a bad mood. It's one day you want to be alone. Don't get me wrong when you get a nice customer. It makes your day go by much better.
bad,The first couple of years was great but it gradually becomes bad to the point that Supervisors and Managers are pushing associates especially the Front-end associates to push customers to apply for the company's credit card and that came to worst that the Managers are threatening cashiers of losing their hours and/or they can be moved to a different departments.  That's horrible! Lots of good old employees are gone because of the worst Managers in town.
bad,"La cadena es de las mejores pero desafortunadamente la tienda en la que labore cuenta con una administración de pésima. Tratan a sus empleados como basura, no les respetan su hora de comida ni de salida."
bad,"Working at SEK/CAP was a very emotional experience. The children and parents were awesome while fellow employees made it very difficult to enjoy my job. While I strive to help the children, the other Teachers in the classroom were talking about shopping or what bar they were going to Saturday night. They often disappeared into the front office to shop online. Very frustrating place to work. When I tried to discuss this with my supervisor, I was quickly labeled a trouble maker and all other employees were told of my private conversation with the boss.  All of the supervisors were close friends, all living in a small town....Horrible experience"
bad,Favoritism is strong here...the hours are sometimes stressful especially for students. They sometimes will work with your flexibility but often don't. Good job for someone in a pinch.
bad,working for Walmart it was very unorganized and all over the place with little to no help. The management was very rude and not vey helpful. I would not recommend it.
bad,"management do not care who they have to step on to get ahead. not all of them are bad, just most of them. and if you are not one of their ""pets"" you get treated wrong."
bad,Walmart is a great starting place to work when you are young. the people I worked with are friends that i still have now and that was 5years. Management will use you up if you are not r=trying to advance yourself there. there are a lot of office poltic sand will try like you are slow until you demend other wise
bad,Started as a stocker the expectations were to high had to get 20+ hours of work done in less than 8 hrs every department is timed go by the freight you had
bad,"Don't get 40 hour weeks, they feed employees well.. They have production that must be met but is impossible Bc order pullers are always in the way. Makes difficult to enjoy job."
bad,"A typical day at work is to stock, zone and clean the dairy coolers and bunkers, I learned how to use the telxon gun, stock the dairy coolers and bunker, and reshop. Management loved to use alot of profanity language it was in appropriate language to use. The work place culture was fun sometimes and some times dangerous. The hard part of the job was when we had to pull the dairy liquid pallets. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting the job done."
bad,"At Wal-mart is good training , good employee , a lot of customer , so hard work , area for enjoyable , 10 percent discount for employees no for foods."
bad,"Management had unreasonable expectations that caused a lot of workers to quit. Pay was docked like it was candy. But overall, they had decent communication skills."
bad,working for this company was very upsetting i tried everything to stay there but i just couldn't put up with the bad attitudes everyone was not bad but the majority was
bad,"Disliked working here, they was favoritism between managers and employees. they were not flexible with my hours. I am a college student therefore I need late shifts. Would schedule me shifts that were not part of my availability or on does I could not attend."
bad,Nothing but drama there. Management doesn't listen to employees and throws it in your face when you get injured. Management also makes harrassing comments to your face
bad,If you are looking to advance at a job then Walmart isn't for you! As soon as you start to advance other co workers will try their best to get you introuble! Very stress full!
bad,Really showed me how the world is. How they take a pregnant woman's word over an honest employee who busted his butt for the company. Filled spots that weren't his responsibility. Terrible
bad,Eliminating long term fulltime associates. No respect from managers towards their associates. Employees are not very happy and it is hard to be around.
bad,"Fast paced work environment with a lot of physical work needing to be done on a daily basis, with only a skeletal crew to do it. Expectations set by upper management are almost always unable to meet."
bad,Management does not care about employees. Does not pay a fair wage.You can not miss work without risk of losing job.Can be a hostel place to work if you get on the wrong side of management
bad,"It's a good stepping stone. Nothing you'd want to make a career out of. Walmart is shrouded in eminence stress for its associates, The chance to move up is there if you want to take it, but rarely goes to those who deserve it."
bad,"First i had to walk into the back and clock in. Next i had to  unload a truck, and whatever other trucks were parked, after trucks are unloaded restock shelves."
bad,My paycheck was less than when I was a teenager. You are worked so hard and always someone breathing down your neck. CSMs have attitudes and will actually refrain from allowing you to have a bathroom break.
bad,"Lo encuentro muy bonito el trabajo,lo que me incomoda sinceramente es el sueldo, se trabaja mucho y se gana poco."
bad,The changes Walmart has made not only in compensation but the controlling environment and stress is definitely not work the pay.  It was fun at first but now everyone is sooo stressed out it is ridiculous.
bad,"Walmart is a place that loves complete submission. The managers are constantly micro managing your work and do not take any suggestions for area work standards or replacement of items. A typical day is being checked on every 2 hours to see how far you have come in your tasks - and if you ask for help you will be told to just work faster. "
bad,"Walmart was the worst place to work, from crazy customers to getting fired for missing 3 days of work with a doctors note because of a car crash. There is not a day that I miss that place. Any time I pass the store I can't help but be upset. From what I have heard from my old co workers they have had the same experience. It isn't worth working for them at all."
bad,Production rates are unachievable. Management is poor create a chaotic work environment where you feel like you are fighting just to keep your job everyday. Very high turnover rate many people quit within the first month of working there. The building opened in 2002 in Hopkinsville Kentucky there are many people that are still working there that started when the building opens many have left job opportunities or have gotten fired for various reasons some to do with the demands of the job
bad,"Good place to work, and you learn alot from the experience of dealing with customers. I found there are too many authority figures (managers, etc) and not enough communication."
bad,Es muy buena la empresa si quieres creser ahi y las políticas son buenos as si las llevan acabo todos
bad,"I had a long 27 year career with Walmart.  I went from a career to termination over trash.  Your not appreciated, valued or ever given a true Thank You.  It is never enough or good enough."
bad,"-Walk the store and give notes with timeframes to my Department Managers"
bad,I had THE worst manager that I have ever had.  The only thing I liked about this job was some of my co-workers.  There is nothing that could bring me back to the awful Walmart.
bad,"A typical day at work was pretty productive for me. You come to work, clock in, and begin your work. Work at the schedule for the day and see which department you where to zone and pick up clothing off the floor. Arrange clothing by size, color, and brand. Management was poor but it also was a very laid back environment. They did not pride themselves on customer service which was very odd."
bad,"poor benefits, low pay, no clear path for advancement, atrocious management, inconsistent hours, oppressive atmosphere, no job security, and anti-worker corporate policies."
bad,"most management are workinh for their bonuses, and do not care about you !!!!! if you have a problem, they pretend to care, and figure out a way to cut your hours or fire you"
bad,"The opinions about the hardest part of the job, typical day, workplace culture, and especially the management is tragic. Nothing ventured, Nothing gained. This is why in the past 3 years, I have seen at least 100 people quit and moved on. Walmart has lots to improve however the company chooses to ignore their slogan advertised inside the building,"" Our company lies behind our associates"". Top echelon management are making their 6 figures yet ignore the burdens of the associates."
bad,For someone who is just starting out in the workforce this is a great place to start. It can also be a career for someone who wants to stay in the retail field.
bad,Management needs to be improved no advancement really in this company unless your in the in crowd IE friends. not great pay and not alot of full time positions available
bad,At Wal-Mart they didn't have proper trainers to train the new people. I learned how to stock shelves and use a pallet jack. The hardest part of the job was trying to get the customers rung out when there is a huge line and only one register open.
bad,"The management staff is filled with petty and lazy people. If you do not fit their requirements or they simply don't like you they will try their hardest to get you fired and blame you for any trouble that you are directly or indirectly involved in. My store, 3219, is filled with bad people and I recommend people only apply here as a last resort."
bad,"A good place to work for a resume, but only if you ready to be treated poorly your just a number hard to survive especially if you have a family and a minority."
bad,"I worked for Walmart for five years.  They continuously told us that we would get profit sharing, but only if you've been there a certain amount of time.  That time was 5 yrs.  However, when I reached my 5 yrs Anniversary they told me the date I would've needed to start was two months prior to my hire date.  "
bad,"A very busy and hectic job to have. Constant pressure to get everything done and more in a timely manner. Not always fair, but had it's ups and downs."
bad,"They have very strict attendance point system in place."
bad,"Good sense of community and volunteerism"
bad,management will make you do their jobs  without acknowledgement. Always asked to work overtime when promised you could keep it then asked` to cut it the next` day. you are supposed to receive  2 15 min breaks and a hour lunch but you are lucky if you even get a lunch after 5 1/2 of working
bad,"Very difficult and unorganized. Lacked in various areas for management and training. Although I did have good days I built a clientele with the customers that came to the deli at Wal-Mart. They wanted to know the days i worked so i could serve them. Id have to say that was the most enjoyable part of the job. I learned how to do a lot of the managers job, which included inventory scheduling, and the in and outs of the job. The thing i found the most difficult was cooking the hot foods for the hot bar and learning the meal types and how they were prepped because their were so many variations to learn."
bad,"Management will go out of their way to dump their work on the hourly employees in their department.  Hours were changed or added to or subtracted from in a moments notice.  Off the clock management(department manager) allowed to come to job off the clock, drunk (appearances and smells are NOT misleading) he was alliwed to shiw up at the job twice in one year drunk, stinking and weaving from side to side and correct and or verbally criticize associates on sales floor.  Both instances were reported to assistant manager and nothing happened.  Associate discussed this problem with other associates and found out it was a common problem."
bad,"Worked there for almost three years. Have taken two pay cuts and my work load has more than doubled. My store lacks management, and the overall atmosphere is rather depressing. Employees lack respect and motivation."
bad,"A typical day working for this company can be described as hectic. Communication among management was poor and helped to confuse most regular employees. Staff was always pulled in different directions. Policy updates were never relayed to staff. Management played favorites and created ""new"" rules for the people they disliked the most. Each new hire was basically in charge of training themselves aside from the computer based learnings. The most enjoyable thing about working for this company was the amount of customers coming through the door and helping to make their day a little better!"
bad,The specific job I was doing was okay. It was a bit therapeutic but the overall job was absolutely garbage. I wouldn't recommend the worst person in the world to apply here let alone work there. It was draining my time and energy. I felt like I didn't belong there.
bad,"Would recommend for first job, not a career job. Management did not care about your life outside of the job. They give random hours, and they do not like to work with your schedule."
bad,Walmart is a job that you would choose as a last resort. Its a steady pay check and thats it. I would recomend this job to a high school student.
bad,"If you can follow their rules exactly and walk the narrow path they provide then this is for you. If you still need a bit of loose leash, it might not be the best place for you. If you enjoy the same thing day in and day out then you are fine. If you want to do other things, I would avoid joining their team."
bad,There were other stores in our area that paid higher for the same positions. The management had many unreal exception and was not willing to help when needed. Unless you were buddy buddy with management  you were not going to move up. They would make last minute changes to our schedules with out asking and if we were late from not knowing it was always our fault.
bad,Walmart was ok to work for. I think it's a nice place to work. Never realized how demanding retail really was. I loved challenges but I would have loved more challenges.
bad,"You don't get paid well enough for your daily expectations. Managers speak poorly of other employees freely and are incredibly negative. Other employees are allowed to start drama, and speak negatively of others with no consequences. Team morale isn't great, and it's a fend for yourself type of environment."
bad,"A typical day at store 3612 was painful and a overall depressing experience.  But I did lean how do deal with people in a much better manner due to the need for customer service, I also got to learn how to use certain power lifting equipment.  The culture and management however was the hardest part of the job mainly because of the lack of communication and back stabbing."
bad,"The management of Walmart does not care about its associates over receiving their bonuses. They drastically cut associates' hours after the holiday seasons, once they are not needed as much. I work 4.5 hours, 5 days a week. That is not nearly enough to get me by with trying to pay back student loans and still continuing my education. When management is needed, they are nowhere to be found, and when requested to speak to a manager by a customer, they make the customer wait a ridiculous amount of time with an apology."
bad,"Management was unfair and biased against associates. They would tell you your wrong even if you did exactly what they asked of you, they were extremely short and rude in conversation made you feel less of a person."
bad,"- always told to do jobs other than your own, not giving you the time to do your own job, then becoming annoyed with you for not getting your job done"
bad,"Don't care about their workers at all. Very bad management team with very rude behavior. I would not recommend anyone to work there, at least not at the location I was in."
bad,What I like about working at walmart was the benefits. I didnt really understand management at times because of the certain procedures that didnt really work with the employees work.
bad,A empresa e .Juro rotina mais na hora de arcar com.oa bens prometidos não cumpri
bad,I hated working at walmart. the management was terrible and the pay was even worst. My co workers were decent which made things a little easier. Overall I would not recommend anyone to work there.
bad,This company promises a lot but NEVER keeps them. Be prepared to deal with rude customers and the salaried managers aren't any better. The employees are what makes your job a little bit better. You get bonuses but only if your store does good. Keep to yourself and steer clear of the drama.
bad,"The pay is bad, for being a huge corporation.  Management plays favoritism.    You only receive benefits if you are full time.  But they only hire a person on as part time."
bad,"Need to treat there workers better "
bad,"Walmart is a hard company to work for. Needs to take a hard look at the management team. It is a fun work environment. Co workers work together to help each other get jobs done, Customer s are a great bunch of people."
bad,They dont accept doctors notes and half of management cares less about you. Some managers are very kind hearted. It is a fun place to work at most times. There is alot of drama and alot of workers arent happy there. They made me work when my doctors note said i was very contagious and still didnt accept it.
bad,"I have only been working there for a few months, however in my experience it has been a fear based environment along with unrealistic expectations."
bad,"At first everything was fine, when I communicated my school schedule they said they understood but then when I wasn't able to make it a specific day, I called and they said okay. Next week I was not on the schedule. They said okay and were willing to work with me?"
bad,The name of my review only applies if you are not a useless CSM or a manager. Expect to be underpaid but overworked. Rest in peace if you are instock or store standards.
bad,Needs more attention to employee needs and complaints and should take time to see how to improve the work experience.  Just another job where you feel invisible.
bad,"does not have not offer a work/ life balance. management is horrible, and in order to advance you have to be part of the in crowed."
bad,Walmart is a very hard place to work if you want to be treated as more than a number. some Walmarts are better than others. it all depends on management.
bad,"Walmart was a good start of a beginning to build my social skills and real-life decision making and making new friends. However, there was a bit of a negative atmosphere at times."
bad,"you slave, and slave, and slave for people who don't care about you or the customers. you might not even get your 15mins breaks if you are in TLE or on the cash registers up front. One day you can have over time, the next day you can't. 50 people tell you 50 different things to do."
bad,"hate Walmart, managers are rude, they never have the things you need to work, they are always telling you that you need to hurry up and finish your work"
bad,"Management seems to think that they can talk to you rudely.  Always telling and telling you how stupid and lazy you are. Really abusive place to work and they tell you if you don't like it, there's the door."
bad,"Wal-Mart had lived up to everyone's bad expectations. I was told not to work there but I needed to pay bills and feed myself or I was back on the street, living in my car with my dog. The management was not organized at all and thus threw everyone under them into chaos at the smallest things."
bad,The management is a joke. My uncle died and they got angry that I didn't come in. They treat their employees like door mats and when you stand up for your self they flat out tell you they can get another person in here to do your job for less!!!!
bad,"management was always messing up the schedule and wouldn't tell you if it changed at the last minute (I always checked my schedule before I left work every day).  management would also blame 1 person for everyone else, even if they had nothing to do with the problem."
bad,"Long, stressful days. Never consistent. People are rude. Management was not helpful. Would get in trouble for talking to customers, but then was encouraged to have good customer service."
bad,"All the tools are there for this to be a successful business with happy employees. "
bad,Walmart can be a ok place to work. I was a cashier and I enjoyed my time at walmart but the management are not very caring about they employees needs.
bad,"If you love to kiss a, great place to move up the ladder. On your knees. Was there for over 5 years. No advancement, until I called out the co manager on a huge OSHA violation and lost my job.    It's a joke of a career"
bad,"Clock in and then find a CSM they tell you your cash register you'll be working at. You check people out, bag items, sometimes help put their bags in their cart, cash the customer out and hand them their receipt."
bad,"I learned a lot in this company "
bad,They do not treat employees well or fairly. They play favorites more than i ever saw in a work place. If they want you fired they will make up a lame excuse or give you impossible tasks so you fail.
bad,I would give this place a chance if I needed work and wanted my 40 hours a week but be prepared for corporate big brother. You work hard with the hopes of advance right? Not here.
bad,"Era un trabajo muy matado y mal pagado "
bad,"A typical day at work was anything but typical it varied. Since I'm trained in every department they really just  have me everywhere. Once I come into work I could be doing anything from, receiving, loading, operating equipment, packing,putting, or inducting. The management in pretty decent for the most part but, it needs to be better due to so many inconsistencies.  The work environment is pretty calm, cool, and very friendly. The hardest part of the job would be the lack of job security. Overall it is a very decent job."
bad,i learned how to load gift cards ring grocery items produce bag grocery to  scan  clearance items and  got  codes from  csm  to override clearance items
bad,Lack of interest by management towards employees well being and job performance very evident. Most things get swept under the rug as they don't want to deal with any issues.
bad,"random schedule, no work-life balance, rude management. Did not use me to the best of my ability. Co-workers called out a lot."
bad,"Cons"
bad,"handling cash/credit/debit, restocking inventory in store/ unloading freight stock, assisting customers with daily needs, working in the deli/slicing meat cooking food."
bad,"The media has been more than active on the issue of Walmart, and they are not wrong. Some days you work more than your shift and other days they begin hacking away at workers hours like a mad man with a hatchet. "
bad,Pay and benefits were to low. Who you report to was constantly changed and employee reviews were not based on individuals or their performance. No job security even after 8+ years.
bad,"every day was tiring job, always exposed to the elements, managers were not very nice except for the store manager, working there has taught me very little to nothing."
bad,I would like to work for a corporation that appreciates my talents and my ability to lead teams. I have worked in three Wal Marts and it seem to me that the daily routines are very much reactive not proactive.
bad,"Although co-workers weren't too friendly with newer employees, the actual work was fairly easy to learn and go into the hang of things."
bad,"I went into the hospital after a manager told me ""don't worry about your job"" and i missed two weeks of work because i was in the hospital. I had a doctors excuse when i got out and they still terminated me. The customers were rude no matter what you did. Hardest part of the job was the fast pace. Co-workers were fine. no comment on management. Best part of the job was the hats and thing they gave you to wear for certain holidays."
bad,"The flucuates but on most occasions if the work is intense, there isn't the amount of people that are needed. The job can sometimes be done in a decent amount of time depending on the size of the freight. Overall the job is mediocre."
bad,"Management was very unappreciative of associates good work, and oftentimes excellent service is greatly unrecognized."
bad,"Zoning buggies, going on cash, helping customers, covering breaks stocking shelves, answering in coming calls. Some managers were great and some were to busy to address any concerns."
bad,"I can say that I have learned a lot  throughout the Company. Learned how to do online ordering for customers, exachanges and refunds.  Enjoyed working with a diversified team, but I would say the hardest part about the job was not having enough coverage,but I always managed to get the job done with or without help.The most enjoyable part of my job was satisfying my customers."
bad,learnt a lot from walmart not so much from managers but from other employees the tricks to make it easier to ring up  products an price over rides sometimes customers get out of hand but that's any where you smile an make sure there shopping experiences were great down to cashier
bad,"I like working with the people at walmart, overall its a good work environment, but its a part time job and i need fulltime hours, i would like to stay with Walmart but am forced to look elsewhere."
bad,I wouldn't work at walmart again lack of respect from managers. Very difficult to move up in the company and hardly any appreciation. Decent coworkers.
bad,I did not enjoy working with Walmart. They showed very little management skills constantly replacing managers and showing very little care for their employees. The working conditions were horrible with constant fighting and gossip between both managers and employees The lesson I learned from this experience is that making yourself better and representing your employers is far more beneficial then lowering yourself to those who do not appreciate their opportunity or acknowledge the joy of being employed. We all should represent our jobs and their associates in a way we would all expect.
bad,I would not recommend working for Wal-Mart they do not treat their employees fairly or give the pay they deserve or the hours they need.    Even if I did not have a job I would not work there.
bad,"they seem now to hire people that are not qualified for the job or who are not good workers  just to fill space, you cannot hire this way when you have people that work non stop and others just walking around with their hands in their pockets everyone suppose to be a team and for some reason the team effort is not there anymore which makes it a low morale  negative workplace to be in ."
bad,The management does not communicate with each other effectively.  A constant shortage of employees makes for a stressful day.  It is nice when we get quarterly bonuses and a extra discount day around Christmas.  I really generally enjoy working a Walmart. The major problem is that many managers have issues with treating employees fairly.
bad,It a jobs where not all talented employee get a opportunity to move up and make a career. Not re-commanded for those moving from other Walmart to come down to Alamosa for it.
bad,The Coworkers are ever loving and helpful. Its never Down time beside your breaks. The company is every helpful if your trying to move up and make it into a career.
bad,"Management doesn't know what the other is doing. POOR COMMUNICATION with employees. Lots of favortism."
bad,Teóricamente a filosofia alcança da visão em gestão empresarial conceituada na conduta operacional em uma visão ética.
bad,"It was an okay job part-time while in school. No benefits and lazy co-workers. Did not enjoy the work-life. If you are a hard worker they will take advantage of you. The highest raise you can achieve yearly is $.50, but they don't like giving that out. $.40 is the realistic highest you can achieve. And if someone in the store ""slips and falls"" then you do not receive your meager christmas bonus."
bad,"They do not want long term associates  .  Job in jeopardy  every day ., not enough help to do the job. Cutting hours every week . Not the same company it was in1987"
bad,"Their technology and programs are abysmal, and havn't been updated for the stores since 1993, and their IT is horrendous. They need a complete IT overhual"
bad,"Co-workers talk and gossip all the time, talking about you behind your back, sometimes even to your face. If someone decides they don't like you they will try to get you fired. Don't work here if you can possibly avoid it unless you enjoy lower pay and drama deserving of high school years. To make things worse they expect you to handle returns, zone/face the shelves, help customers, AND handle whatever else they want to throw at you, and they don't even give you the hours needed to do it. At least half the time that I was working at Walmart I was the only Hardware Sales associate that entire day They only gave me 5 hours a day most days once inventory was done, AND they expected me to handle everything all at once."
bad,"Ficava na porta  do estabelecimento, aprendi que tem que ter muito cuidado e prestar atenção nos afazeres. Direção e gerencia um pouco fraca. O mais difícil era a carga horaria, abordar para pessoas mal intencionais se retirarem"
bad,"After clocking in, you will have to get your equipment to start working. Log into your equipment look at the board to find out what are/floor you will be working on. then start picking orders."
bad,"Working at Walmart gave me the opportunity to work with the public in a customer service sales associate position. When I worked there, I really enjoyed the interaction with the customers, helping them find what they were looking for in the store. It gave me great personal satisfaction in helping someone."
bad,"Its a great place to work if you have no family or a student in school. I've learned that the policies we have to follow aren't followed if the customers get loud and mean, so why follow them!  You cant balance home life and work life if you have different shifts, I've tried talked to my manager and he said there is nothing he can do. My store manager is a cool dude, but never seems to have time to talk to regular employees (employees that are not assistant managers). My store has favorites (I know every store does) and I mean on the DL relationships."
bad,"Its a great entry level job for someone with a retail mindset. Quick pace, friendly associate interaction, basic benefits. Opportunity for company advancement."
bad,"do not promote from within, high turn over so managers and supervisors don't know their workers , no overtime, unorganized, no sense of team no appreciation for employees"
bad,"Was an alright place to work. You got hours and you got paid well. However, the management sucked. If you have a real issue, especially medical, they tended to sweep it under the rug. It becomes very apparent that you are not a person, but a number to them. IF for any reason you can't provide a service to them, you are not important."
bad,"beaucoup de changement inutile et de pression sans fondement"
bad,"Walmart Chile is a decent company, however does not have many benefits for its employees.  It is an international company with branches throughout the entire world."
bad,This job was very good to work for but it was only a temp job with very little work. The people that worked there were very helpful when it came time to work.
bad,"As a stockman I found the work was not objectionable, but the management was unreasonable and unsympathetic. Short staffing was rampant, demands placed on workers was unreasonable, and overall created a high stress work environment that made working for the company nearly unbearable."
bad,"start work at 5:00 am- 4:00 p.m. Monday though Thursday, weekly.work until job is finished no matter how long it takes.most co-workers o.k  management doesn't watch closely when you try to move to different department another guy with same name got all the posiition I applied. I had the good record and his wasn't good After so many years they find ways to get rid of you . Not as family oriented as they say."
bad,"Management wasn't on the ball on things as much as they should have been. They lacked Management skills altogether. The store would be nicer and a better place to shop and work over all if Management had better communication skills and listening skills. They acted like they were team players, but, they were not. Issues would come up and they would leave it at that, unresolved or there would be a quick fix and move on. There needs to be a Team Leader and a Team that will follow through and keep in communications with one another on the same page. Also, they need to keep their Department Managers in their assigned departments so they can keep on top of their jobs and not pull them to different areas of the store or to go up and cashier when they fail to properly schedule cashiers to work at their most busy times of either the store hours or days or times of the year when there are major holidays and or events."
bad,"If you are a woman or a minority you will promote easily.   If you happen to be a white male, good luck.   These are the facts folks.   I did like the other employees that I have worked with there."
bad,"It was great job to have while in university but not a place to grow. Unless you do not mind working on weekends and evenings. It is really hard to get into Head Office from Retail, unless your upper management. Every new management has different policies and rules, which do not make any sense. Managers SUCK!"
bad,It's a stable job if you need the money. It wasn't for me but I appreciate all Wal-Mart has done for me. I worked in the deli which their was no teamwork I'm still their to get the job done.
bad,A lot of favoritism and you have to walk on eggshells. To me you shouldn't feel that way at any job unless you are hired in through man power and you have so many months to be on good behavior so they don't terminate you.
bad,Management does not care about their workers! Great environment to work in but terrible management. They make you work overtime then ask you to cut those hours during your lunch break so they dont have to pay you for the work you put it or there will be consequences..  is that a walmart policy?
bad,"the managers all act teenagers, are very rude and unorganized and always angry and pick favorites between friends. the hours are scarce because they always over hire and they give unrealistic deadlines. most the co-workers are fine because they understand that we are humans."
bad,"Every night is stressful due to the way management communicates. I've learned a lot about the importance of rotation and efficient work pace. Nights typically end with everything being accomplished, starting out there are a lot of ""fires"". Trucks are always late, putting workers behind. poor strategic strategies when figuring out where co-workers should be. The hardest part of the job is when management starts to get unnerved, and harass workers. I do however enjoy the other works."
bad,"A day at Walmart, I would clock in, and go straight to work. Usually I would start Zoning my department which was Housewares. I would move items to the front, fold towels, wash cloths and Rugs back and make it look neat. I would then take the L cart up to customer service and get my returns. I'd take them back and then start putting them where they belong. My co workers were the best, they were all so helpful in anything I wasn't sure of and taught me alot. I learned how to cut fabric and print out the price label, how to zone great, and how to help customers more. The hardest part was being put out on the floor not knowing a thing, this is why I was so thankful for my co workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help many people a day find what they are looking for and making them happy."
bad,"only money matters to company, raises advertised a joke 2% for most less than before. cut out holiday pay and raised insurance cost. Store management incompetent, don't even attempt to teach and train, prefer to bully and abuse best workers and losing many of them. Co-workers are great, we try to have a team spirit, but shot down by management by unreasonable demands. Much of pressure does come from corporate and constantly changing, the best managers are also abused and pushed unreasonably. Horrible work culture for this day and age."
bad,They have a tendency to care more about the bottom dollar than the people who work for them. Pay was ok but was the pay structure was changed months after I started so its not even ok now. Management depends on who you get and sometimes who the store manager is as to whether lower level managers will be friendly. What used to be a family oriented business has become a business where your family isn't part of the company plan.
bad,They are always short staffed so you end up doing 5 different jobs. The management is never on the same page one tells you to do something and then another tells you something else demanding that you stop what you were doing and then they both get mad for you not doing a third thing that no one had never even mentioned before. Depending on the person your co-workers can be very nice or as soon as you leave a room the can talk bad about you behind your back. the only thing enjoyable about this job are the long lunches.
bad,The work schedule was horrible. The managers were immature and out for them selves. They would often either sabotage a fellow manager or steel credit just to get a promotion. honest hard working managers would quickly fall victim to deceit. When I woved to the Backroom unloading merchandise I found out that they fired 60% of the work force and expected the remaining 40% to not only pick up the slack but also work faster. Needless to say people often got hurt because of this and would blame the employee for not paying attention.
bad,the management there is unfair they do not treat everyone as equals they advance the ones they like it does not matter how hard you work for them I worked there for 1 year never made full time never missed one day was never late but made two associates full time and they  hardly came to work too many chiefs not enough indians
bad,"Its a good company to work for, But the management is horrible. The hours they want you to work isn't all that to be you have 40 Hours a week but the balance between your work and personal life gets thrown off, you have no time for yourself or you family,But overall great company the pay is very nice. The co workers are cool you gave some people that have been there for 30 plus years and some people that don't want to be there."
bad,Was not given the opportunity to advance in my position. Management did not work well together leading to a hostile atmosphere and confusion amongst associates.
bad,As a productive cashier at walmart u start to realize that no matter how hard u work u wont be recognized. U cannot move within the company to another position making it impossible to advance. The unproductive workers are praised and will chant go Walmart as u slave away.
bad,"A typical day at work would generally include getting assigned a job. Retrieving carts of product, pulling it to the floor and stocking product on shelves. Pulled for small tasks such as using forklift to unload truck."
bad,Running out to put away carts no matter the weather fast paced environment that can drive people crazy because of how fast they want things done. I learned that I shouldn't take a job without researching them first they dont care about their workers at all I also got sold a bunch of stock that I will never see the money back for I am glad I was let go of when I did cause they would have continued to take away money for stocks capitalizing on my lack of knowledge in the stock market. The people who work there were down on there luck I have heard that people who work there are collecting Food stamps even though they are working pretty messed up to be put in that situation.  The hardest part of the Job would be how much they demand of a person who works there one of the worst places to work at for the average American worker and overseas I hear they are doing things even worse over there compared to here.
bad,I never had the supplies needed to do my job properly and was given a negative attitude by Management I learned to be adaptable and open minded and worked a flexible schedule.
bad,"After clocking in, I try to get a janitor cart ready, but supplies are sometimes short or equipment in poor repair. Sometimes, there's poor coordination in who does what tasks. Management care little about people skills and just care about the Walmart store. I would go so far to say that none of the managers are professionally trained. There is some kind of top-down Management pecking order. My supervisor is always stressed from other managers above him about maintenance things. ""Maintenance"" (Janitor) work at Walmart is very hard and really is an all purpose type job. That is, Maintenance is requested to do just about everything every other ""Associate"" requests from getting other items other than their own stock to cleaning up their mess. For the most part, most of the other Associates are great to work with. Walmart has great diversity in it's staffing. Other than that, I would not recommend working for Walmart, unless you're in a management position or you really need a job. Even then, you would be under a lot of stress."
bad,"Co-workers don't work together. Always doing a three man job by yourself. Management never listens. I learned you have to work hard at least, but not the the point where it sends me to a doctor."
bad,"I worked within the garden center as a sales associate/cashier. I enjoyed the work I did while there. However, there were quite a few downsides to being employed there. Not that I needed management supervision, but there are certain situations that requires a manager's attention. This became a problem, due to the fact that it seemed as if most managers forgot that the garden center was even a part of the store."
bad,"Walmart was a good stepping stone kind of job. they enforced customer service with a smile. helping people was my thing and I love it. is why I liked working there, but advancement was hard to come by they usually kept you at a minimal. but if you work hard you can be noticed."
bad,not as comfortable and very slow advancement even after good performance. Also limited help is given after joining and a lot of pressure with no benefits for part time workers even after a high work load day after day. Only full timers benefit
bad,as veses todos trabalhamos porque precisamos sustentar nossas familias e conquistar nossos sonhos mais a empresa nao sabe da valor nos funcinarios..
bad,Would recommend to people but would warn them ahead of time. Just didn't get along with anyone really while was there. Management definitely needs some work and improvement....
bad,"I've been with Wal-Mart four years and overall they've treated me fair, most of the people i work with are team players the only complaint I have is that i don't like their attendance policy and they don't accept doctors notes."
bad,"The work day drags and you get pulled away from your area constantly to sill in in other parts of the store. Have trouble completing work, Management drove me from the store as I got in trouble for reporting inappropriate behavior"
bad,"Worked there for a year, day shift and night shift. From what I can tell day shift seems to have better management at my location, when it comes to night though none of the managers knew what they were doing and were very uppity about the littlest of things. I would not recommend this job to anyone, do not waste your time."
bad,Management style in store made it difficult to enjoy my job.  This made the environment very poor to work in.  I typically stood in one place which made it difficult to work a long shift.  A lot of repetitive tasks and the job became tedious.  I liked the other cashiers I worked with and the flexible hours.
bad,The managers didnt know what they were doing half the time i was yelled at by one manager for doing what the other one told me to do and then they decided to both gang up on me and tell me i needed to learn how to multi task even though what they wanted me to do was something for front end and something in garden so was i supposed to run back and forth like a crazy person???????????
bad,"Unless the employee is decently high on the payscale (Customer Management, Security, Accounting etc) the atmosphere is the worst I've been around. Force you to take an hour long break (extending your time spent at work) and usually spend an extra 15 to 20 minutes to attend to customers after your time is supposed to end. I was put into a situation where I had to clock out at exact time. Instead I had to help customer and was blamed for an infraction I had no control over (broke same infraction while being reprimanded for this incident). Nobody wants to work there, leads to customer dissatisfaction. Maybe it gets better if you stick around for many years, but I do not believe so."
bad,If you could work for the low pay for a few years this could turn out to be a good job for you. Bad hours fast pace work culture.
bad,Basic entry level job only good for a stepping stone to to get into another job. Advancement is available only if you rub shoulders with the right people.
bad,"picking/binning, filling shelves, organizing."
bad,the Management here is not friendly. The associates not helpful to the customers. they don't give me hours to work even when i ask for them. they have no consistency and are very rude to customers. some act as if they don't want to be at work so they have very bad attitudes from the time they walk in to the time they leave work.
bad,"I worked very hard only to have no recognition for it. On the other hand, when you make one mistake, everyone notices and discourages you from trying so hard in the future."
bad,"Co-workers are friendly, somewhat organized place to work. Management staff was helpful. I learned a lot about customer service and how to deal with an extremely busy environment. The hardest part of the job was getting through the peak times of the day, lots of customers coming through. The most enjoyable part was the satisfaction of helping people get what they want"
bad,"The typical day of work was 8 hours of costumer service. Learned patience and how to interact with costumers for a longer period of time. The management was very poor and unwilling to help their employees. As a cashier, there wasn't very much interaction with the co-workers. The hardest part of the job was how repetitive it was. The most enjoyable part of the job was the costumer interaction and meeting new people."
bad,Se aprende a manejar el estrés y a trabajar bajo presión. El que es bueno en lo que hace conforme al tiempo se vuelve indispensable.
bad,"I worked in Dairy and it would be such a mess that me and my friend would clean and try to stock freight at the same time but they still want us to stock 8 pallets in dairy and check dates as well as get it all done on time when time management is already a problem. I got hired as diary and frozen and they never put me in there, instead they put people that do not know it at all. Also when me and my friend are there they give us pressure to have 5 pallets down-stacked and done in 3 hour while we are by ourselves."
bad,not a great place to be working at and has a horrible management that expects you to work as if you were three people. i would never work there again
bad,management don't care to much about their employees. That would even include upper management. Some of them try to get an associate to quit or get fired.
bad,A typical day was always having to clean up the shoe department. Put clothes and other items away in the right department.  Help costumers when needed.
bad,Its great if you just want a Job were you managers just don't care. the staff can be like a high school all over again and they often stay in each others business.
bad,"It was very difficult to work for this company, the way that the supervisors spoke to the other employees was sometimes disturbing. The best part about working here was dealing with the customers."
bad,"Helped customers with Customer service issues, and also maintained the Money Center. Handled heavy customer complaints, as well as heavy call volume."
bad,"I did not like it at all, everything was sorry as af, the people were evil, the management is evil, the way things are is evil, nothin made sense, glad I am gone for good"
bad,"Management does not treat you with the respect you deserve, but for a first job it has good pay and provides lot of experience for better jobs in the future,"
bad,"You will have to work different departments, besides the one that you were hired for. The hours are ridiculous and they change day by day. The pay is about around 7.66 and up or down, and the benefits are not all that good unless you are full time employee. The only plus is the people are quite nice and understanding most of the time, Plus the co-workers are pretty cool. The problem is that they will find just the littlest thing then you are done. It is how they keep getting so many temps."
bad,A typical day at work was to perform my duties and seven other positions also. I learned many positions. Management wasn't the best. Co-workers were okay. Hardest part of the job was staying motivated. I don't have an enjoyable time at the job.
bad,"Walmart is a corporation, and it's run as such. As low of pay as possible, as little of benefits as possible, and all of the money going to managers who, in the end, care only about their profit. It's very unfortunate having to work there because of lack of options, but it's a job and it's difficult to NOT get hired if you're desperate."
bad,"Pharmacy is an important section, all asociats work hard, unfortunately their work is really not appreciated as is it supposed to"
bad,"First, when I started working at Walmart, seemed alright. As time went on, started noticing employees stealing, management not doing anything, bringing in slow and unmotivated people, decreasing morale in the stockroom. No communication from managers to employees, except in a negative fashion."
bad,"You'll find some people have to work their butts off, while others do nothing. Management is worthless. They care of nothing more than their bonuses and who they can slave out next. Honestly, it was the most demanding job ever."
bad,I loved working with the public but not with the management at Walmart. It is not a very good company to work for I had many issues in the treatment of myself and other employees...
bad,A lot of nice people work at Walmart; I was fired for such a minuscule reason I imagine I was reported for talking about controversial topics in the break room.
bad,"Overnight stocker, I processed merchandise, made sure sales floor was tidy for the next morning. Worked there for almost 2 years."
bad,"customer service, stock , frieght, zone , sales pay is good hours were good at times unloading truck was slightly difficult woring with co workers was fun"
bad,"A typical day was getting managed by people who didn't know what to do. The management most had no comprehension of how to use assets to complete jobs in a timely manner. The hardest part of the job was spending 15 hours a day doing a job, which could have been completed in 8."
bad,"Work life balance is not family friendly."
bad,They really don't care about you as a person they are only concerned about you getting the job they need done.  They don't give breaks on time sometimes you don't even get a break until it's your lunch time and the scheduling is not very fair.
bad,go in and clock in but had to make sure you didn't go over your hours that were given. Then go to where your area or register is. I learn how bad people that shop there can treat you and how little management stands up for there employees. If you did something wrong managers would yell at you on the floor. And they would talk about it with each other in front of other employees and customers. Working with the other employees there was the best lots of really good people.
bad,Scanned items and received payments from customers was my daily job but sometimes it was hard if the prices of the items were not correct.  I learned to be patient with customers who were elderly.  I learned how to be careful receiving payments and giving change.
bad,"i start my day at 6:00 a.m.i am the first one there,i would look to see what needed to be done and work accordingly ,i learned there was no way i could make management happy,i was there for the customer and as long as they were happy was good enough for me.i was the only one working in my dept.A lot of bulling was done every day.yelling and even face's.in  most departments  ,new people won't last long.some won't last the first day.the hardest part of the job is to see them mistreat so many people.but i enjoyed helping the customer."
bad,"most people are friendly enough, but, in my experience, the managers don't care about the employees. When I spoke to managers about problems, ideas, or concerns they'd say ""yeah, I'll look into it"" or something along those lines, but then I'd never hear anything about it from them, and the problem would remain."
bad,"Walmart cares very, very little about their employees. I really enjoyed my job but bullying by my coworkers and lack of discipline from managers made it an intolerable environment."
bad,"I worked in diary department, typical were to refill milk and other diary products. Management would ask you to do petty and unnecessary work all the time. Managers' decisions never line up with each others. Looks very unprofessional on their part. You'll get coached for jut about anything. Good luck showing to work 1 min late!!!!!"
bad,About the only good thing from Walmart is the flexible schedule and the other employees who are stuck there with you. Other then that get ready for the worst types of customers and an overly complicated management system.
bad,"Always expect you to be doing something even when the there are no customers.  This place could be fun for someone else, I just did not enjoy providing customer service. Customers complain way too much for me."
bad,I worked for walmart for almost 18 years and hated every minute of it. A typical day at work included me getting yelled at and/or things being thrown in my face while ringing customer purchases at the register or returning their items they didn't want. The best part of the job was that I made a lot of friends while working there. what I learned from working at walmart is that some people are hateful and aren't happy until they make other people unhappy
bad,"I was thrown at a job with minimal training done via computer and was given about 3 weeks to begin meeting unrealistic goals for someone working there for years. Managers would not prove that quota times were actually made by a real individual and not just some number they set thinking it was possible."
bad,"Going to management with their ""open door policy"" only means that they will give you a few minutes to explain your problem, then they will dismiss you in a highly condescending manner.  "
bad,"Always something to do, most managers were friendly.I wish pay would of been better with full time hours&your discount counted always."
bad,"The worked with my schooling hours to help get me through college while I was obtaining my Associates degree. It is a job in retail, like any other job in retail. I worked behind the customer service counter and in the money center for a year then transferred to grocery, where I worked in the seasonal candy isle and stocked the registers. I went to work, stocked what I could, and went home. It paid what it was suppose to, no more, no less. no frills, no bells, no whistles."
bad,Was not a good place to work. Management treats employees like garbage.I learned all aspects of running the register. The hardest part and the possibly best part of the job is the customers.
bad,"Aprendí a capacitarme sola bajo las constantes peticiones cotidianas de socios , a trabajar bajo presión y objetivos de esta forma se me tomo en cuenta para escalar a otro puesto."
bad,You are on the phones the taking complaining customer calls that you cant help if you go over your scheduled break time due to was on the phone with the customer you are threaten with a write up. Bad place to work and the Management has no compassion and easily showed favoritism.
bad,"Management has little to no communication skill unless it's a complaint they have with you. It's more about who you know rather than how good you are. The job is really hard on the body physically because the coporate office will demand the store operate at 50%-60% staff, so you're stuck doing more than one job"
bad,"Walmart was very understaffed. As a result, we were often overloaded and overworked. I applied for a part time position but was given 40 hours a week. I had applied for a position that i could perhaps work 20-30 hours a week."
bad,"co-workers were super; management looked down at you; hardest part was not getting a 'thank you' or a 'job well done' from anyone in management."
bad,"The people who work at the Tire and Lube Express aren't trying to swindle you out of your money: it's just that they aren't properly trained, so they're really not competent at their jobs. I would never recommend that anyone get their oil changed at Walmart, not even if you work there."
bad,Some of your coworkers were pretty nice. There is a lot of drama that I do not do. I learned that this is a place that I do not want to go back to.
bad,Sign in with a badge. Check schedule but you get shuffled around a lot. What not to do as a manager. The management team just seems to sit back and relax. That old saying too many cooks not enough pans to do the cooking. The co-workers are great make a lot of friends. The hardest part is taking that first step in to the store Spending it with co-workers and customers.
bad,"every day was the same, cook, clean, deal with customers. i learned that the customer is always right is a lie. there was only one manager that i enjoyed working for the others not so much. i only talked to a few co workers. the hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers and managers yelling at the employees. i don't remember ever having an enjoyable part of the job."
bad,"I got to work with some great people, however, the schedules were everywhere. Management had started out great, but after my first two years there it drastically went downhill. Little room was given for any advancement, excuses were made to give no more then a $0.30 raise/year to the associates, and there ended up not being enough people to be able to properly provide the best customer experience necessary. Often having one associate covering 4+ departments, as well as having to help on till.  After our store became a Super Centre, most peoples hours were cut to 12/week, while they hired more people but didn't increase anyones hours."
bad,I worked at Walmart for a little over two years and when i finally left i only made $9.25/hour and the new people who were coming in made $9.00/hour to start off with. the management are lazy and the upper management try to tell you how to do your job when they've never done it themselves. During the holidays the employees hours get cut but they bring in 10-15 new people to work.
bad,"not a REAL good place to work. everyone there is always complaining about something I.E"" walmart does this, walmart doest that..."" it gets old fast. management is another problem. managers lack real experience in the positions apointed too. causing miss communication and bad experiences with customers and associates.  not everything is bad. i LOVE some of the guys and gals i work with. they bicker but they have a right to i guess. the reason i am leaving is because it really is exhausting repetitive work that just wears me down. and my classes took the hit for it."
bad,"Again, working as a receiving associate here is not exactly ethical. When it comes to the needs of an employees family or emergencies arise, this company does not support their people."
bad,Management was not concerned with workers concerns or thoughts on a different perhaps more effective way to accomplish something. Required work load was some times overwhelming with zero appreciation. Management often spoke very rudely to employees.
bad,"The job was ok I like hard work but the work environment is toxic. The management is bad working nights and they kept people on who couldn't handle the job. One of my coworkers on my team was caught sleeping over 3 times and was never fired."
bad,"The store I worked at was one of the better stores to shop at in my area, but it was not a good place to work. The store managers were out of touch with the employees and they had unnecessarily high expectations of associates. I enjoyed working with the group of cashiers at my store but that was the best part of my job. The position I had was the cashier supervisor and the person in charge of the front end, that meant if a customer got upset it was my job to make them happy. The management would routinely ignore calls for assistance with customers problems resulting in a very unsatisfied customer by the time the manager found the time to assist. To Walmart all that matters is numbers and getting the most that they can out of their associates without giving them anything in return. I would not recommend anyone work for that corporation."
bad,"First Couple of weeks were Cool. I Learned that everyone you work with isn't your friend don't matter how much they seem to be. Management is very Rude and Disrespectful, they talk bad on you to other co-workers(your Friends/Co-workers). Your Co-workers just as bad as Management. The Hardest part of the job is doing other positions that you didn't apply for, but they assign you to. The Most Enjoyable part of work, I Honestly have no idea."
bad,A typical day at work was very busy. The management and co-workers was friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was constantly having a huge line for your register and dealing with irritable customers but it taught me to multi-task and improved my people skills.
bad,This job allowed for ample time to continue education. Was good for steady hours. Encouraged training in other fields within store.
bad,"It was ok it had it's up and down's But like every job, they all have those. Some people thought they had more authotity than they did at this job which make it hard for some people to work there, But you have to push all they away and out of your mind. Like I say if you love your job, It will be the best job in the world."
bad,"A typical night at work is fast paced with trying to stock as much product on the shelves as you can from boxes that you open up, to get to the product inside, to fill the shelves, and helping customers find things they are looking for as well.  The hardest part is, after you are done with your assigned task,(or tasks), they then want you to do more work, (ususally the equal amount of 3 people. The most enjoyable part of the job is the occassional customer thanking you for your help."
bad,I don't ever want to work there again. The work load expected from employees is understandable for a corporation that is global and constantly short handed.
bad,"The managers are not well trained, or supportive. The pay is low, especially for women. They have historically given men higher pay when starting than women. Men are give preference for advancement. Managers pick favorites and those individuals are the ones that advance, no matter how hard you work. It is not a good environment and sometimes becomes hostile."
bad,"company not a good place to work went in as cashier and was put on floor in dept I didn't like, didn't want nights and that's what they gave me,"
bad,Great place to work! Employees get 10% discount. What sucks is the scheduling. Its hard to get them to work with college school schedules.
bad,An awesome place to work and be productive. Everyone was friendly and did their jobs accordingly. Only downfall was management and how they would communicate things to their employees and their lack of communication with each other.
bad,"Management was difficult to deal with.  Dealing with customers was o.k.  I did not care for the way they treated their employees.  They did not always back them up in situations where the customer was clearly out of line and had a horrible attitude.  If you were sick, your absence was not excused even with a doctor's note."
bad,"Terrible work schedules, not enough hours, favoritism was a virtue. No communication between management. Does not pay by experience."
bad,"A switch is used to turn a circuit or component ON or OFF."
bad,"A lot of politics here, looking to leave very soon. very monotonous and no appreciation of a job well done. Co workers are great to work with, management is very incompetent."
bad,I worked inside the pharmacy and It was very busy and overwhelming at times. I stayed here three months before I left. It was not enough training. A lot of hours there without the benefits. I understood a lot of the HIPPA laws so I understood that they had to be strict. The work wasn't bad.  Not having the right amount of people working is what made the job harder.
bad,"Working in the Walmart Deli isn't an easy job. The manual work wasn't too bad, but the people I had to work with made if very difficult to learn and be successful. The Deli has been through multiple people even since I left because of the same reason."
bad,Unless you are just starting out or have been there a LONG time DON'T EVER WORK FOR WALMART!!!! I will never work there again. The management does not care about the regular employees.
bad,"Not much of a chance of an advancement, Do not treat all associates equally, there are many hardworking and caring associates,  but they are not recognized for the good work they do.  Bonuses are huge at the top of management....but slim pickings on the bottom."
bad,"Job was repetitive and management was terrible workload was not even, the job was also really fast paced and was almost impossible to move out of the backroom"
bad,"I was hired to work in the hardware department as a sales associate. Shortly after I began working there, I was thrown around everywhere. I worked in receiving, pets garden center, grocery, cashiering, carts, and pretty much every department but the one I was hired to work in. I would have to say without question, Walmart is hands down the worst company I have worked for to date, because of the mistreatment of workers and low hourly wages."
bad,"Management team has no regard for associates lives, especially younger students, expecting them to work 25 plus hours a week while carrying a heavy school load. Team of managers are disrespectful, arrogant, and do not appreciate those that work hard. From personal experience, as an assistant manager, my fellow assistant managers frowned upon me trying to accommodate or work with students to find a suitable balance. Worked 70+ hours a week, doing multiple assistant roles with no compensation. It is now all about trying to make as much money and sales and profits by cutting wages and doing as much work with little support.  A lot of negative attitudes, every man for themselves, while others are not held accountable."
bad,"Managers and supervisors pushing their work off on the associates."
bad,"Liked my co-workers for the most part, disliked most of the managers. There is a lot of bullying from the managers towards the associates."
bad,"I have worked with this company for over eight years (since I was 16). It was a great place to work - family came first, individuals were always respected, management was kind and helpful, everyone had a pleasant demeanor. The company, now, is difficult to work for. I used to be able to have time off for school and extracurricular activities (high school and college), but was told I could not have time off to work at my other part time job. It is very difficult to get time off, no matter if you have an appointment, family gathering, school event, etc. - you have to speak to several levels of management and ask other associates to take or switch shifts. There is no respect for the individual from management or customers - if a customer is disrespecting you, management does not stand up for you. There is also a lack of communication among all levels of management and to associates. Some coworkers are pleasant and make the days somewhat enjoyable. New policies and procedures are implemented almost monthly; associates who have been with the company for a number of years are seeing a cut in benefits (I lost my health insurance because I did not average 29.9 hours per week while I was going to college), cut/change in pay raises, little to no flexibility for work availability."
bad,Productive and somewhat fun workplace .It is all about  money but I guess that's expected of a big company. Most of the managers are ok and supportive.
bad,"Went to work, clocked in, went to the customer service manager and she gave me a til for the cash register and told me what register to go to. I signed into my register put the til in and started waiting on customer's and ringing their items up. I greeted them with a smile and the utmost respect and made conversation with them all with a smile. I asked how they were doing, if they found everything they needed without any problems, and if they couldn't find something they were looking for I helped them and told them exactly where they can find them and they were very happy with my knowledge and helpfulness."
bad,There are flexible hours with various chances with potential for advancement in the company. Walmart is always looking for dedicated people
bad,Ive been with them for 2.5 years.  I do not get weekends off because im not one of the special people in our dept.  I do have kids and only get to see them fully on the weekends ive requested time off denied I have requested a change of availability but that means you do not want to work to them so they cut your hours Ive not found out yet if I got that change or not.  Communication wise is so poor they tell you they need to change your schedule the day before so you have no time to prepare your kids.  Over all management seems to treat you like a child with no appreciation.  Customers at my store have to wait on the next available associate to wait on them because our store is so poorly staffed.  We have to cross train in every dept.  that way their is to be coverage 1 person to 6 depts. so funny .  When I started this place was great but it has gone downhill since.
bad,Wal-Mart needs to make improvements in the way that they conduct business with the customers and improve the relationship between the employees.
bad,Bad Management horrible work environment  ask to much from there employees if you are a student hours contradicts your school schedules
bad,"Walmart is a really great place to work... if you are a member of management. Other than that then it's not worth it. How can I afford to live on 1, maybe 2 days in 2 weeks? I am one of the hardest working people I know (not trying to brag) and yet walmart doesn't recognize that an reward me with more hours. Instead it seems like they give me fewer and fewer hours!"
bad,A typical day at work involved checking customers out with two 15 minute break and one 30-60 minute lunch. The management was not too worried about your success in the company. Co-workers were only concerned about themselves.
bad,I could go on forever here but I won't the bottom line is this company says a lot and does a lot but none of it in favor of it's employees doesn't take long to realize it's all about them and your just a tool used daily!. they say one thing but really it's not possible to follow their rules and do the job. I dislike the company for many many reasons and would not recommend it to anyone but young guys just looking for a short term job.
bad,Je considère Walmart comme un pure système d'exploitation. Ou l'on te fait travailler comme un fou et le pire pour un salaire minimum. Beaucoup de pression et d'exigence. Et le salaire vous tue. C'est juste une porte de sortie quand on a un plan ou un reve. Mais pas un endroit pour faire aucune carrière. Tout dépend de qui vous etes.
bad,"I worked for walmart for two years in two locations. San Antonio, TX and Midlothian, TX. I would have to say they both had their equal amount of negativity and really the only thing I liked about the job was the job itself and being good at what I was doing which meant promotions faster."
bad,Unprofessional management which reflects onto  employees that are hired. Low hours and low pay in return for your maximum output.
bad,"i started working as a crewmember,sandwich making,prepping,slicing,restocking,placing orders,dish washing,fastly,timely"
bad,"chegava pegava meu carrinho ir pra sessão anotava tudo que estava precisando abastecer, ia no deposito pegar e levar pra loja."
bad,I liked working in the Apopka location for the most part as an Unloader the work/life balance was bad around the holidays. I was not fond the Bremen location.
bad,"terrible benefits"
bad,Your find great people who work along side of you. Management will try and push you everyday to work harder an harder then try to make you stay past your end of shift and then all the overtime you get the next day or someday that week your have to cut the time unless its a holiday. Then there never enough people to cover the shift so you got to work five times as hard because the shift needs 10 to 12 people and the most u get is 6 on a good day and 3 or 4 on the worst.
bad,The company was strict on everything. For the most part everything was organized even though I felt that they didn't hire enough people for the holiday season. I worked as hard as I could and still had no job security.
bad,i did not like working for walmart. the management was poorly. i learned a lot on how to run a register. the hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers.
bad,this job is for people looking for something temporary! Work schedules are horrible and the management sucks! Hopefully things are different now!
bad,There was little to no chances for advancement and management didn't really seem to care about their workers. Availability was often ignored and good workers were taken advantage of until the worker left the company.
bad,"If you love to work all the time, this is a great place to work, but if you love your personal time and family, then don't apply, you have to revolve around this company, they will not revolve around you, in a sense, Walmart owns you."
bad,When working for this company you can expect most customers rely on you for any kind of information. If you need a short term job for some quick money Walmart is the place to work.
bad,This Wal-Mart 2913 has been the worst Wal-Mart I ever worked for they are so unorganized. The mangers are so rude and disrespectful when they are talking to you.
bad,"The culture at Walmart can best be described as hostile. Management tends to be rude to both customers and employees alike and if their computer does not tell them how to do something then forget it because they are incapable of thinking of solutions on their own. No matter how many hours you work, they will find a way to stretch them to 6 or 7 days a week."
bad,The management team was not receptive or attuned to the needs of their employees. The health benefits were good. The group of people working there was amazing.
bad,"I have learn a lot about customer service and management. I have learned that I really love working with the public. I have learned problem solving, and how to deal with very angry customers."
bad,I didn't learn anything new aside form the advancement lies.  They take care of themselves and the mindless drones under them who kiss hiney and felate well.
bad,many managers were difficult to work with showed very little compassion for their employees. piled a lot of duties on to one person. never povided enough help for large projects or resourses to do said projects.
bad,"Walmart is  a fun place to work and a very deceiving and dishonest company to work for.Lots of people leave their jobs for a promise of a better life with (Walmart), once the stores are up and running? look out, hours cut, no benefits because you will not work enough hours to get any benefits."
bad,"Lot Attendant, ""Buggy Buster"", During this time, cart pushers were known as ""Stockmen"". We helped with customers with carry-outs when needed."
bad,Walmart in Champaign had horrible management. I worked really hard and felt as though I wasn't making enough for the work I had to do. My co workers were very friendly and I liked the work i did. I fixed photo machines and filed documents for projects and picture orders.
bad,Ok at best place to learn some skills to be used later in life. Good starter career. Management at this store needs more training in my opinion. To many close friendships that get in the middle of work.
bad,This place makes you feel very unappreciated. The management is usually stressed out so it is very often reflected on you. Enjoyed meeting so many different people.
bad,"What I have learned from Walmart, is that you must do everything on your own. Management is rude and not very helpful. When I was just starting off as a new employee, no one was training me. I had to train myself. A year has gone by now and I work very hard and get no credit for the things that I do. My co-workers can be friendly, but most of the time they complain and talk bad about others."
bad,"what can I tell you, it was walmart, the work sucked, the managers had no respect, the coworkers were rude, the only solace was that the paycheck was real."
bad,"Compensation was pretty low considering what the management wanted of the unloaders. In addition to the regular duties, we often had to unload the grocery truck and stock merchandise on the floor."
bad,"Not a great job, Good work, bad management, great co-workers and breaks well worth it!  I was working in all departments and i was suppose to be maintenance!"
bad,Management is a joke they pick and chose their favorites no matter how hard you work you don't get paid overtime even if you have worked it.
bad,"I am still working in this company and doesnot want to disclose anything till I am part of it."
bad,"I would clock in at 4pm and begin unloading the trailer at 4:05pm. We had to unload the trailer as a single person and others on the shift would pull the merchandise off the line and place it on pallets to be moved to the sales floor. The management was extremely poor, they did not care about their employees. All the management cared about was getting the product on the sales floor."
bad,"Sales, cashier, stocking, and customer service.  Selling TVs and advising customers is fun.  Colleagues are supportive.  Good work ethic is rewarded.  Pay and benefits are low and poor."
bad,The only things i could say about this job is that if you needed a job and no one would hire you apply here. Sometimes you do learn a lot of different skill and machinery but at the end of the day the management doesnt really care about their employees that much.
bad,"Management doesn't treat there employees like they are people, they consistently nag you for no reason. They use favoritism towards certain associates which is not right because all associates should be treated the same way."
bad,"Management stands behind the cashiers and listens to what the cashiers say so they can insure that the cashier is pretty much ramming the Wal-Mart Master Card down the customers' throats. And when they don't, management drags the cashier into the office and implies that if they can't do their job then they shouldn't be working at Wal-Mart."
bad,"lugar agradavel de trabalhar, trabalhava na parte de ferramentas , tintas e automotivos , abastecia mercadorias e cuidava de pedidos de mercadorias e validade"
bad,"Amei ter trabalhado no Walmart Brasil, pena que não tive a oportunidade de continuar nesta empresa, a melhor parte era sair de casa as 05:00 da manhã e saber que eu estava indo para a maior empresa do mundo."
bad,"My typical day at work would be to put on my uniform, and speak to a ""CSM"" for guidance on what register to attend to, i would spend 2.5 OR 3 hours on my cash register until its my first 15min break. "
bad,"My job at Walmart was horrible. My salary was 7.90 an hour and the management was unorganized, mean and rude. I was a Cashier and I loved my job because I enjoyed making customers happy."
bad,Do not like to work with employees enrolled in school or have families. Want employees to work in areas not trained for. Management isn't very friendly.
bad,"The hours were long I barely had time to take a break, Management was never nowhere to be found when my co-workers and I needed them. Most of the customers were rude, especially if they did not get the discount they wanted."
bad,Worse job I have worked at. Breaks and lunches were late. Negative attitudes were the environment. I learned that the managers do not know who you are. Communication in the store was terrible. They have no proof of anything they accuse anyone of doing.
bad,there is favoritism and unmotivated workers. its a place where they keep you limited to the place where you first applied for.
bad,"cashing payroll and government checks, MoneyGram services, bill payment, and customers being satisfied will always keep them coming back."
bad,"Few managers care about you, but all the others don't care for you and don't stand up for you when somebody treats you bad who's not a manager and complains and cries alot so they can get whatever they want."
bad,Typically the job day would start around 10 pm with an overview of the night. Once everyone had their job for the night the meeting was over and work would begin. The management team was never on the same page. Each manager would contradict the other. The hardest part of the job was trying to finish the job of another coworker.
bad,I had lots of problems with this Job because they don't care about the employees. If you have a problem you use the open door policy. Basically it's you vs the managers and your problems don't matter.
bad,"Good with coworkers. Can handle multi tacking with coworker and customer. Could handle cart handle, carry out and maintenance."
bad,"no money, no advancement, no future whatsoever. boring, pointless, and unsupported. the best I can say is that middle management at least seemed to like me."
bad,Not enough people to man the floors very poor communication between staff not a pleasant place to manage.not fun Period.
bad,"Can be fast-paced, friendly, at times lack of help due to low management. Sometimes the manager makes ways to be more organized and attentive to the customer needs."
bad,This job had poor management and didn't care anything about employees. Treated workers like crappie and didn't respect there personal lives.
bad,the store is always busy with less employees and the managers are always pressuring the employers. its a fun place to work at becuase sometimes you can meet some good co-workers.
bad,"Working at Walmart has been a life learning experience. Compensation and benefits are very poor there and definitely needs great improvement. Overall it is a decent company to work at while furthering your education, pursuing future endeavors or climbing the latter there."
bad,A typical day can go from easy to stress full at any given time. I have learned how to be a good manager and I was empowered to make business decision. Upper management does need work and there could also be a better avenue for assistant managers to make that transition into co manager roles. My co workers are hard working and  they deal with a lot from day to day. The hardest part of the job is last minute decisions that affect the associates and management greatly that is just drop on Us without warning. The most enjoyable is that working at walmart your built tough and is able to handle almost anything is thrown your way.
bad,"I have been with Wal-Mart for 7 years, and if it weren't for the pharmacy, I wouldn't be here. The benefits are moderate at best, and they pay is minimal for the job I'm doing."
bad,"I moved to a small town from the city and Walmart was the major employer. My job at Walmart was fun at times, yet very stressful. This was just a job for me and not a career."
bad,"It was nice to be able to find a job at walmart. But as far as hours they would make me work was ridiculous. i was a part time cashier and make me work 38-39 hours on a pay period. they would stop me at 39 hours to not pay me full time or give me the full time benefits. Walmart would also give me hours in which id have to miss school, not only was i missing alot of school i was also missing alot of work because this is my last senior year and i have to be on track to graduate.  A lot of the co workers were friendly most of the time, but there was a lot of drama and rumors that would go around, in which i would mind my own business but i woulod some how get involved with rumors starting about me. The hardest part of my job was dealing with selfish rude customers, but i have patience which helped alot with my job."
bad,"They hire you for part time but work you full time hours.  They will work you 40 hours a week for several weeks, then throw in a 20 hour week so they can keep you at part time status to avoid benefits.  They bring you in for one position but pull you all over the place.  They keep it extremely hot in the store causing the employees to be soaked in sweat and uncomfortable.  Coworkers are all very nice to each other but management seems to have a I am better than you air about them even though most of them started in the same place you are.  If it were not for the fact the company focuses more on ways to cut costs to cheat employees it would not be that bad of a job but the only way to be treated right is to move up the ladder and the only way to do that is to suffer through them keeping your benefits out of reach, working in uncomfortable work environments, and being ok with being hired for one position but constantly being thrown into others because they don't want to pay to keep enough employees on the floor."
bad,A typical work day would be unloading trucks and sorting material then putting it on the shelves. I learned that there is a lot more to walmart than most people know. The management was poor.
bad,"I dreaded going to work everyday and at the end , it really became a chore. The best part about working here are the other employees and the customers. These guys are the people who make the job tolerable. The things that make this job unbearable are the fact that they clock your every move. You feel like a slave and you are constantly being watched. You can't even take a potty break without being questioned or someone coming in to check on you and god forbid you take 16 minutes instead of 15 minutes on your break! You will be hassled and reprimanded beyond belief. Let's not get started on the wages. Over the course of a year I only earned a.10 cent raise although I was always on time, friendly and one of the top 5 fastest cashiers. Don't waste your time!!!!"
bad,"Hectic work environment, department poorly managed. Uncommonly low pay rate for average automotive technician, especialy considering I work for the worlds largest retailer. Consistently low on needed work supplys and equipment. Customers are very rude at times and there no proper management to provide imedieate customer service. Overall hard to function properly."
bad,under staff we were lucky if we have 4 people to unload a 2600 pcs truck and they expected it done in a hour and a half witch we did when we had the right number of people
bad,"Operating the cash register, greeting customers,bagging customers items, price checking customers items, cleaning up, counting money"
bad,i was a cart pusher at walmart for about 2 miserable years.. management was always changing and nobody cared bout the employess... all fake personas...overall it was straight for a job when you are young
bad,I have learned to do a few jobs in the backroom as well. Some times management is sometimes not fair. I get along with everyone there. The hardest thing about my job is the compensation I receive. I enjoy working with the other associates.
bad,doing the same thing over and over there is no enthusiastic about the day. the most enjoyable moment is when my fren is there.
bad,It used to be fun back when I started because Sam Walton was still alive. The managers made it fun to work and we got paid for it as well as the customers were great and some not so good.  I learned to deal with good attitudes as well as bad ones.  Managers were great back then they would help you out work as a team with you.  They teach you a lot so you can move up in the company.  Management come and go you have good ones and some not so good.  The hardest part was not being able to help the associates with their concerns about problems in their area.  I spoke with management and they didn't take the concerns seriously.  The most enjoyable part was to see my associates get promoted and than they would come and say thanks for telling them to hang in there and not give up.  I have had the privilege of working with a lot of people who I still keep in touch with and will always be part of my life.
bad,"Wal-Mart, does not offer full time or good benefits. But Wal-Mart has a very strong team that pushes for customer service."
bad,"Wal-Mart was my first job. This particular store was run with a high school mentality and I would never want to go back there. I was more or less forced to stay in the position I was in because of my size. I was also treated as if I had some sort of a mental disability, also due to my size. The people who ran this store were completely unprofessional and I was picked on constantly, which eventually lead to my exit."
bad,"I usually started off the day by stocking milk and eggs, checking to see if shelves were full and checking dates on perishables. Then I would stock shelves and maintain both the dairy and frozen departments. I learned how to do everything that includes. The management there was really strict. There actions made it blatantly clear that they were your boss and not your friend. They seemed to always be looking for a reason to complain. I felt discriminated against in this company. Co-workers weren't to bad but the strictness of the management caused co-workers to be mostly there for themselves. That is they seemed to always be looking for reasons to complain about other co-workers so they can get ahead. These actions were detrimental to the team effort that was expected. The one thing that was good about this job was that a employee was usually given a steady flow of hours from week to week."
bad,"Hard place to work.  The management culture was self-centered and top heavy.  One day praise for a job well done, next day hauled on carpet for same well-done job.  Depended on manager. "
bad,The co-workers are fun to work with. The most enjoyable part of this job is to help the variety of jobs and duties I do everyday.
bad,As a member of management i was asked to terminate all my long term associates because they were high dollar employees. I was told that firing one 20+ year associate would make room for more than 5 part time associates. I stood up for my associates and was terminated for it.
bad,"you have to work all holidays and they do not care about your social life or family "
bad,"There is absolutely no respect for the associates. They are always short people and don't seem to care one bit. They only have two maintance for the entire store. People have to work in at least 3 departments every night. They fire people for the most arbitrary reasons like calling off for one night and constantly cut hours. Everybody makes mininum wage , even overnight people are only making 9 dollars an hour. It's completely ridiculous how they conduct business and treat their employees.You are constantly disrespected by managers there's no common courtesy. The company makes you lie and say it's absolutely wonderful working for them but that is far from the truth. If I had to say something I enjoyed meetings where they informed you about business for two hours unlike now where management  simply talks about people fired and people going to be fired. If they cut welfare walmart employees aren't going to survive."
bad,"A typical work day begins in Housewares with checking to see if any merchandise needs to go out on the floor and seeing what items have been returned that either need to go back out or be taken to Claims.  Usually, after I begin this, sometimes my supervisor will find me and give me tasks to perform - such as filling end caps, or setting mods, etc.  I will begin this tasks, and then I will often be repeatedly pulled from my job to operate a register, cover breaks for those in Apparel (as we are often understaffed) sometimes go to help out customers in Toys, or Sporting Goods and Hardware, occasionally I help out in Fabrics.  Sometimes I will get pulled to help out in Apparel as well.  And often I need to perform these duties while working in my own department as well as assisting customers.  During certain points of the day, I am to help out zoning in grocery and zoning in Apparel.  "
bad,"I am a Certified Pharmacy Technician in a 280 to 500 prescriptions per day pharmacy. The pace is very fast and the responsibilities are enormous. Compensation is slightly above a cashier position.  "
bad,"terrible job training, terrible management, over worked and underpaid,          "
bad,In the beginning working at Wal-Mart I got a good vibe from it the workers were nice as well as the CSM'S (Customer Service Managers) that was until we got new management and everything just went down hill from there. Empolyees began to leave we were short on staff which out more pressure and work on the remaining workers.
bad,"The hardest part of the Modular Team was finishing a modulars on time because we never had everything to build it. "
bad,My co-works were awesome but management could be sometimes hard to work with I would not recommend to anyone. they fired me over my freedom of speech.
bad,"I worked for a fairly decent amount of time for this company, and was very disappointed with the lack of appreciation or recognition this company offered. They expected the hourly managers to work far beyond what was required on the schedule. The pay was terrible, which made the job that much worse. The amount of work that was expected to be completed by an hourly manager was ridiculous. It seemed nearly impossible for two people to complete, let alone one individual. There were very few opportunities for advancement or pay raises. Overall, I was blessed to find a higher paying job."
bad,"I had issues as far as management was concerned; daily tasks weren't being done, instead I was being targeted by the new CSS. When reported to Management, management was useless. Nothing was done, said, or changed. So In turn, I quit. It was an unsafe work environment, not just of management and co-workers but because of our lack of security as well."
bad,I loved going to work everyday because of the people I worked with. We always tried to make for a happy and fun work environment. I also got to love some of my regular customers that I saw week after week. We got to know each other by first name and it was great to have that short conversation while performing their transaction. The only bad part of my experience was the under trained members of management. They have no respect for the employees and almost never say please or thank you. The store manager was on leave or vacation more than she was running her store. I believe that our store would have a so much better work environment if the salaried members of management had better manners and were better trained.
bad,This job is nothing like it seems. They show you no respect and fire people for literally no reason. The hours are long. They don't offer overtime. You can get fired for being a minute into overtime and the management is very disrespectful.
bad,Zone area and work fitting room. Management seemed to be lazy and uncaring. Learned how to be more patient with uncooperative co-workers. Hardest part of the job was doing all the work and getting no appreciation
bad,Process freight and take to the floor.  Put merchandise on the racks.  Zone the racks and tables.  Help customers whenever possible.  Work multiple departments where needed.
bad,"Managers are permitted to do whatever they want, refuse to follow even federal laws regarding employment.  Home Office Ethics board, and ""open door policy"" are jokes, they do not reply to complaints, and refuse to investigate allegations of wrongdoing committed by management. Case in point, I was Fired over an Asthma attack caused by workplace conditions, and store manager falsified report, and is fighting even the unemployment compensation! Totally disregarded FMLA law, and ADA. Refused to provide reasonable accommodation, and defamed my character to others, by lies stating I refuse to show respect/listen to superiors. Falsified documents, to state that I, in writing, admitted to such statement of disrespect and refusal to obey superiors. DO NOT APPLY FOR ANY WORK IN WALMART!"
bad,"Wal-Mart is fast paced and expects 110% every day.  Staffing is always short, so you can expect to be the only person in an area, even during rush times.  Management was hit or miss- especially the higher up they got.  Every work delegation felt like an ""or else"" threat, especially knowing that the employees there had no other income.  The pay was minimum wage, and scheduling was strict.  My mother was in the hospital for a week and after missing a day it was brought to my attention that any other schedule deviation would be met with a write up.  For the constant stress and pressure brought by the management, the frustrated customers were even worse.  It felt impossible to make anyone happy.  I will never work for Wal-Mart ever again."
bad,I enjoyed working with the people that I worked with. the hardest part of my job was going through all the expired groceries.
bad,"Management did not accommodate my school into my work hours, co-workers were fine. The most enjoyable part was helping someone get something that can enjoy.The hardest part about the job was finding the energy to do what needed to be done."
bad,"Managers lacked knowledge of their own store, employee discounts are a complete joke, you will never receive a holiday bonus."
bad,"Management does not care about the employees. You are thrown into a high stress environment and put to work until you start to like it or you break, I broke. I was promised advancement at least three times, each time I found I was lied to. On multiple occasions I was threatened with bodily harm by customers. Generally I felt I like I was not seen as a human more like a machine that no one cared about until my usefulness was gone."
bad,its a job not really what I thought about it but it worked with your schedule just theres alot of perferences over other workers. The days get busy there really isn't alot of help if you need it most css's take forever to help you out if you have a question you have to figure it out on your own.
bad,"Lets just say if I didn't have friends who still worked there, and if they didn't work around my school schedule I wouldn't be there still."
bad,"Wal-Mart is just a place to work if you want to get by.  It is not a bad place to work say if you're attending school or if you are looking for your first job, but it is by no means a place to make a living or to find a career.  It is a fairly fast-paced environment that is very much customer service oriented, with well defined roles and expectations for its positions but low wages and little compensation for the work that is done even, for those in supervisor positions.  The work force is generally understaffed and there is always more than enough work to go around.  Management is helpful and co-workers are fairly enjoyable for the most part but there are always a few exceptions.  There is little room for advancement unless you are willing to invest years into the company.  Education and past work experiences are not honored as much as you'd hope.  New employees will generally start from the bottom."
bad,The amount of work you have to accomplish on a daily work day far exceeds the pay rate. The management staff are inefficient. Customers have no respect for the sales floor or the employees.
bad,"busy fun fast pace environment"
bad,"Selling and fixing Jewelry, Stocking pulling pallets for both jewelry and for the shoe department. cleaning, inventory, and what ever else management asked. Working with customers."
bad,Walmart will find a reason to fire you if they want. Low job security and poor management. The pay is hard to live on. The co-workers are the best part of the job. The worst part is the management.
bad,"Walmart has completely lost touch with the core values that made made the company. The Work/Life balance is gone for most employees part time and full time primarily due to work schedules being done at the corp level. If you are a salaried manager expect to work in some cases as much as 16 hours a day. Compensation is low and benefits though offered to all full time employees is rendered almost useless by the low wage due to deductibles that require almost half your income per year. Job security and advancement come down to who you know and not how qualified or what you know. Management takes a complete hands off approach to work with few exceptions most I have dealt with have no ideal how to manage resources within the store they feel the are above doing the work themselves even if they are the only ones available to do it. The job culture is like many companies they over look anyone that is well qualified, set unattainable expectations then hold it against  employee preventing promotions while also creating a rift of discontent among the hourly management and employees."
bad,"Walmart was a somewhat difficult, yet rewarding employer to work for. I learned quite a bit about working within corporations, where anything can change within a day. I performed the basic, yet demanding ability of cashiering. The most important thing to me was making sure I did my best to leave our customers with smiles on their faces."
bad,"You'd think it was a great place to work but walmart has changed. When I was there in 2005 I loved it. Now it's all about reducing costs and treating employees poorly. I tried my best to stay loyal but their policy contradictions always get under your skin. One day you're a great employee, the next day they are writing up 10 employees for a minor mistake (which stops you from getting promoted). I've seen dedicated employees there for 14 years and get fired over a small mistake. "
bad,"Typically night maintenance would do nearly nothing, leaving much for the day maintenance such as myself to pick up the slack to no commendation nor recognition of such. I would immediately start in on cleaning the bathrooms that typically would be untreated by the time I would usually come on, either at noon or afternoon, or I would make at least one cardboard bale that was almost always overfull, then I would do a safety sweep of the entire building, touch up on the bathrooms before lunch, tackle the bathrooms again after lunch, collect and compact all the trash in the building, make a bale, and do a safety sweep before leaving. One thing I liked about wal-mart was that I was always busy, and the hours were good too, but only if you had hours. I learned how to make bales, and zone, and make stuff, but I learned more that not only honest hard work isn't enough to get by in life, but it almost certainly doesn't help you at all. If it did I wouldn't be writing this, but I was the best maintenance worker they had and they kept the guy that put more effort into hiding than into working, simply because he had been there 2 months more than me, he was a regular associate and I was still a temp, and after the holidays they let all the temps go. Not all management there was a joke, but I spoke to THE store manager about this when nothing was being done about it by the CSS' s, and not only nothing happened, but then 2 days later I was let go, and I know it said ""without reasonable accommodation"" or whatever, but when you're my overseeing manager and I'm asking you why I have 0 hours"
bad,"Low wages and associates struggle to get hours most are under 30. If you kiss managements butt you will move up. Hard work means nothing, they promote their buddies."
bad,"break down load, stock merchandise, clean shelves,clean produce floor, and take trash/palllets to backroom"
bad,"Walmart expects more from associates than they deliver in return.  Part time associates are expected to be available any time but only as Walmart needs.  Associates are expected to be available 40+ hours over the holidays, including full shifts on those holidays, but after Christmas, hours are cut in half.  You constantly work nights and weekends, regularly work at least a week straight with no days off, and when you do have days off, they're never together.  Management will put you down if you ask for a steadier schedule.  They can't understand why anyone would want a life outside Walmart!  Important rules and procedures are never seen in writing but expect to be reprimanded or ""coached"" for not following those.  Also expect them to change on a whim.  Most coworkers are fine since you're all in the same boat, but some feel the need to backstab to get ahead.  The best part are the customers, even the bad ones, because you can always learn something from that experience.  The worst part of the job is management and the ever-changing rules."
bad,The Job itself was just a starter. I learned how to handle mad customers and keep myself calm. Management was slow to respond. My coworkers were enjoyable and I enjoyed talking to customers
bad,You can work your butt off and get no reward for it. The saying its all about who you know than what you know.  Some co-worker are great some kiss up. to move up in the company
bad,Every time I had a question for a manager they would push me off and wouldnt talk to me and said that they are too busy and couldnt help me. Also when I was on leave they would not even call me back. I was great to my customers and really happy except with the managers.
bad,"A mental prison. Too much work, Little incentive. Managers are always riding you even when they clearly see you doing what is being asked of. This being the result of there being more work than the amount of employees scheduled. Overall a negative atmosphere."
bad,"management sucks, they are rude and very mean while at times thinking nothing of you or how you might feel. since there could be places to advance in your job most people and mangers are very cutthroat to be seen as better then the rest."
bad,"Very busy and customers are always wanting your attention with questions on certain items. The job is okay, but the management and CSM are very rude and unprofessional. The most enjoyable was working around a lot of people."
bad,job has a bad enviroment the concrete has a lot of holes in it the job is plating products they did not provide safety glasses nor mask so i assumed that management didnt care about there employees
bad,I worked part-time for four or five hours a day. I learned how to work a cash register. My co-workers were hard to get along with. Most of them did not work hard which made my job harder. The hardest part of the job was dealing with my co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the 15 minute break I got.
bad,"There is a lot of demand at this job and little praise. A typical night starts with clocking in and down stocking the merchandise. After that  its involves working in ones aisle putting up the products in proper places until around four-thirty-five. After that is zoning for the rest of the shift. I find my coworkers to be fairly reasonable and easy to get along with. There are three breaks- two fifteen minutes and a hour lunch. "
bad,"Walmart is a job. Management is a bunch of brain washed robots. I learned a little from the first store. I knew and know more than the my first managers and more than my current managers. They aren't willing to do things to benefit themselves and the company. The hardest part of the job, is working with people in particular management, that won't listen to complaints and suggestions. The most enjoyable part is working and causing the store to look inviting and presentable to the public."
bad,"Irregular schedule, low pay, not enough help to get the work done. I did learn about the retail business."
bad,"•	Developed connections with customers in order to better serve their needs.  "
bad,"A typical day at Wal-Mart is running from place to place and staying on top of your task, getting moved frequently and needing to know more then one skill. I learned how to interact with the public, manage money at a fast pace, and how to be quick with changing speed or tasks. Co-workers and customers can be pleasant, or unpleasant you stride to make people happy. The hardest part of the job is jumping from place to place and not having a constant standing throughout the day, and those difficult customers that are hard to please. The easiest part is just trying to keep relaxed and go with the flow of things and making sure the job gets done right."
bad,"I like Wal-Mart, but I was given very few hours, at a low rate of pay.  Also the store I worked at was a long distance from my home."
bad,"if you need job experience and gain some common knowledge, good option. can quickly move to customer service a low level of management for experience. the pay is just crummy and the treatment is even more ghastly."
bad,"I am an overnight stocker, it was an okay job at first, but I am ready to begin my career in healthcare. I have rare opportunities to use my knowledge gained in college at my current job & I feel there is not much room for advancement. Retail is fun, but it is not my place or calling in life. My co-workers are great & my direct supervisors are great as well. The job is mundane after so long. I am looking to use my logical thinking skills & my passion to help others in my next job & get my foot in the door to begin my healthcare career. There isn't anything difficult about my current job, I am a hard worker & I go above & beyond my duties every single night."
bad,Not a place good place to work. There are so many negatives I'm not even going to bother stating them.
bad,Did your daily job duties along with doing more that what you can/have time to do. Constantly assisting in other departments due to short staff. Managers are either friendly or highly unpleasant. No chances to move forward or receive raises. Not a career path job.
bad,over the years store managers get worst and worst.use people for their protection of their jobs .to put it simple it a dog eats dog world in walmart
bad,"I wouldn't work for this company again, nor suggest to anyone to work for this company. There is no job security! HR and Management were not working collectively which caused issues in scheduling changes. Scheduling changes caused issues and with that came termination, due to Management no error of employee!"
bad,"I enjoyed working for Wal-Mart that was the reason why I worked there for 2 yrs., the best attribute about working for wal-mart is the customers, as well as the fellow co-workers."
bad,sales and profit number one priority. work life balance is tough.
bad,"La evaluación sobre su personal consiste en un defecto de personal de recursos humanos sin estudio en el manejo de su personal y aptitudes de cada individuo, para lo cual no se tiene un control de cada individuo como socio, lo cual hace que las personas con alto valor de experiencia no logren los objetivos que por parte de la misma empresa busca, todo esto al final de la producción es de suma importancia, por ser que las personas que inician a laborar en esta empresa no tienen la experiencia laboral ni el estudio correspondiente, que hace la diferencia entre trabajador y un asociado, por lo cual el compromiso en el socio, así como en el trabajo no es de suma confianza."
bad,being understaffed was a huge problem. Not only would I have to make sure my work was done in my department; I would have to be the coverage for unstaffed areas of the store as well. Your hard work went unnoticed and management were not making sure employees were treated fairly.
bad,"Typical work day was get straight to work and focus on the customers.  First thing you learn with working in a major retail store is patience especially with management because they were very disorganized and the customer is not their first priority because when they're called for assistance, sometime it would take 30 minutes or more to respond.  Some won't even come.  They'll send someone else while they sit on the phone on a person call, or if they just didn't want to help.  The co-workers were the exact opposite of management, and the hardest thing with working for walmart was the poor communication from management and doing double work because of that.  I enjoyed the customers the most.  They were the reason I showed up for work everyday."
bad,"Walmart in Albion is not the best place to work, very poor management skills. Not the nicest people. Although holiday pay was great but they will rarely work you 40 hours a week."
bad,"Job was fun and easy, I had independence within my role to work as part of a team to complete the tasks required. "
bad,Only thing good was 4days off and the pay was great. So many hours put in for 3 days was a very physical demanding job.
bad,Unloaders have the hardest job in the company and make the least amount of money.
bad,"a typical work day would include arriving at work, and promptly jump onto the register, there would only be about 3-4 cashiers at the most everyday after 6pm so it added on to the work we had to do."
bad,"stock merchandise, keep sales floor clean"
bad,"What Can I say its Walmart! Fast, Safety, Power Trips, Customer appreciation, employer discount, committed, team work, competition, passion, work hard, confident, punctual, above and beyond customer satisfaction guaranteed. And most of all  ""always low prices"" Wal-Mart Inc."
bad,"A typical day @ work was very busy to steady work - like to stay busy.  Checking out many customers on cash register.  EBT(Food Stamps), WIC(Assistance for Infants) Vouchers were done a little differently.  "
bad,No respect towards employees by upper level management. The hardest part of my job was the lunch schedule. No one ever went to lunch on time. There was nothing enjoyable about working at Wal-Mart.
bad,"This location has no idea what organization is, none of the managers care about anything especially the employees. No union. No job advancement opportunities on nights because they don't want to lose night shift employees. Low pay."
bad,"A typical day,assisting the general public,while considering there abilities,as customers or vendors,on the phone or within the store.To stay above the negative responses from the general public in all its aspects.Honest management would have created a more positive work environment,as well as respect for employees as individuals.Co-Workers,came and went very quickly for the most part.Some that remained there for some time,had been a positive aspect to work through a shift and also learn new ideas.The hardest part of the job was working for such a low wage for the amount of workload that was expected and added with new management or new policies and no bonuses or other incentives to the extra workload.The most enjoyable part was working along side great staff members and creating new friendships."
bad,"They do not pay well, they expect you to do additional work with no additional pay.  The management of the store was poor.  They never had necessary supplies like paper for the register, bags, fraud pens.  My co-workers were all right.  Some of the managers were good, if you were in the right department.  The hardest part of the job was working without the proper supplies.  The most enjoyable part for me were the people, I am a people person.  As a cashier we make the difference whether a customer goes home angry or satisfied."
bad,It is better than having no job. It is a difficult place to work.
bad,Walmart is not a company who cares about their employees. The only thing they care about is their profit margin.
bad,"A typical night concluded of down stacking product of pallets. then, placing them in aisles and stocking under a certain time. Also, helping customers when needed"
bad,"Wal-Mart doesnt pay to much mind to their employees, very nice people. Management is awesome! :)"
bad,they work you all different hours not having a set time.  to much drama.
bad,Lacks of communication and equality. Lots of work and stress and goals without the proper compensation for having to go over and beyond all the time to these daunting tasks.
bad,Job was ok for part time. Benefits where not good for full time.
bad,Management refuses to give the employees enough hours to provide for there families more employees on food stamps and welfare then can count
bad,"I learned nothing, managers were not on their game. No solid schedule."
bad,"My typical day at work included teaching new employees how to stock, stocking, and casheering. I learned how to use the cash register. There was no mangement duty for me. Most of my co-workers were friendly but then there were some that were a bit rude. The hardest part of the job stocking items that were too high on shelves. I did not enjoy anything at my jobs."
bad,Managers expect miracles and don't realize want a person has to do in the short time they want it done.
bad,There was a lot of favoritism between day and night cashiers also between coworkers. We as cashiers did all the work and made sure we kept the customer service return area neat the whole night and there was only on cashier on the tobacco line. If that line got long through the whole night they would send one of us to finally go. I signed up to cashier mainly and as a customer I know we don't like waiting a long time in line so it made me think we were giving bad service.
bad,"Empresa com uma equipe boa para trabalhar, mais com uma quantidade de stress muita alta, tinha um bom ambiente."
bad,"Very stressful atmosphere, disrespectful management team, co workers don't get along, won't help.customers are very agressive and management won't stand for you."
bad,Only certain people could set a schedule. Work hard but it was never noticed. Management was very hard to communicate with at this particular store. Didnt like this job and i really have nothing good to say about this job!
bad,"it was a job, didn't pay the best but it gave me some money in my pocket and passed the time"
bad,"Poor management, disrespect among workers, favoritism, un-realistic expectations. No advancement, balance of school and work was not well."
bad,Management was never on the same page. Bad communication by management. Management displayed disrespectful attitudes towards employees.
bad,"A typical day working at walmart. The management team is very unorganized, the co-workers never want to help out with the customers. I learned how to run a machine that required strong communication skills."
bad,"A typical day at work is I would punch in, then they would tell what door I had to cover that day then go to that specific door and start greeting people."
bad,Working for Wal-Mart was a good experience for me. I provided excellent customer service and that was the highlight of my day.
bad,"This is the type of company that does not care about it's employee's. The management treats their staff with the most disrespect that i have ever seen and I do not recommend anyone to work here. I must say that there are a few managers that actually care and try. But when you tell the company that you cannot travel to another store because of lack of money for gas or car issues they still force you to go, and then the compensation for the miles traveled to that store is not even enough the the trip its self. They also do not pay that well. I am a department manager and can not ever put food in my fridge. These are some of the reasons that I need to find another job as soon as possible."
bad,its Walmart...everything you hear is true. the leaders are little more then number hunters and you will never know what is going on.
bad,The best part about the job is getting to know people. I just want to grow and change my area of field and make more money. This store is under new management it seems to be getting better. I understand when hired there is a job to be done. I don't feel like a person have to be robotic almost cant talk and laugh with coworkers only for a minute and back to work. I believe a fun environment helps ease the stress and tension of the tasks of many which helps provide better customer service and hard work.
bad,"I enjoy the work I do; but Walmart is a very negative environment."
bad,"Standard ""box on shelf"" job. Learned how to use a box cutter, and warehousing. Management wasn't always the best. Co-workers were a good bunch of people, very few if any complaints. Hardest part was the deadlines. Completely filling the toilet paper department in under 4 hours. I could get it vaguely filled, but not 100% filled. Most enjoyable was the last 30 minutes of clean up, and working in teams, and a ""blitz"" team we did once, where we had a group that would just rush the quick and easy freight in each department, 1 person picking up the garbage, and off to the next zone, and the regular employee of the area would just stay there and finish up."
bad,I really do not have anything nice to say. I helping customers. They did not treat their employees very well at all . I was under paid. The benefits was very poor.
bad,Walmart is a great place to work. Walmart likes to avoid policy and help out customers as much as possible. One time I returned a whole refrigerator at full price when we don't even sell refrigerators. Walmart is definitely ALL about the customer.
bad,Maintenance/ custodial sometime went do not have time to do are jobs. Begin went have to help with stocking  merchandise at work. And manager do not care if the store is cleaning.
bad,"They work you hard and expect you to do the work needed, but they don't compensate you for it. They don't care one way or the other if the working conditions are good or poor, they just want the work done. "
bad,wasnt happy with mangers didnt treat employees wrigh and talked down to them and not a nice place to work for loved my coworkers all hard working people
bad,"Instead of being treated as an individual, or as a human you are treated as an easily replaceable number which is stressful in the sense that you are always worrying about job security. The job itself is very easy and provides no challenges. The only enjoyable part of the job is the occasional nice customer that actually talks back and reciprocates attempts at a brief courteous conversation while scanning and bagging there order in a quick and efficient manner."
bad,Not a great career choice but it will help you build your skills and help prepare you for a career elsewhere.
bad,"not a desirable work environment. A great many members of the management staff lacked proper knowledge and training, an overall lack of commitment in working to see the store succeed from the majority of staff and management."
bad,They ask a lot for little pay. Very tolerate of their behavior until I got pregnant then everything went down hill from there. The management were very realistic about what I was able to being a pregnant over not stocker.
bad,"I don't really have anything bad to say about Wal-Mart just i didn't feel like i was accomplishing anything when i was there, and the pay did not add up for the work i was doing. but the people i worked with were good people just wasn't happy with how promotions went over there and hours were very unforgiving, and just poor management."
bad,They have a varitey of positions available but they are not very family oriented such as a sick child or loss of a family member they are not very understanding.
bad,"A typical day at wal-mart in a college based town, is very horrible. I love customers, but the way they treat us there isn't fun at all. I do most of the work and do not get paid for it. i have learned a lot about management, and how to be a better sales associate."
bad,"This place is not a very good place to work at. Management does not know how to talk to associates, associates are overworked and underpaid. Policies are inconsistent and not clearly communicated with associates (not even in orientation). Scheduling can be hectic sometimes as well. They can take off or put on days without associate consent, even though it is against policy. There are not enough associates to go around to fulfill department needs. The only thing I enjoyed about this job was working with my coworkers and assisting customers who didn't have an attitude (which was most of the time)"
bad,"I worked for walmart for a little over a year and dreaded going there. I did the overnight shift for the remodel. When we werent doing our actual job, all the females on the team were dusting all night every night for about for a month straight while the men on the team did the ""hard work"". After the remodel was over, some people were offered permanent positions aka start over from scratch since the time that we worked there didn't count towards getting benefits. Most got laid off. The ones that got to stay are the ones who never did their job and would disappear for most of the night. My co-workers were awesome except for the few slackers. I was able to get my forklift license after begging for the test for 3 months. After I got certified, I was never on a forklift again because the guys were always chosen to do it. Only work there if you are desperate for a job."
bad,"A typical day consists of managers, who mostly will not do anything to help, assigning numerous tasks. Some managers sympathize with the workload and will actively contribute to completion. Most just watch. The stores are so understaffed that most merchandise sits in the backroom. Often you will have numerous out of stocks, resulting in unhappy customers. Many co-workers are frustrated too, because the stores look like disaster areas. There are numerous political intrigues to contend with. The home office makes arbitrary and capricious decisions without looking at impacts. People have to apply for promotions, resulting in many ill-qualified individuals making decisions. Benefits are lacking and compensation is abysmal."
bad,"i worked backshift for 3 months at walmart, loved it until they transfered me to another walmart to help out.. the place i went to i would have to spend an hour to get a scan gun, none of the employees would let me use one.. they don't care about anyone but themselves & constantly talk about all the employees... management treat you terrible and make you feel lower then dirt.. a manager was overheard saying he was in a bad mood tonight so he was gonna fire someone.."
bad,"Very very busy and fast paced store, but easy to catch up and get a hand on the way the store operates. I was not very fond of the managers. They always seemed too busy and uncaring. The co-workers were for the most part very nice and eager to help. The hardest part about working here was catching up with the fast pace. The most enjoyable part was getting off work."
bad,"Enjoyed my there, learned lots and was able to gain lots of knowledge and experience."
bad,Overworked and badly underpaid. You will not get much if any in the way of help from management
bad,"Management expects you to do everyone's job along with yours because no one is held accountable for their work.  Every holiday you will be working instead of being with your family.  Positions for advancement are almost non-existent,  You will be degraded constantly by customers because managers will refuse to come assist you in any customer relation problem."
bad,"A typical day in the Lawn and Garden center I would check customers out, work freight that had came in the night before, zone and clean shelves, assist customers with purchases, load customers with outdoor furniture, potting soil, manure, mulch, etc. I learned several things about gardening and horticulture during my time at Walmart. My co-workers for the most part were helpful and willing to assist whenever I needed help and we worked as a team. Management, however, were rude, inconsiderate, and too demanding. They would ask you to do tasks that were beyond your training or capabilities as one person. The hardest part of my job was working with management and the most enjoyable was helping customers with their gardening needs."
bad,My experiences was not pleasant. Most of what you hear about Walmart is true. Rude people over worked staff if their is anyone there longer than 5 years consider them a trooper.
bad,"helping customer's, picking tires, and mixing paint, as well as, zoning many department's, cashier, stock, and keeping the area safe and tidy. Not enough staff and the manager's get mad if you aren't in your area (even if you are going out of your way to help a customer because the lack of staff), yet expect you to be in multiple area's to keep it clean and safe. good part time job for student's that need some work experience."
bad,"Avoir des discussions avec les clients que je croisé, mais transpoter les sacs plus lourd c'étais énorément difficile."
bad,"It was good working with the public, learning others departments and trying to stay uptemist with the job."
bad,"Management is bias, makes working there very difficult. Co-workers are sociable but customers are not. Days are long, pay is small, and if you speak outside your pay grade you are terminated."
bad,"As a first job, it highly discouraged me for what was to come in the real world. It helped mold my perception of others. No one is the same, there are many diverse cultures. Respect is given unconditionally."
bad,I was a cashier. I provided excellent customer service with speedy service. This is the job where I learned to use a cash register. The job was too far away from home to work with such few hours. Supervisors were easy to work with. Not much of a chance to get to know your fellow employees. Favorite part of the job was getting to meet so many different people.
bad,"typical day: clocking in, going to your register, ring up customers, deal with bad customers and good customers, get yelled at by customers if they didn't get their way"
bad,fought with company for 3 years as the responsibilities kept coming with out the pay
bad,This is stressful job when your constantly short-handed and it seems as if management doesn't care.
bad,It's pay. Could be managed a lot better. Nice place to build skills but hard to make a living as a career  with those wages.
bad,"Only enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers. Managers were lazy and very rarely did anything other than give orders, even if departments were behind. Hardest part of the job was putting up with the managers...floor associates were not allowed to work together or talk, but the managers could do what ever they wanted with no repercussions because the only person they report to is the store manager who is only there a few times a week."
bad,Very stressful place to work. I have learned how to deal with the general public. I have learned how to help people and meet their needs. My co workers for the most part were respectful and helpful. The hardest part of the job was the long hours and dealing with people all day. What I enjoyed the most was meeting new people.
bad,Learned a lot but not for long term. It's a typical store operation job like any other profiles
bad,rude customers..it didnt pay enough money.the hardest part of working at walmart was having to deal with the customers.
bad,wednesdays are generally the best days to work if you just want a not so busy laid back workplace.ive learned that the customers tend to be fairly nice if you can show them that you have knowledge of items in the workplace.my coworkers were nice and came to me for many answers.the job was fairly easy really isnt much i can say about how hard the job was but i did enjoy meeting new people from all over the world.
bad,"never work here if you can avoid working here as an associate. If you have college, etc go for a higher position because this place sucks if your at the bottom."
bad,You go to work and don't stop. You don't choose when you go to lunch management does and when I say management I mean one of the many guys running around with ear pieces. They cant do their job very well because they wont let you do yours. My opinion don't work there.
bad,"Co-workers are great"
bad,"I had it better than most, as far as Wal-Mart is concerned.  I didn't have to wear the ""uniform"", had a lot more freedom than most associates and made quite a bit more than sales associates."
bad,"theres some things i enjoyed about working at walmart, the work was easy overall once you got use to it however though i was treated kind of badly in my time there. Many of the employee's are immature, etc."
bad,working there was really good at the beginning but it turned downhill after that.
bad,Enjoyed being continually busy and going to different departments and stocking a variety of items. Most departments were under staffed for the work load and time limits were set that were not reasonable. They did not take into account that each individual works at a different pace or the age or overall health or capabilities of the person they placed in an area. Most workers were too consumed by the stress of meeting their time deadlines that they took no interest in assisting the customers and many out right avoided it.
bad,"A typical day at work for Wal-Mart overnight is suppose to begin with a group meeting entail the number of trucks delivered overnight and the store expectations for the floor and product being available for customers.  After working at this particular location, I realized that if I waited for the managers to begin the meeting I wouldn't meet my expectations for the evening.  There are tasks for each employees and at time, the amount of time vs. freight on floor don't match.  Myself and a few other employees would start immediately entering the store working, others would wait 20-25 minutes around until the meeting would begin.  I would work 5-6 pallets of retail onto the floor and a few pick packs which were additional products that was needed to make the shelves full that wasn't delivered on the truck.  The management at Wal-Mart wasn't exceptional at all, I have to say it was the most unorganized company I've ever worked for, the managers would micromanage and talk about over employees.  The co-workers were all diverse, some would actually work and do their jobs, others would drag around and talk with other workers and not get any production.  The hardest part of the job was the management for me, the managers were horrible and just the way that the business was ran in general.  I was told that the store was over budget and that in order for the managers to get their bonus for the year, the store budget had to be cut.  So after firing several employees that needed to be fired, the location started terminating all temporary workers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the"
bad,same results as other walmart not really much support from management or co workers. pretty much a fend for yourself type of environment. the people where friendly up until they needed something and managers would leave them waiting or sometimes not even come to their aid.
bad,"Worked as carpenter on addition to store, then as associate.  I was laid off at 6 months of employment (manager officially told me they needed to downsize, then said my benefits kick in after 6 months)"
bad,"Almost everyone has said terrible things about Wal-Mart, and almost all of them are true. My store was one of the better ones to work at, but it was still terrible. I worked as a customer service associate, and the worst part about the job were the customers who were trying to scam you. Management tries to act as if we're the front line against people who are trying to rip us off, but whenever we come to them with a legitimate worry about the return or money center transaction the customer is asking us to perform, 9/10 times management will make us do it anyway. Management doesn't listen. All they care about are their scores, their bottom line. They don't care if I hate cashiering, and that's why I begged to be put on service desk. If there are 9 cashiers scheduled, but only 7 show up, you can bet either I or one of the other customer service associates will be put on a register, even if there are no lines. It's all because management has these score cards, and if they aren't good... Well, honestly, I don't know what happens. They never tell us. They just tell us what to do because it'll ""affect [their] score card,"" whether or not it's actually necessary."
bad,"As a Department Manager your typical day begins in the morning with management informing you that you need to zone and remove all carts in all your departments within 1 hour (I was over 5 departments with no employees to assist).  Once zone time was over you were criticized about how the carts aren't gone and they need to be gone (on a typical Monday I was looking at an average of 6 carts piled high with all sorts of merchandise that nobody worked on over the weekend because they refused to hire anyone to help me), told of how many pallets in the backroom need to removed (again with no help), complete price changes, do any resets that may be pending and clean your departments."
bad,typical work day was fun due to employees but wasn't ran to properly.
bad,"It was okay, but not the best. I don't really think I was very good at the job. I guess I'm just not production material"
bad,I was hired on as a toys sales associate then after almost a year we were all 3 forced to move out of toys due to downsizing i got moved to cart pusher and had no room to get out of it. did not enjoy it after that it soured the taste in my mouth for the store.
bad,"I learned how to give great customer service. I learned how managers treat associates poorly. My typical day at work was being yanked from one department to another while being disrespected  by managers in how stressed they were. The best part of my day was clocking out from work. It was a very hard job because of the managers, they didn't know what they wanted or how they wanted the job done. Which made things very difficult. I did enjoy pleasing the customer and making sure they got what they needed. I loved my co-workers they always know how to cheer one another up on a hard day."
bad,"With This Company unless you are in a management position; you do not matter. Anyone under a management position is just a number not a human employee. You get hired and just wait for your number to be called when they dismiss you for minor mistakes, or being ill or injured."
bad,The hours you are required to be able to work in order to get scheduled hours are not that which accommodate a family
bad,"I liked working at WalMart because I enjoyed interacting with the customers. On the other hand, communication within management was poor."
bad,"Walmart Canada, has it pros such as job culture and a good environment to work in. Cons No Urgency for breaks"
bad,"Rang out people's purchases, bagged the product and sometimes placed them into their cart.  Received cash/check or card for purchases."
bad,"I am a goal focused and result driven individual seeking to invest my skills, time, and professionalism by contributing myself to your company’s organization, goals, and objectives."
bad,The store that I worked in wasn't very professional. The managers made up their own rules.
bad,At the Walmart store I was employed at I can tell you that their is no concern for the employee's well being. When you work there you are lower then dirt and you will be treated like such. If you are not part of the clicks of the social big wigs then you will be left out in the cold doing work that would make a dog cringe.
bad,Typical retail environment. Managers don't care about more than making numbers.
bad,I've worked for a few stores but Walmart's management team was by far the worst. They bully workers all night telling them they are doing a bad job and do a 360 at the end of the night thanking everyone for all the hard work. The only reason I would tell anyone to work or shop at Walmart is if they had no other choice.
bad,"Management was not very approachable or involved, poor organization, didn't have enough employees scheduled for known busy days, low hours."
bad,"At first I enjoyed working there as the company seemed to really care about the employee's. As years went along they slowly removed benefits and added a heavier work load and just did not care whether the associates could make a living on the hours they gave. They cut hours to where I was only getting 7 hours a week, which did not allow me to make a living."
bad,walmart is not a great place to work if you support yourself. The hours are minimum and no overtime is allowed. The pay is horrible while your job title is really 3 different jobs in one. Management is a bumbling mess. There are way too many egos telling the lower paid employees too many different directives.
bad,"A avaliação que tenho é a seguinte . É uma empresa muito difícel de entender o sistema wal mart é  preço baixo mas sem uma estrutura de organização de preço muda toda momento ,por isso dizem preço errado  na gondola um preço , no caixa outro, isto torna o cliente muito nervosso pela diferença do preço."
bad,"I am sure you have seen/read/heard many things about employment at Wal-Mart, the vast majority of the negative things are true.  I was told when I was hired that they would work around my college schedule, and now I am being told that I either show up when they schedule me or I am fired, regardless of what my availability is in the system.  My Wal-Mart is drastically cutting hours but increasing the workload.  It is a ridiculously high stress job for incredibly low pay with little to no job security."
bad,"Walmart was just draining to me , to sum it up in a word , most employees can be split into two categories : those that don't want to work at all and normally stick you with all the work, and those that want to advance in the company so bad they will break their backs and anyone else's that can gets in their way. The hardest part of the job literally is just trying to ride a fine line between these two categories, and in my personal opinion management can alternate everyday from one side of the line to the next."
bad,"My co-workers were great, the ones that actually worked that is. Management is flawed, very hard to get promoted and over worked for the amount of pay you receive."
bad,"Los horarios cambiaban cada semana y son muy variables. La atención al cliente era primordial por lo cual el trabajo tiene que ser rápido y preciso. Aprendí en todos los departamentos porque por la escasez de personal tenía que mover de un lado a otro. Lo más difícil de ese trabajo fue convivir con gente pretenciosa que solo buscaba subir pisando a los demás. Me gustó el trabajo acelerado. Estar tan ocupada que se olvida lo demás, y conocer gente."
bad,You do not appreciate the food on the shelves at stores until your the one putting it there. Working here made me appreciate what my fellow co workers food a lot more. My co workers were very friendly and I gained a few friendships with them. Management was strict and had no leniency to slacking off or horse play.
bad,"Working at Wal-Mart as a temporary Casher during the holiday season in 2012 was my first job, and I was quickly promoted to a part-time position. While I loved helping customers and I never complained about the physical aspects of the job, I felt that I and my fellow employees were treated unfairly by the managers. The hours that we were assigned to work could sometimes change without notice, and if we did not show up to work (because we had thought we were supposed to be off) we were reprimanded. I was put into an area where I received no training, and had to seek help from other sources that where outside the store."
bad,On an average day at Walmart I push approximately 700 carts a day with no ability to move up. Once given my job it is impossible to move up. I love my coworkers and I come excited to work because my co-workers liven the place up but the management brings us down. They never give us the opportunity to try new things or to learn new tasks and that doesn't work well with a go getter such as myself. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers any way I can whether that be simply get them a cart or lift objects to their car
bad,"too much clutter on counters, too noisy very distracting"
bad,"Typical retail company, little chance for advancement at the time of employment"
bad,"Fun people to work with, that's about all.  Management will agree with a customer even if they are clearly wrong and you are right. Not good at all"
bad,"ring up customers ,how to deal with people.u work all kids of people .the hardest part of working at walmart is the managment.the most enjoyable part is the customers."
bad,"Walmart thinks highly of their culture, but the Phoenix office lacks it. Friendliness is hard to find within the administrative assistant team and some others, team building is non existent. Manager is distracted, detached and most often unavailable. The culture in Bentonville, AR is so much better, but not all of us want to move to Bentonville. There are no opportunities to advance in the small office in Phoenix."
bad,"Pretty much they want you to do your job, plus job of 5 others and supervisors job."
bad,"I do not remember much. I worked in the electronics department and in the photo department. I would help customers and give my opinion on certain items such as cell phone, computer, television."
bad,Would not recommend to my worst enemy. No structure within business. Lack of proper training.
bad,"While working at Wal-Mart I have always performed at a highly efficient manner. I always greeted customers and associates along with doing my regular duties. I often found myself overworked because I did my job along with covering for others more than once. I've felt that I was being taken advantage of by the requests asked of me. I've gained multiple experiences which I do not think I can use for other jobs that I am interested in. A typical day at work required cleaning the floors, spills, bathrooms, and other areas. I've also took out trash and threw away garbage or any other materials. I've learned that Wal-Mart's management can be abusive unintentionally and inconsiderate. Many of the coworkers were lazy, inconsiderate, and opportunists. Many of the coworkers who were supposed to help the customers did little to nothing to assist the customers. Various employees would make a mess and expect maintenance to clean it up. The hardest part of the job was performing all duties that were my job description along with whatever the managers random requests. Despite these requests, I always managed to complete all of my tasks and perform exceedingly. I also informed the fellow co-workers that came after my shift of the things that needed to be done before I left."
bad,"While at Walmart employees are given chances to move around to different departments BUT only if and when one becomes available. meaning it could be as short a one month or as long as one year before you can get to a different position. The Walmart i worked for i was not happy with their management style which consisted of about  6 managers from all over the store ripping into me over an issue they never informed me of to begin with. "
bad,"We serviced cars with oil and tire problems. I didnt get along to much with my manager, and my co-workers were rarely sober at work. The most difficult thing was seeing that I was working harder than anyone in the garage, but we all got paid the same."
bad,"I worked at walmart for about a month as a temp electronic sales associate. After being offered the position I had to wait for 2 1/2 months to begin training. My training consisted of being put in front a computer and sales floor training, I finished my computer training in 2 days, my sales floor training never took place and I was left on the sales floor alone with no knowledge of the registers in that department due to the registers being older and not in the training programs, the manager and other associates left and did not return until almost closing, in that time I managed to learn the registers with no instruction and sell over $3000 in electronics including, HDTV's, various component cables, Xbox 360, PS3, PC games and game cards, Prepaid phones, prepaid phone cards, MP3 players ETC."
bad,I really disliked working for this company. They are a billion dollar company and yet paid us minimum wages. They cared very little about their employees and I felt that the only time they even cared was when I quit. They magically didn't want me to leave and claimed that I was one of their best cashiers and tried to convince me not to leave.
bad,"A typical day at work would consist of touring the store taking notes and implementing a miracle to ensure that those notes and the previous days notes are completed. Never Happens. Low wages, lack of quality number of associates makes this position very Challenging."
bad,"Very fast paced environment. In a single work day the Technicians would rotate all job duties. i.e. Drop off window, where you handle prescription drop offs, input all prescriptions and make sure that everything went through insurance correctly. The next rotation would be filling all prescriptions, filing all prescription, checking in and putting away the warehouse and McKesson orders. After the Pharmacist verified that each individual prescription was filled correctly the Technician would bag each one, making sure not to mix them up. We would also run the cash register, drive thru, and any customer that  needed assistance with anything over the counter. "
bad,"Could not get placed in a department where I had experience.  Hours were spotty and few, and the compensation a quarter above minimum wage.  Little is learned through actual training, as you are told to learn through computer training courses, and are generally vague to cover most of the departments.  "
bad,"I learned to unpack merchandise price and put up merchandise in each department and helped customers with their questions I got along with every employe the hardest part of the job was trying to talk with the managers they are very rude."
bad,"Aprendi mucho en este lugar, se conoce mucha gente se aprende a trabajar en equipo y a tener conpañerismo con los demas."
bad,"Cashiering or I put items back on shelves was my daily duties. Managers didn't care if you went above and beyond for customers. Great customer service does not get you promoted, knowing someone like a department manager gets you a promotion."
bad,"It started out as a positive growing company, to teach me everything from customer service to sales of products. At one point, Walmart was good at managing my life outside of work, giving me time off when needed, or transferring when I moved.  As for the strange co-workers, they quickly turned into my second family. Working at the Customer service desk or on the Cash Register, can really test your skills at handling customer complaints & satisfaction. I feel like if you've accomplished working at Walmart, you can handle anything."
bad,You can get steady work here but the managers time you on your assignments and expect you to work harder than the small pay is worth.
bad,"Training is horrible, managers have high expectations but don't help and treat employees unfair."
bad,enjoyed the job. advancement is difficult. breaks are pretty nice. wayyyyyyyyyy too much drama
bad,"La empresa maneja muy buenas politicas, filosofia y cultura,por ejemplo respeto por el individuo busqueda de la excelencia, pero muchas de ellas no se llevan a cabo solamente estan pegadas a la pared  en carteles.claro todo esto depende de los lideres de que se lleven acabo o no."
bad,employees are great but the members of management are not doing their job. there is supposed to be three strikes then a fire . i got one off of a rumor and they fired me i was getting ready to be promoted and never had any issues with employees always got my job done and first strike and they fired me  .
bad,"worked as a customer service manager, supervising the front end and also did returns and process layaways."
bad,"Stocking Shelves,  Inventory Management, Building Displays processing damaged goods,"
bad,"the actual store manager is not that bad, but his management team leaves a lot to be desired. Fellow co-workers are overall great people to work with. Assistant managers do not care why you have missed work, they have no empathy for their employees and they do not accept doctors excuses unless it is an admittance into the hospital. Even the rude customers were more enjoyable than the management team."
bad,"Wal-Mart consistently promotes doing the right thing! Then hire new people to cover hours that the company says they don't have the sales to use, of course then they cut hours of what is considered valuable associates! This impacts the lives of those people when the economy has impacted them enough already."
bad,"Not a good place for anyone to work. I have worked at the Walmart Supercentre in Guelph for almost a year already and when I first got the job there were 12 of us in my department, now there are 5. Half of our team has quit because they couldn't stand to work here longer than they did. I am someone who is easily stressed/depressed, as such my psychological health has been deteriorating from consistent stress placed on my by the management team that thinks it knows what it's doing and the customers that are lazy and spiteful when shopping. I am ready to join my previous co-workers in quitting my job and finding somewhere else to work."
bad,i was there for almost 3 months and at the end of my 3 months i was told that i could have a job change then i had to fight for the job change then i was placed in the hospital and then given time off work and was fired as they told me that it was concidered a voultiary quit
bad,"The job was fine at first, but I gave the manager my school availability and she completely ignored it. I had no choice but to leave this job because it was interfering with school. The most enjoyable part of the job was engaging with customers. The hardest part was working 12 hour shifts when I had class the next morning,"
bad,"If you don't mind working somewhere where you are not respected and talked down to and at times ...even cursed at, a place where you truly are a dime a dozen and management keeps reminding you of that by the way they treat you, then Wal- Mart is where you want to work."
bad,would not work there again.well over worked under paid.if u didnt suck up to the boss you didn't make it in the company.
bad,They really do overwork you you stand on concrete floors all day and have an impossible goals for you to reach.
bad,"I'm sure there are some wal-marts that truely uphold the image of what sam walton wanted wal-mart to be...but unfortunately we see more and more wal-mart manager and employees not caring. management consistantly asks  for favors  and when you (an employee) ask for a certine day off or a set of hours for the day, noooobody wants to help you out.and there is a lot of favoritism that goes on people sleeping their way to the top... i only wish i was making this up..."
bad,"People Lack general knowledge, Unprofessional management, Horrible part-time benefits, low wages. Little to no training. Your available will get taken advantage of, I work 5 days a week at 31hrs. Availability change gets denied. You will most likely work every holiday, request of time off always gets denied no matter how far in future. When given holiday pay for the holiday you worked its usually around 6hrs, when you worked 8 or more hours on the holiday. I honestly have nothing good to say except some of the people are good people, just a little lost. But if you need a second job, its not too bad once you get used to being treated horribly."
bad,"When I began with the company I enjoyed the work. It was fast paced and could be challenging at times. I worked for the company for three years and can tell you that what Sam Walton created with this company has gone out the window. This is partly because the company is monopolizing the retail industry but mainly because the company no longer cares about the employees that run the stores. Corporate leaders that are in charge of the company have not spent required time in the store to know what it is like on a daily bases and still require more and more from their employees. It is a shame that it has turned into this and I challenge every corporate employee to work in a struggling store for a week. I believe over half of them would not survive an entire week. I promoted to assistant manager and went to a month long training that was a joke, I learned more about management from a 3 day shift management course through McDonald's. I graduated the training course and was placed into a struggling store. Why was this store struggling? Because the lack of training! When you do not train associates you cannot expect to get much from them. It saddens me that this is how a company that hires 300+ associates per store treats its people. As an assistant I was expected to work 5-6 days per week and 12-14 hours per day. I had no life outside of the store and was not compensated for it. This company is a billion dollar company and chooses to not pay associates accordingly; they treat associates like slave drivers would treat property. Just talk to some of the 20 year associates about the changes"
bad,"The company invest billions of dollars on merchandise but does not pay their employees a basic living wage, might as well be flipping burgers for the same pay rate."
bad,I had a very good time with all of my co-workers. Even some of the management were very good to me and very friendly. Others could care less. Problems were not solved nor identified they were merely tossed to the side.
bad,you get there and right away they are telling you to do this do that like you dont know what your job is.
bad,"Learned a lot working at Walmart, but there were far more cons than there were pros.  Management did not communicate with each other on subjects nor with supervisors.  Gossip and rumors flooded the work place.  Most enjoyable part of a typical work day was throwing the truck, good stress relief."
bad,A typical workday in my position is spent filling in for 4 or more different job codes due to faulty lack of staffing. While working with this company I have progressed as an individual in my customer service skills as well as my attention to detail. Management in this company have a very different prospective when it comes to treating their team equally. It just isn't an option for most. My fellow co-workers are a delight to work with and I as a member of management enjoy helping them excel and learn all of the things I have in my journey. The hardest part of working with the Walmart company is trying to get the outsiders looking in to see that every community is different and the demand for certain things are different as well. The most enjoyable part of my work day is being able help people. That is being able to help my associates with any problem they may have as well as helping our clientele find everything they need in their shopping trip to leave happy.
bad,"Not the type of career I would love to have, but what I like about the job is the people I meet such as customers!"
bad,The Oshkosh Wal-Mart is not somewhere I would work again. The co-workers were great but I wasn't very happy here.
bad,"Loved the people i worked with, but the company pushes fear based management instead of employee empowerment."
bad,I have come to find that management dosn't back up there employees and they only care about themselves. There is one or two good ones but thats it. For the other employees you can make really good friends and hae a lot of fun.
bad,Wal-Mart is truly one of these places that looks good on the outside but you don't want to truly know on the inside.
bad,"A typical day at Wal-Mart was nothing but stress. Coming into work you already knew if was going to be a long stressful day. I was hired as a lawn and garden associate and was led to believe that I would work solely in the lawn and garden department. I was wrong. They had me work all over the store and usually all in the same day. I would go between my duties in lawn and garden to having to do whatever needed to be done in pets, hardware, toys, sporting goods, housewears, fabrics, foods, to the back to unload trucks, and even outside to bring in carts for customers. All while I had tasks that needed to be completed in lawn and garden which I would get yelled at for not completeing due to my need in all other departments. My co-workers understood the stress cause they had to deal with it too. Management didn't seem to care."
bad,"Upon starting my day, I would review the previous day to finish items that was not completed."
bad,"if you were not an assistant manager or part of the click, then you never had a good idea or it was your fault. would not recommended a job at least in bogalusa, la any way"
bad,"A day at walmart usually means going to clock in and then out to the parking lot to retrieve carts all day. The one I worked for is one of the busiest in the nation (closest to UCF) and was built on a hill and always had broken mules so I was forced to push uphill by hand. Management is completely uncoordinated never responding to concerns or requests and most days were unaware if I was even at work or not. However, because it is so easy to get lost it was always guaranteed that I would have work since my schedule and attendance were all monitored by a computer. At the same time it would make it difficult to request time off or use vacation time since that required the assistance of a manager."
bad,"clean the floors,bathrooms, and lobby areas. Pick up spills as i pass by them and/or spills that are called out. When people don't show up they pull co-workers to the registers. Hardest part of the day is when the bathrooms flood. Most enjoyable part of the day is lunch"
bad,"I loved working there when I started, but after three months I noticed how the management doesn't respect us. You work so hard but you don't see the pay for your effort and I love to work and interact with people, but Walmart made me hate coming to work."
bad,Only take if no other choice. Poor management and no pre-planning.
bad,An eye opening and humbling experience. Horrible hours. Lousy pay. Rude customers and apathetic employees.
bad,"I work in the produce section.  A typical day consists of stocking all merchandise in the Department and making sure the sales floor is fully stocked.  Completing claims on expired food.  cleaning the Department.  Culling or ""picking out bad fruit and vegetables and expired merchandise.  I learned about inventory management, ordering merchandise, stocking and rotating, compliance issues.  Like any other job, there are good and bad managers at the store considering approximately 300 people work at any given store.  I will state that favoritism based on race and ethnicity is a MAJOR issue at this store which really lowers morale.  It also amazes me that Wal-Mart places no merit whatsoever in the fact that I am educated and have a Bachelor's Degree.  They only focus on job performance, and attendance, seniority and experience for promotion.  The hardest part of the job in my department is the constant ""physical labor""  all throughout the shift being required to constantly life 40, 50 and 60 pound boxes and ifcos.  There is a lot of pressure to get the merchandise to the sales floor quickly, thus leaving you exhausted by the end your shift.  If you are a 20 year old male with strength and stamina, then you are good.  If you are a middle-aged woman, it is very challenging.  It also amazes me that some employees, ""get away with things that are appauling, because they are lazy and trying to get out of working.  If you show up for work and do your job, even mediocre, they will not reprimand anyone in general.  It is frustrating when you as an employee are working very hard, and your"
bad,Failed to move me inside after I told them I had bronchitis 3 times
bad,"SUCKS, dont ever work for them, pay sucks they just hire u as temps only"
bad,"A once great company has lost its way. It forgot that customers and associates are what made it great. The people in leadership focused on computer generated reports rather than true keys to success...sales, profit, associate engagement, and customer relations."
bad,"Typical day is clocking in ,start working right away on the register .If at anytime it starts to slow down take time stocking the shelves on the registers with  products"
bad,This place practice me to be a customer service and bearable to negative attitude with smile and clam.
bad,"Walmart is a job, not a career. Do not expect to make any real money or any real honesty. I was lied to during my interview, told I would work in one department then put in another. Told I would make close to what my salary requirements were, I was given half. I tried to make the best of it, with my experience and education I hoped to move up quickly and leave. Unfortunately they will not train you and favor employees who have put in time over experience, education or understanding of the department. "
bad,"No comment at this time, too much work not enough pay! However co-workers were fun to be with"
bad,"When I first started this job I really enjoyed it, but as I learned more about the business world my mind changed."
bad,"They work you like a slave, with little to no appreciation. I learned how to talk to people easier and start a conversation out of little to nothing. Management could care less about what you feel however, the will listen to what you have to say. There is a lot of drama in the work place and nothing is done to diffuse it. The hardest part of the job is to stay sane in the working conditions but the job is very rewarding dealing with the public on a daily basis."
bad,"The job I was hired to do, I actually enjoyed. I organized, stocked, color-coded and displayed clothing. I also assisted customers. However, during a typical day at work, I did none of the above. I spent most of my time doing other peoples' jobs. I'd spend time in grocery stocking shelves. I'd spend time at the jewelry counter helping customers. I'd sit at the fitting room and answer the phones and let people in the fitting rooms. We were extremely understaffed in the store, so I would be assigned everything else to do besides my actual job. So when I got back to my area near the end of my shift, my sections would be a mess and there would be mountains of returns that needed put away. And the management would get upset with me for not doing my job, when they were the ones who assigned me to another area. Management were often scattered, and rarely did any work on their own. They were unorganized, and would rather the associates worked in the back or in grocery than in our own areas, and they didn't care at all about customer service. The managers were continually rude to everyone around them. My co-workers worked as hard as I did, and they too felt the same way I did. The hardest part of the job was simply trying to please the managers, who were never satisfied. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I occasionally got to work in my sections with the clothing, and come up with display ideas. Helping the customers and working with my fellow associates was always fun. I enjoy working with people. But working for a boss who is never happy is always difficult. The breaks and"
bad,"Typical work day for me was to help set up the conveyor belt and to help hand-bomb the trailer, then I was to palletize the products, wrap in shrink wrap and send it out to the store floor where the employees of those departments would shelve the products. Okay seems easy right? Well the problems started on my first day, the lead hand told us not to throw the electronics (Apparently this was common practice) As soon as the lead hand turned his back one of the regular unloaders chucked a stereo over the conveyor and smashed it. He did not get in trouble. Next, it would seem that anyone with a silver name tag (A silver name tag means they have worked at that store for over 5 years) thought they had pull whether they where management or not. These leads to horrible work culture when this happened because they would do things like come into the back and yell at us for shrink wrapping the palettes (Witch is apart of our job it prevents theft and keeps boxes from falling on customers on the floor.) However our shrink wrapping job made her employees work slower so she yelled at us and ordered us to stop shrink wrapping. It was a case of doomed of you do and dammed if you don't."
bad,"Typcial day was stocking the shelves overnight. I learned how to quickly stock a shelf and learn how to find the pricings on packages without the price tag. The managment was not too friendly and very rude at times. They did not do much to help you if you had a problem. My co workers were always in ""Cliques"" and mostly rude as well. Hardest part of the job was the amount of work they gave you to do in a very little time frame, however I had no problem completeing the tasks at hand. I enjoyed making the money to support myself."
bad,"a typical day at work is doing what the manager tells you, Sometimes its not in your job description or you don't get enough time, but we do what we can to get the job done."
bad,was great in the beginning then they started not caring about there employees at all or the employees families
bad,"Starts off with getting anywhere from 10-15 pallets of freight a day, the freight must be worked within 3 to 4 hours by however many associates there are, usually 2, and then binned by the time they leave. I have learned Customer Service coming into contact with dozens if not hundreds of people everyday, hardest part of the job is not being staffed correctly and having to pick up extra work."
bad,"I would like to say that my experience at Wal-mart has been a positive one, but unfortunately I cannot.  I can say that my co-workers were wonderful, caring people."
bad,"Just no. I put up with this place for 3 years, and that was 3 years longer than any person deserves. The only redeeming quality was my coworkers and that we were all in the same boat of ridiculous."
bad,Walmart pharmacy is not a part of the overall care of Walmart. The management staff do not have any good things to say about the pharmacy.
bad,Management lacked the skill to make the store successful. Favoritism was shown too much by management and if you are not one of the favorites then you did not get hours no matter how good a worker you are. Horrible place to work in my opinion!
bad,The values that Sam Walton set were awesome but as the company has grown those things have been set aside
bad,* come in at 10 pm strip and wax the floors leave around 5 to 7 am                  *  i learned how to run machines and how to do work on them             *  most managers where fun to work with but others seemed like they didnt know what they were doing                                                                 * i got along with all the co workers                                                          *  there really wasnt anything hard about the job                                                          ^  it was inside work
bad,"worst place ive ever worked, management is horrible they dont listen to reason, pay is unbaleivably low, if they could pay you less they would. i would never recommend this to anyone unless desperate."
bad,"Em um dia típico de trabalho você é obrigado a aprender as funções diversas da empresa pois o associado nunca consegue trabalhar em paz no local onde ele foi contratado o desvio de função é algo rotineiro e obrigatório passivo de punição caso recuse-se, a gerencia é totalmente despreparada e agressiva com os associados  usando agressão verbal e até física."
bad,"It was Walmart...not much else to say.  I was a cashier.  Most customers were nice, but you did run into the rude ones sometimes."
bad,a empresa  me ensinou  muito coisa boa  trabalei la na parte administraçao mais fazia o curso de varejista no senac rio 
bad,A typical day at Wal-Mart consist of many customers with large transactions which I provided great customer service to serve them for future services. I learned to do my job and not worry about other employees problems for it is my job that I should only care about. I also learned to provide the best quality possible no matter what the circumstances are so that the customer are satisfied. My coworkers were a great help. My co-workers where also very hard working and we believed in team work in order to get the job done if needed. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the scandals managers and their favorites with many associates. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping those who enter my line. As an associate I was there to assist any customer by any means possible for I was there to serve my company. I enjoyed working with my former associates for we all believed in great quality and service. I love working in fast pace environments while enter acting with my customers. I changed a lot of people attitudes after along day because of my positive attitude towards others.
bad,"I learned various positions while at walmart. Its pretty easy to move around the company, but up to a certain point. Management really depends on the store. I worked under several managers. Some very nice and some not so nice. If the manager doesn't like you for what ever reason, they will find a reason to ""coach"" you. The people that work there are great. A lot of nice loving people work there. What I love most is working with the people I work with. I have a lot of fun seeing there everyday."
bad,Walmart was definitely not one of my better work experiences. They do not treat their employees very well. Maagement is horrible. And you constantly have crabby customers just trying to get in and get out. The only good part about this job was the co-workers.
bad,I have been employed at WalMart for 2 1/2 years. It's a very live environment.
bad,some of the managment are fair.I like being around people and meet them.
bad,"The co-workers were friendly and customers generally enjoyable. The policies of the company are terrible and they treat their employees like disposable slaves. The benefits that you receive after a certain amount of time working there absolutely do not balance with the work you have to do and the lack of appreciation shown for a job well done. They write employees up for looking at the clocks too much, not smiling enough, or clocking out a minute past the scheduled time even if it was because management ""asked"" you to stay over. "
bad,"work place is enjoyable because of the coworkers you work with, but managers don't know anything about the line of job you're in. I work in T.L.E (Tire Lube Express)and manager does not know how to schedule you and keeps changing the schedule with out notifying you and breaking there number one rule of 3 weeks in advance. Not a good company to work for. "
bad,A typical day at work is the interaction with the customers and the co workers at Walmart.
bad,"customer service was the most important making sure the customers had everything they needed, making sure the prices were right at all times, and making sure no one stole from Walmart. some of the co-workers would get mad because you would get the person who stole but once there out the door there is nothing we could do. "
bad,"What I learned was how to become a better cashier, I was never short in my tills. My co-workers, well some were really nice and helped me when I first started working there, some of the managers to me took to many smoking breaks, or did nothing. I don't remember a hard day, I really did enjoy my job and being a cashier, I enjoyed talking to the different customers."
bad,Walmart is extremely busy all the time. Management cares nothing about your family or outside life and your job is threatened constantly.
bad,"The salary management at Walmart 2088 does not push toward improving the livelihood of associates and themselves. They would rather deligate all responsibility toward asscoiates and middle management then to handle problems for themselves. The Job is enjoyable when managment goes above and beyond their title. I have learned that my team has to do extra work so the store will survive. Salary managers DO NOT work anything out of their job code and still recieve a huge bonus at the end of their fiscal year. While the lower tiers do extra work to imporve the store and a not guarenteed a bonus. Average bonus for a associate per quarter if budget calls for it is 300 dollars. Average bonus for an assistant manager 10k. while store manager is about 60k. That is a rough estimate. But they do not have to do extra work to get it. The store is so short staffed that not all areas are have any associates and on top of that they continue to cut hours on associates even though all overhead is not even close to being filled. I enjoy my peers, but not my bosses. With the exception of one to two managers. "
bad,It was like being back in high school with all the childishness and foolishness going on management also acted as if they were in high school.
bad,"A typical day at work for a Customer Service Manager was keeping the front end of the store running smoothly.  We were the first, and the last group of employees our customers would see.  It was imperative that we provided exemplary customer service, and kept the store running smoothly.  Customer Service Managers were at the fore front of this operation.  My responsibilities included managing cashiers, customer service employees, door greeters, and stock man.  It was important to maintain scheduling of employees so that each area was covered at all times, and each worker was given breaks/lunches.  It was also my responsibility to manage the cash in the registers for the entire store, perform active audits, remove excess cash from registers, provide change orders, help customers with difficult situations, monitor customer/employee complaints and/or questions, monitor register lines and direct customers when appropriate, fill in as a cashier/greeter/stockman/customer service representative when needed, and be able to perform the duties of each area of the store effectively. "
bad,A typical day at work is very demanding and non-stop.  It was very exciting getting to operate the cooking equipment and cooking different foods. The hardest part of the job is the break down and cleaning of the cooking and slicing equipment.  I learned the daily operations of food service and what is expected out of a restaurant. 
bad,"verificar todo tubiese el orden adecuado, hacer los pedidos , recibir pedidos, hacer ordenes de compra y devoluciones a proveedores"
bad," Management SUCKS, nothing was enjoyable about this job except for the hour long breaks."
bad,management at abbotsford 3019 store is terrible.. they have no clue what they doing.. and they running the store down..
bad,A good place to work when you are trying to advance to higher positions.
bad,A typical day at work consist of pulling pallets of freight to the sales floors. Unpacking freight from pallets and stocking freight to the sales shelf. Downstocking overstock freight and front-facing sales shelf. 
bad,Walmart is a place where u are only a number and your family means nothing to them. They want u to work your butts off and your thoughts and opinion don't count. I worked there almost six years and they fired me for being outspoken and that's not how u treat people.
bad,"Poor management, disorganized! Employees overworked, underpaid and under appreciated."
bad,"I like the fact that we were allowed a 15min break on the clock, and that our lunch was 1 hour off the clock. A typical day at work for me included coming to work, pulling out of dates out the cake case, and refilling case, checking and filling the ice-cream cake case, making back up cakes for the next day, doing cake orders, and greeting customers."
bad,Walmart is no longer looking for a dedicated employee. They have lost focus on what has made them who they are. They no longer value employee's or customers. 
bad,"poor work environment, management does not know whats going on day or night shift.. hard workers get treated like dirt, poor attutude towards associates"
bad,"Being told that you are not doing your job. Pulled to other departments to work with no coverage to the previous department that you were pulled from. Most enjoyable time there was never. The co-workers were the best because we would say passing if we get fired we get fired, there was never enough help, favoritism, and not really a open door policy, was told had to go through other managers before going to Bentonville (home office)."
bad,"Very busy work day, never bored."
bad,"Was a superviser and a cashier there ."
bad,"I worked in a work environment that was unproductive. Tried to hang in & hope it got better but finally I just walked out. My department manager was hardly available & when she was she just walked around. The co-owner was rude & had an attitude like he didn't like his job or he didn't want to come to work, or had family issues, like he was in desperate need of psychological help! I'm sorry but the work environment made me feel like they didn't care about employees just that you show up for work. I voluntarily walked out because I felt there was no team support. The employees roamed around a lot, sucks when you dedicate your time & show effort but not recognized except when they feel the need to explode on you. Then, I was called in to the office w/o a reason where I was asked questions about the co-owner! All they gave me was my name was mentioned & just had questions to answer. Never knew what that was all about. Thinking & feeling like I did something bad, I just walked out before they considered firing me; lot of miscommunication! Believe me I wanted to stay because I loved the department I worked in, it allowed me to interact with people & help customers. i miss most are the Stories of the travelers trips!! "
bad,"Typically I just did what I was suppose to, help customers and get product onto the floor. I learned little from management and did most of my learning via trial-and-error, usually ending with management siding with customers in regards to disagreements with products."
bad,A typical day at Wal-mart was normal for me. I worked with the same people for years and for the most part I knew exactly were I was going to work for the night. I learned the retail business inside and out from working there. I think that the Wal-mart company should take there management team through better training. A lot of them do not have people skills and lack knowledge about what's going on within the company. My old co-workers were like my family. The hardest part of the job was having to work under a management team that treats you badly. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers.
bad,não tenho muito a dizer sobre essa empresa por que fique muito pouco tempo..
bad,"At a typical day at work at wal-mart you will work by not only doing your job, but your bosses job as well. Many bosses give you direction on a task than once the task is completed they come back and ask you to do something diffrent from what they originally asked you to do. The co-workers usually complian about their pay, hours being cut, rate of pay, benifits, work or direction given etc. The managers are okay at least some of them unless you get a manager that walks past you without speaking. The most enjoyable part of the day is going home."
bad,"A typical day was moving inventory, stock rotation, in and out of freezers and back stock depending on the department that I was in. I worked three differing stores, and was in almost every department in the entire stores, with the exception of auto and pharmacy. I began my career in Pets and finished in Grocery Frozen."
bad,"Walmart asks way too much from their employees. They are always understaffed and ask other departments to chip in to help, and write people up when they do meet their standards on a job, when are told to do assessments on the local online computers for tests."
bad,"Enjoyed most part as customer service supervisor. The management changed, I didn't like the way the store had changed there policies"
bad,There was not much enjoyment in the job when is was done (i work best when my job is meaningful) and it was a night shift. I took the job because i had to find work in between semesters.
bad,"shift starts with stocking shelves which at times last all day depending on amount of freight ...helping other dept with their freight...price changes an telxon work all day .setting modulers ,cleaning fishtanks is everyday chore,customer serv, carryouts.even dept managers have to spend 1 hr door greeting an fetching grocery carts"
bad,a typical day at work is stressful but nothing I cant handle. I learned a lot there example how to deal with unhappy customers. my co-workers are always helping and willing to teach me a couple things. the hardest part of the job is finding the price on open food items. the most enjoyable part is seeing customer leave with a smile and satisfaction
bad,"I loved being a cashier. I enjoyed meeting new people everyday and being around the ""regulars"". The management cut everyone's hours dramatically, and I just couldn't afford to stay there. They never gave us a reason, and they lost a lot of people because of it."
bad,"Its not that all Wal-Marts are terrible places to work at I just feel like the one I was at was very unprofessional and unacceptable. I usually worked second shift at the Wal-Mart in Bedford, Ohio and when I came in there will always be about 10-15 carts that were unable for customer use because they were stacked tall with clothes that third shift would pick up off the floor or get out the backroom and never put up. First shift would do the best they could but we were always behind with no assistance from the managers and other daily things to do. Managers would often pull members of our team to go to another section of the job because someone wasn't at work leaving us with less hands and more work to do the next day. We were over worked and under payed and it was very frustrating. The work conditions were very un clean and we got criticized as workers more than praised. It was just a terrible experience at that particular Wal-Mart."
bad,"Wal-Mart was a wonderful place when I first started there. I loved my job and had no problem with coming to work. Now its just terrible. No hours, which is hard making my finaces meet and management does not work together"
bad,Walmart is a company that can either make or break you. Your career with walmart depends on your attitude and how much you are willing to put into it.
bad,the most enjoyable part of the job is working with the customers. i run across so many personalities in one day that it is awesome. the second part i like about my job is working with some of the other associates. the ones that show up every day for work makes the work day seem to run smoothly. the part i hate about walmart is the lazy people that are hired with the company. the ones who gets the job but then call out every time they are scheduled to work. another thing i dislike about the job is the poor communication with management.overall my experience working at walmart is a cool environment.
bad,"A typical night at work entails throwing frieght, zoning areas, performing customer service, removing empty pallets,cardboard and trash from the floor. I learned how to throw frieght in a professional manner and I worked productively with almost all my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was working with miscommunicating managers who abused store policy to their advantages. The most enjoyable part of my job was performing my task."
bad,Same thing everyday. I would send stock out to the floor and they would send it back. Management was very hesitant to teach you anything that might jeopardize their job or maybe had the potential to make them look bad. Very few of my co-workers even wanted to come to work never mind enjoy their time there. The hardest part was just knowing that I had to go in
bad,learned how to perfom oil changes and tire changes stock inventory and cashier managment
bad,"I started at Walmart as a cashier, had problem with scheduling as my second job. Transferred to Deli, for better hours and more pay. I have worked there for over 2 years and now have been having issues with scheduling again. I was told Walmart should be my priority and I get scheduled when they need me and if conflicts then I lose the hours. So in actuality my career goals at Walmart have been ended."
bad,"going home , I worked for this company for many years and got hurt and they terminated me before the dr would release me ."
bad,ended up picking up everybody slack and did not enjoy experience
bad,"There is nothing really positive I can say. I took this job because I couldn't find a job within my degree (sports marketing). When I was going through the application process I was told it was an Assistant Manager position, however that was not the case. After being there less than 3 months I was asked to step down from my position to one that pays less. They say they want to help you, have you learn the skills so you can move up the ladder, but I have been going backwards. You work varying shifts, never have more than two days off which are not the weekend. It takes a toll on your social life. I am currently looking for another position."
bad,"I dislike break pack, they over work you and expect you to meet the quota and your breaks count against you even though your required to take them. And the benefits aren't good"
bad,esta empresa me gusta mucho y por eso he elegido que quisiera trabajar en esta empresa ojala si me den trabajo aquí si no es de eso ojala fuera de otra cosa pero me den por que la verdad si me gustaría trabajar alli
bad,A typical day at work...its always unpredictable. I love my co- workers...but at times I feel management doesn't care about its associates..in turn makes me not like the job. Overall i like what I do. But not who is working above me.
bad,overall walmart is a horrible place to work. the benefits stink and unless your in the managers click there is no room for advancement. they lie to you and when you get hurt on the job they refuse to pay for your medical
bad,Schedules were mis-communicated loved the customer service it was okay place but good luck on advancement
bad,"The only thing that was good about working at Walmart, was my co-workers."
bad,Focus on one type of job only..removal of employees from varied positions to put them all in one position
bad,* A typical day at work is a lot of stocking and loading/unloading..
bad,customers vary and reflects on how ur day goes. it doesnt pay well (min. wage) lil to no advancements. management chose favoritism
bad,This is a perfect job for a person straight out of high school persuing college. The work is easy to learn if you have appropriate training from fellow employees. This in term would just be a temporary work environment for it would not be good for long term.
bad,Wal-mart can be a great company to work for if more managers and corporate employees were to get more involved and see what goes on in day-to-day operations such as cashiering and assisting customers. They expect you to do all this work and still receive less pay. The management is a D- at my store all they care about is their pay and how many sales they can make all the while being understaffed and paying less.
bad,"Walmart does not understand that employees who enjoy their jobs take pride in their work. Compensation is worse than lousy, management treats store-level employees like second-class citizens, and the advancement opportunities are terrible. I would not recommend a career at this company."
bad,"Came into the job, and was taken in quite quickly, and promoted within 6 months. However as of late things have taken a downturn, For no reason other then their personal gain. No a company to work for long term. Mainly for students looking for money for collage."
bad,"On a typical day at Wal-Mart at least at the store I was fortunate to be employed, I along with most other of the employees knew what their jobs were and knew what to do to get them done. Almost everyday I had learned something new or was willing to learn new objectives by my fellow employees which made it such a ""team"" around there. Management was kind but again for us who had worked the shift I worked, management was helpful when needed but knew we would get the job done no matter how jobs they gave us. Everyday was hard work and we all were given many responsibly but did what we could to get them done and always asked or assisted each other to get them done before our shift ended. Over the 6 years working for Wal-Mart I worked in a few various positions but as for my last as a receiving manager was where I felt most at home. Due to meeting all the new vendors and the constant multitasking which kept me busy all day and excepting something new to occur every time I walked in always kept me on my toes. What I have learned most from working at Wal-Mart has been what it takes to operate a day to day operation of just one of hundreds of retail stores."
bad,Walmart was the absolute worse company I have worked for in my entire life. I dont say this easily because I myself have a high standard of job care. I take my job very seriously and walmart used that to there advantage to allow senior persons to do as little as possible while forcing honest hard working people to have the threat of termination on seeking higher persons to correct the issue. Myself I was terminated for refusing to come in on my day off so I could witness my mothers Baptism in the Blood of Jesus Christ. I also had a friend terminated for being unable to come in on a similar note that his wife was going into labor. They use the chain of command as a threat to force persons to work harder because there is so few jobs in the market in the local area. I did my best to please but in the end corruption took its hold over myself and many others. In addition the breaks where not fair or mandated to state law. As well as complants for not returning from lunch earlier.
bad,Day starts with a meeting telling us we needed to do more every night. Management was disrespectful.
bad,"aprendi muito sobre uniao ,sempre trabalhavamos em equipe,mas infelizmente a gerencia nao sabia reconhecer o trabalho em equipe, e dava valor e promoçoes sempre as mesmas pessoas."
bad,não gostei muito de trabalhar no walmet não porque ? muita desorganização não tinha horario pra nada não gostei dessa empresa.
bad,"If you need a temporary job until you can find a good one with benefits, more hours, better pay and job security then Walmart is a fine place. It is also good for students who want a little extra money on the side. However Walmart is not a good permanent employer. They are constantly cutting hours, pay as little as possible and in spite of their motto, lay employees off as soon as they are in need."
bad,"Horrible work environment. Every manager there has a bias and will single you out just to make you want to quit. I once witnessed a manager ask a soon to be father (she was under watch at the hospital) if he could cover other shifts and when he said she was due anytime, management held the fact that he had asked to pick up other shifts over his head. she then proceeded to to tell him that he is giving up his chance for other shifts by refusing. they will not work with you if you have a lot going on in your life. i was forced to move out of my house and they would not change my hours to accomdate my 2 am late nights. i was later fired due to tardys and absences."
bad,"Era bem cansativos os dias de trabalho pelo fato de ser um hipermercado e o fluxo de movimento é muito grande, mas aprendi muito com ser paciente e receptiva. A gerencia era bem acessivel mas a parte mais dificil era quando encontravamos pessoas de mau humor, mas quando iamos para o intervalo passava tudo o extres e o constrangimento pois nos divertiamos com os colegas"
bad,poor working enviorment management cares little for empolyees bad pay
bad,THis is not the job for you if you have a family. I was sick and management told me that they dont have to honor doctors notes so i still had to come in. They also have their picks in who will become the next person in management. No hoildays off !
bad,Wages are low. Benefits are a terrible joke. An on the job injury will result in management hassling you non-stop.
bad,I don't mind the work just how management treats people.you have a time limit to get your work done.when your done you can help others get there's done.i don't like that you have to take a hour lunch .that just seems like a waste of time .
bad,"Coworkers are more suspicious of other coworker and do not pay attention to the theft going on by customers..great for first time job seekers, you learn a lot and"
bad,Most days I get in early so I can get to my department on time. As a Jewelry Associate i was hired for i also was a front end cashier fitting room associate also. Need i say i enjoyed my job it was just the small amount of hours given.
bad,"A large business with concern about making money, not paying employees their value, and expecting too much in return. Mostly people who really need a job work there and will then do almost anything required of them to keep their job. The management expects too much and wants everyone to do many different types of work for no extra pay. No overtime paid, just told to take a longer lunch or come in later, to make up for too much time worked. it is also a very physical job, moving merchandise around all the time. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fellow workers, they are all dedicated and want to do a good job, but management takes advantage by putting more and more work on them."
bad,Some of the assistant managers need to work on their people skills.
bad,My day starts off i check to see what product is empty on the shelves than i fill the product. I get a list of notes for things they need me to do through out the day. I do alot of merchandising around the store.I help unload the trucks sometimes and I do customer service daily. I do price changes and counts on the shelves. I also check returns through out the day to get the product back on the shelves.I make sure the shelves are clean and the product is in the right place make sure the labels on the shelves are correct. i learned alot because i wanted to know everything that made the company work. I learned my management skills there how to place orders do price changes and merchandising.The job has never been hard for me I have always enjoyed going to work there.I think it's time to move on and expand my knowledge.
bad,The hardest part of the job is dealing with irrate customers
bad,Mostly did my shifts standing the cubicle the company provided us in the middle of the electronics section. Assisted customers with they're choice of phone and phone contract.
bad,"As a Support Manager, I spent most of my work day preparing for, aiding, and cleaning up after my immediate supervisors. Though my job wasn't glamorous, I learned a great deal about how to manage a large crew of peoples with little time to do so along with my own job demands."
bad,"My experience at Wal-Mart has been a unique one. I appreciate the lessons, on the clock and off, that I've learned with this company. Though I'm ready to move on, working at Wal-Mart has taught me more responsibility, the ability to multitask a little better, and the advantages of growing close and successful relationships with people. I've learned how to deal with the pressures of heavy workloads and finishing tasks in timely manner. My relationships with higher management was a definite pro in my experience at Wal-Mart. I was able to talk with them freely and often regarding issues, suggestions, etc that would make Wal-Mart a better place. That would have to be my most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part was working with so many people ( employees, customers) and dealing with those different personalities and expectations. Overall it was a great learning experience."
bad,worked overnight as a stocker stocking dry goods. my shift was from 10pm to 7am. with 1 hour lunch.
bad,"The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers. A typical day at work was clocking in at start time and stocking shelves until clock-out time. My co-workers were like family; we helped each other as a team. The hardest part of the job was trying to satisfy the bosses; nothing was ever good enough. Management didn't seem to care that some epmployees had families; thus a life outside of work. I've learned that most of the time I enjoy being around people and helping them, and also I've learned a little something about the retail business as a whole and what it takes to be successful."
bad,Very rough seems like everyday managers just want more and more from us.hard to do this slave work for slave wages... cant trust anyone managers nor co workers... hardest thing about this job is dealing wth management.
bad,"Management doesn't care about how much you do for the store, but focus more on what you don't or didn't do. The co-workers tend to stick together, but there needs to be serious improvement in management, and I believe that is in all stores."
bad,always had a good day at work .
bad,"I thought that my job at Walmart was similar to my job at Publix because they were both deli jobs. I knew almost everything about the job very soon because of my previous experience. The typical day at work consisted of mainly helping customers(serving them lunch meat and cheese, chicken, salads, etc.), cleaning the deli(wiping the slicers down, sweeping, cleaning the rotisserie machine, friers, hot case, doing dishes, etc.), frying chicken, and various other foods. I also had to take garbage down to the back to the trash compactor. I didn't learn much at Walmart because it was so similar to Publix. I learned how to prepare the salad case at Walmart. Some of the management was nice, but some didn't really seem to want to help. Many of my co-workers were nice, but some of them would disappear and then I would be left alone. The hardest part of the job was working by myself. The job wasn't really too hard, but it required more than one to two people doing job. I couldn't help all of the customers and clean at the same time, so the teamwork really helped, whenever it happened. I always did my job and I would never disappear. The most enjoyable part of the job was some of the people that I worked with. I really enjoyed the teamwork because when teamwork happened the whole job is able to be done. The customers are able to be helped as soon as possible and all of the necessary cleaning can be done."
bad,Wal-Mart lets you give your availability but then takes hours away if you are not available certain days and times. I was available M-W and Friday and Saturday for 19 hours each day and could not get 40 hours a week. They have a great pay rate for certain departments and working conditions are above most.
bad,"Well my entry into walmart was based on the assumption that i was temporarily entering a certain job, and would eventually be transferred into another once i met the requirements. I was 17 at the time, and was waiting to turn 18 so i could enter the job i actually wanted. I discussed this with the manager, and he said this would be fine. Then when im hired, he tells me it isn't, and i decided i didn't want to stick around until my birthday working a job i really hated, so i left due to the manager being dishonest, and neglecting to tell me about a ""6 month job policy"" for job switches before i was hired."
bad,"We unload merchandise off of trucks onto pallets to be taken to the floor to be stocked. There are many,many bosses,,,,including many lifer associates who want very badly to be somebody but never will be. We are given too few workers to complete the trucks on time and when the manager shift changes we always hear ""How come you aren't done yet"", from the manager coming in. We are responsible for work that 3rd shift is suppose to do. We downstack multiple pallets worth of merchandise and have to pull very heavy pallets to the floor. When the dairy/frozen truck comes the employees from those depts rarely come to unload the truck. So, we have to stop our job to unload and bring their pallets of merch. to the fridges and freezers. Yet, we get no thank you's and get hammered for not being done with our work. This job pays minimum wage and is part-time only. You get poorer as the months go by. And, working with the people they make you work with makes you dumber. Run Forrest run. Or, never, never start working for WalMart in the first place. If you are educated and have a college education take your diploma somewhere else. They DO NOT help you advance. Take this from a college educated fool."
bad,"I checked out customer's merchandise and gave customer service. I overall liked my co-workers on a friendly level but on a work level most tried to avoid work. I got to meet new people and the job was fast paced, which I enjoy."
bad,"A typical day at work would involve helping rude and unhappy customers who complain about any and everything, working with young inexperienced lazy workers who don't have any concept of team work; the hardest par tof the job is dealing with the rude customers and working with lazy, inexperienced people who come to work to socialize; the most enjoyable part of the job is helping the few friendly customers who come in and enjoy their shopping experience and let you know while checking out."
bad,Most of the management are unprofessional. The hardest part of the job is when its under staffed.
bad,"I worked there for ten years. I loved my customers and the people I worked with but things changed for the worst while I was there. It went from one person in each department closing at night to one person for 3 or 4 departments while they pull you to the register all night. You are held accountable for your area when what you were supposed to do wasn't done because they told you to do other tasks instead.. Because you were scheduled 8 hours out of which 1 hour is lunch, 1 hour was in foods, 5 hours were on register, and If you were lucky you were in your area the rest of your shift. They don't hire full time anymore just part timers."
bad,"Given the nature of the business, specifically in my department, the daily routine is just that - routine - except for the variation in customers and customer requests and attitudes. Very seldom are there any learning opportunities, since you are expected to know or learn on your own, most of the necessary automotive knowledge. Management is at best adequate, but not readily helpful, knowledgeable or sensitive. The best part of the job are my coworkers, a very funny and diverse group of guys. The hardest part of the job is having to be on your feet all day and handling the work of at least three people, while dealing with the attitudes of customers and the inadequacy of management. The most enjoyable part of the job is the thanks and admiration I receive from customers and my fellow coworkers for handling and resolving a difficult situation well."
bad,"This is not a carrier, it's a job. I can't stress that enough. There is very little moment to be made in salary or position, and hard work is rarely rewarded."
bad,"Taking cash, credit cards, and EBT payments for the items that I ran thu my register. My scans per hour is running at 1,000 with 100% accuracy. While at this job they came to me to learn other jobs, jewlery, electronics, money center, and customer service.I enjoy working with other people for the same end result. Nothing was hard because I made it all work for me.I really enjoyed working with the public, the young , old,and personal shopping for people who needed help."
bad,I would go to work and complete departments stocking as well as front facing the merchandise and cleaning up my work area.
bad,"Does not promote from with in , many unfair labor law praticies ."
bad,It was difficult to learn the routine. It's like you sink or swim. If you're not alert and ask questions you're left in the dark.
bad,Never came to work late or called in. Statyed late to make sure my work was finished. Make one mistake and I am let go.
bad,Walmart is a place where you can take advantage of perks like their stock programs you get discounts on rentals and a lot of other items
bad,"Walmart was a cold work environment. You never really get the chance to know your co-workers, because people are in an out. My schedule was neve consistant."
bad,"When I began to work for Walmart, they were very friendly. They didn't just work with my school schedule, they wanted to work with it so I could do my job to the fullest. As the years dragged on, they changed their philosophy. The friendly managers that I loved were replaced by hostile business men and women who snubbed off the associates. They only talked to the associates when they had something to complain about (or someone to fire). As it stands, it's a very terrible company to work for."
bad,Typical day of work means having to deal with some really difficult customers who expect you to go beyond your means to bend the policy in order for them to get either their money back or some sort of store credit. The management never have your back and would almost always give the ok-go to take a return even though it is beyond the what the policy allows us to take. My co-workers are great for the most part. They were helpful and always willing to teach you anything you want to know. I did actually learn a great deal from working here. I learned about being patient and keeping a cool head and most definitely about customer service.
bad,A typical day would be talking to customers and placing cake orders. I learned how to decorate cakes very well. What I don't particularly like is management they sometimes speak to you like you are beneath them. Overall my co workers are great and fun to be around. The most enjoyable thing is dealing with customers.
bad,In management your salary is fair and benefits.I learned a lot in retail and can utilize it at my next job.
bad,"1. typical day, cleaning, repairing and setting old and new shelves."
bad,cut meat up make orders and weighed everything. not to good beacuse no full time never liked the empolyees and where to harsh always wanted the best but never payed what they would want
bad,"handle money, they only care about there product and making more money anything else the company dosent care"
bad,I love being around people and helping them as much as i can.. I dont really know my coworkers that well yet but so far some are nice but some are not so nice. Management in my opinion isnt the greatest. They dont pay attention to alot of things you tell them.
bad,"I dorve a forklift, stacked stock in the ware house. I learned safety on the job."
bad,Greet cusomers
bad,Overall not a good place for me advancement is not based on merit
bad,"I worked in an office and had very little supervision or interaction with others. However, what I did see was poor management, understaffing, and low pay. I always loved how management knows nothing about my job, but try to tell me how to do it. They couldn't fill in if someone was sick. Our job was super important, and only three of us worked in the office. It took two people to do the job, so if one of us went on vacation, we had to work everyday since no one else was trained to help us. Other stores had a few back up trained in through out the store."
bad,Working for this job is ok for a beginner but it's hard to move up in the company . I have learned how to develop customer service skills so I can move and do better things and hopefully have good opportunities in life .
bad,This was a have to job. I had bills to pay and this is where I worked. I do not even like shopping at this place .
bad,"I loved my job at walmart, however I found myself not loving walmart. Walmart management loved me because I was able to complete my job 90% of the time, which allowed management lo look good .However the attacks of completing 20 hours worth of work in 7 1/2 hours was not good enough for management, I needed to do more. I have completed 41 hours of frieght in 7 hours of a work time, with this ability I needed to complete 20 plus hours of work a night or I was lacking in my ability to perform my duities. I decided I was to good a worker to put my energy into walmart I needed a job I could be proud of."
bad,working retail under minimum wage with perfect attendance and being a team player did not advance my skills
bad,"Wal-mart. They'll act like they care, but then the'll stick you in a minimum wage job for over a year when you're clearly trying to support a family. Not to mention they'll try everything they can to keep you from working full-time. Typical work day includes doing everyone's elses job, drama in the break room, and management that's too busy with silly projects from corporate to handle store business. Sure, they have stock sharing and medical benefits, but don't expect to afford them with what they're willing to pay."
bad,"Everyday there are notes that need to be taken care of. Weekly notes. Price changes,scanning outs and ordering merchandise daily. Making sure. On-hands and negative on-hands are correct. If have enough people in your department or not. They want however many pallets of freight that you have gone. Most of my co-workers were great to work with. One of my problems with management was that I basically begged them for training. So that I could properly do my job. I feel like they set me up to fail. That really hurt me. I was with the company for twelve years same store. I never changed locations. It took me nine years to finally want to move up. To be treated like that didn't feel good at all. I didn't want any kind of Appreciation, of coarse. Everyone wants to feel appreciated. Just know that I could do my job and do it well. Was all that I wanted. I enjoyed and loved my job. It was overwhelming at times. I begged for more people in the department, due to the fact that it was understaffed. Sometimes management didn't know how to talk to people."
bad,Walmart experience was clocking in too work manager would tell me what side of the parling lot i had and then i would put my vest on and go outside too push the karts back into the building. Co workers were no help I felt I took majority of the load of their work including mine. Manager you wouldnt see come out at all accept lunch break.
bad,"I learned that at wal-mart it is more important to ""make friends"" with your immediate management than it is to complete your job to the best of your abilities. After working for the company for 4 years as a department manager I found the overall goals to be un-realistic and expectations beyond reach. For instance, the weekend shift is supposed to organize(zone) and stock the department. On Monday mornings, the beginning of my week, I would receive a department walk through. I would be criticized for the state the department was in and marked down for it. Another instance involved and update of a area within my department. I had cleared the entire day to get the area done, but found that members of management would pull me from the task. Towards the end of the day I was pulled by another member of management. I informed that manager that I would not be able to complete the task if pulled. I was informed that that was ok. I was then written up the next day for not completing reorganization."
bad,"Management was very unorganized, other then that I learned better people skills responsibility and the value of a dollar. I loved to interact with the customers and help them in anyway they needed."
bad,-too long of hours
bad,"Work in a fast-paced, hectic, environment all the while maintaining a thorough and methodic food preparation and disposal schedule."
bad,"l Loved my job as a cake decorator and baker. I learned how to decorate cakes, how to use the telzon and order product. learned a lot about customer service."
bad,"At work I am either checking out customers in a timely manner, at the service desk providing customer service with returns and exchanges, or answering the store phone and directing customers to the departments they need or helping with general questions."
bad,No good benefits for employees. Not really a place where the employees are a team. Management doesnt really know how to manage and you get promoted if you are in the in crowd...but every location is different
bad,"The most enjoyable part is working with amazing co workers, and dealing with fragile customers"
bad,"I try very hard not to mention negative when I speak of past employers, so I will make this brief. A typical day working instock would include unloading merchandise and grocery trucks, inventory management and stocking shelves. Some of the people I worked with were unique and colorful in the nicest way. There were many not so positive aspects of working there but I always did enjoy my fellow instock associates."
bad,the other employees dont care manigment is not knolidgable its just horrible but if you need work its a job
bad,Highly stressfull atmosphere caused mainly by management especially before inventory time. Only hiring part timers so need to give vacations and benifits limited. Difficult at times to get relief for breaks and meals.
bad,"My day starts with setting up my equipment start making my orders for that day,I'v learn that getting everything together one place will save me time.Department supervisor would check work progress sometimes if there was only one person working that shift.the hardest part of the day is trying to complete orders before deadline.The best part of the day is seeing a customer face light up when they come to pick up their orders and say great job ..because of the disrespect and unfair treatment by store managers /assistance managers and department supervisors to employees,co-workers and myself ,I made my decision to quit after almost 4 years.many other workers in my department (bakery) had also quit."
bad,The company don't offer any type of benefits not even part-time unless you get to a managment position.THe managemente positions are very well guarded and hard to come by.Other wise the personel is very respectful and it's a good work enviorment.
bad,work at walmart is a basic go in and work with the customers. I learned how to deal with all types of different customers.
bad,"I worked as a cashier, and the pay was not satisfactory for the work. Working a total of 35 hours a week, part time, and receiving 7.65 an hour is unreasonable."
bad,When they are told that an employee is a Disabled veteran and that they have a condition that may require them to miss work that would be beyond their control they want to see the employee's private medical reccords and will terminate the employee while the employee is trying to deal with their condition.
bad,A typical day at work for me is stress have such a hard time do my work with all kind of distractions.. What i learned is how to work hard and how the business works.. The management there is awful u have managers that don't even know how to run your department but try to tell u this ain't right or this how that goes.. Co workers are find some rude others just go there for clowning instead of working. The hardest part of my job is when i have to do everything on my own that takes 2 or 3 people to do..The most enjoyable part of my job is lunch breaks and providing customer service to the customers.. just to see them smile
bad,shoes dept. changes with the seasons and can hard work at those times.
bad,I can not speak for the entire store but only the location where I worked. The management has potential and a few good managers but the lack of communication and cohesion destroys the team. Compensation is the major issue when compared to the amount of work you are asked to complete. As far as the benefits high cost with low benefits...
bad,"typical day at work, just be a person thats there for whatever it is your to do. I learned this company and management is good at passing the buck."
bad,"Contrary to what Nike tells you, just DON'T do it. They will use and abuse you and when they don't have a need for you anymore they will find a way to get you to quit or fire you. Worst experience ever."
bad,"One of Walmart's catch phrases are ""listen to your associates"" it's sad to say that policy is long gone. I'm not speaking about all Walmart stores in general but the one I personally work at does everything but listen to it's associates. Working the overnight shift you would expect the associates to slack off a little but this is not the case. In actuality its the managers who have a tendency to wander about the store looking at DVD's or listening to music. I will say that at my store we have a wonderful group of associates. I can definitely say I'm proud to call them my coworkers. They work together help each other when their own work is done and are very customer friendly. Working here I've learned a great deal about customer service and working as a team because we all understand that in the end getting the job done and the store looking clean and customer friendly is the most important thing. One of the more challenging aspects of my job is having to multitask between two peoples job when I was only hired for one. Our store used to have 4 cashiers at night two of them quit and one was let go. Being that I have previous cashier experience with Walmart the managers volunteered me to be a full time cashier as well as an Inventory Specialist full time. But I will only be paid for one job but still be expected to complete both jobs completely and without error. I find this to personally be completely unfair to me as an employee. I have spoken to management about my concerns but did not receive anything but a sorry we can't do anything. I think Walmart needs to go back to the"
bad,A typical day at Walmart began when the store opened until about 4pm:
bad,"When I was actually getting hours and working, I loved the job. However I worked 10 days in 3.5 months, and only 2 of them were full shifts. ."
bad,co-workers were not easy to get along with the managers are terriable and bad leadership
bad,"At first this job was ""THE"" job. or should i say career. I loved working at Walmart. Then hours were cut they limited the number of cashiers we could have at any given time. Also they cut the number of sales floor associates. This made a lot of employees upset with hours being cut. As was I. Going from a full time manager to part time was kinda rough. Therefore i resigned looking for other opportunity."
bad,A typical day at walmart is get to work clock in. get your assigned register for the day. set up your register then just cashier till breaks and lunch. managment wasnt the best in communication. they would change rules a few times a day without telling the employees which was the hardest part of the job.i am usually very good with sudden changes...i just need to know about them. co-workers were all awesome. the most enjoyable part would be just being able to work with customers
bad,The Have Lazy Managers. and some methods used are questionable
bad,I like my job but not the place. Walmart does not value their employees.
bad,"The managers at the store I worked at were not ""people friendly"" they were always walking around without a smile. There were never enough associates on the sales floor to assist customers in departments and there were barely any registers open. The associates were more friendly and pleasant. The hardest part of the job was basically watching the managers (store, assistant, and zone) either sit back in the offices doing much of nothing, walk past some merchandise that would be on the floor and tell an associate to pick it up, and for them to be asked for assistance by a customer and them telling a customer they will get someone to assist them instead of them doing it themselves. Sometimes it was hard to be as patient with ""difficult"" customers when working the customer service desk. The best part of the job was putting on smile on a customers face just by assisting them."
bad,Hardly any room for advancement. Only good thing was the discount which still was a terrible 10% discount.
bad,Started off very well then they switched store managers and everything went down hill
bad,walmart is a big company but lacks respect towards employees. the employees themselves were great to work with but the whole system was bad. benefits were not at the standards they should have been at. also the work envirorment was unsafe.
bad,Walmart used to be a place where you could get somewhere and be something. Now adays though its simply looking to suck the life out of you and move on to the next potential employee. Very rarely can you find management that isnt running scared of the suits and problems that need to be solved are often ignored hoping theyll go away. Also If your hoping to get a full time position you might as well forget about that idea. Walmart would rather suffer staffing shortages then promote or hire full time help to cover shifts. How do I know this?I'm a part of it.
bad,"Work was very fast-paced. I was poorly trained for the task that I was hired for. Communication was very bad, as well as the pay. I would not recommend this Wal-mart as a place of employment to anyone."
bad,"this walmart is very discrimitory and disrespectful. I complained to the managers about me being discriminated against and they did nothing. Went to the market manager and reported this and nothing. One of my hispanic co workers was also discriminated against by the managers. saying "" im thinking about firing you because you can speak fluent english"" we go to work there everyday on time do our job and they dont do their job. they force you to work ""part time"" but give you rediculous hours and no benefits. I got hurt working at this walmart and the only thing the managers said to me was that the company is not responsible for me or any injuries. the managers even have people doing their job. there to lazy and disrespectful."
bad,i had fun building bike furnature i operated scissor lift forklift pallet jacks i also worked in garage for awhile working cars oil changes and tire lube i work for then for fourteen years and hoped to retire i enjoyed working with and helping costomers
bad,"I found that because there were no restrictions on the knowledge of different positions, the knowledge of Business Administration was limitless. That was the was advantage to me. Even though, i didn't want to make a career in retail, I was still able to grad all the education I wanted in Administration Operation, Operations of Financial Services & HR operations."
bad,"First 6 months or so were wonderful, loved working with my coworkers. Management was horrible."
bad,I am a student and they constantly would schedule me when I wasn't available leading to absences that I got fired for! Management needs to get it together!
bad,"The co-workers were amazing people, however management left much to be desired. Poor organizational practices, inadequate staffing ploicies, and general disregard for employee concerns. Benefits packages were poor at best, and upon reaching the required 90 days for first raise, was told it had been changed to 1 year, and insurance benefits were cut."
bad,if you are career oriented and determined to make it a long time career it works out. like most employees i met there its just a job and a stepping stone toward something better.
bad,"I love working in customer service it was fast paced, but there was hardly any team work or good comunication you had the open door polocy but the store manager and other managers did not follow it and spread rumors about empolees"
bad,Wal-Mart has forgotten that it is their associates that make the company what it is. They are continually taking their benefits away from them or modifying them. They continually threaten the jobs of management and you have NO home life working for them. They have totally forgotten that Sam Walton cared for his associates and they enjoyed working for him This is truly no longer the case.
bad,Management was highly aggressive forced people to work hours unmanageable for their circumstances and threatened anyone who spoke out with immediate termination.
bad,To many chiefs not enough Indians. You get pulled in to many directions. You can not get things done. you start a project and then a manager will pull you off of it to do another. then another manager will come along and pull you off that one to do another one. You never can get anything finished. T hen they want to know why your productivity is down..
bad,"It receives a low rating, due to the fact that they mistreat their workers, when they should be treating them better. Management constantly pushes the workers to do 3 to 4 times more than they're physically capable of, and threatens to fire them for leaving on time, or for having over time, due to poor management skills."
bad,"Don't show up early you'll get penalized for it, I showed up too early too often and then was told I wasn't supposed to.  They later said they would take care of it but did not, so when I had to call out sick, I was fired the next working day because it wasn't taken care of"
bad,This company will burn a good employee out. You are never appreciated for good work. I've been there almost 3 years and never once was given recognition for any good even though I was told by customers and co-workers.
bad,For the job at Walmart they need to pay cashiers more because of the high demand environment and Because a lot of the people that come through those lines are disrespectful
bad,Management is poor communication is poor work environment is poor they coach the employees who work hard day in and day out and continue to cater to the lazy people I want to be appreciated at my job I want to like coming to work
bad,"Most of the people I work with was very reliable ,most of management really do not know how to talk to people really nasty to most of employees first-hand experience"
bad,"It is a day by day bases. Some days are good and some days it can get really bad. It is a so-so place to work at temporary if you in school, but it wouldn't be a good long term job."
bad,"management does not care about associates, will not work with new schedules. every man for themselves, they threw me in online grocery by myself, everyone left after two pm and i was there until 8 pm"
bad,"May ask too much in not enough time. So instead of one area, you might end up with three areas due to lack of staff and callouts. Extremely repetitive."
bad,"Company is extremely money pinching and thus most all positions are vastly underpaid and under appreciated and more often than not, does not promote a healthy work environment, advancement is almost impossible unless you suck up like crazy and even then it’s difficult, very often management will play favorites and if they don’t like you they will get you in trouble for minuscule things, worked at 2 separate locations and both were very similar, management will spread rumors about you like wild fire with very few ways to fix it"
bad,When u get to work ure always lost as to what to do. Looking for supervisor alone was a hassle. Not organized and not enough equipment. Not much hours
bad,Terrible expérience! Je ne recommande pas du tout!
bad,"Walmart is a very big corporation, with a lot of locations. Some of those locations probably adhere to their work values, but unfortunately mine did not, especially in upper management. ASM's did not follow company procedures for conflict resolution, time management of employees (assuring everything could get done by applying people to tasks they were suited for) and failed to follow company policy regarding absences and late arrivals on a ""favoritism"" basis."
bad,"I've worked for Walmart twice now, and both times I was met with some of the most toxic work environments. The work load was too much for the people that we had. The management was abysmal. I wouldn't go back to walmart even if the alternative was living on the street."
bad,It’s a job. The checks clear. The only thing is the lack of culture. Nobody truly seems to care about the success of the team as a whole. Managers lacked organizational skills and personality.
bad,"I worked at the distribution center and i hated it. I don’t care if I got paid well, it was not worth it for me mentally and physically. You’re treated like a machine and expected to do so much a day when most days it is nearly impossible. Most new hires get shoved on weekend night shifts. And don’t get me started on the environment! You’re shoved in a huge stuffy building with no air and summers are terrible"
bad,"I used to like my job at walmart but 7/8 years ago something changed. Management stopped caring about the associates, work per person was quadrupled, advancement became nearly impossible for a hard working, loyal and competent employees. You are never judged by the quality of your work but by your ability to befriend your manager. For example: talking about football with them while other people work."
bad,This specific store was overwhelming. We were often expected to keep up with a workload that was not feasible. I would only recommend working here as a temporary position.
bad,"I use to enjoy working for this company.  It has changed a lot and not for the better of the associate.  If you cannot pull pallets, lift bags of dog food or forget about your family life, then this is the company for you.  Good luck in you endeavors."
bad,"Management needs severe improvement. The benefits are good if you’re able to get them. You pull teeth to get full time, and if you are able to get it they don’t give you your full benefits"
bad,"I would only recommend working there if you had no other options or needed a job as soon as possible. "
bad,Management is horrible even if you’re full time they will give you 20 or less hours a week fun environment but that’s all I’ll say about Walmart good luck
bad,Job wasnt hard but the point system is the dumbest thing if you have kids and need to leave to say bring fresh clothes to your kid who wet themselves at school then you'll get a point and once you hit a certain amount they let you go no exceptions
bad,"Logic and organization is not how Id describe my experience at Wal Mart."
bad,This place sucked. I often was underpaid and management was a joke. The only good thing about this Walmart was that it had shawarma right across the street.
bad,Not a good company to work for / Awful Management!! You will wait for weeks for changes to be made for broken machine / tools. Machines are over 13 years old and never maintenance and when they brake down Management plays the blame game...
bad,"Started out as an ok place to work but bad management that doesn't seem to care much about employees or what they do. Huge lack of accountability and a lot of finger pointing for stuff not done or done correctly. "
bad,...if you want the money its there. Don't expect to move up or transfer. Attendance is really strict. A lot of changes. Employees are not thought of. Everything is money and productivity.
bad,"Management does nothing to help when staff is short.  They just stand around and gossip.  Too many young managers with no life experiences.  No communication between them. There is a reason why lots of managers step down."
bad,a lack of basic communication between management staff often lead to have to do things repeatedly or undo things we had previously done. not a great job but it pays the bills.
bad,unload a truck then stock aisles with groceries from the truck. I have a pretty good idea of where most groceries go in each aisle. lots of favoritism in the management area. always try to make the customers happy at any cost. the hardest part of the day is probably getting your aisles done after a large truck. the most enjoyable part is probably being able to help a customer when they have questions about where things are located in the store.
bad,"There are plenty of chances to move up in the company. But in terms of management, they’re very poor. They don’t know how to treat there employees properly. And instead of boosting moral they only lower it. Walmart is only good if you’re looking for a job when nobody else out there is hiring."
bad,"The management team definitely needed to know more about the jobs their associates do. The associates shouldn't have to train their manager's. They should also be more available when they are needed and not embarrassingly hard to find. When a customer wants to speak to a manager, then the management should be there helping them."
bad,"Management does not encourage their employees in a positive light, it is constant negativity. Many issues with bullying, and nothing is done about it."
bad,"Cons -You have to wait for a year to receive benefits . The managers let stress control their lives . The customers are ridiculous but that’s everywhere. We have no security so people steal ALL the time . Walmart is not all what everyone thinks it is . They have favorites. "
bad,Not enough teaching. Management doesn’t listen to associates needs. Family job life balance horrible for management. Not enough training for new hires.
bad,"I do like that I’m able to go back to school for something else. For a very long time we were understaffed and over worked. Unable to catch up on work. Unable to provide excellent customer service. We are fully staffed now but do not work as a team. We have new hires that need to be trained but nobody taking the time out in management to actually see that they do that. Most of the work falls on the people who want to do their job, which is only a few."
bad,"I worked for this company for 5 years and it took a while to see where the the space between what they preach and how the upper management acts. It really is all who you know, who you date and who your friends are.  If you are not willing to bend to that sort of behavior, you might want to find someplace else. "
bad,"No matter how hard you work, it is never good enough. I always go above and beyond and hardly ever get recognized by upper Management. All the CSM’s were required to work 6 days per week from the beginning of November to the first week in January. Now, because it’s slower, we will get a formal coaching if we have 1 hour of OT in our payroll....."
bad,"Unorganized, unproductive work environment, management is two faced and uncaring, shifts  are unreliable and inconsistent, alot of repetitive unproductive work, not enough workers for the amount of work they require you to get done."
bad,"This company can take you far however is not for"
bad,Great place for high schoolers but not a mature adult working there was like being in a high school simply because everyone had to know everyone's business
bad,"...they pay well"
bad,"Store managers do not care about you. All they care about is their yearly bonus. If you strive to be a store manager, go for it! The pay is excellent! But don’t have any emotional concern for your Assistant Managers and you will do fine. Walmart spends millions per year training new Assistant Managers at their Academy. They fire Assistant Manager’s daily."
bad,Very physical work. production rates can be hard to meet. upper management shows no care for their associates. Continually changing policies and taking more and more away from associates.
bad,Management treats you as you are beneath them and opinions coming from entry level workers dont matter. No teamwork is allowed or it is meet with a coaching.
bad,"As valuable as customers are to Walmart, they should also be concerned with their employees and training.  There is a sense of no organization within Walmart.  When hired, yes you go through a lot of visual computer job orientation, but as for hands on training and introductions by a manager, that does not happen.  They just let you learn you job on you own and never check to see how you're doing.  In fact, I was hurt not too long ago and my manager has never asked how I'm doing.  I like the job but not the lack of organization, as I am a very organizational person."
bad,"It’s great work environment to build and learn skills . It’s a self thought work place. "
bad,"Assistant Mangers are disrespectful. The people above you think they can talk to you any type of way. Even if you take off months in advance, they still will deny your day off."
bad,My experience working there been stable but I would prefer for Management to try on doing better on how they treat their employees. One thing I would never complain is that this company have a strong way on putting their customer first.
bad,"I wouldn’t recommend someone to work at this Walmart. That’s my review. Poor management, they’re all kids. They tell you “ I’ll handle it don’t worry “ nothing ever gets done. It’s just overall bad. I rather be jobless than work here again."
bad,"While not the worst place to work at first, every year loss in benefits has made this company unbearable to be at. If you are just looking for some quick working experience then it is a decent start though."
bad,Management lacks a clear vision for the store and attempts to turn coworkers against each other instead of being leaders and team builders. Pay is not enough to live on. Too much unnecessary drama. Revolving door of coworkers due to personal vendettas by management.
bad,"The only best thing about working at Walmart is that your schedule is made in advance. Other then that management is poor and there’s no teamwork or place for going up unless you go where they want you to go."
bad,No advancement. Customer service is emphasized. Hours and days schedule often change. Communication needs improvement. Most employees are unhappy but grateful to have a job. Friendships develop.
bad,"Workplace Culture"
bad,"I loved working at walmart, it was busy, and lots of people to meet.  The problems were managers or csms, were nasty n front of customers.  Twice my customers were embarrassed for me and frustrated because there was no help when I needed it.  Plus the hours, I had to work every weekend, (no home life at all) and also I had to drive 45 min for a 4 hour day. This all happened in Okotoks, my  experience in Whitecourt totally different."
bad,Walmart has the idea that the employees don’t really need to be valued. They order us around and we never receive credit or approval of the work we do.
bad,Walmart pay is good but overall in my opinion they have a lot that needs to be changed. Walmart is not a bad company to work for because their is some good things working for the company as well as bad.
bad,They demanding and put the company first not family. Under staff not a team. Difficult to work for stressful. Change  your schedule all time not fair company to work for
bad,"At my store, management really only cares about making money and not about customers or staff. They'll cut your hours out of spite, they talk badly about customers and employees behind their backs, etc."
bad,"Cut hours. Asst. manager is terrible and should be fired, treats everyone below her poorly. Fired many people when GM was gone for birth of his child."
bad,"Morale is perpetually on the cusp of death, being forced out of the grave by mandatory group meetings usually near the back of the store. "
bad,"I don’t recommend it for your whole life but only for part time . Schedules were wierd . If you put pto early it’s considered absent . But if you put pto after it’s better,"
bad,If you need a quick paycheck and don't mind what schedule you work. Join walmart. If you have goals and a life and value your off work life. Wal-Mart is not the place for you.
bad,Its a awful place to work. They don't help you out. If management doesn't like you specially the new store manager he will find away to get rid of you
bad,Wal-Mart is a stepping stone. Is not a place that see myself  20 years down line still there. But you can make a living you can get your bills paid. They do have raises. They have bonuses but it all depends on your work.
bad,"While working at Walmart, I was given the position of being an overnight worker when Walmart stayed open 24hrs. On the weekends we would have almost our entire night call in or just not show up. We would  complained, I would get the job done as needed no matter how manyhave hundreds of boxes that needed to be unloaded and stocked by the end of shift, the items also had to be inspected for damages. I never people showed up to work. In my mind I knew I had job to do and it was gonna get done. I did my job with much happiness, and learned to be harder worker no matter what circumstances may arise."
bad,"I had an entertaining time working for the company. I worked as a cashier with and saw customers lose their minds for the smallest things. That was the entertainment for me. "
bad,i loved working there even if management is poor. the few friends i made like employees made up for it. i had alot of common customers who i loved seeing every day
bad,"I worked here for around 8 months and I started out full time. They (the company and managers) work you to the bone. I worked 1pm-10pm everyday with 2 days off a week. Sometimes only 1 day off. Some might say that isn't bad, but the evening shift like this just didn't work for me. I never had time outside of work to see family or friends. Also, you work around a lot of teenagers who are lazy and immature. I would work my butt off and seemed to get no where. The managers took months to change my schedule from full time to part time. Then when I tried to change my schedule again, they didn't change in time for school season and I had no choice, but to call in to work because they scheduled me out of my availability. Overall, the company pays okay, but the work environment is disorganized, passive aggressive, and tiresome."
bad,"With places like Walmart, it's the people around you that make or break the job. The unfortunate part is, there are a lot of managers who don't exactly understand how to get the most out of their subordinates. This can leave workers becoming easily irritated, or wishing to move to a different job very quickly. Unless you find a diamond in the rough location, you're most likely better off getting paid a hair above minimum wage somewhere else."
bad,It was good to working for Walmart. Although it wasn't the job that I always wanted to do. But yes I got an exposure that how to deal with people to solve their queries.
bad,Once the old manager left it completely fell apart and  no one does their job or even cares if stuff getd done. Biggest store in the north wrst and they treat it like its a small town store.
bad,"Tip for being a student working Walmart. Never ask for them to be more considerate of your school schedule. Ask for 3 shifts you get minimum 5 making part time pay with no benefits. Nothing is ever good enough, never show them your full work potential or you’ll never get a break. You stop wanting to wake up in the morning, a constant feeling of dread looming over you when you realize you’ll never advance in the ladder."
bad,"wal mart. management has it's on click. managers,pick on people with 20 years or higher  to find things to fire them, one former manager hit on girls for dates.store manager knew and did nothing"
bad,When I was first hired the only training I received was how to operate a cash register. Only I was hired as a floor associate. I was expected to just guess at what questions I should ask so that I would have things explained to me. The first 2 years I had decent hours. But as soon as minimum wage was increased my hours were cut back to only 12 hours a week from 28.
bad,"professionalismI wouldn't recommend anyone I know to work at Walmart."
bad,"Bajos sueldos,horas laborales muy extensas,sin posibilidades de ascenso ni de capacitación. Cuando quise compatibilizar estudios con trabajo no se me dio la oportunidad por lo que tuve que elegir entre estudios o trabajo."
bad,"It's an okay job , not too hard to do. Managers don't really care about lower level associates they only care about themselves and money. Management not very willing to work with associates."
bad,"It was a stable job I will give it that, but overloaded with tasks per person, and unprofessional managers that got away with treating their team poorly. open door policy is worthless when I had to deal with a situation of harassment. There was no disciplinary actions taken for the employees that regularly violated company policies, such as being overly direct with associates when there was an ""issue"" and often wasteful of products in the fresh production area, unsanitary, not following local health codes and general poor work ethic by disappearing for 30 minutes at a time each smoke or restroom break. "
bad,They dont care about their employees or their customers. Too much favoritism some of it qasnt bad but yeah dont work there it's not great if you dont fit in with the managers
bad,Could be better but not terrible. Most associates don’t want to do much work but for the most part get the job done. Management doing know what they are doing.
bad,"NO TEAM WORK AT ALL. Management are self center and not willingly teaching nor promoting good working habits. Poor managements skills in the store as a whole. Frequents mistakes with schedules, not enough help and work overload. Expectancy of excellent customer service with poor interaction with employees."
bad,"It isnt a bad good if you get the hang of it. Just stressful and doesn't work around with your schedule, especially when you need it. Could be better about how they treat employees and be fair to all."
bad,"I am fairly certain that to be in a management position at walmart, you just have to know someone. They do not promote from within and only one manager in the store I work at has any common sense."
bad,It’s like working in a high school with bad local government officials. Everyone gossips constantly and management tries to keep out of anything that might make them do actual work. There are rare exceptions to every location where the employees actually care about the job and the customer but from my personal experience of being there for almost four years those rare employees are few. It mostly feels like you’re working in a high school classroom and everyone has their clique.
bad,Honestly the most of the people that work a Walmart are like the customers who shop there on Christmas Eve. Just the worst. There are always employees taking extra breaks and not pulling their own weight. Every child that is with their parents at shopping at Walmart has the worst attitude.
bad,it's an ok place to wotk. I enjoyed my coworkers. The company itself is very cooperate and no room for anything that doesn't earn them large profits  people who decide how to run things obviously haven't been directly on the floor working.
bad,"It is a decent entry level job.  However, you must remain flexible in your available days and hours and be willing to have no set schedule or routine days off.  Most associates get two days off together but not always.  They recently restructured the PTO and sick day policies and they are extremely strict.  Also if you have called in sick more than two times you do not qualify to receive any bonus."
bad,"Thankless job with little support from management, little to no room for advancement, repetitive work with little variation, expected and sometimes required to work extra hours but take time off later in week to avoid possibility of overtime"
bad,"I worked 2nd shift at store #2387, and it was a fatal mistake to take the job. The top-brass management team at Causeway Walmart is trash, and creates a toxic work environment. Their goal has become maintaining barely passable levels of performance, versus making improvements to the operation(That's the standards of the Academy Store for you). Good managers at that location are both worked to death, on top of being eclipsed by the bad apples within the team. Their support managers and Sr. Co-manager won't perform department walk-throughs until either 2 hours passed your clock-out, or first thing in the morning in order to discredit and besmirch your workmanship. They'll hire you as part-time, but will schedule you like a full-time associate in heavy-traffic departments to void your eligibility for the company benefits. Their scheduling manager can't properly facilitate the store's needs with during the business weekend(Fri-Sun), even though they're over-staffed. Expect to be pulled from your area during those days to fill the void, and be told you didn't fulfill your department's tasks due to their inability to manage the store. There's no genuine communication within the management team either, so none of them can keep track of associates activities within the store. If you intend to work at 2387, be prepared to take photos and videos of your department before clock-out. Otherwise, be ready to be continuously ridiculed over doing your job to the absolute best of your ability through their underwhelming managerial skills."
bad,"Not a good place to work especially on black Friday, management doesn't care about you they only want you to work non stop to make them look good. "
bad,Very fast paced and physically demanding while unloading trucks. Sometimes management would help. Cap 2 was the lowest paid position but entailed the most work and heavy lifting. Hours were sometimes 10 to 14 hours depending on how many trucks were scheduled for the day. Supervisors were expected to stay untill the job was done. Lots of pressure to get trucks done and then have to stock the grocery partan!stock gro
bad,"Worked here for 2 years off and on, management are jokes who take themselves too seriously. They try to squeeze blood from a stone and expect you to work 5 times as hard as them for a quarter the pay. No holiday pay and expect you to work through major holidays for a small discount that only works at their stores. You start your day unloading trucks and are griped at and micro managed until you clock out."
bad,Walmart is out to make money!!! Not make their employees happy. They have taken too many benefits away to the point many experienced employees are finding work elsewhere.
bad,I’m a pt college student & Walmart has been somewhat flexible with my school schedule. The Walmart fails to recognize talent in a rewarding manner & also is the king of taking away from their employees & giving less benefits/support. Managers & Csm’s (lower ranked managers) don’t communicate with each other in a professional manner & they wonder why their turnover rate is sky high. Etc.
bad,"They assign you on positions you aren't trained for, and don't offer the pay with that position. The job is easy. There's no huge challenging aspect. The pay is fairly good, but hours are a little hard to get if you don't request them. Management is rude and can be unhelpful."
bad,"DONT DO IT. "
bad,The managers will cut hours even if you are full time back to around 20 hours a week so they can get bigger bonuses. People try to get you fired if they dont like you and you are treated unfairly.
bad,"The management at this establishment was rarely seen, but always critical when they came around. There were many technical issues that would go unresolved for quite a while. Scheduling was awful, mainly because they had so many different people cover it! They had little regard for specific schedules, especially for students!"
bad,"I did not enjoy working here too much. Barely got any hours, the atmosphere wasn't fun, etc. It was just a job where i was just going in to get it over with."
bad,"Better leadership needed, no robots need to apply. Leave personal problems at home. Need to stay busy and lots of favoritism to associates who don't much."
bad,"from the start i realized it wasn't for me but i needed a job so stuck it out for 5 years."
bad,"A soul stealing, miserable job. Being an adult In charge of adults who don't care to follow orders. Lead by adults who don't know how to communicate and make you jump through loops during your shift to please them. An exhaustive place."
bad,"Some of the  managers are so nitpicky and  overly critical, even some of them are more reasonable.  They assume that everyone there is an illiterate idiot. One of them just gets bored and screws around with decent employees. If it was more busy they would be too preoccupied  with other tasks. I assume that running a grocery store is tough."
bad,"There is so much going on inside, Alot of people trying to give orders and no one trying to give a solution. They write you up for any and everything. if you get hurt due to someone els or self its still a write up or termination"
bad,"Place to work stocking and making sure the shelfs are full and the outs are scanned, have learned how to use the hand held for making sure were product goes and if we have outs ect. management is not so friendly as it used to be, its not as caring as when I first started."
bad,"The issue or issues are that management is still stuck in high school and favoritism plays a huge role in advancement. If you are not in, you don not get to advance. I get thrown around to 2-4 departments each day I work there. I know more about the store than the people I report to and add my 3 degrees to the mix, one can see why it is a bit frustrating to be passed over time and time again."
bad,"Great for the first few months, then we switched a store manager who didn't know what he was doing. When I left, our apparel cove was full of freight, we never received help, and two coworkers of mine were practically living at the store playing catch-up. I'd never recommend working here."
bad,"In the 3.5 years of working at Walmart, I'd struggled with many personal health issues and was almost fired for this. I was not given my annual raise during my last year because if my evaluation score, but I'd only been in my new department for less than 6 months and I was also at the most high risk stage during my pregnancy. I will never understand how I got such a poor rating and no raise in 2019 when I was excelling the 2 prior years before for evaluation. I stayed only to survive financially, but manage"
bad,When I first started I loved working there. I’m on cap 2. My new supervisor is a total bonehead and loves to disrespect people. Management does nothing about it.
bad,"I was a customer host at walmart. The pay was good and hours were not too bad. Management sucked though. I had a harassment issue that never got taken care of. They could care less. Also, they dont seem to care if you have family emergencies come up. It's like it's an inconvenience for them. But, the uniform is more relaxed. The pay isn't too bad. You get 2 15 minute breaks and an hour lunch."
bad,The home life doesn’t exist! They are rude and after 14 years of taking verbal abuse I left! You never do enough.. rude customers and drama from associates. Not worth it!
bad,In the beginning I enjoyed my time at Wal-Mart.  As times changed so did the services and we constantly had changes in management.  It is fine as a starter a job but don't get comfortable.  I honestly know I stayed longer than I should have.  Very hard to advance within this company.
bad,This a great place for a permanent employment.  There is no chance in getting promotions or growth.  They want to keep you in the same position.  There is no time off when emergencies happen.
bad,"It's fine as a first job, just don't go into it expecting it to not be Walmart. You're going to have to deal with some undesirable people, and your manager probably isn't going to be around much, but you're getting paid to stand in one spot and move stuff across a belt."
bad,Talk in person can not express my self about Walmart this is why I am applying for a job at whole foods.i need a better environment Walmart doesn't care about their employees I have a department manager doesn't know how to do anything
bad,Managers treat u like dirt and you are always to push the Mastercard on all people it's horrible and people with less experience get the jobs cause there family members work there
bad,Aprendi a me comunicar mais e a alcançar meus objetivos
bad,Their is a serious ethics issue within the store. If one manager fires another mangers employee it becomes a whole work issue like team against team. Management allows certain employees get away with against company policies if they like u and fire you if they don’t.
bad,I was injured at my place of residence. Even after the doctor released me to return to work. I was not put back on the schedule. Went about 5 separate times to talk to manager with no luck. Still have not heard why I was not put back on schedule. I will say my coworkers were very easy to work with and very friendly and helpful. Going to work I liked the overnight shift.
bad,Some store managers follow proper procedures and some don’t until a Market or Regional Manager visits. They also assign people to stores away from home and require that they know what’s happening in that community. There is a lack of communication and training in some stores.
bad,"Specifically at my store management didn’t know how to schedule, or properly plan out anything to make the work environment efficient and productive. Employees were always pulled from their own tasks and work to pick up the weight of others , management rarely helped."
bad,"Walmart has great pay but I feel as if they do not pay you enough for how cruddy they treat you. If you are pregnant Walmart is not a good place to go especially if you work in the back and find out you are pregnant. They take months before moving you to a safer location and they force you to do risky things while pregnant. If you have a family matter at home or any other personal issue, they dont care. They dont care about their employees, only getting the work done."
bad,They would give impossible tasks for stocking shelves alot of times understaffed management don't seem to communicate with one another rules change from person to person just bad place of business to work.
bad,"The money is fine, but you most likely will be overworked and won’t get major holidays off. Rarely see family and benefits are minimum. Flexible schedule if open availability."
bad,"Walmart like other company’s is making big changes so job security is not there right now. They pull you dom one dept and send you where ever they need help as they can not keep anyone right now, due to poor or no management"
bad,When I first started the previous Assistant Managers were very nice and always made us be a team when getting the job done. Now that the other managers are gone the newer managers make us work very hard alone getting tons of freight done to the point where we run out of time and become very exhausted and stressed.
bad,"Managers are uncoordinated and treat workers like expendable objects, because they have a cycle of employees always coming in. It takes them 2-3 months just to change your schedule or accept a day off."
bad,"As a new hire the expectations placed on me seemed a bit high, wages are barely enough to live on, and you get paid biweekly so by the time you get paid again you’ve been struggling for a week. You only get 4 sick days (unpaid) every 6 months, and you only get a 25 cent raise every year. If you miss a shift without calling in they count it as all 4 against you and terminate your employment immediately, however they are willing to work with you in certain instances. You do get paid time off as long as you work there over 6 months, but it’s cumulative so you have to work more to get more. Considering that they will only work you 4 days per week and won’t allow overtime, it’s hard to get the money you need and the paid time off you deserve. Overall, I wouldn’t recommend it unless you’re a high school student without typical financial responsibilities."
bad,"The job itself is a good job; the management at this particular store does NOT communicate."
bad,Extremely busy location usually short staffed. Constant changes in policies and management. High turnover rate. Had great benefits. Equipment needed updating.
bad,Management cant be bothered to talk to and the schedule will change a day before you're supposed to work. Unless you are a relative of somebody in the store dont waste your time
bad,"Its a 'OK' place, but there is no communication between the different managers or shifts. You will be asked to do one thing by the morning manager, and when the next shift comes in, asked to 'undo' or redo it differently. Only PART TIME!! There are very few full time positions."
bad,Walmart is in a constant changing status. It sometimes forgets that their associates are what drives the company. The work/ family balance does not exist for all associates.
bad,Though the pay is higher the workers AKA Managers did not make me feel like anything other than a number in their ranks as well as they had little consideration to me having family. I just got married and yet still having been with them almost 3 years I still feel as though I am the lowest of the low to everyone except from my immediate supervisor.
bad,"The Supply Chain building used to province work life / balance, but now all that drives the building is production.  Holidays and floating holidays have been deleted.  Mandatory overtime, coming in early and staying late is a weekly occurrence.  The pay is no longer the top of the area competition.  It has not grown as in the other competitive buildings."
bad,"walmart will take mostly anyone, and on paper they do insure to make it sound like a perfect place to work for. This being said, it does depend on what store you find yourself placed at. Some are better than others. Said others can be a total nightmare.  If you're absolutely desperate, then go for it. But if you have other options, take them."
bad,Working at this Walmart is stressful your coworkers be against you when they should help you . The hiring manager doesn’t know how to talk to people . It’s a lot of stress related to this job the customers will drive you insane with requests sometimes and so do Managers they except you to do 2 days of work in one day .
bad,Reason I posted this is because there is zero room for advancement unless you spend time with upper management (that’s not job related)  it’s just the good ol boy system and people more deserving of management jobs are left out of the equation
bad,Overall working at Walmart has provided me with a lot of experience.  Working with and around many different people has helped with communication skills. Working as a department manager for 4 years has built my leadership skills.
bad,"Managers do not care about you in the slightest. Customers treat you horribly. Benefits are a scam to keep you working there, if you leave you get penalized It is your fault for choosing to work at Walmart."
bad,"Even if you don't want to advance in Walmart, you just want a job to help you pay your bills, Walmart takes care of messing that up for you. It is a toxic environment from management to other co-workers. Favoritism is all over and can get 12 to no hours a week if you irritate the wrong person,"
bad,Ridiculously Long Hours: Workload outweighs the time allotted to accomplish with quality. The hourly associates are the redeeming factor in the work place.
bad,Management needs to be fixed. The managers didn't care about the job security of the employees or the safety of the customers. expired food left on shelves for years. and when it was brought to the attention of management. I was fired. The worst company I have ever worked for. absolutely disgusting.
bad,"Terrible management, and had to constantly remind them what my availability was. I got scheduled days that I wasnt available and more hours than what i was available to work at the time."
bad,"Walmart recently changed the way that their management structure works and functions. Making it so that there is very little to no promise of advancement. Although I would argue that it is a great job for someone in high school. They also do not compensate your wage for prior knowledge and certifications. For instance, i previously had worked there for almost 2 years and was making almost 13 an hour, came back about 8 months after with forklift experience on top of all of my prior knowledge and was only making 11 an hour. I led to be very frustrating along with the fact that they changed their management structure so I had lost hope of moving up."
bad,I needed better pay I have work experience before I start working there sorry for what I was going to get more money than they offer I was actually making more money at mine first before I came here and I thought that sucked
bad,"i was hired as a automotive technician one of Walmart's ""specialized"" jobs which only paid .50 cents more than the base hourly pay buy was a easy interview only things asked about was my 2 previous jobs and why i left but then after that the hiring process was a world of stress and trouble first they closed there ""rec"" which they use to hire multiple people at one time to become employees so the solution would be to re apply but my account  which is attached to my social got blocked for a year in order to re apply and I've been waiting 4+ weeks on corporate help me and my HR with hiring me but during the mean time my manager was still making me work fully aware of the situation knowing that my tax info wasn't take nor where my personal identification in order to even work and knowing that i'll have to be payed under the counter and do my own taxes on my income and i have been told numerous times by my manager that i won't be in trouble neither will they and i don't stand nor should work under these conditions and i would love to report this indecent to there corporate office but i can't find a phone number or email i can contact for there HR department for there employees"
bad,Walmart is all about who you are and who you know they play favorites there’s never enough help on the front end which makes for a stressful work environment if you’re not getting yelled at by a customer management is barking orders at you it’s constant chaos just about everyday they are all about the almighty dollar
bad,"I have worked at 2 different locations here in GA, both had poor management teams. They don't keep the associate involved and excited about growth opportunities and at times have a lack of respect for the individual. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers you meet."
bad,"unethical, hippocritical company.  Managers encourage, and reward customers to complain, and lie.  They give and receive kickbacks to discriminate against certain people, they think are too honest, and try to hard to help, and satisfy people.  They wish to surround people with their friends, and inner circle who will backup whatever policy and treat or mistreat whoever they choose to help, or not help."
bad,Mgmt expects you do they work but when u ask for a promotion pass the tests and interviews they lie like they gotta interview more ppl then soon as you go to a different department they give the position to someone else mgmt uses profanity they ghetto they cook food at the store that they bring from home mgmt be stealing they be on they phones and they gossip more then they work actually they don't work they asks associates to do the work for them
bad,"No chance of promotion, raises, or even full time hours. Not a recommended choice for employment. No consistency on schedule even though I have open availability."
bad,"Very poor front end management and cashiers were constantly understaffed especially the busier the store was. CSMs constantly had to step in and open a register to help cashiers and then were being taken from their tasks at hand. Core schedule sucked and gave you inconsistent hours. Even as a full time worker, you couldn't touch a 40 hour work week."
bad,"Walmart was alright, though management often chose favorites and had a habit of dumping customers on an associate even if they were busy. There was much too drama and not enough fact, yet people whom didn't deserve to get in trouble did."
bad,"Chicken Noodle Soup whit a soda on the side is better than management."
bad,Great company just bad management when I worked there from 2013-2014. One manger didn’t know what the next manager was doing. I was hired for electronics and on my first day they told me I was being moved to meat department even though that was not the offer I had accepted.
bad,"Never work at Walmart they are not flexible with you at all, yes it’s 10.00 an hour but in reality your pay checks are small, I wasn’t happy there. They don’t show they care."
bad,I believe the hardest part of my job is having to work around the company’s schedule instead of my own . I just need a new job to make more money for my little girl .
bad,"Bad management, no teamwork whatsoever, there's no leadership, no direction. Management doesn't care about employees. Get a job there if there's no other choice"
bad,"Doit remplir un kotas de placer du stock , 7 pallettes de stock par shift. tout en répondant à la clientèle. Clentèle souvent irrespectueuses."
bad,"Not conducive if you have a family. No compassion or empathy or understanding among management. Hours given can vary regardless of what you need. You have to work with their schedule hours, no room for movement there."
bad,"I currently work there now.I am a associate and feel like that I am not appreciated.The assistant managers  downgrade, belittle and insult my intelligence as a person that has feelings.I have tried to explain to them how I feel about it but my words are worthless to them. I am very discouraged by their actions and attitudes."
bad,"You have to constantly ve working, up on your feet and cant sit. Very stressful and physical. Not flexible with hours at all even with a medical condition."
bad,"At my store the management was a joke, they were very unprofessional when talking to customers and employees alike. Schedules were always cut so no one had any hours unless you were one very good terms with your manager. There’s so much favoritism here it’s sad. They pretty much treat you like a slave until you either quit or get fired."
bad,"Not a very good job, management need some work , other employees got very rude at times. They would not give me the hours that were discussed , and always told me not to come in."
bad,I did learn to work more productively and became an expert in customer service at Walmart.  Other than that I prefer to remain silent about my experience at Walmart.
bad,"Te explotan mucho laboralmente (cajero) dejan que te humillen, cualquier falta de dinero te lo descuentan, si te sobra mejor para empresa y te tachan de que le robas al cliente ( aun asi sea por máximo 10 pesos)"
bad,"customer service is ok, They promote the ones who do not want to work, the most enjoyable time is the holidays being around people who you are close with and the customers who are your regulars."
bad,"The only plus side of working there was fellow co workers. Terrible management, and I don't mean just one manager. All of them were awful. Sit in the office all day and ignore everything going on around them. Each person is only a number, and they don't care about you whatsoever."
bad,"Being an Asset Protection Customer Host requires patience and a thick skin. You are the first person an incoming customer meets, so if anything in the store is perceived by the customer as unacceptable, it's your fault, and you become the complaint department. You are also the last person the customer sees when exiting, so when you're required to ask for receipts for items not bagged, you're harassing. There is a clique-ish culture with employees, unstable shift assignments, and limited advancement."
bad,"When I first got the job working for Walmart, I was ecstatically happy. Working for the biggest Retail Company in the world SOUNDED like an honor. Of course, over time, I knew that it wasn't easy but whatever got me to improve on my workplace skills, I'll take it."
bad,"Management was very mean to all the employee's. They never told you what to you need to improve, they just yell at you in front of other staff and customers."
bad,"Walmart is a good place to start if you're fresh out of high school or maybe just something to have during college, or just a job to retire to. If you work overnights, don't expect anything. It doesn't matter how hard you work, how much you exceed expectations, there's no chance of you ever moving up unless you're a favorite. There is a huge lack of communication between shifts, and management, and WAY too much drama. You work all the holidays with no holiday pay, walmart is constantly changing the way you do things, so there's really no point in getting used to one method of working, because they'll just change it in a month. Wouldn't really reccomend."
bad,"When you start they let you know that you are allowed x number of days that you can take off, but if you use those days they then try to fire you. Management is not good."
bad,"Check the back room/receiving for merchandise and restocked the item in the designated area in the store  and had a certain time frame to do so, it also had a 15 minute break and a 30 minute lunch which was okay"
bad,"Company really needs to go back to their old ways of taking care of their associates, but since the change they are more in it for themselves instead of the associates. I'm more disappointed with the company now than I was 15yrs ago."
bad,"Over the years Walmart has declined as a company that cares for its associates. They have taken most of the incentives to work away the management is awful and are constantly under pressure. It has become a stressful environment to work in. "
bad,Worked for this fast paced company for over 13 years and was promoted more than for times during my tenure there. Thought I was going to retire there but was one ofmi hundreds that were laid off due to restructuring. Met a lot of great people and life long friendships.
bad,"Its not as bad as people make it out to be, but the wages are low and the benefits arent really very good. Its better than not having a job, but its a place to work while you find a better job."
bad,"The hours for part time was 40hrs a week every week plus overtime often, but they rarely gave anyone full time. I never knew anyone to get full-time unless they were one of the many pointless managers."
bad,Trying to listen at too many people that call themselves bosses but don't like to listen and really take things under advisement. Doing a job then turn around and have to redo it.socializing with other associates.
bad,"The pay was the only good thing. But because they pay that much they don’t like to give that many hours. You may get hired full time but you won’t receive the hours. "
bad,"The managers are horrible and the gm is no better they have the nastiest attitudes,the cant control half their staff and the pay is so low especially for stocking"
bad,"Management doesn’t know what they’re doing. Ran out of bags quite often, never enough cashiers, they don’t fulfill their obligations, like they say they will. They don’t keep their word."
bad,Store is usually understaffed and workers poorly trained. Many workers that do poor jobs remain hired even after many many warnings of poor performance. Workers that do their tasks well are often tasked with helping finish the work of workers that don't do well. Often time each shift is left with remaining work from previous shifts and end up leaving work behind for next shift in a neverending cycle of being behind.
bad,"i enjoy what i do in the company but some of the management makes things stressful"
bad,"Our store is exceeding sales budget but only because the current store manager continiously hassasses his management staff. Rude and menn comments are made daily about them in front of store associates. He also sends hurtfull and demeaning text messages that are just nasty."
bad,"WalMart is stuck on being the largest retail company in the world.  In recent years they've completely lost whatever identity they had as they strive to stay competitive.  Momentum is keeping them moving along, but consistently overworking and under-preparing associates at all levels combined with nearly constant restructures and process changes has worn their workforce thin."
bad,"as a front end cashier, you come in and immediately get sent to a register, you have to fight to go to the bathroom when on a register, also breaks and lunches are almost always late, the csms are always rude, and have a super ego almost, you get an hour lunch which is nice and thats about the only thing that is nice. management doesn't care, they belittle you and act like you dont matter and are always sitting in the back on their phone. when i say this is one of the most awful places i've worked, i mean it. i do however miss my cashiers that i worked with, thats about it."
bad,"no advancement, work you to death you let them. Managment are either really good or terrible. customers are terrible and have no respect for you. Nobody really cares"
bad,"They ask you to do things that you are not supposed to do,and you don't get paid for doing them.like manager is supposed to do that but regular associate gets asked to do it."
bad,The more you learn the more work they make you do. A lot of the manegement has favorities. They look for any excuse to get you in trouble. Too much work little pay. Try not to work too long here the longer you work the more difficult is to find a better job.
bad,At Walmart we have 6 assistant store managers. Of those 6 only one of them are very chill and laid back. The rest are fighting with each other over who’s the bigger boss and has more control. They are never on the same page at all.
bad,It's  a good job just poor management. I worked 18 years for company and making $18.00 a hour and they decided to let me go do to getting older and moving a little slower.
bad,"Its fun to work if the management is on top of things, i had fun working for this company but the paid is not enough to support a family in this country."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend Walmart unless your looking for a first job,  a retired person kooking for a few hours, or upper management."
bad,Don’t do it to yourself. It’s cool for a while and then they start abusing you. The management is faulty and the hours are worse. Seniority means nothing and minorities have to work twice as hard to prove themselves
bad,"It's not worth the pay, they treat you badly, they pull you in different directions through out the store to benefit them. Poor management through out the store. Refuse to be fair if you don't work what they want you to you basically don't have a leg to stand on."
bad,"I worked for this company for three years, from August of 2016 up until very recently as of September 2019. I enjoyed the sense of routine and stability that it gave me, and always knowing what to expect regarding scheduling, job duties, etc. However, towards the end of my time there, I found that it was not a good fit for me and my personal needs in regards to having an enriched sense of advancement or appreciation. It didn't really feel like I could advance there due to physical and mental limitations that I personally have. I don't think they fully live up to the polices they give out in regards to accommodating to the needs of disabled people who would like to branch out and try something new. The communication felt very hypocritical."
bad,"Crabs in a bucket atmosphere. Nepotism runs everywhere in these establishments. Majority of managers are sleeping with subordinates while promising promotions. I've worked at six different Wal-Mart's over seven years due to promotions. Same culture everywhere."
bad,"After a year and 2 months there, I have seen Silvis Walmart slowly go down hill and it really heading that way currently. I would rather have a better working environment where I can use my brain power and knowledge."
bad,"This a very high pace stress place to work. You have to motivate yourself and keep your head up, new problems arise, but it gave me the experience I need to get to the next level."
bad,"The management at the store where I worked acted like they cared and respected you, but they don't. In fact, they upright lie to you and string you along."
bad,"Overall past few years the specific Company I worked at lost sight of what matters most to the company, it's associates. They used to have tons of programs that rewarded and appreciated the employees that came in to bust their hump for them on a daily basis. They got to the point where they actually started diminishing benefits and perks that once made for a strong and united workforce. They promote from within but, watch out if you happen to get promoted because it seems to me the managers are just a place to pin the blame for ANY issues in the building.  Upper management will take zero responsibility for any of the issues they or home office create and try to sidetrack any discussion of trying to fix any issues."
bad,the job is simple but hard and fast paced. management is quick to point fingers to shift blame off them selves. the company will work you till you drop if you let them. must self manage or develop health issues from stress and over work. constant fight with management to be treated fairly. KNOW their policies and use them even ones regarding management. they wont know them and violate them regularly. especially if you have to file a incident report or injury clams.
bad,"Started out great, soon realized how the company was ran and now I hate it. No care for the employees, always ask for more work out of you and never get anything in return. Managmnet sucks"
bad,"It was a good experience first working there, however, the longer I stayed with Walmart, the more disrespectful they started to become. They needed more workers there in order for that location to have better service."
bad,"The store could run more productively if all senior management were on the same page. More often than not, one job will have to done three to four times over since different managers have conflicting objectives."
bad,"-Overall average working environment"
bad,Management is my biggest complain. They are not helpful they are rude and expect so much out of there employees. Walmart employees should be paid more because of how much they do. No set schedule  and they don't consider how tired you are getting out late then going back in early next morning no set days off. And there constantly changing there policies.No holiday off except Xmas. day.
bad,Bust your tail off so everyone pretty much doesn't do much of anything to help you.forget asking for help also because they will look the other way.pay is terrible.
bad,Walmart is a pretty easy job to have. Most things are electronic which is nice. It was easy to access your schedule. It's a good first job or easy part time job for extra cash.
bad,"Working there was extremely stressful. Warehouse is not big enough for the amount of volume they ship out. Order fillers were very young, often their first job so their work ethic and quality of work suffered."
bad,"Wal-Mart all about walmart"
bad,"They're an ok company to work for. lower level employees & management communication could be better they, do not use most employees to the best of theyre abilities."
bad,"managers (mainly the guys) can be pretentious jerks. customers are often annoying. ive hated every day here, but the people I work with are super nice and easy to get along with"
bad,"I didn't like working for Walmart. "
bad,"Co workers are great. Management could be better. Communication skills are non existing. Unrealistic goals that are set in a short time. Kinda fast paced. Schedules are not flexible, if not in their standards you get no hours. Not the same company i signed up for years ago. Hard work for little pay"
bad,The management need improvement from the way they treat the employees under them to their own productivity and organization. They dont listen to employees on ideas and opinions of the employees underneath them from marketing managers to the assistant managers.
bad,"I worked cap 2 which was 2nd shift. I would start the day by doing the group meeting and then going to unload the truck which can be any where from 2400-5000 pieces to sort and place within the department that they belong to. the worst of it all they expect your truck team to get it done within 2hours. and you'll most likely have about 7people one throwing the truck one doing break packs which are boxes that have mix items that most likely go tot he HBA department. the other people are doing the food side, the chemicals, clothes, dog food, baby stuff and etc... every department we have to sort and put up on pallets to later be take to the floor and worked. and we never met that time limit of 2hours and we would get yelled at for it. and there would be no a/c in the back and it gets really hot real quick. after the truck you were given a department and you have to finish whatever you get from the truck and whatever if left over from the other side of the store."
bad,"the hard part was management was slow getting to costumer to help cashiers with a problem that they had to over ride, or benefits was not given to the ones that are their for long period of time."
bad,"Walmart does not care about any of their employees. They fire people after 8 months to avoid having to pay for insurance, or make the employees full-time employees. They extremely over work everyone. Managers are rated on how many people they can coerce into working extra hours without pay. Walmart is an evil corporation."
bad,I got good hours at Walmart but it was hard moving up. Management was absolutely horrible. It was hard moving up because they had favorites. You deal with rude people all day. Never again ! I became very depressed working in such a toxic environment.
bad,"Don’t work for Walmart if you have young children, may get sick or care to have an outside life. I was literally throwing up in front of my manager he said I’m sending you home and giving you a point. They don’t accept any type of mental health or doctors notes."
bad,Walmart was a great job to work for management needs more training in certain areas. They don't care for there employees or life situations. It's more about who you are friends with instead of work ethics
bad,i brought up a complaint to my boss and it was immediately brought to there attention that i complained about them via my name being said the boss was friends with her and after that tried to make work more stressful than necessary.certain assistant managers were again harder to work with about schedule changes.
bad,"Incompetent Managers, Super Understaffed. There are overnight workers that literally do nothing and daytime employees are responsible for all the stocking, zoning, and returns to keep the area clean. While we have customers roaming and misplacing items, we have to babysit the overnight workers that slack off and eat chips all night. Makes no sense, super easy job overnight. Go for it"
bad,They are very rude and could care less about anything about you. Just get the job done so they don't have to stay over and you don't get any overtime. Whether you have 2 trucks or one truck put everything thing up in the same amount of time or you get into trouble. They let any manager talk to you in any way they want whether in your department and know anything about you or not. A lot of bullying from the gay people to others. One person can do one thing that another person can not. The office people are awful.
bad,was not given a promised raise in income. the management couldn't care less about the employee. the attendance policy was a joke. if you did not call in a full hour before your shift you would be given a penalty strike. after three strikes you're gone.
bad,"When you apply to be a Cap 2 Associate it's basically you, and your coworkers, being ridiculed for not doing every job in the store at once. When I worked there I would usually throw the truck for about two and a half hour to four hours only getting a break when the truck is finished being unloaded and sorted. Afterwards, you either go to your assigned aisle to stock, or go to lunch. The lunch period is an hour which very lenient given all the other circumstances. This Walmart in particular is a Supercenter which means that the store has a higher standard to set than other Walmart stores. This does contribute to the high-pace, stressful, and on some days, almost impossible workload for the amount of workers on the Cap team. Management does attempt to assist in said workload from time to time however it is extremely seldom. The stocking in itself is very simplistic since, if you are just starting out, you are paired with someone who has been working for an extended period of time or someone who is quick at stocking. Thankfully, your coworkers will be the best part of the job since most non-management are very entertaining to work with. Finally, the work schedule is quite strange since, even if you request a set schedule you will most likely have to check everyday to see if yours has changed. Unfortunately, several people were fired because of the said mishap. Most of the problems with the store come with the lack of communication that seemed quite unusual since you will be given a set of tasks each day. Overall, the job is extremely hectic and taxing if there is no talking between"
bad,"For retail, Walmart pays pretty good. They also give 1 hour lunches, which can be a benefit to some people. Other than those benefits, this job can wear you down. "
bad,"It was a decent job, but poor management caused disruption with hourly associate relationships. Compensation was not fair to those associates who had been with the company longer than those who were new which caused major issues between management and employees."
bad,Management talks to the employees like children.  Your hours are cut before bonuses are received on your paycheck. I have learned that you can't make customers or people happy. I enjoy conversations with co-workers and having fun at work.  The workday can be slow at times to the point that you want to go home. If you are a cashier at the front end stay busy zoning so the Customer Service Manager will not say something to that you are not working.
bad,"Never recieved hrs promised, had to delibereatley work on holidays, mgmt  -some were helpful others did not help at all.Some mgrs were truthful others were not. never got fulltime hrs or benefits."
bad,"I would not recommend this job - it was stressful because the hours did not.allow for much of a work life balance. Also, you are clearly just a number to them. They regularly get rid of positions that are needed and then chastise their remaining overworked employees for not being fast enough or efficient enough. The customers are very rude and ugly most of the time. "
bad,"Complete lack of management. Employees are expected to be able to function on the first day. Training is a joke. If you have not job history the this is a good for to break into retail, but otherwise I wouldnt recommend."
bad,They can treat their employees better listen to what they have to say just don’t push them away when they need help or asking a question. The management need a little bit of help
bad,"The company has no loyalty to the associates. As said by many managers, ""There's always someone looking to do your job."" This is the job  for a high school graduate to take in between high school and college."
bad,"Well I can't say that everything sucks at Walmart. Some of the managers are good people. But it's usually the good people that leave or get fired, and we get stuck with the really bad management. We have this one manager that is so bad that any time he finds a way to get back on day shift, he gets booted right back to night shift. Day shift can't deal with him. So they decide to let us deal with him. We have been told time and time again ""he should be going back to days in about a month."" It never happens..."
bad,"Had a coworker commit suicide a little under two years ago. You can't go a day without someone mentioning wanting to die, and just the other day a coworker mentioned that they were excited to go to a funeral, because it meant that they didn't have to go to work."
bad,If your a good worker they will use you for way more than your supposed to do.  If your not a good worker you just slide by while others do your work for you. Then they combine jobs and you take something for less pay when they pick their favorites not the best qualified for the jobs
bad,"The job entailed more physical labor, but the employers did not understand when you were scheduled or not and called on random dates and claimed you were supposed to work. Bad work environment in general."
bad,"Walmart managers have no idea what they are doing. They send you on breaks too early or too late which ends up sending you back to back for some breaks. They have no benefits for part time anymore. They don’t do paid time off for part time anymore. You can’t exceed 4 points, so if you have a family emergency and can’t trade away your shift, they fire you. However, management cares nothing about your legit reason for not being able to come to work, but will take other employees points off that they recieved for being late due to oversleeping."
bad,I had a really bad car accident when I was working there.HR was very understanding and willing to work with me.The associate manager when to HR and told them she didn't want me there if I couldn't do full duty.They told her I could stay she was mad and I worked 3 days and on the third day the night manager told me I was a liability and she said I had to leave.I was very upset but I said om.
bad,"Managers are fine. CSM is terrible sometimes. Customers can be really rude. Need to be fast at all times. Will yell at you for stupid reasons, even if you aren't doing something. You can't ring up family members nor boyfriend/girlfriend. They will fire you for stupid stuff as well."
bad,never want to work with your schedule even when you have children and other responsibilities.  put you on for hours youre not even available and are RUDE when it comes to needing time off because youre in the hospital or your kids are
bad,"really just not a great place to work, they don't pay well. corporate is filled with greedy, narcissistic parasites that don't care about anyone beneath them at all"
bad,At Walmart the work and the job is easy the only problem is the hard worker have to do all the work while other don’t .  Management  Doesn’t know what they are doing and this is not all Walmart just the one I worked at
bad,Insane customers. No job security bad pay a company that makes billions but can’t pay employees a livable wage. Do not care about work life balance all of the 20 year employees get whatever schedule they want
bad,I liked my coworkers and the job itself. Didn't feel as though advancing was fair. I took the managament test and passed but no matter what position came available I wasn't even given a interview to prove my worth. I would have loved to move up but felt that was just wishful thinking.
bad,"You're expected to complete a job without the proper tools or training, then held accountable for not being taught or having access. Management doesn't have the answers to simple question. No communication."
bad,"Walmart is a Gigantic pile of dung."
bad,"To much favoritism shown others. Too many lies and gossip spreaded, by co-workers, managers believe what they say, without doing investigation or even not willing to pull tapes to review activities."
bad,"Don't expect to be appreciated with Walmart. Dedication and loyalty provides no job security with this company. Mid-level management changes are frequent (every 1-2 years) and new District Managers come and go, making drastic changes along the way in an attempt to maximize their own bonus. This pattern of greed seems to trickle down from upper-level management which gives incentive to managers for pressuring people to quit and cutting hours so they can absorb more bonus for themselves. Walmart only strives to squeeze out profit, maximize bonuses for managers, maximize employee turnover to keep pay and PTO payout to a minimum among other corporate tactics. Walmart DOES NOT INVEST in building a better company. Strategies used by management include involuntary hour cuts, reducing shift hours, minimizing staff, setting unrealistic ""expectations,"" and manipulating business and scheduling metrics as a weapon to discipline non-managers. Customers come to Walmart looking for the cheapest out of pocket costs so don't expect a great level of class or respect from them, even towards healthcare professionals like Pharmacists."
bad,"At first I was excited to work at the distribution center, but they only care about themselves and not the associates. The management is not all that great either. They say “We are a team” but you are nothing but a number in their eyes to get their work done."
bad,"Bad Management, bad polices for working, benefits get worse every year. the discount you get is garbage. if you need a job and want to work there stay no more then five years at the most."
bad,"Management is not on the same page, lack of communication between all managers and associates, frequently changes work schedules without consulting associate, does not hold people accountable, managers do not treat all associates fairly across the board, some managers show no respect for the associates, managers don't like it if you call off because you are sick or have an emergency, managers only concerned with the numbers at the end of the day. No uniformed organization, changes occur frequently and without everyone knowing of the changes. Managers have scolded associates out on salesfloor, in front of co-workers and customers. Must be a strong person to work there and be able to stand up for yourself when needed and hold the managers accountable when they treat you badly."
bad,Displaced (laid off) after 24 years of loyal service.  Service and performance are not valued if a cheaper option is available.  In my case my full-time salaried position was replaced by two part-time hourly pharmacists.
bad,The mangers are rude. Don't help when you need there help they fire you for no reason. They make you work doubles if someone doesn't show up. The go away from company values
bad,"if you’re just looking for a JOB with hours that come and go are not stable, this is the place for you. If you’re looking for a career, a place for advancement, or just an employee that cares about their workers then THIS ISNT THE PLACE FOR YOU"
bad,Fast work and different type of jobs on a daily basis. Performing varies tops of skills for the company and providing great customer service and greeting customers.
bad,Walmart has a lot of traffic and being a cashier you touch everything that a person may need. Also you have to have a great attitude to deal with so many different types of people.
bad,"Honestly, while the pay is decent and hours are flexible there aren't a lot if benefits and its not a unionized job- on top of that depending on your position it can be emotionally and physically taxing with little to no reperations. Its fine for a seasonal gig but I'd advise against long term."
bad,The pay is great but the managers are horrible and they have this point system that doesn't even care if you are sick or been in an accident. If you get over 3 or 4 points you are fired. When you are at work all they do is gossip and spread rumors and you may end up fighting because of it.
bad,walmart plays favorites and promotes its kiss ups to jobs they can’t handle. The unethical things I witnessed as training coordinator were shocking. The store managers would throw their mommas in front of a bus to cover their butts. I made it 5 years before I quit. You’ll have to sell your soul to the devil to stay there any longer
bad,"Rules and policies jobs all would change like overnight, stressful to say the least. Management was never on the same page.  It's like management never had your back on different things worried about their own jobs and would do anything to keep them and our bonuses were nothing but the managers make sure they got theirs"
bad,"I hated Walmart the managers where mean and hateful, and unfair all the sis was complain, short checks not getting your hours. Over worked underpaid.  I hated Walmart would never work there again"
bad,"the job would be better if the management would have better respect for our associates better staffed, less pressure on work ethics. need more cashiers less self check outs."
bad,"When I was working with my peers I was some what happy. The main thing is that it was hard to clean the restrooms. I would say that I had to stop the toilets from over flowing meanwhile I was trying to get the customers  "
bad,"Walmart offers a great opportunity to people willing to work 60-70 hours a week. As an assistant manager there is peer pressure to work through lunches and 10 hour days are the minimum-most Asms work longer and the expectation is more that of a 60-70 hour week. If you care about your actual life outside of work you are shut out of the clique. If you have a family emergency or health emergency don't expect anything except passive aggressive guilt tactics if you need to call out. While the training is excellent, and the company's directive sounds good in theory, it isn't followed in person. I love working with people and training associates but the company has a motto, ""coach them out."" At least at the store I'm working at,they seem more concerned about getting rid of people than training them to excel. I've worked in other retail environments and I've never seen such a lack of empathy or professionalism towards others."
bad,"Walmart will drain you. The work isn’t hard and the pay is fine but the atmosphere is terrible. Everyone wants to leave no one wants to work and there’s barely anything to do sometimes, the way people talk to you if you’re an associate is ridiculous and the managers don’t care about your life even if they fake it. The feeling of working there is just unhappy. It’s depressing don’t do it."
bad,"They are telling us we have to do 2 cases of product stocking per minute including date checking and pulling old product to the front. They don't care about the older employees at all. Several members are senior citizens and they were told to their faces "" we don't care that you have slowed down, we want these times met!"". They threatening employees with job loss constantly."
bad,"Coworkers were positive and helpful, management made speaking to them about issues stressful. Anything to do with restocking our supplies was brushed off and we were constantly out of things we needed which made it to where we were blamed for the state of things. two managers were the issue, played favoritism too much they had favorites and treats everyone else badly. Walmart is a good place to start but the point system in the end hurts people."
bad,"As a cashier at Eastland Tx WalMart scheduling makes no sense. You have to schedule your life at least 3 weeks in advanced and that is not a guarantee.  Forget having family emergencies, Sick children, family functions. "
bad,I would  never my friend or family to work for this company they keep changing the rules to the bad if you been there 0to2yrs you don't get pto time it's just a bad company to work for
bad,"Its a good first job if you like being taken advantage of which for the younger guys it builds work experience. But for any person trying to live or raise a family, this place is not right for you."
bad,"I've been there a few months & at first, I LOVED my job. You get breaks (or a lunch) every two hours, which is super helpful considering how stressful it can get in the front. Management above CSMs (customer service managers) is atrocious. The store manager is not helpful. Don't bother going to personnel if you need accommodations - you get shuffled off to a third party who doesn't keep you informed. You get 5 occurrences for every 6 months, but they don't all clear at once, each occurrence clears 6 months after it happened. Doctor's notes aren't accepted as an excuse to miss work so you will get an occurrence. Honestly, management is worse than the actual customers, and that says something in retail. I have never worked for a company so neglectful of their employees' health. The only way occurrences get excused is if you have PPTO, which you don't start building until your 90th day. Basically, if you have any chronic health conditions, don't work here. If you need time off, don't work here. If you want more than 20 hours per week, expect to have fully open availability. And also expect your late shifts to be followed by a shift at the crack of dawn the following day. I was not compensated enough to stay here."
bad,It's a decent place to work other than they are on a point system for attendance. It can be fun but can also be stressful sometimes especially around the holidays
bad,"I worked at Walmart for two years and four months. I was here while in college and the way it was run wasn't proper. Walmart has CSMs ( customer service managers) and they would have to be at the service desk, by the registers, by the online pick up and in any other departments that needed something to have an override. It was to much work for one person to do. They should have had a CSM for each area."
bad,"It's walmart, its what you should expect. It helps pay the bills but unless can be a pain. Customers expect certain things that you can't do because of policy and managers who don't know your department are quick to judgement."
bad,"$13 an hour was nice but getting paid the least out of the other teams when our team did the most vs other teams barely doing anything is unacceptable, management is extremely bad, never on the same page with doing certain things or having priorities in things we didn't need to get done, not to mentioned being threatened of losing job because things aren't getting done"
bad,Might as well never take a break here. Once a CSM tells you your break is about to start they count your line of customers too. It's ridiculous. They overschedule college students but hire them with the guize of being accommodating.
bad,The rest of the management is a little iffy about carrying on the responsibilities of their roles and taking safety seriously and will also sometimes give me false information about my safety concerns and also there seems to be an alliance if you're not in the circle you will get left behind gotten and cut on hours to make you want to quit
bad,"No training recieved. You're thrown into it. If you do not already know what you're doing, you're going to get lost."
bad,There is no concern for employees wellbeing. Stress company over family. Make empty promises and promote only whomever they want. Management pretends to care about your concerns but never do anything about them.
bad,"Working at Wal-Mart Distribution center helped me to gain inside understanding of an overwhelming, low compensation employment. Pay was not enough to cover living expenses, and work was overwhelming to the extent of harming the body physically."
bad,Bad Management Staff was always sneaking off to smoke or whatever leaving the good employees like myself to do all the work. Very little encouragement or appreciation.
bad,I worked for Walmart for 14 years. I made the work worthwhile only because of my dedication and positive attitude. Walmart culture strives to berate and beat down the hard working employees and ignore their concerns about the lack of consistency in holding everyone to the same standards. In the end I had many instances of unprofessional interactions with my upper management. I chose to leave because my concerns for a balanced workload between shifts was not taken into account. I also was compensated poorly as I had received .30 as a raise for a period of 3 years. It was ridiculous.
bad,You have Managers that don’t know what the want to do. They don’t want to give you hours when you need certain days. Not that many cashiers. A lot of upset customers.
bad,I thought I was going to be miserable for the rest of my life working with them. Good luck trying to get any promotion at the pace they're going. Luckily I found an affordable coding bootcamp that I would much rather take that risk than be guaranteed to be miserable.
bad,To work really hard for a company to gain a position of management and when they pretty much tell you that you are too understanding and should step down or face possible termination otherwise  and then when you feel almost forced to step down and because a little loophole allows them to not only take your promotion rate but extra % earned prior to promotion that's Walmart n more
bad,"If you are 1 minutes late from lunch, paidbreak, you get written up. Don't  call off work. Have to be in early and start 5 mins before actual time. Or get a punctual hit on your record. Walmart is very controlling."
bad,I enjoyed working for Walmart but overall thru the years I feel the store morale has gone down quite a bit. They have also started to eliminate alot of positions company wide.
bad,The people here are in groups...when I say this they have there favorites it's almost like a high school scene!! If you hired it's just best for you to do it work and go home!! You have to learn things on your own because you ask how to do something it's like no one wants to help you and the people that do try and help are not on the same shift as you
bad,"This is not a place to work if you are looking for security, and looking to advance. If they hold the slightest grudge against you for any reason you are not going to get anywhere fast and will look for ways to get you to quit."
bad,Management was bad my department was awful. It wasn't just mine I can say that out of all the managment/ department managers only 2 people actually hear you out. You can work hard and everything but at the end of day the dont care because you're making the department managers look good to the boss
bad,"Walmart felt great when I started. It was my first job, and I stayed for about a year. You learn basic customer service skills, register software, etc, but the only one pushing you to go above and beyond is yourself, and it is seldom, if ever, rewarded or even recognized in any way by higher management. The benefit is every other job you have afterwards will feel wildly easy."
bad,"This was a good place to work when I started, but after about six months I saw that people who had worked there for 10 12 years  had their hours cut and quit working there   because  not enough hrs to make it worthwhile to  be there.  A lot of people either quit or had to go to a different Dept. and/or shift change. (like days to graveyard)  Not good for family life."
bad,el tipo de persona que labora como supervisores no tienen la capacidad para sacar su trabajo asi como los gerentes ni sub gerentes
bad,"Was a wonderful place to work for the first 6 or 7 years that I was there. The last few were not. At the store where I was employed, you had to be part of the ""clique"" to go forward. The most enjoyable part was the customers I interacted with They were supportive and interesting and really appreciated my working with them."
bad,"My department manager was really not understanding and as much as she said she was following the company rules and bs like that but if you work for a company for 9 years you can explain your act of kindness to a worker with a disability and who was hurt while on the clock for not being able to come a few days, because it is my right to have a little bit of wiggle room when I bring in a doctors note."
bad,"Tried hard to keep up this job. Got threatened, harassment,  by the manager. Was not getting enough hours , was covering in anothere walmart but was called and threatened not to work there. Got a suggestion to change place if there is no respect or value by the management."
bad,"Management very shady and retaliation is rampant even though they say it against their policies. Do not trust anyone there. Their work/life balance claim is a joke. No respect for employees. They look for ways to get rid of higher paid,older employees."
bad,"If you are looking for a stable continuing job, then it is great besides the continuous cleaning, dealing with managers and customers. But as a student your legit living a double life; you are not able to balance it out because they expect the younger you are the more work they can force you to do because the full time people just get to slack for being older. As a student I had to deal with calls about coming in when I am never free because of school and having to contact managers when they would reject my days off for my tests,exams and assignments that are due. If your student do not work here it is not worth the physical and mental pain that they give you."
bad,Too many chiefs and not enough Indians which causes over- stressed and under- staffed work days. Mental abuse/ discrimination making you feel unworthy of being alive.  Staff will throw you under the bus for their gain
bad,Not tge highest paying job nore any real benifits from working here. Night shift blames day shift for everything and vice versa. No real chance for advancements and they have an open door policy that they don't follow at all. Never order enough of whats on sale. Management doesn't know what's going on but if you just want a pay cheque then it's an ok place.
bad,Management needs to be more involved and care and be willing to understand associates and there needs and be more open minded alot of work with no appreciation
bad,It has to much favoristim.Co workers don't want to do their job .Pay rate would be fair if u could get above 20 -30  hours a week.The customers are great.Does not follow your true availibity. Paid time off is a joke.You will be part time employee for over a 1 plus and still counting.You cannot receive health benefits unless  you get at least 30 hrs a week.My suggestion  look somewhere else.
bad,"The department manager was rude and always blaming someone else for her job not being done. Accusing me of not doing my job. It got so bad that I was taking before and after pictures of the area I worked in to show her I was doing my job correctly. I was only scheduled for 4 hours a few days a week. Other employees were always doing different things everyday in a rotation, but I was always having to clean up behind them every day. It was difficult to do my job well and keep up with everyone else's mess."
bad,The management at Wal-Mart sucks right now and they have favoritism and double standards but overall not bad to work at. U can work fixed days but if u do they cut your hrs.
bad,I work OGP at walmart most know it as pickup i pick groceries the management at my store 4407 is very poor and they have their picks and chooses. The pay is good.
bad,"Working here had its okay moments but CERTAINLY had its bad moments. Management was poor. People who won employee of the month were the usual favorites from the electronic section. If you think you can get employee of the month as cap 2, you have another thing coming. Cap 2 is easily the worst position to work for. Everybody is treated like dirt in cap 2. Don't do it."
bad,I gave my all everyday to this company. I highly enjoyed each day interacting with the customers and bringing smiles to their faces. I provided exceptional customer service and gave my best everyday to strive for excellence.
bad,"I was working for Walmart as a regular associate in garden center and cashier for the paid was not good enough that’s me Walmart have to go back start training there associate,s the old fashion way because you gotta help the coustomers the best that you can and gotta have the knowledge how to help him or her as for the only way I would go back is as store manager you welcome the customers like if it was home"
bad,"A typical workday would usually include a meeting at the beginning of each shift, we would then proceed to start work and 2-3 pallets would be given as an assigned work amount (NHM Workers). I learned a lot of thing during my time with the company, I learned how to make a baile, use the MC40& 70, I learned how to scan outs, and learned a lot about inventory. Some people from management are really abusive and others are really trying to help. The workplace culture that is brought to Walmart is one of the worst things about the company, the goals set by corporate are unrealistic and have caused a lot of people to hurt themselves and to feel trapped another thing that also was a pain was the fact that they make you do things that do not fit your job description, for example, there is no maintenance and you happen to be near the bathrooms and you get called to clean them or sometimes the managers have you do their assigned work because they ""have other things to attend to"" the hardest part about the jobs is that you have to do a minimum of 40 boxes every 30 minutes while also assisting multiple customers at the same time. when I had started working here I found it very enjoyable but the only thing I did like about this job was the hours and that I did manage to make some good friends along the way."
bad,some managers & people are not very happy & friendly. they give unnecessary attitude to employees for no reason. they aren’t very understanding about family situations & life getting in the way. some managers & employers are amazing & well rounded individuals.
bad,"Pros-the ppl you work with"
bad,"Walmart acts on the logic that its entry positions are stepping stones for a wider career, and uses that as an excuse to act without regard for the actual employees. Job security is purely based on whether managers like you. Pay is low and not regulated across employees. Work hours are sporadic and nearly random; on several occasions I have needed to get managers to modify my hours to work at all on certain weeks."
bad,During orientation I was led to believe employee care was important.Flexable schedule Not true. fellow co-workers specifically a culture of Somalianshadn't were treated differently it would take two people to Somalians to do the work of one white person they would take a necessary brakes there in the break room praying on our time getting paid they also are in 10 minutes before the it's time to punch out in the lunchroom and waiting for the time clock
bad,This company is alright to begin with but as you continue to work there you feel like your in high school all over again. Most of the people you work with are pretty good and make work a lot more enjoyable but there are to many chains of management and its very confusing. Other than the people and management it is a good place to work most job tasks are simple and easy to follow.
bad,"Walmart is a wonderful place when u first start wrking there but after the managers start changing and different people come and don't  kno how to run tht area, everything goes up in smoke ."
bad,"Would not recommend unless desperate, and can deal with bad managers. Managers don't care about you. I learned to think for myself, to avoid being written for asking what to do each day."
bad,"The always lots of learning new skills, do you best ."
bad,The actual job itself was good. The company policies and the childishness of the people I worked with was terrible. I was penalized by having hours lessened for speaking up against a manager in a different department that was not accurately doing their job.
bad,"flexible hours and big staff"
bad,"Management is awful. They lie constantly, ignore ""company policy"" and do things the way they want it done. Problems do not get solved when they are brought up and you're basically told to deal with it."
bad,"Walmart is a good place to work a little fast pace and a little busy...  People are nice and most are quit helpful,  they are usually well rounded in stocking there store."
bad,In order to advance it’s all about who you know it’s not your worth ethic’s If you need a job it’s a great place to start. It’s a lot of work they will work you in many different departments same pay
bad,"Basic job, not very fulfilling. Customers are very rude and aggressive which has given me very strong people skills."
bad,"After 6 years working for the company I learned one thing, they DO NOT care about its associates or whats right versus whats wrong. As long as their agenda is met, they could care less about its associates. Everyone is expendable and I didn't know it was as bad as it was. Management at Walmart is the biggest joke, as they are never held accountable for the things they ask of us."
bad,"Horrible, inexperienced managers hired/promoted by their ""friends"" there so it seems.  I don't know for sure but the #1 complaint among my many coworkers is how poorly managed the store.  You know, that's the #1 complaint from customers too!!!  It's not a bad job, it's not hard, but they're so many minor irritations it wears on you.  Can you say ""lazy, immature petty coworkers""?  Of course that's not all the workers, some are quite nice, but they hire some mind numbing lazy and ignorant people.  Phewww.  The store is soooooo unkempt it's embarrassing really.  Coworkers using profanity loudly around families and children on the sales floor.  I'm no prude.  Believe me, far from it, but there's a time and a place for that and being around my coworkers that do it is embarrassing too.  They give you almost ZERO training.  They send you off with a coworker who basically does not care at all about training you.  Maybe they're not that great and you don't want to model yourself after them anyway, it's hard to know when you first start there.  Managers often aloof doing other things and don't supervise much.  Well, the cat's away, the mice will play.  Almost no one there takes the job seriously.  Not much team work, people out for themselves, shaving time off breaks, etc.  If you have questions about things because well, they don't train you, you have to ask your coworkers and 9/10 do not care at all about taking the time to show you or explain to you.  I've never worked somewhere where coworkers get so bent out of shape about things you're ""supposed to know"" that NO ONE TELLS YOU. "
bad,Politics. Politics. Politics. Got to suck up to bosses to get anywhere. Managers are managers because they are willing to be beat down and abused. You have to give up your soul to be favored with raises or advancement.
bad,"If it ain’t broke why try to fix it? It seems as if the corporate office is only trying to make life more difficult than it needs to be. Frustrating that those things that are working well are changed by management.  Equipment needed for the job is sorely lacking. I feel for the managers, whatever they are paid isn’t enough. "
bad,Honestly this job sucked the day I started I found it very depressing and draining for me I hated it the managers don't care about your life nor your mishaps either be there or be replaced SIMPLE.
bad,"The job itself is not too bad, but Management in Hickory is absolutely awful the cap 2, 2-11 supervisor is horrible, there is constant drama, and even if you stay out of it people try putting you in the middle of everything."
bad,"Working in the Safety field at Walmart is only beneficial to those that are single or married w/out children or their children are out of the house. Managers are expected to go beyond their pay grade in duties/responsibilities. I do not recommend a managerial job for anyone who is not set in life yet already, not the place for a starter family."
bad,"The job itself was okay, but the other employees and customers just ruined it. I don't know if this is just the store I was at or not but everyone was so hateful and rude."
bad,Slow workers horriable management  and favoritism nothing is ever constant same people have to do everything while others do nothing just not a good work place
bad,"Última opção para buscar uma colocação , sem estrutura , ineficiência total nas decisões administrativas."
bad,"Working at Walmart is what you make it. I like what I do there. I just don't care for the management. Way too many mangers and different managing styles. You are hired to work in one department but once you start working, management steps in and demands you do way more because lack of employees."
bad,"Walmart gives flexible schedules, but their communication skills are poor. Management is horrible and lack interacting with their associates. I would not recommend anyone to work here, unless there is no other option."
bad,"For starters, When I was hired, I was under the impression that I was hired for the overnight shift. Three weeks into my employment, I found out that they had hired me for days."
bad,As with any large company you feel like a number more than a person. As long as you can keep focused on the task at hand you should make it through the day without any problems(including a pat on the back for a good days work)
bad,"They stack on loads of work, with not enough help. Cost of living is more then you make. Small room for advancement. Managers dont have time to help.."
bad,I enjoy the people I work with and I do for the most part enjoy the job. Its the management that makes things difficult.  The home office has no idea what goes on in most stores and just adds new rules every couple of weeks just to mess with us.
bad,"- Constantly trying to stock everything when manager or other associates do anything"
bad,You have to do the work or 3-4 people or else management will find a reason to get rid of you. The work itself is fine but the management isn't understanding.
bad,Other co-workers on the same level and CSMs are great. Middle management doesn't care about underlings. Sexual harassment cases aren't taken seriously
bad,Manager kept changing  my hours....co workers were great... everyone would complain in lunch room on how there schedules were change day by day you never knew your hours ....I would come to work then told I wasn't on that day....my schedule  would say I worked 2pm to 9..pm..then I was told I was on to 11pm....this  happened all the time.....just got tired of this...
bad,"I’ve been at Walmart for a little over a year, the company itself is okay, but my store is so terrible. Horrible management, lazy workers, horrific hours/benefits. We constantly get treated like garbage by customers and management. They fire the good, hard workers and promote the lazy ones. It’s honestly just bad overall."
bad,"The short time I worked in the produce department, there was no department manager and the assistant manager was off and on again on leave. Luckily, I had plenty of  previous experience working in both produce and inventorying damage, because I was pretty much on my own while working evenings."
bad,The past couple months we have had a mass exodus. Every single manager has left the company. Ideally Walmart has great intentions but upper management DOES NOT support or acknowledge hard work.
bad,"Greedy company that pays the minimum and every year, everyone gets the same $0.24 raise! The hard workers make the same as the lazy ones and the store manager only cares about herself, not the employees."
bad,Poorly structured upper management. Nobody knew the policies or protocol of auto care center. My asst. Manager transferred from housewares to auto care center and did not have a clue. She was constantly working different shifts in other  departments to gain favor of store manager. Store manager been there 35 years just skating by till he retires. He was constantly seen in the parking lot taking naps during the day. Always seemed glassy eyed due to drinking or being hung over.
bad,Some people were lazy and since I was new they basically wanted me to do their work for them. Which at first I didn't notice until I realized they weren't really doing anything
bad,Basically all the machinery was broken or down majority of the time. The csm’s never wanted to walk to give us our change and the pumps hardly wanted to accept cards of any kind.
bad,"The work is definitely for the athletically inclined. Constantly moving for 12 hrs definitely got tiring and at the end of your work week you will feel it all over. I am not very Athletically inclined and by the end of the work week, I couldn’t get out of bed, my feet hurt more than anything."
bad,managers are on top of you and you have a point system for your attendance and if you call the manegers direct to let them know your going to be late or out they dont help you out. you have to call the call out line
bad,Management and company does not care about you at all.  Lots of busy work.  Make you responsible for several departments at once. Hardly anyone on the floor to assist customers!
bad,"Lower management is wonderful, but upper management is difficult to work with, and constantly changing to boot. It's stressful and competitive for no reason as well, and the only things that kept me sane when I worked here were my immediate managers and close coworkers."
bad,I liked working there but they didn't care about the employees. They would push you to work then when you get sick or hurt. They act like you are to blame and they will warn you of your attendance constantly. They don't accept doctor's excuses even for worker's compensation case.
bad,they would never listen to me like i was an adult. i asked for full time multiple times. because my grandma is sick and i need to pay for her. they told me i could. but then just refused when i asked when. they treated me like i was an idiot. they would never listen to my availability. i was being harassed and bullied i went to management. and nothing got done about it. the associates were completely rude. i was a hard worker. i would come in when they needed me. but i hot nothing in return.
bad,"You get accosted for calling in sick. They expect you to do your job and someone else's job and when your job isnt finished you get yelled at. If you are not full time and dont work in a position with a fixed schedule your schedule will be all over the place, sometimes working 3 hours one day and only getting 29 hours a week."
bad,Some days it's amazing and you're making lots of cash Then the next they don't work you for 2 weeks.Then when you ask for more days they give you 14 hour work days for 7 days a week.
bad,"Walmart isn't at all the dream job we all wanted in our younger days. They toy with your hours regardless if you are labeled full or part time. Hours always seem to get cut around bonus time resulting in checks that just look normal even with the bonus included. Management thrives on threatening and mistreating the hard working employees and babying the slackers, while slacking themselves"
bad,"While this is nothing compared to the military, they definitely seem to incorporate some tactics used during boot camp in all levels of employment. If you have the right mind set you can make it far in this company, but be prepared for no family time. Depending on your work area and management team it can be a fun place, but only in short increments. Keep a positive attitude, as difficult as it may be, and you will be ok."
bad,"Too many managers not enough employees wanting to do their job.  I was great ful for the phone operating skills I learned. Unfortunately I would not refer a friend "
bad,"Once a good to work for, Walmart in the last 5 years has shifted it attention away from ensuring the happiness of it's work culture to a penny counting miser willing to cut jobs and benefits just to meet a bottom line."
bad,"I never understood what it meant to not want to work due to management, but after my experience at Walmart I do. The expectations of some associates versus others is ridiculous. The fellow associates are typically rude and unmotivated. I'm sure it would be a great job for anyone intending on spending a career here, and not for an aspiring soon to be college graduate."
bad,My managers couldn't care less about you as a person.  Wal-Mart is not understanding of the fact that people are only human and at times can't be at work.
bad,"Dystopian work ethics of most retail stores, Walmart comes out it the worst of it. In my time working for them, I worked several departments as a Stocker. The requirements to stay top paced was realizing that corners had to be cut to make quota."
bad,New associates are brought in with very little training which makes it a stressful environment. Also new processes are delivered to the store but no teaching or training
bad,Some of the managers were willing to assist others were rude and not respectful. I would have enjoyed working at the establishment if there was a different team leading us to be more successful.
bad,I started as a cashier and worked my way up to customer service manager. I even helped open my stores own stand alone liquor store. Funny thing that I was promoted to customer service manager in june of 2018 and never given the training for how to be a customer service manager or csm. Holidays were very crazy. Upper management keep rotating front end managera every 3-5 months so the rules always changed. By the end of the holiday season upper management basically told me that they believed I was not a good fit for the position. I was told to either drop back down to a regular cashier or be fired. I decided to quit because I felt dropping down was a slap in the face. The other thing I did not lile was that management was always putting blame on me for things that were out of my control. Upper management wanted me to be in 10 places at one time.
bad,"Taxes: W2s were dumped on a table in the break room. Many of us were not told this, and just walked in to find our sensitive information laying there for anyone to grab after god knows how many hours."
bad,"I was on 2nd shift stocking and the amount of work we have to do is ridiculous. For example: Unload truck, stock everything from the truck, pick up the slack from other positions, clean-up. If you apply for stocking, they will make you do cashiering sometimes. There is no advancement in the company and management has the most illogical thinking. Bad benefits since they keep taking more away from you the more you work there. Can't use paid time off since they reject every request. Full-time employees don't get full-time employment benefits."
bad,My experience working for Walmart wasn’t that great. I didn’t agree with management or the pay. The environment wasn’t that great as well because it is on ASU campus.
bad,"management was not there as much as needed , very poor knowledge  from some of the upper management from some things you needed answer. to hot to work there. no room to grow at all. pay was good if you could get atleast 32 hours a week ."
bad,"Not much room for advancement. They will train you to know the entire store without the pay compensation. Schedule fluctuates. Benifits are good, but the pay is not livable where i live."
bad,"At Walmart, some days I am greeter at the front door welcoming customers on the way in and thanking them for their business on the way out. A very positive shopping experience is essential. Checking receipts on the way out. Guide customers through the store. Carry outs with large items. Making sure electric scooters are accessible and fully charged for customers. I also get shopping carts from the parking lot when needed."
bad,"When I first started it was under a different manager and although stressful, I was getting hours. When he left they put a manager back there with no automotive experience and she had personal issues with me and took those issues out on my hours. They are always short staffed and the new manager can't schedule coverage to save her life even when there was enough employees working there."
bad,Management is horrible. They always make comments that they understand or I will take care of it. Nothing is ever done you have to annoy them for them to do what they say.
bad,Working in a store so massive needs structure. Important to complete job and task daily. Always be wiling to help assist customer's. Can be very high intense working environment that you need to know how to cope in. Very important to stay aware and in tune with all customers. Be ready to work with smiling face and engage with customers.
bad,"Walmart can be a great work place. A great company to promote fast and start a career. But the biggest downfall that I seen at Walmart was the management. Very unprofessional. Easily stressed. No leadership, just bossy. Also the ratio of workers compared to work that needs to get done is absolutely impossible. If there were more employees. There would be more productivity. Management wouldn’t be as stressed. And that would cause less employees to quit."
bad,"A typical day at Walmart is monotonous and exhausting. In my position, I would unload 1 or 2 trucks (no matter how much was delivered in one day, we wouldn't be permitted breaks or even our legally required lunch until everything was unloaded), then we would stock shelves until the end of the night. Management was harsh and unforgiving, and treated us with blatant disrespect. One in particular would talk at us and when she was done, she would say ""Bye. BYE,"" until we walked away, rather than speaking to us like normal people. The only pleasant part of the job was my coworkers who were on the same level as me. all low level employees understood what it was like to be treated poorly by management so they were all kind and helpful. We were united against a common enemy."
bad,"A typical day would be to set up pallets and carts for products to be placed on them. Then we would bring in the line that you could tell was on its last legs. Finally, we would have one person ""throw the truck"" as they called it and the regular employee's would take the products of and separate them from each pallet to the certain location. Here's were it gets interesting; while I worked there I was the only one who worked and entire half of the line by myself, and then some more when I got finished before everyone else. Assistant managers and the 2 supervisors didn't realize what I did at all and would yell at everyone of us that worked the line. We were understaffed and were expected to clear a full sized truck in 2 hours with only 4-5 people that included me. One of the supervisors was brand new to the Cap 2 team and he would yell at everyone of us and would push the line so fast and so hard when some people who worked the line would have their fingers smashed between boxes and the supervisor continued to push catching my fingers as well. An employee who was hired on more recent but quit because of rude management and supervisors; he was talking at a regular tone and was not arguing but made a recommendation was yelled at and was threatened to be written up or ""coached"" as they called it. He kept his calm and didn't argue or yell when he was threatened. One of the supervisors always was gone and left for long periods of time and no one would know where he was at. At the end of the truck it was nice because we could catch our breath. We then went back and pulled all the pallets"
bad,"First of all, I can say that the experience of being part of the Walmart team made me a better person in the long run, but it is something I wish I had gone through in high school or college and not after graduating college. But I graduated into the Bush/Obama recession and jobs were scarce, so I couldn't afford to be picky. The starting pay wasn't bad, but the raises were pitiful (10 cents at every evaluation, really?) At first glance, a company the size of Walmart should have plenty of upward mobility, but the reality is that promotions were related to politics and being part of the right social network than they were related to work ethic. I worked myself to the point of physical exhaustion, and when my supervisors encouraged me to go for promotions, I was always overlooked by the management. I basically had zero personal life for six years. After I begged the right people, they finally started giving me Sundays off so I could start attending church again and at least pretend I had friends one day a week. But this company truly expects 24/7 availability out of its associates, so be willing to sign your entire life over to Walmart. After working for 6 years, I still had not accrued an entire weeks worth of vacation."
bad,Do not work for this company if you can avoid it. They do not care about their associates and will sweet any and all issues under the table without question. They would rather pretend that your problems don't exist and that you are just another slave than anything else.
bad,"i would work from 2 pm to 11 pm 5 days a week unloading trucks and stocking shelves, it gave me no time to spend with family and friends. i felt that management didn't do a lot. the other workers where somewhat helpful.the hardest part of the job was unloading the trucks in the time we where allotted."
bad,"Most if management doesn't know how to do their jobs correctly. Employees get in trouble for things out of their control. If you have any sort of disability in the slightest, this is the worst place to work. On top of it all, if youre.working full time hours and they hire you as part time, you still dont get benefits."
bad,"It's Walmart, you work here when you can't find something better.  Management is paid well but I was paid 40 cents more than minimum wage.  Not enough to live on."
bad,Walmart wasn't Bad nor Good. Theread were things that I loved about it but things I hated about it. The job description I had no issue with. It was some of the people.
bad,Need to be more family oriented pro hide better pay set in place better leadership in certain locations and roles give better opportunity for advancement.
bad,They don’t try to keep employees & don’t except doctors note no matter what the condition is . They treat you like you have to be there not want to be there to me is an inconvenience
bad,Job is very stressful lack of team work from a mangers bad scheduling put 5 to ten task for one person to do not enough hours per week managers don’t respect associates
bad,I like the hard working people of Walmart.  The people of Walmart were hard at work everyday and kept me motivated to complete the day. The People of Walmart were everyday people just trying to make it in the economy at the time I worked for them. the Company as a whole was not very accommodating to the tasks they implored. The company did not pay well at all and never gave any raises annually or for being the best employee.
bad,"When i left Walmart i had almost 40 hours PTO or vacation time coming . I tried to get it for several pay periods , i was told in the office they trying to fix it so i could get it . Over a month went by still no money , i was told corporate made a mistake on my check and i would be getting the money . I waited expecting it . The money was never given to me . I feel it was a very unfair deal . I was treated unfairly , if they weren’t going to give me the money for some reason. Which i was never told , why didn’t they just say no your not getting anything. Instead of making me believe and wait for several hundreds of dollars they knew they were not going to pay me . So in other words The PTO you work for and save is not really yours it dose t mean anything and you certainly won’t get it if you leave . They care nothing about the people who work there , and especially not if you have to leave ."
bad,"Nothing but drama, if you're looking for a job that insults you, threatens your job security, or makes you want to quit almost every day then I suggest you come here."
bad,No care for pregnant women staff is rude and also understaffed there was a women that committed fraud and ended up doing to prison they also had safety hazards never took break on time and they decided when we could take break .
bad,"Unrealistic times with no help was my daily routine. I worked in the Frozen/Dairy night shift. 10PM to 7AM. I would come in to 16 pallets of freight and be told, ""The computer says its 18 hours to work, so 3 people should be able to get done by 5."" and halfway through the shift, they'd pull the third guy, and yell at us for not getting done. Lather, rinse, repeat."
bad,"very stressful job. poor management , no communication , female employees been discriminate. unfair treatment to female employees, lack to career advancement."
bad,some days would be stressful when other days it can be a easy day which can go by long or fast. i really didn't learn anything about working there because all i had to do was help stock and the customers.
bad,"Management from the bottom up is horrible. They don't know how to handle anything. Treat you like doo-doo. The harder you work the more likely you are to be let go or abused. 15 years ago it was a good job, but now they have made so many bad changes that it's going to go under just like Kmart, unfortunately...."
bad,The managers would get you to do their jobs while promising to help you with yours but end up not helping and you end up behind yet get in trouble for going over your hours. You get penalized for clocking in early. They messed up scheduling Easter and left me hires alone with no help and try to force them to stay because they didn't schedule a closer for the deli.
bad,Walmart's management is unorganized and so focused on making money that it prefers to understaff and overwork its employees. Many new hires quit within the first month.
bad,"I felt that as management around the front end began to change, the work environment got a lot more hostile. Working wasn't fun, there was barely any freedom, and we got yelled at for a lot of things."
bad,"I don't know if its just tbe past 2 walmarts ive been in, (store 1800, 5823 combined 3yrs) but work life is stressful there. "
bad,"Always understaffed and underpaid Wal-Mart likes to keep you probationary for 9 months and work you like a dog. Even if you survive the probationary there is a list of things that can get an employee of any tenure fired instantly, but really should be wrist-slap situations."
bad,Needs to get set once and for all instead of the constant changes. No paid holidays like really as full time employees wow!! A lot of unknown changes daily. Short breaks however
bad,Management is awful and you can only move up if you kiss managers butts. They don’t care about anything except themselves. It’s an okay job for starting out but it gets worse and worse
bad,"After working for them for some years, the changes made were made against hourly associates. Upper management has high expectations but don't have any for themselves."
bad,"Worked in all aspects of this retail store, learned a lot about merchandise placement and customer service."
bad,"Lack of work hours for a position that I should have received more time to complete all the tasks assigned to me, being the only person in my department. Management can't take responsibilty for their own faults, would rather pin faults on the employee. Negative experience if it weren't for rude management and lack of work time."
bad,I worked over 14 hrs a day no support from store manager and co manager in the store instead they spend more time overloading with others duties around the store besides getting disrespected constantly on a daily bases. Seen employees getting yield and disrespect calling  the hotline and nothing HR don’t care
bad,This place sucks don't do it. Managment was terrible.  Employees smoked and dealed drugs in the bathroom. Matinece never cleaned. There is only 1 cashier open in the morning and just self checkout. Csm never come when they are called.
bad,"Walmart is a company that doesn't respect the floor associates.  They're always finding ways to cut hours so they don't have to pay their associates.   No paid holidays for non management associates. No holidays off except for Christmas. No protective sick leave, if there is they find ways to adjust everything so you'll never see it!"
bad,I enjoyed my nights at Walmart but I knew it wouldn’t last forever. Graveyard shift works for some but not for me. It really bleeds into all aspects of your life. I loved the free time and social aspect of the job but at the same time I felt like our part of the team was overloaded with high expectations and little help.
bad,Actually it's all in my review summary. Walmart's can use a lot of upgrading their use of money they put out to purchase ueslesd machinery while paying employee's that can't find other employment due to their age 48+.
bad,Make sure that you listen to management carefully and don't let them try to trick you. Always double check your work and make sure it's done to their specifications.
bad,"At the start everything seemed awesome, the management was very helpful and nice and then I got injured on the job and they were saying that i didn't get hurt at work when infact I did. Also lots of gossip amongst employees and management. Long hours and weird shifts. Pay isn't that good either and no benefits until a year of being with the company."
bad,"It is a good job for someone going to school, in my opinion. But it is not a good choice for long term employment unless your ultimate goal is management."
bad,Walnart is a large company that does not treat their employers like real people with lives. They recently passed a new point which makes it easier to fire people. Not to mention that some were fired because they were scheduled out of their availability and because of the new point system.
bad,"I work in the deli and its kind of the worst job Ive ever had. Were always moving and they dont even care if we get our breaks. Its a very stressful job and not worth the pay, specially when its a bi-weekly paycheck."
bad,"Wage is great with full benefits.  Don't expect to survive on the hours you get.  Vacation time is hard to accrue due to lack of hours.  If you have problems, don't count on management to help, they'll listen and then turn their back on you or stab you."
bad,Working at Walmart was ok. It was when I was younger and did not have a lot of responsibilities. I was refused regular hours. I worked just short of full time hours although they did not schedule me for full time so they did not have to provide benefits / additional compensation.
bad,"I started working for Walmart as an overnight stocker, but was soon promoted to overnight Support Manager.  I was in charge of training and development, disciplining associates, and managing and delegating workflow tasks.  The company does not offer flexible schedules or competitive pay, but many of the associates are genuinly wonderful to work with.  Unfortunately, the company continues to strip employee benefits over time and offers no opportunity for advancement from within, preferring to hire salaried members of management from the outside.  Many of the managers are paid well below market and there are quite a few that lack integrity or scruples."
bad,"You will rarely see a raise, they don't approve time off, you will likely have to work all holidays, and the schedule is random. Upper management talks down to employees and can be very disrespectful. Customers can also be rude, although some can be very kind. It is also a very stressful work environment with very little room to advance. They make sure to remind employees that they are replaceable. It's just a very unhappy place to work at."
bad,"Management was poor or nonexistent. They consistently over ruled Wal mart policy to take care of the customer even when obvious theft was involved. Favoritism was a problem, if you're not liked you're harrassed and never allowed to be promoted even if qualified. Management is never cohesive everyone is telling you something different about how to do one job. It's chaos. The only time poilicy is followed is when an audit is going on. Would not recommend."
bad,"I have worked at Walmart in their online grocery dept. for a good 2 years now. I'm putting in my 2 weeks notice now, and it's for a collection of reasons."
bad,"Walmart in Westwood Ks 998.the manager are very rude.tell you they can not talk to employee for 90 days,hire person who just come inn don't work,then want you bust your but.manager suck.manager wear pant below they Creek of hip.pant pull down. And nobody say any thing to her.t hey will lie on you to get you fire.have different rules for you.family not suppose work together.mother , daughter,son work together,break together lunch.you and another employee can't take break together.a and act like they don't know manager sleepy with the son."
bad,"If you don't really care a whole lot about workplace standards, then this might be the job for you. If you're looking for a generally friendly work environment, understanding management, benefits, and advancement opportunities, look elsewhere. They don't care about their lazier employees, and work their amazing employees like horses. Overtime is never paid for, they make you take time off from your next scheduled day to compensate, communication between management and employees are abysmal, and you're only allowed about 4 sick days in any given 6 month period, so if you get sick easily I caution you to reconsider."
bad,I worked at Walmart during the summer break of college. I decided I wanted experience in retail to figure out what type of job I actually wanted when I graduated. I worked at Walmart until my school schedule did not allow me to continue traveling home every weekend to work.
bad,I would recommend the one I worked at it  because the managers didn’t know nothing about there jobs and it put more on the workers and the will over work some and some people got away with doing nothing
bad,The Walmart management has been unbearable lately there always trying to write people up for unreasonable circumstances and we don’t get paid enough for as much as they ask for us to do
bad,I don't really have much to say except its Walmart. I injured my back working in the TLE and they did everything they could to not pay for the doctors bill. They push people to work in tough conditions and then don't want to take care of them when they get injured.
bad,New wave of managers hit the store and don't care who you are. Found myself picking up a lot of people slack. Most enjoyable part about my job at walmart no one really told me what to do or how to perform. I knew my job very well.
bad,"I worked for 3.6 years as a manager and associate ranked me as one of the best manager but still I never get a raise.Current  Management is the worst management in the history of this Glen Ellyn Walmart, there is lot of favoritism, they only promote their people. scheduling is very bad you can barely find any associate in any department and management never come for help. No matter which position are you applying for be prepared to do everything"
bad,"Stressful , Work and life balance is impossible, Long hours  too much of changing schedules and not enough notice to work my children to make sure that I have someone to watch and not caring about the associates"
bad,Wal-Mart has gotten to money hungry! They keep taking more and more away. Trying to compete with Amazon! We now have to walk through the DC to punch in which it's a 3 minute walk. That is 6 minutes of walking time we loose on our 30 minute lunch time and 15 minute breaks.
bad,"The Walmart I worked at is less than ideal. It mostly has the bare minimum when it comes to facilities, and many of the team members are not that great at their jobs. "
bad,I like the job and i like the people i worked with but the problem is i couldnt get enough hours and have subsidized my salary with sideworks that would make me late now and then
bad,"You are asked to do multi task even if they are not your job code, if the store manager doesn't like you, it's very hard to promote.There point system and scheculating  system only seams to work if you don't have a family"
bad,Working at Walmart is best for those who have a passion for customer service or for those who are in school needing a part time job. It's a large company that makes its employees feel like they're just a number
bad,"I would have a better reflection of Walmart if I was not a full time student. Working 40 hours a week has always been easy, but Walmart was very strict about hours which made it difficult as a busy student. It was nice to have an hour for lunch though."
bad,I have nothing more to say about wall-mart. however since this review is mandatory I suppose i have to fill it with words to make it reach over the 150.
bad,"This place promise me that they will be willing to help me and advance me on from the parking lot to any department from the inside. Instead, I have been harassed and bullied by my supervisors and my assistant manager for not working as part of their demands out in the parking lot. Everytime I try to reason with them that not one person can't maintain awhole parking lot by themselves is impossible. But, they wouldn't listen and I have been working here at Walmart for 2 years and still they have not moved me inside."
bad,Wal Mart primarily employees part time employees so no benefits are offered. Opportunities for full time advancement are almost never available.  Not career oriented.
bad,"At first, the position of Fresh Cap 1 Associate was exciting and new. Learning a newly created job seemed like a really good opportunity for advancement. However with all new things, it quickly lost its ""shine"". When the position was first created, the company randomly chose associates from surrounding fresh department to converge and transfer to this new job title. Some associates had never done this type of work before. Most of us had come from production and were used to doing tasks such as cooking or making salads. Being pushed into this new position by no choice of our own was a little unfair. It was either transfer to Fresh Cap or leave the company. I was excited to leave the production team and start something new. Unfortunately, there was little to no help from upper management. Between the first week we started and the week I actually left the company, they added 6 new jobs to our already stressful position, with no additional employees. Most recently they added the task of monthly inventory to our duties, again with no additional employees to assist."
bad,A terrible life choice. Revolving management. Asked to do things your not comfortable with. Told you dont do enough so no raise. Told I had to wait on a guy I had  a restraining order on. Most stressful job I've ever had.
bad,"I would really rather NOT go into it, that place is a terrible joke with no punch line unless the punch line is me. Personally before I worked there I thought a big company like Wal-mart would have been a much tighter ship, but it is like the inmates running the asylum kinda thing."
bad,"At the time, I enjoyed the pace and intensity of the job because it kept me healthy and in shape. I also enjoyed interacting with all of the people and being able to help customers find what they were looking for. My biggest issue was the constant changing of dept. managers. I informed my THEN manager six months ahead of time that I would be returning to school at UNC-Greensboro. By the time that date rolled around, I was working on a 3rd manager who was not aware that I had given management a departure date, and apparently no one wrote it down, so it was taken that I was leaving the job without giving sufficient notice."
bad,"This is not a very productive place to work because you never know when they are going to reduce your work hours.  When your work hours are reduced it causes a lot of problems with your living expenses. You cannot pay your bills when your hours are reduced"
bad,they are pretty laid back. not enough hours or pay to live off of. cant apply for most of the benefits unless you have been there for 2 years. if full time you get full benefits after a year. don't really get any vacation time. They no longer except doctors note any shape or form. child/children are sick and you have to miss aday you get fired or written up even with a note.
bad,"Co-workers often give orders and assume that they are in charge, and management condones this."
bad,"Everyone is only out for themselves at my Walmart, and are all too willing to throw new associates under the bus should the opportunity to arise. Most of the managers stay in the office rather than help where they can or stand around talking. Not too many friendly faces. If a manager has an issue with your job performance, they are more likely to complain to someone else and have that person tell you. "
bad,"What I initially thought was a great place for advancement and a good work enviroment turned into quite the opposite. Started at a store that just opened, so for the first year they inflated the amount of people and hours we had, and initially had a fantastic manager. For a little while, things seemed great. But as our hours got cut and the good managers got pushed away, you slowly realize that Walmart is poorly staffed and poorly managed. "
bad,Ongoing issues are not addressed or resolved by area managers. Hardest part of the job is getting the training needed. The trainer does not share all the needed info to succeed.  No training program in place to insure that all needed training is achieved.
bad,"We need. Better paye ,manager whi know how to deal with coworkers.they need to get more workers.those tjat are there over work because they are short staff."
bad,Don't do it.They will not work with your schedule. They do not allow for proper training. Information is hoarded from others so that they can't properly excel.
bad,Worked ghede for a year got oit cause the management was the worst amd got better pay elsewhere so I didnt habe to take verbal abuse anymore from manager jay
bad,The store would have meeting which not every associate was a part of. You could work there for months before attending a meeting. Any concerns or questions were just ignored.
bad,"Having worked in this company for over 8 years I've seen a huge decline in the culture. They used to care about their employees, and now it's all about working them to the bone with no appreciation or any chance to move up."
bad,The management was just awful. communication between the manager of each department was lackluster and they obviously didn't like each other. Not a single day would pass without my boss threatening to fire me. She/he most definitely had a anger management issues. After months of misery working there it took 2 to 4 complaints at Walmart headquarter did she try to change her behavior towards us. she/he didn't do it for us but to get a promotion has Walmart director which she ended up getting.
bad,"terrible management, in place solely from time in and not to do with actual ability to manage."
bad,I like what I do but managment don't really appreciate you. Management looks at it it's easy to replace u. Walmart has it's day's it can be good or bad. It all depends on who runs the store and how they treat there employees
bad,A potential employee would perform with frequent corporate level reorganizational changes. These changes may require multi-career skills.  They can be breaks in needed communication at the divisional level.
bad,"I worked at Walmart for 10 months just to get terminated because I was in the hospital and physically unable to work. The management was terrible they were always rude and did not communicate.  Everyone starts at 11 an hour so it is good pay, but the only way you will get a raise or advance in the company is if you are favored by your managers. They don't advance you based on your work ethic. I also am in college and told them I needed fewer hours because as a music major 37 hours and 7 classes were too much for me- that is what put me in the hospital. They took 2 months to change my availability and they refused fewer hours. I was mentally, physically and emotionally tired and unhealthy. A terrible job would never go back. You don't get benefits unless you are full time."
bad,"Working at Walmart in Kingsland Ga. Is like being in highschool again. The customers are just a handful but that's just people in general. The co-,workers are a whole book themselves you have those who come to work and mind their business and just come for the check. Then you have those who kiss the managers butt and wanna gossip and be in everybody business. AND the managers OMG they are just the worst I ever seen they looked down on you and discriminate, and pick and choose who they like.They make you do all their work while they walk around the store laughing and giggling on their walkies all day. But don't let them catch a associate laughing and talking, it's all get back to work , be productive, go zone something. Just straight up hypocrites and this go for the CSM'S AND ASSOCIATE MANAGERS. KINGSLAND GA HAS THEY WORST TEAM I EVER SEEN."
bad,Stressful environment to work in. Dealing with call outs and not working in the area your hired for. Bad management. Benefits are bad for part timers.
bad,"I was a manager, the environment is not productive to running a smooth operation in my opinion. The lack of direction and motivation was surprising. The dis jointment of the staff was apparent. People didn't work well together and would try to under mind your authority if it didn't fall in line with their opinion."
bad,"* Stressful"
bad,"Started at Walmart in 2015 and it seemed like a really good place to work and I mainly enjoyed the job during this time.  Had the opportunity to transfer to Sam's in 2016, which I did, and that was wonderful.  However, my club closed in 2018, forcing me to go back to Walmart, in the process.  The 2nd time around was terrible.  Too many new initiatives and changes, all focused at covering the company's behind, yet disguised as ""customer"" related.... Job was about customers, at one point, but when I came back to Walmart, it was all about numbers, just like the other retail pharmacies (CVS, Walgreens, etc.)"
bad,"When starting my role at Walmart as a night-stocker, I was made to do the infant department and then move straight on to Toys, and everyone that i had talked to that worked there, was that Toys is where they send those that they want to quit or have a reason to fire because it is almost impossible to keep their standards in toys."
bad,We are currently going through major changes in the company and there seems to be a major lack of leadership guiding it.  There is a lot of management talking in meetings but they are very reluctant to help out when departments are struggling to make results.  This has resulted in a divided management team and high turnover.
bad,"As a cashier, they do not give you your scheduled breaks. Then managers get upset you are over your time. They do not communicate the issues or a possible solution. The hardest part of the job is not the customers but the associates trying to work as a team and failing miserably. I really enjoy the chance to provide great customer service but the stress is not worth it."
bad,"This job is very long and strenuous. You must be okay with being outside. The daily tasks include cart pushing,in all weather. Cleaning of parking lot. Helping customers with loading items."
bad,They do not offer adequate security measures for their money center workers so you’re basically on your own working at your own risk. If you get robbed be prepared to be off work without pay.
bad,"It isn't the store has a problem, but those who manage each departments."
bad,Asset Protection is very difficult no longer have direct reports but still expected to get things done being a dotted line manager. No longer focusing on theft controls and growing with the loss prevention security new technologies. Being more of a administrative follow up manager to new apps and technology with no control over processes.
bad,after being promoted to Customer Service Manager i realized how corrupt this establishment is. I was forced to go against policy countless times to return items that should not have been returned. stay out of retail
bad,"I made money for a short time at Walmart,managers were kind and tried to help about flexible schedule. the best part for me was connecting with customers and helping them.I really liked Walmart app and tried to help customers by using it."
bad,Walmart is best for people without kids or relationships. Walmart want you to put them first at all cost. They only work with people who they favor. Working hard and being dependable for them don't help. You need to be in there favorite groups. That the managers hang out with outside of work. To get flexibility from managers.
bad,Walmart is going down hill. people i work with are great. but the way walmart treats its people is bad. they expect way to much from people. if they want you to do something they dont care what you have going on in your life. the expect you to be there for them.
bad,At Wal-Mart I typically supervised people that worked in my area of the store.  I worked for the most part in the entertainment area. this was the toy section and electronics.
bad,"Claim that advancement is an option, however outside hires dominate management and higher positions. Hours are cut and new people are hired rather than distributing hours fairly. Confusing and unfair wages and time off allowances, random hour cuts store wide blatant favoritism, and largely understaffed year round are all reasons that brought me to believe that working at walmart for two years was the worst choice i possibly could have made."
bad,Work you hard and you do various jobs in one day. Benifits suck and the management have favorites. They dont like to hire any more help and you never get off on thanks giving.
bad,Staff helped you out but management was horrible they didn't care what happened to you as long as it benefits them. Pay was good benefits was horible.
bad,"The collective staff works overnight to restock shelves and clean the building for the following day. We'd have a short meeting to assign sections and go about a routine for most of the night. The work is straightforward and could be finished with time to spare so your not working under pressure."
bad,"I worked for Wal-Mart just short of 6 yrs, 4 of which were in the bakery. We had a lot of regulars training and were taught not to handle food if vomiting or having diarrhea yet I was told by my manager that they needed me to stay so I had to go over his head to leave.  Also, the after employees were coated on yet I would go behind them and find expired product in the floor.  Everyone also worked under great pressure though we were given duties that not only covered our job description but other employees as well, while those employees were allowed to stand around and comversate."
bad,"Very understaffed."
bad,"good job for those just starting out in the work life."
bad,"Se autonombra la empresa n1 del mundo mundial"
bad,Walmart is a terrible place to work for. They don't give you any opportunities to advance your career and they go with whoever they want to advance over work experience in this field. They have no union. And they are terrible on scheduling their employees properly.
bad,on a typical day of being a customer service supervisor i would be flustered as soon as i get in due to management. they would short staff us then tell us to get our customer lines to a low level with few cashiers we had then make us do alot more then we are required with again the short staff we have
bad,"Walmart is a place that makes you feel welcome at first, they management is a disaster, they make you feel low when you ask a question concerning your job. They are supposed to post all openings for advancement, however if they have a favourite, they ignore applicants and out that person in the position. The people that work there themselves are great people and are frustrated. Underpaid for all the work and care they put into their work. They are heavily understaffed and have timed work, if you are stocking they will tell you it takes 1.3 hours, the problem is while stocking they expect you to help customers and clean up the area. The 1.3 hours can quickly become 2-3. I would say they have benefits, which is great, but the overall stress and lack of appreciation is one of the many reasons why I would not suggest Walmart as employment."
bad,"Management is not helpful. Minimal training. Some people are very nice, but not many people even communicate with you. Rules change constantly and don't inform you ahead of time. Uncomfortable working environment."
bad,I have worked customer service before but customers at walmart are extremely rude and so was the management there. I enoyed my fellow employees but other than that there was no positive about the workplace
bad,"So where do I start..."
bad,The people are the backbone of this company and they get treated like garbage and disregarded at every opportunity. Working here has been nothing short of unpleasant.
bad,"Always short handed new management all the time "
bad,"It's income for a means to an end, but if you want better you must know when to move on to better yourself.  Retail has it's ups and downs, and Management could seem to bully and instead of working as a team they make the team of one."
bad,"I've been trying for years to work my way up. Hard work literally gets you no where but overworked. I have sacrificed a lot. Canceling vacation. Coming in from vacation. Made myself available all the time. Missed children's birthdays. Kept a great attitude and customer service even with my cousin workers, even when a family member died. Even when I wanted to just burst out in tears from the stress. From stretching myself out so thin. From doing three people's jobs from call ins. Do not expect recognition for anything you do. People who get hired in after you will make more. They will also get management positions 3 months into the company,without even an interview, because it's about who you know. Not your work ethic. Not about your experience."
bad,"Management is super Ignorant and lazy. Their Knowledge performance, and integrity doesn't even come close to the workers that they are under them.The Store managers and assistant managers  think the workers are beneath them and can talk to them like peasant. The Company need to a requirement the Store Managers and managers have a annual psychological evaluation."
bad,"I miss my coworkers ,hours and pay and chances to move up (because I was to good at my job) was insanely disrespectful. But they want Me back. Not me."
bad,"I worked at DC 6094 same one the CEO started. It's true what they say about this place being the tuffest warehouse and the best one year after year, but with that in mind working there for me was borring and horrible. The more I learned the more work I was given, the more efficient I became the more they trap me into the role I have, more I self taught areas within the DC and becomming more essential to walmart I would just get more work with two years of endless promises of promoting and pay raise"
bad,Management only keys on getting there merchandise that needs stocked done . Does not really care how their employees feel. The hours are good. You can put what you want to work .There are times that you don't get your breaks cause they expect so much out of you..The stire did oretty much have what most customers have. But if we didn't have it they would suggest somewhere else or try and get it from another Walmart. Didn't mind working for Walmart when it first opened but over the years different managers just brought the store down in both enjoyment coming to work and morale.
bad,The hardest parts of this job are the physical parts.  You have to lift hundreds of pounds as quickly as possible for long hours each day.  There is also no room for error.
bad,"front end manager plays favorites too much, even though you are more than qualified for a promotion an have passed all tests with flying colors he tends to put younger less experienced lazy employees into promotion position. will not work with your hours once you start. pray you don't need to change your hours because it will not be approved unless you are a favorite of the management."
bad,My manager never knew what she was doing. Daily I would get screamed at by the store manager for directly doing something my manager told me to do. Constantly asked to skip half my lunch and stay several hours late because my manager couldn’t delegate tasks or hire more people.
bad,Walmart is a good place to work I would recommend this place to everyone but I want to better  myself for me and my daughter to spend more time and sometimes Walmart can’t  provide that
bad,"Not recommended if you have dreams, or exceptional job skills.In my experience, You will become like the rest of the employees all treated as low man on the totem pole, regardless of your efforts and abilities. terrible structure, unreasonable time frames, and very poor communication and leadership."
bad,"Walmart gives the appearance of a great student job, unfortunately it is farm from. The management is horrible and does not care about staff. I worked for walmart for 2 years before finally giving in my notice. "
bad,The only good thing about this job is working with the coworkers. Besides that the majority of the job is just horrible. Worked for 2 years to try and move up in the company but no matter how hard I try they will never give me the opportunity to move up.
bad,Working for this company has to be hands down the worst experience I've ever had. from the abysmal treatment of the associates to the ramp it theft and malicious mental abuse that goes on in this company is ridiculous.
bad,Management won't work with associates with on hand matters.no communication at all. Store change position hours to their liking which benefit the store
bad,"Essentially what I said already. Gives a good paycheck for the time spent, but doesn't give much room for advancement in a small town. Beware of the open door policy- they will throw you out the window."
bad,"Management varied depending upon whom you reported to. Associates were fun to work with, very dedicated, very professional...we each carried our own load and would pick up the other when needed. Fun team, we knew our specific responsibility and would stand up for one another should management get a hair out of order. New management came aboard my last two years and we never again heard a compliment or a pat on the back. Pay increase came once a year....Year 2017 ""The Walton Family"" had a very profitable year and we all shared in their wealth with a very generous 2% salary increase across the board company wide"
bad,"É uma empresa que exige trabalho duro assim como qualquer outra,necessita de competência,o trabalho em equipe é fundamental, pois na falta do mesmo o desgaste físico se entende de forma prejudicial aos funcionários,os colegas de trabalho são  ótimos em sua maioria,trabalham e se ajudam.os gerentes buscam sempre bater meta,mas para isso exigem muito dos funcionários,alguns apoiam muito seus trabalhadores outros,mas em minoria pegam pesado e criticam seu trabalho."
bad,Its okay to work at but not great!.... You dont grow within the company due to the fact that they already know who they’re going to hire before you even submit your application and the person they usually hire usually doesnt know anything logistics wise.
bad,You have to be 10 people in 1. There is never enough help on registers or on the salafloor so you have to be multiple people everyday. You never can get your own job done due to the fact your always doing someone elses job. Manaegment plays favortism to. If your not one of the favorites then you get treated badly. Jobs constantly being eliminated.
bad,"Was an interesting experience working at Walmart "
bad,"If you like working long hours, and having your boss over your shoulder and if you think that production is more important than safety, than this place is for you."
bad,"For such a large company, I was very disappointed at the poor leadership skills, communication and management I encounter on a daily basis at Walmart."
bad,"A typical day within the Wal-Mart organization will last anywhere from 13-16 hours. There are several meetings during the day to make adjustments to changes (meeting or not meeting goals). There is little time for managers to have breaks, which result in them eating quickly or missing meals. The autonomy to make sound decisions is rare. Consequently, the managers often feel powerless. Often changes are made to managers’ schedules with little notice, which is difficult for single parents and those with young children. Wal-Mart does provide sufficient knowledge of logistics and the supply chain. What it does not provide is consistency. The framework is archaic; this includes software and some technology.  This structure leaves little time to develop positive relationships with employees. Often they feel overworked, silenced, and unmotivated to complete tasks to the best of their ability."
bad,Walmart wa a good place 7 years ago i loved it but they changed policy took away vacation and personal time the store is run poorly by management to much to do not enought help there no team work and managers are rude.
bad,"Working at Walmart is like no other place I've ever worked."
bad,"I’ve actually worked at Walmart on and off for a total of 10 years."
bad,"Busy, crazy, bad management, too many long days with no days off. Scheduled 9 hours, but you work 15 hours. Too many chiefs with too little indians. Good luck."
bad,"Walmart is everyone's go to job, not the best place to work, the people were friendly but they treated you like slaves, always made you feel like there was no job security"
bad,"Stocked shelves in an assigned area. Pulled to unload trucks with heavy boxes & stock shelves in another area. Reprimanded cause I didn't have time to finish my area due to being pulled. Cashiered in Pharmacy but Pharmacist was not helpful when a customer changed their mind & he had to use his pass code to make the correct changes. Worked in Garden Center cashiered, customer service & stocking shelves. Had to use a ladder to stock high shelves. I'm a female in my 60's & was afraid of climbing the ladder. "
bad,"Poor Management in last store.I completed many tasks that were manager jobs with no recognition. I was asked to help a coworker and was unfairly terminated. I gave Walmart many years of dedicated service and am extremely disappointed!!  "
bad,while working at Walmart for the past 6 years I've noticed a lot. I believe its a fast paced environment with potential for advancement under the right management.
bad,"Loved my position but poor upper management that results in high turnover and loss of potentially great employees because of them."
bad,management is the main reason they have such a high turn over. all they care about is another dollar made not about the care and well-being of their fellow employees.
bad,"You never know what to expect day to day, it always changes. You have nice customers and then rude customers. You work alone a lot at self check out when you should have 2-3 to make sure customers are helped in a timely manner. Your breaks are usually late. I do like talking with the customers. Its interesting conversations! You also build a special bond with co-workers."
bad,"Has so much potential to serve the community and employees better, Needs to remember it isn't about share holders but the people who built the company."
bad,"-Work days go by fast as a stock associate"
bad,Ambiente de trabalho e distribuição de tarefas poderia ser melhor gerenciado.
bad,Friendly people to work with. Discounts for employees are low. Pay is low. Hours are not great. Management is of low moral. Over worked. Lack of growth within the company.
bad,I unloaded trucks and organized pallets of merchandise to get ready to go out on the floor to be sold. And I put the itmes in a crate  according tot heir bar code.
bad,"its okay to work if you get a good manager who is ""in the know"" and understands how a time sheet works, and who works with you on time off as well as days you cannot work."
bad,"Walmart is very methodical and will fire employees for turnarounds, they constantly weed out people over almost made up infractions."
bad,"Needs to improve in a lot of ways, feel like their poor in just about everything slow when customer needs them an or needs help. Plus when cashiers need help their slow an really lack with care for customers"
bad,"Expectation is over 50 hours a week, using your pto time that you earn is frowned upon.  10 day, 12 hour runs are part of the role. Pay is good, however the health insurance is poor."
bad,"Walmart might be a good company for some to work but this particular one could be run better. Due to the changes coming from corporate, many positions have been eliminated or absorbed."
bad,"Not always fair. Did learn mixing paint, fishing/hunting licenses, a different way to make keys, run registers."
bad,The walmart company is an okay company. the coworkers are what makes the job more fun. The customers can be rude and talk down to you. hard to balance life and work with Walmart
bad,Hoping I dont have to work for walmart company every again endless its management. I also think that they could do alot better with management it not very great at the store I work at.
bad,The managers don't care what you are going through. They don't care if you're depressed and in need of great help. All they want you to do is work and get mad when you can't focus.
bad,"I enjoyed it for the most part, but there is definitely A LOT of favoritism going on and they don't give enough hours. Management sucks. People don't keep their mouths shut when others get fired which isn't supposed to b told - but that could be any work place."
bad,While working at Walmart did help me very much to build my customer service skills it proved to be such a stressful environment that I could no longer bring myself to stay. The main issue I encountered was that 99% of issues that employees or customers had could not be solved by anyone who actually worked in the store. The corporation is so large that policy is valued over people.
bad,"It was fun some of the time when people would show up for work"
bad,"It was okay at first, but over time it became stressful, and management wasn't great. I got fired after hurting my back working on a car by myself when I wasn't supposed to."
bad,the manager wasn't too go really because she told me to call her that coming monday so i did but then she never picked up and i show up to lake st. louis walmart and told her that she never got a phone call.
bad,"Great job while you, but not en ideal place to work if you’re in school or you have a house hold to take care of... manager don’t care about your life outside of work"
bad,"You work here because you have to.  The expectations are about the same as any other retailer, just amped up because of market managers that want to get promoted to corporate.  Do not expect to be rewarded with anything but more work for your overtime.  Or worse yet, you'll be castigated for putting in that overtime to make your department succeed and thus costing a bit of money for a manger's bonus."
bad,"Get to work and go straight to the toy department."
bad,Was many years ago so may not be a fair review. Hours not practically family friendly and pay was low. Maybe good place to get experience but not long term.
bad,Management has no desire to generate a work environment supportive to employee retention. They feel it is easier to replace and refill a position than to build up a current employee to standard.
bad,"This is the 2nd time I have worked at walmart. The reason I returned is that it is close to home and was an easy job to land while I look for work elsewhere. I actually have managers I like but they are basically powerless to fix any of the problems that originate from head office and there are quite a few of those. I ,and other associates  like to chat and in multiple depts. we have found that although there are enough people to fill regular time slots all over the day Walmarts policy is to make sure your hours are always changing as in on day starting at 5 am 2 days later closing until eleven. This makes work life balance pretty near impossible. Whether your trying to maintain a decent sleep schedule, or create a regular workout routine or find a reliable babysitter ,good luck."
bad,"I am so thankful that I had some previous pharmacy retail experience before becoming employed at Walmart Pharmacy in Martinsville, VA.  The reason is that there is no set training involved in this Pharmacy at Walmart.   You have to learn as you go and even though if you ask for help...the other technicians help if needed but it's not all the time welcomed...it's like most of the time you are bothering them if you ask for help.  The Pharmacists on the other hand ....well let's just say you have to be there to believe.  I actually witness a Pharmacist going back and forth with a customer/patient about an issue with their medication...and instead of calming the customer/patient...this Pharmacist proceeded to edge the customer/patient on to the point the customer/patient was using profanity and the Pharmacist was making smart remarks, etc.   Even though this particular Pharmacy fills a very high volume of prescriptions daily....it has the highest number of turnovers for the pharmacy technicians.  My suggestion would be for any future pharmacy technicians.....would be demand you are trained properly (3 months and continuously checked on to make sure that you understand what you are doing completely with positiveness)  also that you develop great customer service skills.  It is not good when a customer/patient comes in and starts complaining about another pharmacy technician have a bad attitude and asking if they are like that everyday.  The atmosphere in this Pharmacy makes it hard to enjoy your position.  The training needs to be a positive experience and not someone seemingly exhausted"
bad,"Working at Walmart the only good thing is the pay, you start at  $11/hr, other than that management is poor, employees are undervalued and turnover is extremely high.  And don’t bother reporting anything to management because retaliation is a very real and almost certain possibility in work hours or even your job."
bad,I worked for Walmart for 9 years and i love my job but they make it very hard to work for them over the last few years. My hours have been cut to zero for the next few weeks because i have limited availability due to my daughter having epilepsy and other disabilities she has evening appointments that i have to take her to. Until about 4  years ago i worked only 2-11 pm 5 days a week with no complaints and even after i started working daylights had hours until we got a new front end manger who will not accommodate me. I was promised  2 other positions they later revoked the offers and hired new people for the positions.
bad,Wal-Mart is a okay place to work. It's great pay but the management is not to great. But the people there are nice. I would not recomend it to anyone.
bad,"Wal-Mart is a good job to have if you want to struggle paying your bills, but is fun talking to different people, counting an giving change, helping people to find what they are looking g for,"
bad,Was very un professional didn’t even call or anything to fire me just fedex a check to me with papers saying terminated management plays everything by there own book favoritising the people they like the most and firing any one
bad,"the customer service was very nice the management was very kool and the job always had cool events, my days at work was always interesting,and my employees was always so helpful,we were a family"
bad,The Wal-mart culture is boring. The environment is gloomy. The management team is lazy. The employees are unapprecitated and the turnover rate is high.
bad,too much work time not enough pay never was at home with my family. I want a job that pays well but will let me have home time with my family. I would not recommend this position unless you are a single person.
bad,"for a stepping stone job its good but overall I do not recommend working long term. They will rarely offer full time and Benefits are minimal at best. Management seems to play favorites over employees and is much more lenient with those employees compared to ones they prefer less. I Have been on both ends of this spectrum. They give the most minimal amount of hours they are able to in order to look good on a corporate savings level. Upper management can be very unhelpful when dealing with an upset customer and they will tell you that they need you to be firm with the store policy but will not back you up when a customer wants to talk to a higher level of management. Then you are at fault and you are the one who gets written up or talked to for not upholding company policy. Their ""mandatory"" meetings require you to clock in if your on your day off, which the meeting only lasts an hour at most. However, on your scheduled shift they require you to cut that hour of time making the hour you spent during your day off null. if you are premoted to a new position they do not take any time to train you on the duties and requirements of that position. For example I was promoted to department manager and my first day on the job I asked the store manager who is going to train me as far as job duties, ordering out of stock items and knowing when and what merchendise to put out in your department during the seasons. The reply I was given was ""Figure it out"""
bad,the managers cared nothing about the employees  all they cared about was making the manager above them happy..i was the tire and lube manager and most thought that was no place for a woman
bad,"I know not all management is the same as I had, but it seemed like the management didn't care about their employee's.. One minute they say overtime is allowed and another minute they say it is not allowed. There were a lot of people that needed the 40 hours and it seemed like to the management that they didn't care about that. Whatever time you were scheduled to go home, you had to leave at that time. If you didn't, they would get upset at you because you were not leaving the time you were supposed too. There were times when I needed the 40 hours and I would stay overtime if I needed too, but management wouldn't allow that."
bad,Most Walmart stores in the San Antonio area are poorly managed.  The training is below standard and those who suffer most are the customer and the few good workers that look for direction that isn't there.
bad,"A typical day at work starts off hectic. You have to search for equipment that works at an optimum level. Once you find one get started, after starting you have to move fast enough to make your moves in a timely manner while being safe and keep that pace up until you finish, whether its 10 hours or 16. You also have to be prepared to run out of moves throughout your night that will prolong your night and drop your percentage."
bad,"A typical day at work was stocking, zoning, helping customers with jewelry sales, servicing watches, and doing ear piercings. At any given time you, would typically be called to help as a back up cashier."
bad,"A typical day will have help customers find items in the store, as well as return items they've bought and don't want/need anymore. Along with helping them pay Bill's and/or send money. I learned to be calm in stressful situations, along with having patience not only with customers but also with other associates, but when it comes down to it Walmart only cares about one thing and that's money."
bad,"If you’re wanting to work at Walmart, I would recommend going for cashier positions. Also, managers tend to pick favorites and those are the ones who get promoted. Looking for part time work, this is the place, but don’t try to make a career at Walmart."
bad,Worked here fo a few months. Managers hated me because I was young. Never worked with a school or sport schedule(all I asked was for 3 nights off a week) and all around nobody I worked with enjoyed this job
bad,Great co-workers. Flexible hours. Good pay. Not much room for promotions. Ended up doing the work of 2 or 3 people by myself sometimes. Learned a lot and grown a lot working here.
bad,Only did the three weeks training upon which store manager decided I was too old for this position and filled with another person. Company did very little to assist me in finding another location and basically ignored me
bad,"Doing most of work while D.M. complained about work he had to do. "
bad,They don't respect your availability and are an all or nothing type company. Doesn't pay as well as other jobs. Poor managment and corrupt corperate values.
bad,"Horrible scheduling. No work/life balance. Walmart should give you a choice if you want to work mornings, evenings, etc, they don't. There are so many people who would prefer a night shift, etc.. Why force people to work both shifts."
bad,for the most part a typical day consists of going in and seeing what all has not been done by the prior shift and finishing that work. after that you complete your tasks given by management past that you help customers and zone or clean the department.
bad,The worst place to work at management sucks and so does your work and life business. They do not care about your health at all. They also take the ability to advance away
bad,Overall none or minimal consideration and benefit for employees. Scheduling woes weekly and poor management all together. Lack of planning and budgeting for hours and projects leaves many incomplete projects to be burdened onto next shift often.
bad,they promise good stuff when hiring then they drop you with your team. your on computer for a few days which is part of your training then your team is suppose to do the rest. if one person in your team doesn't like you your out the door. the hours are random so hope you like to work random hours.
bad,"Never had any consistency in scheduling, was a full time associate with 5 and a half years with Walmart and was only scheduled 34 hours per week while part time associates were getting 38 to 40 hours per week. plus i was coached for working a couple hours over my scheduled work hours.  I made 11.50 per hour after being there over 5 years and cashier new hires were making 11 per hour!  Im an Army veteran who was fired for allegedly leaving an ammo case open yet i have witnessed salaried management leave THEIR KEYS in a gun case and walked away, their keys in a register and walk away, support managers and department managers leave their keys in ammo case unattended.  This company does not support military veterans or treat their employees well"
bad,"Didn't enjoy my time as a sales associate or as a cashier, hours were abysmal and all over the place, with a lack of coverage in every area, do not recommend at all"
bad,I was a cashier and i loved the fast pace working and meeting new people. it was sometimes hard to deal with the craziness but i had very good co-workers.
bad,Walmart isnt fair with pay or hours only when your needed.sometimes the schedule is changed and they dont inform you about the changes they made. The employees that work for walmart with me were excellent workers.
bad,When i worked for Wal-Mart i loved my job. Then i had health issues and within the 90 day grace period i have several anxiaty and panick attacks. I had Dr notes and they still fired me because of the stupid point system! I will NOT work for Wal-Mart again due to my disabilities!
bad,"No work/ home balance, too many unfair work conditions and expectations. Not an even work flow and everyone wasn't held accountable for their actions and decisions."
bad,"Very busy, got to learn patience, management could be ok depending on who's there, customers can be friendly or they can be really aggravating especially when they try to get over on you, hardest thing to do is deal with the all around attitudes from customers and management, meeting people is always fun especially co-workers."
bad,"It's not a good place to work the managers are lazy and don't care about there employees they do things difficulty, they don't want there employees to succeed in the store"
bad,"Everybody wants to work for Walmart until you get in it’s not what you think it is , the management sucks they talk to you any type of way , they forget about your breaks"
bad,I did not enjoy working for Wal-Mart as much as I wanted to. Most of the managers didn't handle certain situations correctly or professionally. You were talked down to or belittled quite often.
bad,"I’ve been there for 17 years. The are geared to promote the young almost exclusively. Turnover rate is very high, even in management. There are decent benefits offered. I used to feel like I was a part of something. Now I feel like just a number."
bad,"I've worked at walmart for almost three years now. And let me say the s*** I've put up with hasnt been worth it. You have to watch everything you say to anyone, and your department manager chronically snitches on you like its high school. You can not just go to work and do your job and not be bothered, it's always got to be about some sort of work politics."
bad,"The other employees were always friendly, and immediate management was always helpful to both the employees and the customers. The company's practices and policies lead to lack of morale and motivation for employees near the bottom. "
bad,Despite the lack of a store manager for more than a year lower associates were able to make sure to work as a team to push proper products out and satisfy customers with friendly customer service.
bad,"My time at Walmart was short. My hours were routinely decreased, despite business continuing to increase as the  holiday season raged on. I felt that the management of my department was fragmented and did not care to develop or coach associates into perpetuating the company's standard. The culture was hard to get used to as well. It was hard to take pride in the work I was doing there. The attendance policy gave no leeway for injuries or illnesses not long term enough to require a leave of absence."
bad,"I was happy to work at Walmart for the first 5 years but the last couple years things have gone down hill and now it in my opinion is a place where favorites given the opportunity to advance their careers and the rest can either fall in line or get handed their walking papers so to speak"
bad,"You work your butt off for your store and you are just a number. Easily replaceable.you feel like you are not welcomed or valued, you are just a replaceable commodity that they will replace when you do not agree with or need something for yourself."
bad,"after leaving a $125000 per year job this is hard work for sure."
bad,"The people of Walmart some are great, but most are not. Being able to do multiple things means you might get more hours but get yelled at for not being able to keep up with your areas tasks."
bad,i was harassed at walmart for having a disability. they would be really rude if i asked for help on something if i need it like if it was a 2 person job.
bad,A competitive environment and most store managers are unwilling to change. Many of the assistant managers are not well versed in leading and motivating. Standing out is not difficult if a person has a strong will to succeed.
bad,The pay is decent but it’s nearky impossible to become full time and they constantly cut hours. They don’t like promoting women. They expect honesty and integrity from employees but they will lie to you to benefit Walmart. Mangers and the company  have no integrity. Walmart today isn’t the Walmart Sam Walton started and invisioned.
bad,"Right now Walmart as a company is losing profits, so they are taking it out on their employees, its a stressful place to work at right now and will probably always be like that."
bad,They cut hours and expect for u to do your job management job and help others before I get off but they cut your hours short amd still expect it to get done . at times if you dont do management job they will also cut your hours .
bad,"Fast paced, cut throat environment. I would recommend this place to work for but keep in mind that they do not do thorough checks on people and some people are not honest about themselves."
bad,"My experience with Walmart in a word is sporadic. There is no such thing as consistency at Walmart. There is obvious favoritism shown by management towards certain associates, micromanagement from longtime associates, and what seems like a growing trend of moronic behavior at the hands of corporate management who have become so far removed from reality that they have created a fantasy universe all of their own that it actually seems to be a pleasant alternative to the reality that is the dumpster fire most stores are when they have to juggle the inane whims of Home Office and the myriad denizens that roam the aisles. "
bad,you can work your butt off all day/week/month long and never receive any credit or a simple good job from the store manager or any of the assistant managers. I'd say all the managers are terrible except two. The workplace is always so negative and no one has anything nice to say about anyone else. Who would wanna work for a company who is nothing but negative and with a store manager that cares about nothing but his own job?
bad,"The management was running a skeleton crew, the workload was unrealistic, and there was never a supervisor available when needed regardless of the concern. At one point I was scolded for taking lunch 5 hours into my shift, even when I hadn't stopped unloading a full truck for a break I am legally suppose to take and only 2 other people helping. A job that normally had 8 people and capable of being completed in 2 hours. I was even threatened to be written up. Too much of a workload to be disrespected for taking on so much weight"
bad,High turn overs because the way they treat employees...Very Racists and could care less about Life beyond wal-mart...makes fun of employees and stresses employees out
bad,"They don’t treat you right they want u todo everything, not to many hour and a poor management, its very stressfull, I don’t recommend to work on the one that i was maybe its diferrent on the other ones"
bad,If you have the right manager the job is good. The bad news is they switch the managers around every six months. Most of the managers are inexperienced and inept.
bad,"Walmart will use any excuse they can to deny anual raises, and management within departments changes almost monthly, new management often are not properly trained for new positions but feel they know better anyways"
bad,You have to keep begging just to get what you want or need. Nobody wants to do anything and people are getting fired and then hired again. And nobody wants to do their jobs.
bad,"Salary unrealistic,  working in the Granby store has completely changed the way I look at WalMart as a company. Management tends to favor people that have no mind of their own, do not know how to say what they want. If you aren't n the ""Klick"" you will never get ahead in the company."
bad,"minimal training"
bad,"Management hires their family and friends. This in turn creates an unfair work environment and shows favoritism."
bad,"I worked here through an agency called Kelly Services. I did not receive my first paycheck for over a month and was ultimately let go because of the fact that I could not afford transportation - when in all seriousness it was their fault I couldn't get there. Very shady, but I'm sure it's great once you're hired on directly!!!"
bad,Wal-Mart is don’t care about their employees only the money they make all long time employees get hours cut or fired because of the pay even though Wal-Mart don’t pay well
bad,"I was with Walmart for seven years, I moved up fast with hard work. Once I was management I realized it was not worth it. I was never home always working. Staff was always complaining about something because it was just a pay check for them and not a career."
bad,"Même si tu travaille pour longtemps, ils vont pas te respecter ni te donne plus d'avantage ni le nombre d'heure que tu voudras."
bad,"Learned how the Walmart Company wanted things put on their shelves. Management had the discretion to change it at will. The hardest part of the job was when you worked a department by yourself and you are responsible for putting up to but not limited to 10+ pallets of merchandise on the shelves, the picks and make sure any and all pallets that were not worked were stacked properly and sent back prior to the end of your shift."
bad,I was trained in for multiple areas and never got a pay difference. I was working as a front-end manager but not receiving the pay that the rest of them were. I neglected my home life to make sure that my career was doing good but on a medical leave I was terminated when they wanted me to come back as a cashier and that was outside of my restrictions.
bad,I work at the distribution center and even thou the pay is good the work is extremely hard and take a great toll on your body. There is no except Walmart life. Turn over is incredibly high because of the stress the work takes on your body. Many injuries. No holidays and mandate every week. If you don't want to be tired all the time and want to see your family then don't apply
bad,"Not team work "
bad,Walmart is a money pit where in my experience your manager doesn't really care about you as a person as an example my store manager got caught laundering over 10 million$ from the company which was supposed to go to the departments that were always understaffed due to this and his punishment was he was asked to quietly resign with a slap on the wrist and indefinite time to pay back the money with nothing on his record.
bad,"This is the type of place where you have to know the right people and say the right things to advance into management and salaried positions. God forbid you're ever sick or get into a car accident, you will be penalized with ""occurrence points"" and once you get a certain amount you are fired. only work here if you're desperate."
bad,"starts the day off with nightly meeting where we hear the notes from the store manager on what and where we should improve on then stock freight, help customers, zone the shelves then leave. Upper management holds grudges against its employees and refuse to permit any elevation in the company and will bully employees out of positions that they don't like. Hardest part of the job is watching the slackers get away with far to much when a simple ""mistake"" could get you a coaching(written warning). and the only good thing is the hour lunch."
bad,"Waking up knowing I had to go to work was the worst feeling ever. I started the day with a headache because I knew what was going to come of the day from management. Maybe 2 registers would be open with long lines with both of them. I tried keeping a positive attitude for the customers' sake, and I did. The job did have perks such as the amazing people I would meet everyday and the laughs I would get before I go home."
bad,worked as a cashier and helped ring customers up that were checking out. Management was very poor and organization was non-existent. I learned to work in a fast paced environement.
bad,The management was horrible to work for i would not recommend anyone to work there unless you can deal with horrible management the pay is great but the managers treat there employees bad
bad,"My biggest issue was the amount of managers who refused to show sympathy for anything, let alone their own employees, I had a day off request denied for no clear reason other than “because”. I was also singled out and over the silliest things, such as my shirt not being appropriately blue enough."
bad,I had thought since they say walmart is like family sure if your family likes to screw you over they refuse to work with your schedule first 6 months you get 4 points people have lives but walmart wants you to make walmart your life
bad,"Things are constantly changing and not always for the better. If something isn't broke then don't fix with it. Policies and procedures change on an almost weekly basis and it is very difficult to execute and keep the employees up to date and on board. Most of the management training is irrelevant, as well as the actual employee training,and it is pretty much a sink or swim mentality once you are in position in your store. You are not truly empowered to control your areas and are subject to your store manager's whims. A lot of the people are great but there is a very dog eat dog mentality that is very counter productive to any kind of serious team building between management."
bad,"I worked as a kart attendant at Walmart for about 5 months, ending up quitting due to insurmountable work load and brutal working conditions as a result of incompetent management and severe under staffing. Towards the end of my time there I was sent to work on the whole lot by myself for entire shifts, most notably on labor day. Equipment was in a constant state of malfunction and was much of a safety hazard in my view. Would not recommend unless you have no other choice."
bad,"i would prefer not to discuss my opinion. i worked there to get over my social awkwardness, and allowed me to go to school. however i feel the culture at Walmart is sub par at best."
bad,management refuses to do the job properly  they will not handle disputes in a timely manner unless it is one of their favorites allowing associates and department managers to get into constant disagreement when things are not accomplished
bad,"Very unorganized managment team. Very selfish higher up management who will take advantage of hard working associates while catering to less productive and ultimately lazy associates as long as those associates are ""yes men."" The pay is fine but you are lied to about getting raises. New hires will be started off at as higher rate of pay than more experienced associates and reporting this will get you written up because you are not allowed to speak about your pay."
bad,"Training was a hassle due to the need for employees on the floor"
bad,i had a super easy job but they had bad management they had their favoritism nobody ever did their job they would pick their favorites and they got away with everything.
bad,"Everything is very unconsistent,  you have to be a favorite if you want to move up, hours are all over the place.  Been there for 3 years now working my butt off and i am still only part time.  always a hard worker and not really rewarded at all for it in any way.  the yearly raise is pathetic and if new people get hired 90% of them will start out making more than you currently make."
bad,"the only thing that i like working at walmart is that it helps pay the bills, but the company is very bad at treating there workers good it's a lot of stress working there."
bad,Stressful  no work life balance management is a joke  at one time this was a great place to work but as the saying goes one bad manager can ruin a whole crew
bad,Walmart has a problem with not promoting the right people.  I worked there for many years and was passed up for promotion too many times when I had earned it.
bad,"Working at Walmart was very boring.The job duties were easy, just lack of work.  You have a 30 minute break. You have to stand up eight hours, with light 10 minutes breaks, in between hours. I learn to never except a job that don't have any work to do."
bad,"It's a job, not a career. Keep your expectations low. If you're able to move up in the company, it is a great place to learn new skills you can use in search of a career."
bad,"All anyone cares about is results,who gets it done or how said problem is solved is not a issue, often too the detriment of the customers and associates."
bad,"I had the best coworkers a person could ask for. My fellow Wal-Mart employees were all The nicest people. However, you give up everything from Christmas Eve to New Years to your children's activities to your health to work for Wal-Mart; the lousy pay is NOT worth it. I was a cashier, which is the most non-stimulating job I ever had. I thought I was going to die from boredom. My legs would swell and hurt, and it was the slowest time has ever moved for me. I liked my customers, again -I loved my coworkers, but I never saw my children. Ever. After you give all your time to Wal-mart during the holidays, they always cut your hours way down in January, so there is no way you could ever pay bills. Everyone got sick. Everyone ended up with some major health issue. A body is not meant to stand in one spot for nine to ten hours per day."
bad,Walmart is Walmart but nothing really to say about the company. nothing negative i am grateful i even have a job at that time. working for the was a challenge
bad,"My first supervisor was great, she'd listen to your ideas as well as your concerns. The second supervisor not so much. Biggest problem I had was the person that did the schedule,  everyone else in the department I worked got every other or at least every third weekend off however I was scheduled EVERY weekend  & when attempted to discuss with the scheduler was told if scheduled hours were a problem he could find someone else. Also schedule posted online wasn't always what was ""hand written"" one at work was. I went in on a couple of occasions to find my schedule had been changed, without notification, & had to cancel some appointments scheduled days prior."
bad,Walmart was just a stepping stone for me I personally did not enjoy it management was slow to react to complaints and needs of employees I was a nursing mother at the time and they reluctantly allowed me to pump and it was in a dressing room did not provide reasonable accommodations for my needs as the law states.
bad,I worked for the same location on two separate occasions and both time I was grossly overwhelmed by the overall lack of management. There seems to be an attitude of acceptance towards mediocrity as far as the entire company is concerned.
bad,"I really love my accounting position at Walmart. Walmart could be a very good place to work, but I believe that they expect to much out of there people. Walmart had a lot of good hard working people that work for them, but I don’t think that the upper management treats their people right. It seems like that in the last few years they have lost a lot of good hard working people that have been with this company for a long time have left this company."
bad,"Typical day at work would be me coming in and fixing issues that were not fixed by previous shift. I was crossed trained across the whole store I enjoyed that. Management was iffy due to the fact that some management cared and took pride in there job,had their associates best interest and stores while others just sat around and could care less and slack off and not care about the associates. Not every location is like that, but at mine it was. The hardest part of my job was pleasing management, because if you were not a favorite more work for you. The most enjoyable part of the job was at the end of the year we would get a Thanksgiving and Christmas meal."
bad,"I would not recommend that anyone work at Walmart unless it is the best option for them. In the tire lube express, we accept cars until five minutes before closing. Meaning, despite the fact that we close at 7PM, we have to accept several jobs that will make us stay for hours overtime."
bad,some employees did not want to do their jobs and looked to others to do it for them. They would often get awy with this. Management showed favoritism to many workers.
bad,Coming to Wal-Mart from the fast-paced and more liberal work environment of Sonic was a shock. You cannot do anything that isn't in your job description and there is no sense of freedom. Wal-Mart exists solely to hire the first person that applies and meets some simple criteria and don't care about the quality of their employees or how their employees are treated by management.
bad,Basic retail. Good for college students or anyone that wants relatively chill part time work. Company is trash and could pull of a COSTCO model if it tried. But they greedy.
bad,"Love my responsibilities as a Shopper at Walmart.  Love my schedule (4-1pm), my colleagues and the customers.  Walmart management needs more training specially dealing with their employees."
bad,"The Walmart in Copperas cove, I wouldn’t recommend anyone to work there, management is a joke, coworkers are all rude. It’s a depressing place to work, they do not help you work around your schedule at all"
bad,Work life balance is nonexistent for management. You work more than 50 hours a week alot and night shifts then day shifts. PTO is not granted often. Good job for single people but if you have a family you never see them.
bad,literally the only good thing about working at walmart is pay and it isnt even that great. I am convinced that the only reason walmart can keep people employed is the pay.
bad,I didn't have a great time working here. The hours were long and the pay was low. It was just a job while I was in college. There were many times I didn't know what I should be doing too.
bad,"I loved my job 5 years ago, but since the ownership has changed, so did the environment. What used to be a reliable stable job, became an unrealistic place to be."
bad,"Easy work, difficult dealing with Management.  Human Resources is not helpful towards working reporting an internal issue with other workers. Can quickly be promoted"
bad,"Walmart doesn't usually care about its employees, or others in general. I learned this after it was too late to really quit, and was fired after being ""incompetent""."
bad,No family life at Walmart. Doesn't care about time off for vacation or family functions. It's all about money and customers. You can not get time off every year you have pto time leftover which you were unable to use.
bad,"I loved the food service part, but always seemed to irritate the accounting dept with late deposits.  They wanted things delivered to them at a certain time, while I was putting the food away, cleaning the kitchen, and observing kitchen protocols."
bad,Walmart is a good place to work if you're a kid in high school just trying to make some money but for those trying to pay bills and life a stable life it is a no. The hours are very inconstant. If  you apply for a cashier potion you are automatically considered part time so you RARELY see 40 hrs a week. At most you will receive 20-32 hours. You get a discount card but its only 10% and it rarely ever takes anything off of purchases.As big a the company is I'm sure they can afford to give a bigger discount than that.
bad,"Walmart, despite my negative review has helped me in my time there for the 10 years of service.  I learned much about the world, people, how management works despite all the flaws of the company.   It helped me grow as a person and I learned from the bad, but not becoming that part of the bad equation myself and stuck to my principles.  I kept the good parts to my heart.  I hope for all those that enter Walmart find better opportunities unless they end up fortunate in their path there."
bad,"If you are looking for a place that doesn't care about its employees, than Walmart is the place for you. They don't listen to your voice and they expect you to fo everything with no help."
bad,"I was very very sick with a bad ear infection, I had came into work to push through my shift on cash because I didn't want to leave my managers short handed. After telling the manager I was dizzy and needed to go to the doctor because my ear had begun to bleed. I was told I couldn't leave and to get back to my job. After leaving I was written up even after bringing back my doctors note."
bad,New organization of management made the environment too stressful. The management at the store I worked at was very inconsistent would not back lower levels of management
bad,A typical day at Wal-mart was okay. Sometimes i felt as though the management was very unprofessional. Being a cashier there wasn't so bad but I really felt like I needed a better job at the time.
bad,worked at walmart for almost 15 years. my main issue is with managers playing favorites. most people just want fair and consistent .was very rare and those were my favorite managers
bad,"Fix what breaks, usually caused by employees, 90% self inflicted"
bad,This is a place that doesn't care about their employees unless you are a butt kisser and you are buddy buddy with management.  Very stressful  and they no long want to hire full time.
bad,Working at walmart was great for the experience but it was hard to get the job done right when 10 different managers want and expect different things. The management needs to work on staying consistent.
bad,"Short working hours to avoid pay insurance. No raise. You are always replaceable."
bad,Has a very friendly environment and the people are nice.  The people are what make the environment workable even though some days are hard to get through.
bad,"Walmart used to be about family. Now they have the worst reputation and are all about the dollar. They treat their associates poorly. The pay is horrible and management doesn't communicate. Tons of favoritism. The reality of it is, if you don't like what you do or who you do it for, find a new line of work because your productivity is a reflection of your attitude."
bad,"Experiences vary widely from location to location, but for the most part, what we've come to view as the Walmart employee stereotype, became the example of unmotivated misery for a reason. Walmart employs a LOT of wonderful people, and I do feel they've been unfairly singled out for their low-wages, and unethical behavior...they are, by no means the only corporation to adopt this as the standard. In fact, the pay and benefits found in equivalent positions with other retailers tend to be slightly better. That being said, the Walmart ""culture"" of anti-union, policies regarding coaching for improvement (being written up), and the average store-level associate seeing their annual pay increase by just forty cents (often less)...there's plenty of demotivation to go around. We are seeing a surge in the number of self-check-outs, and a push for both mobile app, and online purchase options to keep driving corporate profits, while streamlining overhead costs associated with the number of positions not rendered obsolete by automation. Associates are seeing positions eliminated company-wide, and the workload being redistributed (often unrealistically) to a crew already sparsely staffed. Burnout is rampant. Walmart's ""open door"" policy is what they offer as their alternative to unionizing available to any associate seeking a way to advocate for themselves in a confidential, fair, and open manner, without any fear of retribution, or unfair treatment. Its a great concept on paper, but in my own ten years' experience, I can think of few associates whose outcome following their initiation of"
bad,Wal-Mart is very strict with very little consideration of their associates . any time your late you receive a point any time you call out you will receive a point 4 points total you are terminated no matter the circumstances
bad,I would recommend people to work but they don’t know how to treat they workers. They don’t know how to help and work with people. They have nasty attitudes.
bad,Not happy at all Walmart will get you in the door and ok the rules and everything changed later. The hour go from 40 to 18 fast and you get 4 hours a day shifts
bad,"I spent three years there and never got promoted even with trying. I was expected to do more than my fair share of work on any given day. There was not a lot of respect from some of the management, if you had a personal problem you where told to figure it out or get fired. If you where sick you were still expected to show up for work. I was told that although i was running a fever of 103 i was still required to show up yo work my shift."
bad,"Walmart constantly tells people to follow procedure and do things by the ""One Best Way"" guide. For the workers it's not a guide, it's the gospel. At least until the first salaried manager tell you to do it ""the old way."" If you tell them you are going by the OBW guide, they tell you it's just a suggestion. "
bad,poor management that prides themselves on their turnover rates and completely against flexible scheduling. management looks for reasons towards disciplinary action without justification
bad,"When you interview, they tell you to dress to impress, not that you didnt know that already, they push you way to much, they expect you to k ow everything"
bad,I isn't really like it. I felt like I really worked hard and didn't get paid  nothing. Their hours u work one day would be mornings then the next day nights u never knew what shift u would be on
bad,"it was a very unpleasant but interesting experience. very miserable coworkers, mean managers, rude customers and always filled with people. but overall the pay was decent for the mean time."
bad,Work environment is no longer inclusive. Senior Management ignored industry trend and has become a headwind for the company. The culture has been turn on it's head.
bad,No me gusta por q uno no puede optar a otro cargo puedes estar toda tu vida haciendo lo mismo
bad,I did not enjoy my employment as an overnight sticker due to the ethics and management style of one manager. I might have stayed and advanced but could not work for this abusive manager.
bad,"it was like a family, then corporate came in and terminated long time employees and replaced them, management was lousy and they treated the hourly associates horribly, I will never go back"
bad,"Working for Walmart was an unique experience, the days went by quick due to how busy the store was. However management made life at work very frustrating. They would refuse to schedule for your needs, and there were more managers than associates."
bad,"Worked for Walmart in the summer, the job was very easy to get but that is about the best thing about it. Hours were all over the place, generally opening but sometimes midday or closing shift. The assistant store mgr to my department wasn't too bad but was not very personable or helpful. The section mgr my department was awful. Job was very difficult for minimum pay."
bad,"Ridicules pay ,with bad management , resulting in bad work ethic with employees causing lots of turnover, employees expected to do work of 4 employees without comparable pay."
bad,"A day in the life of a Walmart associate involves working hard, listening to management, following direction and completing daily tasks. Pay is low for the amount of work done. Associates that are not productive remain as associates when they should be replaced."
bad,"Do you want to be treated like you mean nothing? Are you comfortable with never missing a day of work, in fear that you'll lose your job, even if you have a doctor's note? That's what working for Walmart is. You are nothing more than a nut or bolt in their machine, have some dignity and find somewhere better to work."
bad,"Wrongly terminated , did not agree with their decision and very upset that it happened. Other parties involved barely got punished. Feel store manager had it out for me."
bad,I would never ask that anyone work at walmart the managers take advantage of you and will look for any excuse to fire you.  The only thing that made the job bearable is the people that are there miserable with you.
bad,Working here was as stressful as work gets; hours flexed sometimes without employees knowing. A lot of people were in and out of my workplace due to management not knowing how to properly address their associates and for unfair work environment. My job was not hard but the people I sometimes had to work with were a nightmare. It also does very little to encourage people to work when the managers are biased (that is just my opinion based on my own observation).  I did not enjoy working for Walmart at all and wold not recommend it to anyone.
bad,"I applied to be electronics and I got put into Lawn & Garden.  Fine whatever.  However, I often got put by myself having to do register, zoning, and managing the department alone and there is absolutely no way to do that BY YOURSELF ON A SUNDAY ONE TO TEN PM."
bad,"When I first started at Walmart it was perfect. I was able to take my college class and still get the hours I needed to pay my bills. I also didn't have to worry about my anxiety attacks getting me fired. Fast forward 3 (almost 4) years later. They changed their attendance policy to a point system. My anxiety attacks are going to get me fired eventually. Yes, I'm even on medication for them. Also, they changed the way they do their scheduling. I now have to choose between being able to pay my bills and taking the classes I need to get my degree. Other than those issues, I enjoy working there."
bad,"This job I barely made ends meat at, and the company is drama filled everyone there seemed to be out to get me and do not end up treating all individuals equally. When they say you get a 10% discount they mean only on stuff that you do not need and not food products."
bad,There is not much room for advancement and there is a lot of favoritism that goes on in the workplace between management and certain employees. It is difficult to get full time.
bad,"There are dozen managers daily, all of them complaining about something.  The management does not acknowledge their employees, they don't greet them, they don't speak to them unless it's to yell at them, they don't speak, they yell."
bad,they will hire any one for any job they will make you do any thing even if you are to old to work that hard most managment is out to make them selfs look good at your pain
bad,"It’s a job I can’t really complain because it’s pay isn’t a little better than most places but, the things you have to deal with and the amount of hours a week is just not worth it the pay and hours aren’t enough to live in todays economy."
bad,I learned a lot while at Walmart but the environment isn't someplace I like to work. Stressful and minimal room to move up in the company. The culture wasn't one I'd work in any longer.
bad,"I wouldnt recommend this place but I really did like working here.  I had a pretty work girlfriend at every corner of the store.  & would talk to them almost daily.  It was fun to be around so many people.  Little hectic on black fridays & holidays but nothing a shopping pro like myself not used to.  My review is different cause im me, didnt make lots but wasnt necessary."
bad,"Ambiente de trabajo malo, los gerentes abusa de su poder, las horas extras mal pagadas ($10.01 la hora) los supervisores no están bien capacitados"
bad,walmart wants you to do your job plus three others jobs as well. they find ways to blame you for things even if you did not do it. they do not like for you to think out of their box.
bad,"I am under contract after the restructure to refrain from causing the company any embarrassment. "
bad,Lowest paid associates work the hardest. Management rarely pitches into to set good examples for employees. Company has several different clicks that do not blend well with a company as a whole which causes miscommunication and problems between employees.
bad,"Walmart is a good job for someone who has open availability throughout the week because they will get scheduled for more hours. Starting pay is good money and you get evaluated for yearly raises. Walmart has a no fire policy, you only get removed from the schedule when you miss 6 days in a 6 month rolling period. There are no sick days even with a doctors note. The attendance policy sucks and is why most people quit. Its a great job to work during college since it pays good and they always need help. However, they expect you to do a lot in a little amount of time but if you can stick with all the stress and poor management you can make decent money."
bad,Although i learned a lot at Walmart. there was a lot of favoritism and management rarely heard complaints and changed things. When things were changed it was to force associates into other departments.
bad,"Some of the managers at Square One Walmart are very strict; they have realistic goals and most of the time unprofessional. If you by any chance call in sick, they will call you throughout the day and convince you that you could just take medicine and come in for work. They prioritize the company before their employees well-being. One of the times they called me in for work knowing I was at school. That's why some of the managers here are hard to handle at times. "
bad,As a Department manager I had several responsibilities. I had 3-4 associates scheduled to my department and was expected to delegate the responsibilities to them. I would have loved to have done that but as soon as my associates would clock on the front-end managers would take them up to the registers before I could ever see them. I was still expected to complete everything daily but didn't ever have the help that I needed.
bad,"It's Walmart, so everything is exactly as you would expect. Management positions are primarily staffed by sociopaths. Would not recommend unless you need a flexible schedule."
bad,"Although pay was good overall employee productivity & goals where heald high & hard to achieve. Not an easy job, very fast paced. Somewhat of a stressful & competitive job."
bad,The managers do not know how to do their jobs! They do not appreciate their employees! They are hard to find and never answer their walkies! It a joke
bad,"Typical day started with a fast paced unload of a truck filled with merchandise, after Truck was unloaded onto pallets or carts CAP Team will go and stock shelves with truck merchandise or from overstock areas, Management always pushes the employees to perform better: sometimes setting unrealistic goals and deadlines for the associates to achieve."
bad,When I started back in 2017 I thought Walmart was a great place to work. I was wrong after working hard I wanted to be a manager which was a joke they never got back to me on that...they said we will work on it but didn't work nothing out.. Also the people that out hired after me they have more hours then me...
bad,"I enjoyed Walmart but I got fired for a misunderstanding, which I took the problem to the manager and the manager didn’t do anything so the problem got bigger and I kept getting picked at until I couldn’t take it nomore"
bad,"everything you've heard is true. they don't treat their employees with much respect, more like dollar signs. they care more about the sale than how their people are treated and seen by the customers. "
bad,"they do not care for you and the pay is super low. I don't like the management they don't help with bad"
bad,The benefits have decreased over the years. The hours have gotten horrible. The electronic scheduling is a joke. Balancing work and personal life is no such thing. Work is expected to come first. It boils down to the all mighty dollar.
bad,"Walmart claims to be an associate based company.  Walk into the Milford Walmart and ask the associates how many people feel that way.  I was let go for reading documents in personnel (my department) that i was told were confidential.  I was handed those documents by an asst mgr in response to my asking ""what do you mean:.. he handed them to me in answer to my question."
bad,"I was threatened and accused several times over by managers. extremely stressful work environment, where we are treated like slaves. managers don't care about the store quality."
bad,"talk down to employees and use fear to control employees, I enjoyed the techs I worked with who showed me how to do the job that I had no idea of what I was doing. the bay managers were some what cool but were groomed to have no people skills or problem solving management."
bad,they need a lot of help with the way they treat employ and traning  their mange team and replace some so bad the job was fast past and demange but good and staidey
bad,"Care only about production don't care how it effects work staff.  Poor heath insurance unless  you have a major accident,.  Does have good dental and vision.  They like to make up rules whenever the like to."
bad,Walmart is a great place to work when you have nowhere else to go. You get nine-hour shifts with one-hour lunch breaks. You will enjoy the work if you can deal with management's horrible skills. The best parts of the day are when you get to complain about the management to other workers.
bad,There is too much drama and the job was very stressful.  All of that combined does not work very well for a happy work environment. I was only supposed to work 20 hours a week but continuously got scheduled for 30+ hours.
bad,I would recommend someone to work at the Wal-Mart store as I enjoyed working there while in highschool. I would not however recommend to someone working at the distribution center. I normally worked 12-14 hours a day 4-5 days a week. The management is terrible and the mission seems to be to run the employees until the cannot function.
bad,Walmart is a Terrible place I don’t care about his employees only care about upper management they don’t take care nobody they always take favorites they always show favoritism if you don’t go along with the management team you’re most likely going to get fired in the process they always work too hard when they don’t like you and they don’t take time to actually sit down and help your schedule
bad,And manage ment manage ment makes you feel unimportant and like ypur a nobody And talk down to you . And they hire people know I g they have health issues and will miss days and say it won't be a problem and you won't get points and they still give you the points.
bad,Ok job it just have poor management. I would come to work thinking I will be on the cashier Register and when I get there they would put me outside to push carts Which I don’t mind doing but I’m a cashier and they have doing it everyday since I been working there and they also hired more cart pushers and I’m still pushing carts..
bad,"Only work there if you are already a bit dead inside. It’s a drain on the soul, and you can feel that in every co worker who you interact with. Do not be mislead by any attempts to look better, Walmart will fire you on a dime for any reason they choose and they have no true loyalty to their employees (unless you’re a long haul trucker). The big bonus they gave out was claimed to be because of the new GOP tax plan, but in reality they closed hundreds of stores and canned a bunch of upper management to bring the bonus to the employees. Just stay away."
bad,It's a ok place to work if management was completely replaced. My management had their favorite employees that they would let do what ever they wanted and have the rest of the employees that didn't brown nose them do their work load on top of what they were already assigned.
bad,"You would get written up if you missed work when you were ill. Even if you had a doctors excuse, they would write you up and give points. That would cause you to lose your job after so many points."
bad,"I've worked for Walmart for almost 15 yrs. and was mostly tolerated until recently. I am a fast- paced worker and still isn't noted as such and sent to pick up slack from slower workers. I would like to know what I'm suppose to do from the get-go and not switched because someone doesn't want to work in a certain area. Their pay is okay and their benefits area okay as well, though."
bad,Stressful workplace poor management. Nobody ever tells you tje info you need to know until there yelling at u for not doing stuff you dont know and they except you to know how to do everything in the world and except u to do it to
bad,Lot of items to stock. Expect to help your coworkers when your done with your duty. Clean up your mess when done. Never clock out without clean your area.
bad,"Walmart wasn't bad when I first started, but the last few years were miserable. It became an unbearable work environment. Associates and managers were very negative. They say there's room to advance at Walmart.....yeah right. It all depends on who you are. If you're not a suck up, you go no where fast. That's not even the half of it.  It finally got so bad, I would cry on my way to work because I knew what I was headed in to. Glad they cut my hours from 32/week to 8 every other week. Gave me a chance to get out of there."
bad,"Company policy is for team effort, but if you ask for assistance from other employees in your department you get in trouble.  Policies regarding how many associates are to be in a department during shifts are never met even when it violates security policy.  Co-workers are friendly but management is detached."
bad,You work all hours and sometime do get your break. Managers do not have your back when you try to enforce the policy. They can fire you for any given reason.
bad,I’m truely grateful for the opportunity to obtain my cpht through Walmart and a somewhat flexible schedule for school aside from that i left work crying pretty much every day because the patients are just nasty. Majority of my day was spent as a cashier and not actually filling prescriptions. I was never offered benefits even though i was working full time hours for over 6 months even when i went to inquire about my benefits they said my manager had to put me in the system as a full time employee which if you know anything about Walmart they hate doing that. My friends were making wayyyy more working for other companies and had been working in the field for the same amount of time. Overall avoid the company... avoid any retail pharmacy for that matter. If you are absolutely desperate and want to get your Cpht license for free go for it.
bad,"Never know where you will be working until you get there."
bad,"Unless you are willing to constantly push to be reviewed for a different position, you are not advanced. Even when you try for advancement if you are making more than what the ""manager"" position offers they cut your pay. Management is lacking in support to the store and there is a high turn over rate."
bad,Walmart believes it's work force belongs to them. Any time you have is Walmart's to use. Your free time is only yours if Walmart doesn't feel it needs it. It is demanded that you work whenever they say. They don't have holidays and they don't pay holiday pay. They will apply extra penalties for missing work above and beyond what would normally be applied whenever they want to. The company is not bound by any rules because they can change them whenever they want. The rules are very strictly enforced on YOU however.
bad,Depending on which Walmart your hired at will determine your home lifestyle and stress levels. Some Walmart are very easy and laid back while other Walmart will work every minute out of your shift...my suggestions would be ask a employees how the work/home balances is before applying for any location.
bad,"Worked in pharmacy. One manager turned it into a street corner supplier for ""pain relief"" patients. New manager spoke to us in baby talk. No a bad job if ran properly."
bad,You are pushed hard to meet your goals and the goals are unrealistic at times. When you loose someone on your team its take quiet some time to get a replacement.
bad,Too many things change and it all rolls downhill if you catch my drift. Policies change all the time and there is not any way to adapt successfully without learning to change quickly.
bad,fast paced-long hours-have to vacation hours to fill in hours during slow times which are plenty- work 10-12 hours a day without lunch breaks only get two 15 minute breaks a day- hot in summer cold in winter
bad,"management undermines its own employees. doesn't pay attention to the major needs of the store, and treats their employees like dogs. a good place to work as a temp job but never as a long-term job"
bad,I work  as the stocker and we pick from backroom to pulls to stock supplies stress hurry to finish it . not good place to work . not provide interpreter for sign language
bad,I really didn't mind working there except for the scheduling could have better and I had a family that needed me but the policy didn't allow that. That's why I left.
bad,Walmart’s management team is a total hack. All there is is people on pedestals. I love working hard for people who can show equal respect. Walmart needs a revamp bad.
bad,"With Walmart trying to compete with Amazon, there are constant re-structures and changes that make its employees feel like there is no job security, at any level."
bad,other employees would not do nothing really and would leave me out there by myself and go to break room i was always alone and i didnt like it cus i felt like they were too aggressive
bad,"A customer service manager spends a great deal of time enforcing proper operations in the store, according to its job description. This includes getting change for cashiers, preparing cash registers and auditing registers for shortages. They must also handle customer complaints and concerns, as well as training employees."
bad,"There is NO space long enough for me to be concise enough to tell you that you DONT want a future at ANY walmart. if you like being appreciated for anything, DONT WORK HERE. Ukiah walmart is rundown, disgusting (especially the bathrooms) and the managers are idiots."
bad,"The political system within Walmart is utter garbage. Within my first year and a half of working at Walmart I worked above and beyond and took charge every opportunity I could, including taking up roles of department managers and supervisors of my own team. Each of these times being promised an advancement and then passed up for someone either moving around (Department Managers) or by people who were less qualified. There was even a time where there was two positions open for supervisor over my team and I was working as the temporary supervisor while also receiving a interview for it and given positive marks to just be told they gave it a transfer and a overnight associate which in his first day of asked me where freight went and how to do the job! I slowly lost interest in moving up and after two years they gave me 3 coaching within 6 months period just to keep me where I was. I realized the rumors were true, if your good where your at, don't expect to be moved up unless you kiss a few things I wont mention."
bad,Most managers at WalMart are young and under trained. Promotions are based on popularity rather than hard work. Compassion and sympathy does not exist.
bad,"I work in the online grocery pickup department and while my job is easy, my management sucks. Ive been trying to leave to another department fo4 about 5 months and they always come up with excuses on why i cant be moved. Hours are good in my department at least but go anywhere else and you'll barely have 15. Manager is constantly berating us and threatening to fire people. Gives certain associates special treatment with schedules and makes unnecessary comments to associates about other associates. We've gone through 3 department managers in the last 5 month's."
bad,The work I do there I don't feel like i get Paid enough and we don't get the raise that we earned since they bumped up the hourly rate and the stocker's do the most work but don't get paid.
bad,It was good place to work but over the years it start to change and management treated that their workers wrong. I don't want to leave but it got to point that they forgot that people have lives and family I got take care and feed
bad,the OBW that the company has adopted is law for the company has been ill introduced and has made absolutely no sence to add the receivings of Fedex and UPS without the training that an associate needs to do their job. The mana gement team from the store manager to the APmanager whom I understand was incharge of the training did not make any or much of an attempt to make this happen.Coachings took place without any help or training.Poorly handled period.
bad,I put in my 2 week notice due to relocation. A year later I come to find that my previous manager listed me as fired and that I’m now not eligible for rehirement.
bad,"My availability is open. they encourage it for anyone who wants hours consistently. This means i work a variety of hours and never have the same schedule or days off. if you open to handle putting the money out and making sure the store is ready for the day. If you close you put all the money away and and ensure that all the customer are out of the building. both have their ups and downs but no matter what shift i work my job always includes, giving cashiers breaks and lunches, having enough registers open we don't have lines, giving out change and taking money from overflowing registers, auditing registers, handling customer complaints, troubleshooting technology problems and associate scheduling errors, and making sure the day goes smoothly. It is always busy for my position, as we handle the majority of issues in the store and are expected to keep up with the work flow regardless of staffing and upper management availability. occasionally i have to fill in for the upper management with phone calls and and associate issues. As a matter of fact they are encouraged to come to CSM's (me) before all other managers.   Due to all this, in my five years i have learned quite a few multi-tasking techniques and gained problem solving abilities, plus an abundance of irreplaceable people skills. As exhausting as this job can be, at the end of the day, your attitude is what can make this job good or not. Associates and customers from a variety of backgrounds and cultures will visit the store and can make the experience enjoyable if you allow it."
bad,The management at the Wal-Mart i worked at was not friendly at all. They only care about themselves and would put on a total different face when their bosses came in.
bad,"A typical day at work was standing at the register for 2 hours then take a break and then back on for 2 hours. I liked this because it broke up the day."
bad,Issues throughout the company hardly ever get solved. People that work twice as hard do not make the amount of money of somebody who doesnt do their job. Management is often found doing a lot of talking and no work
bad,"This was the worst job I've ever had. The management was unorganized and rude. It was nearly impossible to get time off, even with a doctors note saying you were sick."
bad,I was an excellent / hard worker there and they let me go cause of medical problems. The management is lazy and not compassionate enough bout their employees.
bad,Supervisor and Manager socialize  and are seldom available to assist the techs with customer service.  They are not supportive of the techs and unnecessarily critical of the techs.
bad,Wal-mart expects extreme amounts of effort for very little pay. You are always expected to go faster no matter how well you do on the job and they care very little about your personal happiness at work.
bad,Management expects too much while not having enough employees to do the work that needs to be done. They purposely understaff the stores to save money but then berate employees for not having their work done. It's impossible to win at Walmart.
bad,Don't care enough about there employees felt unappreciated. Not paying there employees enough pay for hard labor that we put in for the company. I will never recommend somebody to work at Walmart
bad,They always late with breaks when you need a manger assistant they wait an hour before coming to you and the mangers are disrespectful and the older workers always belittle the younger workers
bad,The schedulers at Wal-Mart refused anyone to get more than 32 hours in a week. There were five managers who never communicated and blamed employees when they didn't know what was going on. Shift rotation was unreliable and schedules always went up late.
bad,Management isn't willing to help associates when they are in need and don't care when they need days for personal issues. They do not work with your availability and are rude to associates and customers alike. Policy is not followed for anyone.
bad,"Start the day stocking your area because night shift cant. Deal with rude and angry customers do to co-worker mistake. I knew everything coming in but the training is reliade on the computer,none of the managers Know what there doing and are off 4-5days out of the week. We run out of stock but they still want us to sell what we don't have available. The only thing that maid the day was a joke from a fellow workers or working with my friends every other day."
bad,the management was horrible and they were not very professional with how they ran things. i didn't get paid what i was supposed to be paid and they never had enough employees so we were always behind.
bad,Poor staffing and poor management they didn’t help when you are alone in your department and the dress it gives you isn’t worth the pay and the hours are inconsistent
bad,"I didn’t like working there at all , it was to much drama and not enough working. They also did not pay right always cut me short of my pay. Management had no respect ."
bad,Would get assigned to a department with a piece count and time and worked at a pace of urgency to get product on the shelf. helped people by answering questions as well as showing product.
bad,"Walmart is the epitome of bleak, mindless, post-modernity, lacking in culture or standards, with no sign of life within its pale walls."
bad,"There is too much work place politics, there is no opportunity for advancement. Hours worked are excessive compared to compensation .The good thing about Wal-Mart is your get a steady pay check every two weeks."
bad,"Say they value employees, and want to hold onto long time associates, but do not compensate them accordingly.  Gave them plenty of chances, but four years of being undercompensated and feeling underappreciated were more than enough for me."
bad,I did my 100% best til the end of my shift.. I have management qualities and was overlooked for positions I interviewed for.  I feel like when I spoke up my opinion was pushed to the side
bad,"Working here means working to the bone every day you here being either 3 or 4 days a week. Production quotas are unrealistic and will get you terminated. All management cares about is numbers and not in the slightest if you actually tried your best, it just won't be good enough."
bad,"working at Walmart was an experience all on its own. Some of the assistant managers were helpful others were rude and not so helpful."
bad,the attendance policy is not fair for a normal person especially if you are a single parent. there is no lee way. often have to work overtime to get tasks done and then coached on working overtime. too many chiefs who do not know the roles they are managing
bad,The managers don't know how to talk to their employees. Constant belittlement and they show no signs of caring at all or trying to help with problems with the employees.
bad,I Was fired without a written warning or single days notice after reporting coworkers for abusing perscription medication on shift. While working harder than anyother department with a pay differencial that was actually nulled out three months into my employment. So starting wage was the same aeound the entire store as employees would generate raises they cancled them.  But continued to give managers and supervisors differential pay raises based on department. A
bad,"benefits are great, hours aren't bad. management could use some help. you get 2 15 minute breaks and an hour lunch during 8 hour shifts. get decent vacation time"
bad,On top of horrible pay there was also horrible treatment very unprofessional with cursing on the sales floor when I worked there I had to my job plus extra work cause other were sloppy at there work left messes ect
bad,"Easy to advance hard work to keep your promotion "
bad,Walmart was a very disorganized place to work for and teamwork was not encouraged and on the contrary the management would write a employee up for working as a team.  The computer training that we had new hires complete emphasize teamwork; but our management didn’t adhere to corporate policies.  We went through employees like a revolving door.
bad,"I think it was the particular location I was working at and the management that discouraged me from continuing working at Wal-Mart. My managers were particularly rude and created a lot of unneeded stress. They were unprofessional and expected work to be done in an unreasonable time frame. I understand when the stock was smaller, but during our bigger truck nights, we were expected to complete stocking an organizing within an impossible impossible time frame. They offered advancement with a pay cut and had me work full-time under part-time position and it didn't seem fair considering the amount of work I did and how quickly I had picked up on things."
bad,The Job itself is not too demanding either physically or mentally however the 2 biggest issues with this company are the customers and the management. The management is often out of line or they believe they have more power over their employees or their customers than they actually do. The customers themselves are something that the company has no control over and I do not hold their actions against the company however I believe the words Hazard pay should be in the payment plan.
bad,"The biggest problem is that promotions and advancement are given based on who you know, education and performance is hardly considers specially on higher positions; to get into above co manager you must  have a ""sponsor"", regardless your performance they are going to look for someone to blame."
bad,Great to have on your resume. They turn over 100% their replenishment teams every two years due to the work environment. Pay is not that competitive to industry standards and what suppliers in the area pay.
bad,I work overnights. I no longer want to work nights and am wanting to find other employment. Overnights is draining my health. I've asked to move to days and they won't let me.
bad,"(At My Location) Due to The Lack of Professionalism and Knowledge from Management, This Is, and Has been The Most Stressful and Unfullfilling Job Experience EVER! This Is a Prime Example of Making What Should be a Uncomplicated, Enjoyable, Unstressful, Job... A Stressful, Complicated, Unenjoyable, Workplace. (At My Location) WE AS CASHIERS, THE ONES WHO ACTUALLY DO OUR JOBS, ARE DEFINITELY UNDER PAID! IT IS A VERY HIGH PACED, DEMANDING, STRESSFUL, HOSTILE,  ENVIRONMENT."
bad,"While each store location differs, bottom line:"
bad,"Walmart was an ok job. I loved the customers and some management, but they switch things up a lot and dont give out the memo. This makes the job stressful."
bad,"Although the discount is nice at times, there’s many things about this job that wasn’t a fit for me. The management is unfair, the other workers gossip way too much and gets everyone in trouble. You’re on your own at this job and I feel as if in a work place you and others need to be a team."
bad,"The pay is way lower than they give for the work you have to do, no benefits and a strict dress code with stupid fitting ugly vests that make you sweat your muffin top off!"
bad,My son has special needs and it was really hard to get days off and I needed to take him to places that he needed to go. I had to close my availability to be able to take him to places so they cut my hours.
bad,"When it comes to wal-mart its all business. some jobs you get to know your fellow employees and eventually are like a family, not here. its cut throat, everyone is constantly competeing  for their own job. its actually rare to see the same person working at wal-mart for more then a few months."
bad,relaxed place to work but not benefits and no overtime was offered nor given at the time of working management was not great at all lack of professionalism and respect
bad,although many hours are available managers are overworked which enables them to be demeaning to associates . i had no time with my newborn and was expected to come back to work immediately.
bad,It’s at your discretion.. everybody’s different so everyone’s experience is different this is just my opinion about them I never got my raise they refuse to move me to other departments so i can advance and there’s no sick days etc..
bad,Worked for 6 years. Never got an advancement in my job. Managers write you up for things that are not true. They fired employees that I know that did a great job.
bad,"At the time that I was working for Wal-Mart I was young and want to make money. "
bad,"The management was poor, the managers had favorites and treated the other hard working employees harsh an in a disrespectable manner. Upper management protected their favorites who did not have to work while the ones who did work got in trouble."
bad,"If you are desperate for work, then work here. But be careful as management is cut-throat. I was discriminated against by one of the manager's friends and was threatened to be fired. So I quit and haven't looked back."
bad,the most enjoyable part of the job was checking out customers. smiling and greeting every customer with 10 feet of you. A typical day at the workplace was fast place checking out and ring the item up re stocking the shelf.
bad,merchandising and sometimes cashier the managers were very rude with associates I liked working there but some associates were nice and some were very rude
bad,"I worked in one of the highest performing stores in the market, but the culture is terrible. It's only gotten worse since I left too. Walmart treats all of their employees as dispensable cogs."
bad,Job is very stressed full and management makes the job harder . Their so many people above you that you have to listen to but none of them are on the same page. Management is very rude and disrespectful often making work less productive
bad,"Overall it was an ok- job. Management sucks. If you had an issue with a supervisor, management will take their side just because they are above you. They made you stay mandatory overttime with a 1 hour warning prior to the overttime"
bad,Your value of an employee to this company is how far and how deeply you will sacrifice your life for their needs as opposed to individual availability or capability.  Thrown under the bus the second you are no longer needed despite lotalty and time dedicated to their cause.
bad,"I met some enjoyable people, but for the most part, no other associates spoke to me unless they wanted me to clean something up, then they'd shoo me away. My co-workers still acted as if they were in high school, and I also had to put up with some incredibly rude customers."
bad,"Reviewed and maintained modular updates on store level, implemented scheduled changes and updated computer systems to reflect said changes, organized and maintained physical store fixtures, trained and lead mod personnel, setup displays, forklift certified"
bad,"this is my 16th year use to love coming to work, this year not so much,  hardest part of the job is getting hours to run department, most enjoyable is that you get to see families grow and develop regular customers ."
bad,Ask a question to any associate about a product or policy and no body knows changes all the time but they don't tell us. Ask a question to 5 Asst. Managers and you'll get 5 different answers. I just got burnt out on all the negativity
bad,"I learned a lot in my time at Walmart and they invested much in me. I evolved everyday with each day bringing new challenges and opprotunities, but the company is moving in another direction and I think its time for a change"
bad,"This was a terrible place to work, was considered part time and they made me work full time hours with no added benefits. They claim they work with college school schedules but they do not. Very little room for advancement. Management doesn't actually care about you, you are just a number."
bad,"barely any hours, you don't get the hours you want, and they make you work other postion you didn't apply for, there always on you about overtime, they take your kindess for granted and everyone is always talking behind your back"
bad,"Good competitive salary"
bad,"The store is poorly managed. As an employee, there were numerous policy changes that were never communicated to me which resulted in poor evaluations. I was promised a set number of hours weekly and hours were cut numerous times"
bad,"being an underling your always pushed to do the higher ups jobs while they stand around an chat or play on their phones,an if they do happen to work they will finish half the project an hand off the rest to others"
bad,Was not a very good walmart to work at the manager's were very rude and never helped. you cant advance there either unless ur friends with the manager
bad,"They hired me knowing i had no prior knowledge of vehicles and offered to teach me on the spot. Its not hard work, the main difficulty was remembering the differences between each vehicle. I'm currently working there but trying to leave because the hours are inconsistent and the manager is slowly destroying the place."
bad,"-fast phase envioronmet"
bad,started off on 3rd shift loved it became a manger in the deli after 2years loved it so decide to do something new .I love cake decorating but looking for something new
bad,"managers were very rude to employees did not treat people with respect and had favorites among the employees, i would not go back to work there if i had to,"
bad,"ambiente bueno a tempreraturas frias"
bad,walmart is walmart if you enjoy people then its the perfect job for you. it does require you to be there at least 6 days out of the week and  to work every weekend. their pay has increased which is a big plus compared to other places still paying 7.25
bad,"I've been there for more than 15 years at several different stores from Greensboro to Hillsborough now in Burlington I have full experience in every Department but only paid for one. Starting off as a full-time associate and now a part-time not by choice but by medical leave.New Associates are paid $11 minimum wage there but their are people who been there for more than 10 years and haven't even got to $11 which is really unfair, for the experience hard time associate."
bad,I am a current employee but my store has allowed hostile work areas. I am wanting to move up in the career but my store will not let me. You have to pass a test to stay employed.
bad,I could literally look to my left and right and find a Manager but I never had back up ever doing any task.  Co workers were hard to come by. It's a dog eat dog management system based on drama and backstabbing.
bad,"Despite the  decent pay, the overall experience of working at Walmart was very poor due to inconsistent management and it's abuse of associates. Hardest part of the job was consistency demanded of the Store to work 5 overnight shifts in a row. Management was inconsistent, three different managers with no organization of our goals for our shifts."
bad,"Minimum wage with small raises, not much in the way vacation, although plenty of sick time, and management is always on the look out for someone to fire"
bad,It is a very stressful job. The work life balance is just not there. Being treated unfairly by management. The stress of how many hours that are worked and the lack of home life.
bad,"Very clicky, treat you not so nice. Dont train people properly. Pay sucks. List goes on forever but not gonna bore you with it. Nothing good about this place!"
bad,"In my opinion, Wal-mart is not the worst place in the world to work. However, if you are a hard working individual who takes pride in their work, the typical day consists of management expecting the impossible. You will be used and abused without any appreciation. Many customers get upset/angry when you are doing your job to the best of your abilities while abiding by the rules. It is strenuous work and it only gets worse as times goes on. "
bad,Being a single mother and also having a disability Walmart Canada did not want to work with my hours to pick up my son from school or when i would get sick i would always have to fight with management to get better hours or try and switch with other associates working at Walmart Canada was a nightmare. Management made it very difficult for me to work at there store
bad,"I was going to school at the same time that i worked there. It pais the bills and allowed me to finish my program in less time that i was expecting."
bad,"I worked here about 2 years as part time, and suddenly management demanded that I work hours that were against my availability or I'd be given no hours at all. The hierarchy in management is crazy, as it starts with the market manager yelling and then to the store manager, to the assistants, and finally to the associates. The departments are overworked and understaffed, yet they assume we should be able to have everything done perfectly. Management will flip-flop back and forth on their word. Lastly, if you are part-time, a student, or have a second job they do not work with you and want you to treat wal-mart as your career."
bad,"No training was provided and had to learn things on my own.  Some managers would tell you one thing and others another thing.  Tried to please them, but was hard to do."
bad,its a good place if u need a job no  but the overall company hates their employees .  i worked a lot for them and they did not offer me any raises after two years or  no full time
bad,It's an OK job if you're doing an entry level job like cashiering but don't get sucked into anything else you'll get screwed over. Management will try to brainwash you and manipulate you. They work you like a dog with out compensating what you deserve and expect a job of 10 associates done by the end of the day by yourself.
bad,no pay
bad,It starts out as a great place to work until you reaize the corruption and inner company secrets. You are scheduled a regular schedule so it's legal and told if you leave on time you will get coached
bad,The managers dont really work with you or understand the pressure that they put on us workers. The store manager is very disrespectful and dont value the workers.
bad,"I work! That is what I do! I work to keep my space organized and functional. Don't expect others to keep up. However, I do expect others to clean up their own boxes and trash! I am so efficient I have become the clean up crew too!  "
bad,very busy and fast paced environment. as a cashier we took on other tasks and assisted with work in other departments .maintaining cleanliness in the store as well customer assistance in a fast pace environment
bad,"Was routine work. Clock in, clock out go home.  Lots of inter-work dating and all the drama that comes with it.  Management had their favorites and did not care about having enough registers open so that customers can be checked out faster."
bad,Coworkers are great!! Work was good in the beginning but over time has gotten to be more stress then what its worth. They do not hire enough staff to do the work. Expectations are different for every associate. No consistency in schedule even after being there for 5 years!
bad,seeing things coming through the register you were able to help customers monitor their expenses and prices and discount things they'd purchase ad matching for them if they had their paper along
bad,"Poor management, managers had their favorites and were very unfair to all employees, high expectations, not very understanding of employees need to balance work and your personal life"
bad,The issue with the problem at the Walmart I worked was the management. It was very disorganized and lazy. The store is a disaster and the back room is so much worse.
bad,"It's a pretty boring job.  I feel more like a glorified cashier than a pharmacy tech.  My managers/pharmacists are great to work with but the managers that handle the rest of the store are pretty unapproachable and lifeless.  The hardest part of the job is remaining enthusiastic and approachable after dealing with the general public for hours at a time.  The most enjoyable part of the job is filling prescriptions, at least with that part I can just focus on the job at hand without general public interaction."
bad,Everybody at entry level either works really hard or not at all and everybody above that get paid five times as much to yell at you and sit in McDonalds all day. Some stores are much better but Walmart doesn't punish management for not doing much so it happens a lot.
bad,"Although the pay is ok for part time, I don't qualify for any benefits."
bad,"The job is stressful, with the customer demand and the manager lack of presence, but once you get past that it's a pretty good job. The opportunity to move up in the company is not always there."
bad,Very busy. Usually one person working in several areas. Management did not like complaints and very seldom helped with problem solving. Enjoyed the associates and loved working with the customers.
bad,"I have worked both inside and outside. Admittedly working inside stocking shelves and unloading trucks, it wasnt that bad, we had a decent manager and were allowed a fair amount of breaks, and had a decent amount of respect. But working outside as a cart pusher, all respect is dropped by management. They refuse to understand the difficulty of your position and will scold you for being behind. They even ""lost"" our equipment and claimed it as stolen until I recieved a work related injury and then they miraculously found it within a minute.  As far as help goes, corporate cut the hours walmart can hand out so much that only 1 person can work at a time. Also the store manager is extremely cheap and refuses to buy proper equipment."
bad,"Wal-mart distribution center is a very fast paced, cut-throat environment only concerned with getting products shipped out in time to other stores and supercenters. If you did not meet or exceed production goals you were disciplined regardless if there was enough work or not, most times not, which is unfair."
bad,The job its self is not bad for being customer service the main issue is the incompetent managment and the petty managers i had to deal with. The company is constantly short staffed so what i did from day to day wasnt what i was actually trained to do
bad,"Poor management, unfair treatment,  disorganized inconsistent leadership,  rapidly changing working  environment,  unrealistic expectations for salaried managers."
bad,"Bad management through the store and not good work enviroment, very hostile environment and rude management in general and bad coworkers who don't do their job"
bad,"Wal-Mart was fair about getting pay on time with direct deposit, but if your an individual seeking to be rewarded for hard work and a versatile and credible work ethic and you thrive in a place that doesn't  backward ethics then Wal-Mart is not for you."
bad,"Always something to do."
bad,"When I began at wal-mart it was run very efficiently and orderly, but that declined almost immediately when they switched management at my first store."
bad,"I was blessed to get the job when I did, but over time the management used an abused their power. I was injured on the job, and was getting my hours cut."
bad,"I don't have much to say about this job, starts with low pay and not enough hours, depending what your position it could be lite work of very hard work and for the same pay"
bad,"A typical day doing my job consists of getting yelled at/ cussed at by customers, disobedient cashiers, and calling for upper management that never comes. When these issues are taken to the store manager she ignores them and us, which isn't unusual. Our HR associate is the one who actually runs the store. This is not somewhere you can work if you don't have thick skin. We never get any recognition for the work that we do,not even as much as a thank you from our store manager. If your looking for a positive place to work this isn't your line of business."
bad,everyday was chaotic. No one had a grasp on what to do. schedules for employees were always incorrect. attrition was constant. The hardest part of the job was knowing that there was no job security. the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting some terrific people.
bad,"- Not every Walmart is the same. I just had the misfortune of being hired on at this location. All levels of management are very aware of how to boss you around, but have no clue of what it takes to get the job done. Never expect them to work with you on anything, just expect commands with little direction. Hard work is very seldom noticed. You have associates that show up to work intoxicated and receive more praise than you. It is a very biased community and unless you know the right people, good luck."
bad,Working as a truck unloader at Walmart was not easy to few workers on a job that required the minimum amount of people with the increasingly short amount of time to unload the said truck. Mangement was incompetent and actively got in the way of your job overall a very frustrating environment.
bad,"People can be cool. Upper management has favorites, it's difficult to move up. The pay could be more for the physicality for the job and speed they expect. I wouldn't work there again."
bad,"Esta empresa chama a atenção na hora do candidato mandar o seu currículo pelos benefícios oferecidos. "
bad,"En el Medimart de Tlahuac hay mal ambiente laboral ,todos quieren subir de puesto y te pisotean en el camino ,hay mucho acoso y bullying laboral"
bad,Fine place to work if you need a job. They follow a lot of stupid rules and are very biased and unfair. work environment is great and co workers are great but management is garbage and needs to be cleaned out.
bad,"Management is a joke, they don't take concerns seriously, if you can even get a hold of one to talk to. Your fellow associates are always unhappy, and severely cliquey. Not a fun place to be everyday."
bad,I loved working in the bakery. I had the best manger ever in their. Then they moved me to being a cashier because I'm a people person. Then I became front end manger a csm. Thats when a new manger came in and he was so hateful that alot of people quit. I was one of them but I did put my 2 week notice in before I left..
bad,"Working overnight at Walmart was decent. The management forgot that overnight existed and we were neglected most of the time. In all honesty as my first job it was fine but not good enough to keep me there. Management would blame everything on us when they couldn't do things on time during the day. The workplace culture was nice my co-workers were amazing and were always willing to help. The hardest part of the job for me was trying to go to school after work since I worked at night and going to school right after wasn't exactly ideal. Most enjoyable part of the job was definitely the people working with me as they were just super bright and fun despite horrible work conditions. For me, this was my first job and my manager knew this but wouldn't offer to help me most times saying as a 22 year old I should know how things are done."
bad,"It was a seasonal position, I was not there long enough to judge the whole company. I did enjoy the short time I was there. It just wasn’t something I wanted to do long term"
bad,I was promised a certain pay rate and full-time hours. They immediate went back on this promise the minute I signed the hiring documents. The pay I was promised was $2 less an hour than what was agreed on and my hours were always kept at part-time status. My manager didn't like the fact that I was doing things differently but they worked.
bad,Walmart is walmart its a grind.  There is tons of room for growth if your willing to not have a life at all.  The management side of things was a killer when it came to being happy and rested.  The pay was decent but with the amount of time you spend in the building working it was less than minimum wage.  Also walmart is a very big ( who you know ) company and not what you know.
bad,"Everyday was fine, sometimes a pain with managers and a few supervisors."
bad,"I actually had a good time working here, the big downside is not wanting to learn more than one way how to do different things. They literally implemented something called ""one best way"" to run each and every department. Good idea, but the managers at each seperate store would also have to learn how to do each job, and that's something I know managers at my location didn't like at all."
bad,"I have been Working for Wal-Mart for over 10 years and there has been good days and bad days. At first i loved my job and then schedules are cut and the workload remains the same. I do recommend Wal-Mart if there are no other forms of employment for you. However, do prepare yourself to be around favoritism and ethics that are not followed. There are several reasons why I am looking to transition into something new and exciting, but I do not dwell on the past and the future looks bright!"
bad,The managers will ask you to do things they know are not allowed and you do em because you wanna keep your job and if your get in trouble then they bail out on you
bad,"A typical day at Walmart is generally fast paced."
bad,"Being in Garden Center for a while now, it has been very rocky, no benefits, you always feel like your hours are just cut to very low levels, like for 2 weeks, I'm going to have 1 day, 8 hours, then off 6, which I cannot live on."
bad,"The pay was the only good thing about this job. I was hired as full-time, but as soon as they found out that I had a 2nd job that was only part-time, they started cutting my hours. They didn't have enough cashiers, and since EVERYONE knows how busy Wal-mart can be, this made for a very stressful experience. Since you don't get any PTO right away, you can't really miss any days from work."
bad,"I had the experience needed to do the job but it was difficult to get a full time position and without that, you don't go anywhere!  Walmart does an excellent job at getting all they can from an individual.  They have high standards yet sometimes lack common sense business practices in dealing with their employees.  It's hard to think of a career at Walmart."
bad,"I was responsable for ordering and stocking the Pharmacy area at Walmart.  I was also expected to work on the cash register when needed.  I had no associate to help me and was expected to do all  duties alone, an impossable expectation.  We were in the process of learning how to manage our stock in the warehouse area, a new thing Walmart started and we were not given formal training.  "
bad,"Walmart Managers are expected to work many hours past their scheduled times with little to no consideration of personal life, holidays, or family. The company espouses a culture of respect for the individual except when it comes to their managers. The higher up the chain you are the more disrespect you must endure. It is common practice to be belittled or be threatened by market and regional leadership with the justification of ""You're a manager"""
bad,A typical day at work was getting a write up for work that needed to be performed on equipment or doing preventative maintenance on tractor/trailers. They provided some training on updates for their equipment and some refresher courses for maintenance. Upper management losing sight of employee desires for their off time life and family needs.
bad,"Harassment was a huge thing that happened a lot, certain manager didn't help when a problem would come up, ex: "
bad,Stressful and unorganized  is on a typical day. I learned customer service and the retail industry. Some management is great and some are very hardcore. Co-workers are like family. Sometime very physical demanding day.. Met many great customers.
bad,"La verdad que no pagan mucho, yo gano $2,100 a la quincena (el pago puede variar dependiendo del estado o ciudad o puesto) los aumentos anuales son de tan solo $100 mensuales. los promotores ganan mucho mas. "
bad,"Most jobs here are very easy, but i found that at my time here the biggest problem i had was with management, they can make working here very stressful at times."
bad,WalMart as a company has sunk. They take away from their employees when they lose money and make it our fault. No matter how many years you work there you will always make the same amount as the person who was just hired on yesterday. I will never work here again once I leave.
bad,"I worked the cap 2 (2pm-11pm) shift; usually stayed until 1am-2am working to finish unloading the truck--I was asked almost every night to stay later even though I was getting overtime, it was still a very exhausting job."
bad,Hardest part of the job is just trying to do what does assigned to my particular job code. On a regular basis I have a lot of extra work added on that really isn't part of my typical job assignment. But going above and beyond on a regular basis is what's expected.
bad,"Working at Walmart would be mostly fine if it wasn't for the coworkers. The majority of the staff I encountered at Walmart were negative, angry people who did not seem to be pursuing any future for themselves greater than Walmart cashier."
bad,"At my location, we were on a skeleton crew nearly always. The managers were often at odds with each other, fighting over the decent associates, while the associates that did little work were asked much less--while getting the same pay!"
bad,"Poor compensation"
bad,"Working at Wal-Mart today is not nearly the way it was 10  years ago, the overall treatment to the drivers has changed for the worst and the oppertunity to earn a good living is gone. Sad this was a great job and culture at onetime."
bad,under the right management the company could be a great place to work and very rewarding but under the wrong management its very stressful long hrs no advancement
bad,"A typical day at work was spent with departments understaffed, receiving conflicting directions from management, and never really being sure if your schedule was going to be changed."
bad,"Over all Walmart is not a bad place to shop, to work there is another oradell.  Management was too high strung to take out daily tasks, and doesn’t treat employees like their customers."
bad,"Rules, procedures, safety and regulations keeps changing almost on a monthly basis. The pay is decent but they ask far more out of you than what the pay is worth."
bad,"Walmart has a point system for call-ins. This makes it difficult for people with families and medical problems. Lately, hours have dropped for everyone but cashiers. Management has told these associates that they need to pick up hours in other departments or move to other departments completely. Not enough associates are scheduled to cover areas. Communication is terrible. A lot of times, associates and management don't answer the walkie."
bad,"Work consist of unloading freight, stocking, and building merchandise features. The culture is strange. Our managers didn't want employees speaking with each other. Felt as if the camaraderie and relationships for a successful and enjoyable work experience is frowned upon. Understaffed and over worked. The job is hard physically, but not mentally. One phrase to sum it up, soul sucking."
bad,"People wanted to move into management so that they could slack off and pick favorites.  No communication between management and associates.  If you are a favorite, you can have occurances removed from your Performance report, but if you are not, you will be written up for anything."
bad,Management shows favoritism to employees that they are friends with. There is a general lack of disregard for the employees and management would rather fire employees than promote them.
bad,"As retail is changing the company have cuts lots of jobs. There is limited places to move up now. Also, the benefits  isn't the best at all. If you are willing to pay high co-pay."
bad,"Fast-paced"
bad,"You aren't treated like an employee it's more their slave, management sticks together you can never find them and if you have a problem you solve it yourself they won't help you. They ALWAYS pull you from your department to run registers even though your busy doing the work of two people they honestly could care less, even if that means your work doesn't get done but you best believe your getting wrote up for not doing it fast enough."
bad,"My career at Walmart was mostly positive. The work is fun and challenging in good ways, but my career ended with management changes and job expectations were changed without notice. What I was required to do was never stated because I worked an irregular shift from my manager, and I was reprimanded up to termination blindly. Not all employment opportunities at Walmart are like this, but the franchising means it can happen, so be cautious."
bad,"I've been written up for things that aren't my fault. One day I'm told I've made nmajor improvement, then the next, I'm written up because team members have ""screwed up""/"
bad,Walmart in the Huntsville location is poor location to work for. Management is not very supportive or helpful. Management is very lazy and they expect you to do everything to cover for them. Attendance policy doesn't impact in Associate's life. Any doctors appointments or a simple few minutes late will get you terminated. The most enjoyable about the job is that you have you co-workers that help each other and will find answers for customer better then Management. The hardest part is you don't have a great Management team.
bad,"Unrealistic expectations by senior management, lack of concern for lower managements work life balance. Always want more, more, more, more, more, more"
bad,"What can I say....Walmart has unlimited resources and will hire almost anyone. To me this creates a position only good for experience needed to get a better job. There is a general sense of ""well if you don't like it leave"". If you can avoid it, do."
bad,"It's okay the work was easy. Just do you job and nothing bad will happen. Didn't have a problem with anyone form management, but I kept my head. They also work around my school schedule."
bad,Walmart plays to many favorites at work even though you make your production and brings other people to your area to work and take hours from the employees that work in that department.
bad,Good place to start if you want to get into retail office operations. Very few will advance from here but it shows you the workings of the company so you can possible transfer. Non stop calls and direction is weak. Not a job for those that take things personal
bad,"Associates will work hard. The goal and focus is on the total store, ensuring all tasks are complete, working as a team, and setting the next shift up for success.  There is however a ""favorites"" order. If you are favored, you will get, if not, you will have problems.  Instead of management working with associates to ensure work performed properly, they pass the buck.  Are willing to write you up and get rid of you. Will use you, and have no respect for you, no matter how hard you work, or what you sacrifice."
bad,To many people telling you what to do. You will get in trouble if you don't finish on persons task but have to do the other persons first. They were unfair.
bad,"typical retail store, you get what you put into it as far as working. for the college age person that wants part time its a good place to get those part time hours but if you have a family and need a career then you probably should look somewhere else. unless you have 10= years to put into it and plenty of patience."
bad,"Not a good place to work, Management communication is very poor, No appreciation  for hard working employees, lots of favor-tisim in the workplace unfairness, some employees give 120 % while others gets away with  just giving 50%, no respect of the individual even though its preached every day especially  from upper management."
bad,It would be a good place to work if Management wasnt so poor. The job is not as it was when i first started almost 8 years ago. Its not a job that you would want to retire from.
bad,"* work days 12+ hours."
bad,Schedule never allows time with your family. Pay was fair for what was asked. Benefits were good with exception of health Insurance doesn't pay for much. Promotion decisions were not fair and just
bad,I got along with my co-workers.The GM was more helpful than the co and asst mgrs were. I liked being a greeter but had to leave for personal reasons I prefer not to say.
bad,"Assist customers with finding product in store, answering questions about products; maintained inventory control with use of handheld device; stocked product on floor along with maintaining cleanliness & safety in aisles; filled in as temporary Department Manager over paint, electrical and hardware, small and large furniture, rugs and window treatment departments while associate was on medical leave; assisted in other departments as needed; sponsor and trainer for new employees of fresh food departments (produce, bakery, deli, and meat)."
bad,"i wasted 10 years there , and have nothing to show for it. you got enough to survive but not enough to get ahead. management is petty and misguided, they will though you under the bus to save them selfs"
bad,Management sucks and I would never want to work for people like that ever again. They are horrible people that don't care about their employees and only care about money.
bad,"Not a complicated job, but became difficult when lack of leadership and evident lack of concern on their part came into play. The ""children"" were left to make all of the decisions."
bad,"I love the people I work with. They are all caring and understanding. They work hard. The problem is management, specifically upper management. They are so disconnected with their workers that they do not seem to understand how things can or cannot function. The store manager is not concerned with this issue as long as it does not affect his bonus. Another issue is upward mobility, or rather the lack thereof. They do not want hard workers in management; they want someone they can control without question. They will create a ""management"" position with little incentive or benefits, give it to someone, and then eliminate that position within a year and a half to keep up with costs.  "
bad,It is a good job everything I do I can manage it. I’m going to stay there into I find better.  The management in the workers are great .its a job I can build with.
bad,"Working at Walmart was not the best. The deli could not keep a manager and when there was one the schedules were not in good order, leaving one person to work multiple hours and close by their selves. This made it hard to get a break or take a lunch."
bad,"I would unload trucks, sort freight onto pallets, stock the freight, and run backroom processes. Most people I worked with enjoyable to be around, and everyone would provide excellent customer service."
bad,Wal-mart would be a better company to work for if they treated there front-line employees better. Benefits to all employees give opportunity for employees to get full time after a certain time frame.
bad,Management is what makes Walmart so bad to work for they have favorites that they treat better than everyone else. They also do not take care of problems the way they should. And they have favorites that they break all the rules that they hold everyone else too if you are one of their little pets....
bad,"Clock in at 10pm go to work do mods. at midnight first 15 min break then back to work, then between 2-3 am lunch, then at 5am last 15 min break then 7 am time to go home. "
bad,"just a temporary job, garbage management. Low pay, low hours. If you do get close to the 40 hour mark for the week you are told to clock out and go home."
bad,"I tried my best for customer relationship. Some of the customers are rude and hard to get their appreciations, but I do my job with big smiles. Management team give me good support but late response."
bad,"I thought more of this company because it is Walmart, and I will give it to them that they have awesome and competitive benefits. However, the environment is awful and slacking. Management is not good. We have some very nice people but overall it is not the best place. The training is lengthy and could be shortened and simplified. If you aren't a ""favorite"" you will be denied about everything and if you are you can get a way with a lot of things. I don't think it is a bad company just bad department."
bad,"Nice if you like killing yourself with work for three days in a row and four days off but otherwise the expectations for production are unreasonable unless you're extremely committed or very fit. This job will shave off a few years off your life with constant requirement of lifting around fifty pounds at quick intervals (I had to throw about 50-200 cases of cat litter, 50lbs each, at a rapid fire pace or expect to hear about ""how I'm not meeting goals"" from management)."
bad,It was great when I started but its not going in a good direction.  The manager's do not follow one best way. They do not follow the steps to get promoted
bad,Managment is not people oriented. Training is done on the job and they are not flexible with their hours. Would not work at walmart again and do not recommend others as well.
bad,"Incompetent management, no weekends off for full-time employees, low pay for the work you do. Full hour full lunch is good, but you rarely get to take the two 15 minutes you're allowed. Under staffed a d not enough equipment when we have a full team."
bad,"It was my first job, so my body had to break into what it felt like to work 40 hrs a week. The bad thing is that I was hired part time seasonal, but they worked me full time. They did this so they didn't have to give benefits out. That place practically traumatized me from ever working at Walmart again, but it was also probably considered the worst Walmart in the country, so much so that the CEOs of Walmart paid 2 surprised visits to make sure the store was in shape. The morning shift had tons of managers, not that many stockers, and then when there was overflow in the stockroom, night shift got blamed for it, and the managers admitted that the store was way understaffed, and was allowed to hire during the holidays. I go back into Walmart, and I see night shift working, and I feel for them, I really do. You can see the look in their eyes, they do not enjoy one bit of it."
bad,"Job work/life balance - non existence. You spend holidays at the store especially Thanksgiving. Average daily hours worked - over 12 hours."
bad,A okay place to work but no one cares there and everyone is always confused. employees talking to much. Unstable place to work. Needs more direction and motivation.
bad,Okay Walmart is a fun company to start off on but later on the road it just seems like the managements doesn't really care about the employee. I mean we worked a lot of hours just to get coach for overtime
bad,"busy and interactive "
bad,"I did learn a lot about pricing, online ordering and all the different areas of the store. I was the personal shopper for over a year. A personal shopper does the shopping for customers who place orders online. I enjoyed my job but when the company changed to include grocery, I was moved to customer service. The hardest part of the job was making sure that each and every customer's orders were filled. I liked the set shift that I had."
bad,"Moving made me realize this isn’t what i wanted to do my whole life it’s was good starting at my other Walmart i learned more and i felt like i was growing more but when i moved i felt closed in , I’m  just ready to grow somewhere else and explore my options somewhere where i can build learn."
bad,I couldn't meet their standards. I also had a slightly unethical incident on my record during my time there.  The managers were also sometimes vague with their directions towards me.
bad,At Walmart the amount you get paid is fair and even though you get offered benefits as a full-time employee they work you right to the make as a full time employee but still keep you right there where you are accounted for a part time employee position so they don't have to give you benefits. If you are someone looking to gain customer service experience this is not the place it is overly stressful and out of control this will ruin customer service for you. The management isn't the best because none gets paid enough to care. The only enjoyable part of this job was knowing i had a pretty stable amount of hours each week. The hardest part of this job is not losing your sanity.
bad,"Does not pay for holidays off anymore, example have to work on thanksgiving for straight regular pay. If you call in you get four times the amount of occurrences."
bad,They have to do better with the managers they feel like they can talk to you any kind of way they want dont have know respect for there worker. they need to do better.
bad,No equality amongst employees. hours were back to back closing shifts and opening shifts. You have like 4 bosses that all tell you something different.
bad,"Terrible management, CSM's social hour superceded actual work. Environment was cliquey and hard work never noticed. There's always a couple people you may not get along with but if you're working retail , work for customers , not friends."
bad,Management changes every two years or so.big changes company wide basically told drivers they are paid too much to be competitive.lowering new driver pay by .10 CPM with no planned raises. Never thought I would want to leave here when I started seven years ago. All their changes only benefit investors.
bad,Walmart used to be a family oriented company but now it is all about making sales and profit.  The store that I was at was very stressful and your job was threaten everyday.  As being a manager I was not allowed time off many times I was schedule so you worked tired and working continuously.  You could not smile much and always worried of not having a job.  I know not all stores are like this but the one I was at was bad.  The hardest about the job was getting help from your fellow managers or store manager.  They would always hide and I was the one dealing with all of the associates and customers issues.
bad,"Wal-mart is there as long as you are ready to work and put up with the narcissistic attitudes of customers and managers. Work place itself is fine, the managers will speak to you any kind of way and expect you to deal with it. Horrible turn around rate and no way to advance because no individual wants to deal with managers already hired."
bad,"I've worked here twice now and I can officially say that this time is terrible, I've been treated like a tool since I came back and it's miserable. The manger just want you to do what you are told no questions asked. Which is fine but they don't apprentice anything you do."
bad,It was very stressful. I was laid off and that was fine with me. Poor management with no skills. Very unprofessional the staff and management talked and gossip about everyone.
bad,"It's an okay place to work, just not the place for me. They aren't very organized and I'm always having to do a lot of different jobs throughout the night. I would like a job that is more stable."
bad,very strict for low pay management not understanding always yelling at staff in front of customers breaks were never on time or hardly got breaks hardly no work hours
bad,management isn't very organized and its difficult to get ones own job done when constantly being pulled from ones department. They don't treat their employees very good.
bad,"When it was time to pay for worked time, management was poor to the point of not submitting time for employees to get paid. I would assume when you work as expected; then you should be paid for that time in a manner in which is expected bi weekly and if you have erred make sure that an employee is taken care of with accounting immediately"
bad,walmart is very hard to work for. they do not accept doctors notes. and are willing to fire over the smallest things. it is very hard to get a pay raise and almost always deny a request for a day off. they are not understanding at all.
bad,"Management at the store I worked at doesn't appreciate the work that you do and are quick to criticize. Doesn't resolve issues and play favorites. "
bad,they claim to have family values and they clearly do not. do not trust anyone. no ne cares about anyone they will make up things and back stab you for there own gain
bad,"If you do not have a family or life outside of walmart, go for it. Do not expect any vacation time or holidays with your family. Anyone who is interested will come to find out the walmart way of life. There is absolutely no overtime, no holiday pay. It begins to suck the life out of you."
bad,The department that I worked for was very informative and the training was just as. Easy.  It was very laid back and fun . My manager was easygoing as well.  It is just a strict novella phone policy
bad,A lot of the time there was only your register open nd you had to deal with everyone on your own and a lot of the time the ffront end managers wouldnt help you out so you had a line of angry pedestrians getting flustered with you it sucked
bad,They can do much better. As a company. Management has no respect for vets. They don't want to pay for overtime. They should pick up the tab for our health insurance.
bad,working at Walmart is good in a way but very streeful  went u have manager who are not train correct or do have a people skills ur put on  to the sale floor and u have to learn everything on the floor  with the help of ur coworker I was fast to learn and teach other what I had learn I made the job easy and enjoyable I move up the ladder and work well with other my  only obstacle was management  I learn to be a good leader u should respect ur coworker and help them teach them so they can do a good job and thanks them for being apart of ur team   if u had management who would take time and walk the store and work alongside of coworker there would be a sense of unity  and worker would feel more combatable about be at work and there would be better communication and trust and among   i mean not every manger is bad most are just not train correct and most have gotten there position because they were friend with some who is part of management so they have must experience went they get promoted  best part of working in Walmart is again if ur willing to learn and don't let coworker or management get in ur way u can go up he ladder with hard work and get satisfaction and feel a sense of pride in ur day at work i would recommend if ur young and want to experience what real work is cause if ur able to stay and learn is going to be a lesson well learn for ur future  and a guideline to how to deal with any other job cause ur learn and see hw the real work place are and ur learn to make money u have to better ur self so in the u not find ur self in the future all stress out  and help u find
bad,"Management tended to either leave the associates to themselves and nothing would get done, or breath down everyone's necks, which for someone with certain anxieties about being snuck up on, this is not a very good situation. The only enjoyable part of this job was a few of my fellow associates who happened to be decently competent at their jobs."
bad,"There's too much drama between people, everyone here is rude and judgmental of you. If you mess up or do anything wrong, everyone will immediately find out. It's like high school pretty much here, if you don't make as much money as someone else does, you don't get a say in anything."
bad,"There always a task to do, Which is a Plus. Not a boring job. Poor Management in some areas. No Communication between many. Company Lacks internal Growth."
bad,If you don't want to move up and are content to just do one thing then its a great place for you.  I however like to be constantly moving and improving which is not expected at my store.
bad,"Management at the Walmart I worked at was poor. Staffing was not well planned, perpetually understaffed, lots of scheduling problems, rude manager and poorly treated staff."
bad,I can't even count how many times I was cursed at by a customer. When I complained to my supervisor they shrugged and did nothing. They refused to work with my school schedule. I ended up working 40 hour weeks when I was only supposed to work 20.
bad,"I was put in a different department after working there for 1 year, and told I'd get a call with my hours, and 2 weeks later, no call, no hours. When I inquired about it, no one knew what I was talking about. I was forced to find other employment. My manager looked me right in the face and lied to me. I loved my job there, but management screwed me big time."
bad,"I worked here for a few years starting when I was 16 I don't really remember to much about it I worked in many areas from cashier, floor employee to ending in the tle department."
bad,Working at walmart was fun. The customers were awesome some of the customers followed me from previous jobs and I got along with everyone. The managers were not friendly and did not follow all of walmart handbook rules. The managers were becoming very difficult to work with and fired any one with an idea an or opinion.
bad,I love help care  i do with my heart i see when then go happy from Wal-Mart  it fun and friendly service i ring up purchase.An have good customer service.
bad,You don't get any hours if your availability is not open. The management team sucks and only help when they need help. I try to find the upside of working at walmart because I have a family to take care of.
bad,"Well paid job, but the management was inexperienced as the warehouse has only been open for about a year. This led to hiccups that you wouldn't expect for a multi-million dollar company."
bad,Management is not friendly at all. I felt like I was nothing more than a pawn working here. They don't care about you. They do not like to work with your schedule and hate when you ask for certain days off months in advance
bad,"I had fun working at the cell phone booth at walmart, The only thing I did not like was having very little leadership or direction. You would be told to do one thing, then get pulled to another department for something else then get written up for not finishing the first task. Management never took up for their sales people. Customer was always right even when they were definitely wrong. I.E. returning stolen merchandise."
bad,Was moved to department manager quickly in 6-7 months. Was immediately put in charge of 3 departments which made me feel valued. There were hundreds of price changes and display changes daily and lots of stocking. Enjoyed the busy work and learned a lot about what a stores appearance could be.  Only had one to two associates however depending on the day.  It seems to be a somewhat recurring trend in todays workplace to do more with much less.  Feel I was not equipped to be a great manager so soon.  Appreciated the experience.
bad,it was fun and a nice place to work at when i first started but as i got to see what it was really like and how management talk to you yea they say its like family but it is really not i hate it i didn't want to be at work sometimes and i'm a hard worker but that place make you stress out
bad,Wal-Mart has changed so much over the past few years. It is not at all about the customer. It's about the mighty dollar. And they don't care if you have a family at home.
bad,When you work at walmart you quickly learn that there are rules....loads of them...You're also required to work past your schedule which you have to deduct the following day with a longer lunch because overtime is forbidden
bad,"I worked as a cashier, stocker, and customer service associate at the same time. I enjoyed helping most customers. I would never work here again, but appreciate the experience."
bad,"During the 20 years I worked there I was treated like a number not a person and was used for what they could get out of me then when I developed things like high blood pressure, muscle pain, allergies etc.. and could no longer do some of the things i had been made do they treated me even worse."
bad,"As a company it is a good place to work"
bad,hard difficult bad managment  poor hourly ungrateful i dislike it very much. no overtime allowed. very difficult customers to deal with. very bad experience
bad,"People at wal-mart, in general, are friendly and easy to work with.  Management, on the other hand, is ""cut throat"" and treats employees poorly.  Pay is not good and conditions could be better.  Some of the more important jobs pay the least and raises have recently been reduced to a small percentage rather than a set amount.  This has been reason for some to quit and others to feel under appreciated."
bad,"The spin out of the Home Office is much different that how you are treated as an employee. Therefore, it is important to read the reviews of the store location that you are applying for. If you are a manager, forget about having a family. They will only see you enough to sleep."
bad,The management does not promote the Wal-Mart culture of respect for all. Raising the bar to achieve KPIs is great but should be attainable - which Wal-Mart Logistics management does not have the professional ability to do so.
bad,the management throughout the company is selfish and careless towards their employees. requests in Moving up in position or simply switching shifts will be ignored. All person all needs or complaints will be disregarded. Desperately understaffed. employees are over worked to make up for lack of hiring.
bad,"customer service, cashier, at times slow work pace-have to find areas to clean, organize, many years ago not sure if things have changed, only holiday closed is for christmas"
bad,They are hard to work with on hours. They mainly want people over night but if you have small ones this job probably isn't for you. They do pay well with good hours dont get me wrong but they make it hard on you if you have children especially if you work all nigjt.
bad,"A typical day at Walmart as a cashier is basically having to stand all day long with or without customers in your line. When customers come up check out their items with great attitude and smiling face. "
bad,They are terrible at pretty much everything. The managers don't care about the employees and no one wants to work there. If you need a job I would tell you to go anywhere else.
bad,Gives you hours but lacks in a lot of other things. Poor management. Unorganized facility. Poor communication between management and employees. Have to be flexible with hours
bad,"A typical day at work, is very busy with little rest time. From working at Walmart, I've learned that everything boils down to politics. Store management overall is horrible, they're never available when you need them. The hardest part of the job was working with slow people who had little to no understanding of the field of pharmacy. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to put a smile on patients faces."
bad,Did not like working split shifts and the fact the computer generates a schedule and sometimes it took 3 weeks just to get a day off approved. Not allowed to have any vacation during holidays.
bad,"Typical day at work was 9-12 hours depending on production, however they would push you to your limits to get the job done sooner in order to avoid giving you a full 40 hour week."
bad,"The pay is great but that is about it, they treat their employees like garbage, there is a high level of retaliation if you report an issue, they are not family oriented in the least. Unless you are friends with someone higher up or you transfer it is highly unlikely you will ever advance, they do not promote based off skill but rather who will follow suit."
bad,Very thankful to have a job. Everyone is very kind to me. I enjoy meeting people and have a fine working team. A usual day at work is handing credit and cash transactions at the registers and assisting customers.
bad,Walmart only cares about their profits they dont mind stepping on its employees to get the profit either they will do anything they want to get an extra dollar
bad,I definitely learned a lot working in management at Walmart . I worked so hard.  And even though I would not wanna work for the company again I definitely have no regrets working there
bad,"I learned how to operate scanners, how to do inventory, unload trucks in a timely fashion and just keep the backroom tidy. Management did not care about their employees, which made working there not enjoyable. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing how much progress I could make in a day. The least enjoyable part was having to deal with the managers"
bad,The store I work at has gone downhill as far as respect for the individual is concerned. Upper management will not take responsibility for their own weaknesses. Integrity is not a quality to be found in this store. Policies are ignored. It is a disappointing place to go to everyday. I just go out of my way to take good care of the customers as management doesn't seem to care. We are always running out of bags and paper towels. There is never enough maintenance staff or cashiers. The atmosphere is not positive or conducive to a productive work environment as it seems upper management is not concerned with improving the situation but will find a way to belittle you when assistance is requested from them.
bad,You have to work when they need you...if they don't your hours are cut...it doesn't matter what kind of emergency you have if you call in its held against you. ..from September thur December hours are long...only holiday you don't work is Christmas day.....production is very high..if you don't make it which is sometime impossible you get wrote up...if you accidently put product in wrong place your wrote up...you get wrote up and coached for every thing.I have worked there for 23 years and am currently look for a new job.
bad,You can't change your availability for 6 months and can only call out 3 times in 6 months or your fired. I got hurt and they won't let me change departments
bad,"Salaried management is very disrespectful of associates and hold impossible expectations of what should be done in one shift. Pay is not what it should be, there is only a one dollar difference between a sales associate and hourly supervisor. Benefits are pretty good and not all that expensive. Advancement is not based on experience or skill but on favoritism even if you cannot do the job. Work/life balance for hourly associates is good as you are not allowed overtime so 40 hours a week will never be exceeded unless you are salaried management in which case you will be very taken advantage of. The store manager can do pretty much whatever they want and manipulates and plays games with associates."
bad,Hired on as part-time worker but always doing 40+ hours a week with no full-time benefits. Most of the training was learn as you go. Expected to be ready by the second week of employment for high skill jobs.
bad,seen employees as a number and cared less about quality more about quantity. made to answer for  day to day operations without any guidance then get in trouble when you didn't do their job correctly .. a lot of favoritism for special customer rather then treating every customer as its the last customer ..
bad,The Wal-Mart Neighborhood Markets offer a more condensed shopping experience but the environment as an associate is not conducive to growth or longevity. I would not recommend working here if you are a hard worker and want to be promoted based off merit and not sucking up to the managers.
bad,management never says you did a good job or area looks good all they care about is getting things done don't care if your department is short help & you can't work one tenth an hour of overtime
bad,Walmart use to be very family orientated and a fun job and due to all the changes in the company they have become very inconsistent they do not pat holiday pay you have to use pto they helped there associates they over load the management with limited associates
bad,"This was the hardest job I have ever had. Training was horrible, I wasn't allowed to write down information to try and remember it, then I was grilled on the information. The staff pharmacists did not have basic compassion for their clientele but they were the managers. For me, the most rewarding part of the job was helping a patient with either OTC or prescription drug information in order to help the patient to meet their needs."
bad,It’s a very physical demanding job with almost impossible expectations the management team just does whatever they want and make up rules as they go and can fire you for anything if they want to
bad,They could treat there employees alot better. If you wasn't liked they gave you the cold shoulder. The management team is not that good either. All around the company is not a place you want to work for.
bad,"Management consistently ignored policy violations and counterproductive work habits.  If a procedure was not properly carried out, rather than addressing the problem at its source, associates were consistently pulled from their own workflow to fix said problem on a daily basis."
bad,The hours were always different. I would get on a register for two hours and take a break for 15 minutes and then get back on for another two hour and then take an hour lunch. everything ran in two hour spans. I was promoted to customer service and learned of lot from there.
bad,"This was the best walmart to work at by far because the management was nicer, the pharmacy manager wasnt super uptight and actually very respectful of his employees for the most part."
bad,Walmart sucks supposed to be family oriented but isn't. Had daycare issues going thru divorce got fired for absences that were supposed to be approved by management
bad,"Managers always expected more than could be managed in a shift, with strict limits on overtime. Employees would always be over tasked with work and not enough time to finish. Managers had no care for employee abilities just expected everything to be done."
bad,Good starting job for me right out of highschool though the management are very rude and called me a slow piece of (insert rude word ) even thoough i worked as well as the last guy that trained me
bad,"Walmart was very stressful, mainly due to the lack of communication between management. One manager will tell you to do one thing, the next will say something to you for doing it. There was also favoritism. A LOT. There are some associates (management included) that don’t have to work, it’s ok for them to clock in and walk around, Be or their phone, or sit down at the computer; meanwhile I’m the only cashier on register for 2 hours and my line is backed up because it’s so busy, and i didnt receive any help, so along with customers having an attitude with me higher management said it was my fault. Even though it was the csm who was standing around on their phone no where to be found. "
bad,I expected much more from such a successful company.  Management mislead me into thinking I had a solid chance of moving up the ranks. They were also biased to certain employees and made decision without consulting lower management subordinates. Job culture was stale and employees are given no incentive to help customers as management sees that as a distraction from your job at hand. Pay and benefits were exceptionally low considering what was asked of us.
bad,Management was never there when needed. Completely disorganized and illogically ran. The hours were scattered all over and was never set. The store manager disappeared without letting anyone know what was happening.
bad,Salario bajo con poca estabilidad laboral y poco desarrollo personal y profesional.
bad,I did not enjoy working at Walmart. I felt that the working environment was undesirable and the management was not of the quality I was used to in prior jobs.
bad,Was an experience . There we a lot of different people to interact with. Management definitely needs some improvement. As long with who they pick to run the front end.
bad,Workload is ALWAYS more than one would expect for an 8 hr shift. Expectations of upper management are are often unreasonable. Bonuses earned for meeting production incentives are not always passed along to workers
bad,"I felt they were unfair because I had a intermediate leave in for what the doctor required me to be off work and by me having to work six months straight before one day comes off I had two many days I had 9 days in six months and that was to many days. I feel that if you have a doctors excuse you should be excused from work because for one you don't want to make anyone else sick and for two you don't get paid for the time you are not at work so that is cutting into your money when you get sick and a single working mother like myself need all the money I can get."
bad,"pay was great and the people were nice. Worked alot of hours and loved the over time. Customers were"
bad,I have over 20 years experience in the kitchen and was not paid enough for what I was able to do for the company. I felt there was alot of favoritism when it came to management.
bad,"Management lacked in training. I was hired for Maintenance Position I applied for as that was my background, and right before December, was told I was being moved to In Stock position, without warning and that I would no longer be on maintenance. This store did not care at the time. Management were wishy washy, and you never knew what to expect day in day out from them."
bad,"It is a tough place to work. Fast pace, the goal is impossible to make as a stock associate. If you don't make the goal you get audited. You have to do a walmart cheer twice in your shift. they veto a lot."
bad,"very hard to work with families, management never on same page."
bad,It felt like you were just a number and always replaceable.   Breaks and lunches where not very coordinated and didn't offer much time off for children's  illness
bad,"I enjoyed what I did.  I would say that management training is not taken seriously.  A lot of unethical behavior.  A person can be their best but if a concerned person were to ask questions  about unethical behavior, job can be unstable.  Retalliation a big in WalMart."
bad,"Inconsistent schedule,  always expected to go above and beyond with no compensation, not even a thank you.  Schedule changes without notification  or consulting you. No hands-on training. A classroom and computer setting, then you're shown to your department and expected to know everything.  Walmart's core values are based on 1950s Sam Walton, and are taught, but never enforced or used.  Walmart believes in less people, more work.  You will need to spend your days off sleeping and destressing. NO work life balance. Only 20 cent annual raises for hourly associates. Doesn't matter if you're a slacker or hard worker, because no matter what,  your getting a 2% raise. Which is roughly 20 cents for most people.  You can advance in the company if you are willing to give up your family and have an extreme lack of empathy.  The 10% discount covers the tax on your purchase,  so it's not even really a discount."
bad,"Great people to work with, wonderful coworkers, always willing to help, team building, kept you busy in your work day, so days went by faster, discounts for employees, great training"
bad,While I worked at Walmart as an overnight stocker I was treated like I was less than nothing if I didn't get something done I was forced to stay until it was finished I was sent to the hospital because of how stressed I was with work and was not compensated for it at all
bad,"I worked for Walmart for only a few months.  They said that I was not seasonal, but I was.  They let go many employees including me.  I did not like the management staff handled problems with us.  They were not approachable and played favorites.  They were grouchy acting and rarely smiled.  I liked the work itself, but the rest of the job was stressful."
bad,"Be kinder,"
bad,"Good place to meet people and if you are a social butterfly this is the place for you. They have this thing where if you do your job great, you get to do everyone else's too! Not a bad place to work if you don't plan on moving out of mom and dad's house anytime soon!"
bad,Job is very stressful.  Nobody follows the rules or policy.  Pay on the other hand is good but you basically gotta work the whole day. Managment is sorry.
bad,Customers treat you poorly and CSMs are overworked and slow to react. The pay is decent but the hours are crazy. Random four hour shifts were not uncommon.
bad,"Management was terrible. She favoured the men and always had it out for me since the beginning. The employees were two faced, not all of them, but most of them. They would be so kind and nice to your face but then say terrible things about you to other people. Not a positive work environment at all."
bad,"Pay was great but that's about where the good stuff ends. 9 out of 10 truck loads were mixed but they still expect your production to be the same. they don't modify production standards at all for mixed trucks. you can barely hit production expectations with nice organized truck loads. They tell you that you can transfer to a different job after a year, but you have to be hitting production to transfer, and hitting production is next to impossible. Management gives all of the good trucks to their favorite employees, that's why they always hit production. Its terrible."
bad,Cleaning and reorganizing the toy area. Putting out freight and helping customers and management in all areas of the store. There is always something to do.
bad,"I really didn't learn any thing that I learned from my previous jobs and"
bad,"I worked at Walmart for almost a year and at the time I left they were about to fire me for my attendance, note I’m a type 1 Diabetic. They didn’t care if I was having issues on the job, I even brought in paperwork from my doctor with accommodations that were to be met and they ignored them. One day my blood sugars were so bad I called my doctors office and the nurse told me if I didn’t go to the hospital it wouldn’t end well for me. Well needless to say I notified my manager and they told me if I left I would be fired because I didn’t have any more points for attendance. Trying to get time off with an injury is a nightmare too. I broke my foot and obviously had to be on crutches and the management team refused to let me come in to work and do something else until I was off the crutches so I had to take a few days and was almost fired because they didn’t have me fill out paperwork correctly to the company that approves days off for injury. I then had to get a walking boot to come back to work and was constantly yelled at for how slow I was moving and the fact I couldn’t get everything done. Walmart is a joke, they are not family friendly and I do not recommend working for them at all."
bad,"Working at Walmart is what you expect, standard pay in a store with a lot of downtime for an efficient worker."
bad,This place over works its employees and under pays them. The hours are pretty cool but people will try and get over on you by making you work over and not getting paid for it
bad,you don't see that much hours. advancement not easy. some managers are nice and good to Work with. fast pace environment and customers most of the time are rude
bad,Wal-Mart only likes certain people..if they do not like you you have no chance of advancement...they do not offer full time employment anymore . You can not make it from paycheck to paycheck on what you make there
bad,Good for a temporary job but long term will destroy your confidence and the scheduling/ management you have will determine your life. I regret staying with Walmart for so long.
bad,Work there if you don't have many options or if like challenges otherwise steer clear. Working at Walmart will definitely strengthen your customer service skills.
bad,The overall job is stressful and everyone talks about everyone. Management talks down to associates in front of other sssciates and customers. They promote unqualified associate and over look others.
bad,"I loved most of my coworkers and immediate supervisors. Unfortunately, communicatation is poor. I often receieved contradictory information from management. One manager asked me to teach a new employee how to use a piece of equipment required for the job. Five minutes into it, another manager chided me for being too far away from my post. I tried to explain what I was doing, but she refused to hear it. The employees were given a change of dress code  with barely 2 months notice. (Mind you, we got paid every other week) No reimbursements or clothing  allowances."
bad,walmart have a fast past high value environment that get unmanageable do the daily task. as humans we want to be first. the million dollar answer one at time
bad,High turnover because no one wants to do their job or they dont want to close. They dont hire enough people to cover what needs to be covered and if you have enough then it doesnt cover the busiest time of the day. Mangers are all rude and dont have a clue of whats going on half the time.
bad,there where no typical days other than long hours and constant threatening of your own job for reasons other than there jobs being threatened for the few slackers that are ruining it for everyone. management is completely useless in the fact that they only did there job when upper management is coming around.
bad,"Didn't mind working there, loved working there with some people but ultimately the terrible management Walmart continues to employ drove me away and the same result with many others. Their attitude in the workplace is ridiculous, often would just tell you orders to hear their voice or because half of them are tyrants. Most enjoyable part? The people you work with and the customers are quite interesting. The worst part? Easily the management. How some of them even get into a management position is beyond me. Would I recommend? Sure if you like to get bossed around by people who don't have a clue what they are talking about."
bad,"The warehouse working conditions and the rate of pay do not match up. Wanting full work without paying your worth, this job is completely full of it self"
bad,This rang true with me after 9 years with the company that I had moved up in and worked very hard to take care of the associates that worked under me I had a horrible store manager who made me quit caring about the job. Your experience with Walmart depends on the management team and unfortunately as large as Walmart is it isn't possible for every manager to be a good one.
bad,"It could be a better company if there were more cashiers scheduled "
bad,"I had no problem with working at Wal-Mart per say, but I left due to management isssues as well as lack of advancement/pay raise. I was thrown into cashiering, constantly in need of managers who seemed too annoyed to bother. I never did pathways, but was expected to perform well in my job. I would definitely work at Wal-Mart again if I had more opportunity, as an associate, to grow and strenthen my early work career."
bad,"Managers weren't the best, but they did start off with decent pay and at least 32 hours. Waiting to go to full time since they are cutting people. Hours sometimes get cut for no reason."
bad,Worked full time but with part time benefits. Never had enough staff to work comfortably. Customers were rude. When you caught people stealing you could not stop them because management didn't see it.
bad,"i had enjoyed the bonuses we received as in extra bonus checks, extra percents off all holidays would receive up to 30 % off anything in store."
bad,"One thing that I can say about Walmart is that I did learn a lot, even of it was self-taught. It motivates you to do the best you can in order to remove yourself from the company. Other than that, not much good to say."
bad,"Scheduled 48-50 hours a week, expected to stay late and come in on days off. offered days off but required to beg for them, and still expected to work during them. Unachievable goals set each day, and will change or be added to throughout the day. So much work to do that you are unable to take any breaks, and told that I don't need to eat while i'm at the store. Also so understaffed that you are not allowed to leave the store until another manager comes in at the ""end"" of your shift."
bad,"low in staff "
bad,You are never guaranteed your hours. One week maybe 27 or 28 and the next 33 or 34.  In my facility there are problems that keep happening and no one ever fixes them. A lot of complaining from management but no action on there part. I love the people i work but Moral here is almost non existent. I wish you could just come in and do your job and go home but that is not the case. The pay is competitive for the work but there aren't many options for advancement. You only get a 20 minute and a 15 minute break on a 10 hour shift. This is unacceptable.
bad,You have to have no life if you want to work here I broke out in hives when I was working there and needed to be hospitalized and they fired me for clocking out and going to hospital on my lunch break
bad,The job In-Stock teams means Scanning in new product and checking to see amount of product left in the system. The increment was fine i stayed in the back counting merchandise most of the time. Staying over for night shifts. But I can say helping others when the store opened for business and customers come in needing help.
bad,"Very stressful and production requirements were continuously raised, job procedures changed constantly, and constant changes in everything, thus making it difficult to produce at the level they wanted."
bad,Corporate instills changes that lack in the proper communication to the associates to carry out the changes.  They also are consistently changing things that are currently working and not changing the items that need to be addressed.
bad,"never enough employees but i don't think it is the lack of employees, i think it is the lack of wanting to spend the money to employ them. You know how it is when you go in and there is 20 people in line and you have 30 lanes and only 4 cashiers"
bad,When I was employed at Walmart the atmosphere was toxic.  Work hours were continually being reduced while workload was increased.  The store was always short-staffed.
bad,Management makes this a horrible place to work. They don’t communicate well with Associates they make you feel  beneath them. I personally felt discriminated against because my department manager didn’t like the fact I was dating another associate that was a female and me being a female she didn’t “approve” of it. They only like you if you kiss butt and let them talk to you any kind of way. They overwhelm you with work but never want to take the time to help you get it done.
bad,It is a good place to work however Walmart seems to more interested in body's to fill spots and not necessarily work ethics. Management puts more pressure on those who do their job and less on those who don't.
bad,"It's retail, what more can you expect? Long hours hard work, you will work holidays. Made to work overtime only to have it cut later in the week, with no notice. If you have any other options go there instead. Come on McDonalds is hiring isn't??"
bad,"for the job that has to be performed as a cashier, the pay is terrible. long hours, stressful job dealing with unhappy customers and no communication from mgmt on what is going on w/n the store."
bad,"Poor management"
bad,overworked there for 3 years too long. if you value your health and mental well being working here is not an option. the best part about the job was hour long lunches
bad,"While my time at Walmart has been good, there are several flaws within the company. Management shows a lot of favoritism. Associate with seniority are not expected to work as hard as those who have not been with the company for very long. Walmart is also very strict with hours. It is almost impossible to get full time because they do not like associates gaining more hours than scheduled."
bad,"no training,understaffed,confusing,bad leadership,to much work for each worker,forced shift change,does not work with you,cramped work areas in back and overall bad"
bad,I couldn't please management to many managers one manager two co managers eight assistant managers six support managers plus each dept. has a manager so everyone has opinion and seldom could you get two to agree. oh and there was the regional manager who come go a totally different direction example floors need more wax second manager your putting to much wax down and so on down the line .
bad,Work for this company for quite some time. My work performance was outstanding. I worked well with others. My hours eventually got cut and then I was let go.
bad,Walmart pays bad they expect so much with little pay in return. Sometimes you are doing a job for another department and they get paid more then you but you are working their department for your pay. Unfair pay environment
bad,"management doesn't do much, they delegate you to do everything even if its there job, they don't help you out and make you feel stupid. they don't give you much training you get thrown into a job you've never done."
bad,It’s just not worth it at all the pay is good but it took for 2 years to get to full time even then it was a fight to even get proper hours or even where I am spouse to work
bad,I worked 3rd shift stocking the dairy dept. I unpacked pallets of freight. Loaded carts and took them out on the floor to restock shelves with dairy items. Made sure items were not outdated on the shelves. The hardest part of the job was working in a cold environment in the middle of the night. The best part of the job was getting to go home.
bad,"When you work here, the motto is ""the customer comes first"". FORGET IT! Their motto is the dollar come first , the management cut staff and increases the work load. You can be terminated for almost anything.  "
bad,"management ther's too many chief's and not enough indians. Everyone wants to blame everything on the third shift.. They're too quick too firing people, and trying too transfer. Management is very poor."
bad,if walmart had better management that would make the store a better place to work for. if they cared about the associates more than they do it would be better.
bad,I will never work for walmart! No co.pensation for being extremely sick. Everyday you don't show up is a point on your record. Every point is totalled and you will get fired quickly. So show up and work no matter how sick you are.
bad,I moved up pretty quick there but when i got in to the leadership role the higher up don't pay attention to you and its to much scream and yelling no structure.
bad,I feel that Walmart did not train their management support staff for the job(s) that they needed to do and therefore the rest of the staff at the store was left under-managed and unprepared for many of the challenges and tasks that the days would bring.
bad,Many times myself or other co-workers including others managers were threatened with termination for either minor issues or ones they decided to make up.
bad,"WALMART should be your last resort when applying for a job. As for me at that time I was not flexible with my schedule, but I still needed a job and this was my only option since they offered me graveyard (which I was looking for). it is stressful, and management walks a round the whole time, holding a cup of coffee  bossing people around and being demanding."
bad,"All the negative hype about Walmart is usually true. The employees are under compensated and hate their jobs. While I was employed, I LOVED my customers. I loved the constant interaction. However I was usually playing referee between my old coworkers and customers because employees do not take any type of ""customer service classes"""
bad,Poor  management.  Favoritism.  Not enough  hour's  liked it get to meet people.  And like to be helpful. To others.  Have no problem with help  translate.
bad,"If you don't have four roommates, or you're not living with your mother, then you won't be able to afford to work there. Starting hourly wage is $9. After three months it's bumped up to $10 and you'll get an employee discount card for 10% off some items. If you have no dependents, no cable/internet, car loan, cell phone bill, and get on food stamps, then you might be able to afford to work for Wal-Mart. Scraping by with no money for fun on the weekends or saving up for a rainy day is not worth it in my opinion. It might be okay as a second job, part-time. But honestly most Wal-Marts are going to want you to work like you're being paid $20 per hour, and most of your coworkers are going to be smart enough to not do that. Good employees come and go quickly through Wal-Mart, while lower caliber ones are in like a tick. Wal-Mart isn't all bad, but if you've worked for other companies you'll know you're being taken advantage of."
bad,"This use to be a good place to work at..but not anymore. A lot more work has been piled on, with no more pay, taking on roles to reduce the amount of work Asst. managers do, They don't do much as is anyways. People who work hard and do a good, always great crapped on, while nothing happens to the lazy workers"
bad,Salary positions with Walmart provide little work life balance. The market team in the South Dakota cultivate a stressful and fearful leadership teams/style. The store level teams are wonderful with a great level of experience and are incredibly hardworking. I would not recommend salaried positions with this company.
bad,Overall the company was bad in all aspects they had very little care for  people in the right area for there skill sets. The only thing i truly liked was my coworkers they were great people.
bad,"You learn a lot about interacting with people and a lot about the functions of a chain grocery store.  However, poor management and the lack of training restricts ones vertical mobility and decreases productivity."
bad,Wal-Mart barely pays the associates enough to live off of. Managers often skip or ignore corporate policies to enforce a strict work environment with fear of dismissal that is uncouth to the scribed rules of Wal-mart Corp.
bad,"Just terrible. Poor Management and no room for advancement. i've been working for them for about 8 months and wanted to move to the electronics department, they did not do anything with trying to move me there even though someone just got released from that department and they were short."
bad,"Walmart is a busy and productive place to work. You can meet different people and make their lives better by helping them find what they need & want, and providing great services !"
bad,I loved my job when I started until I saw all of the bias stuff going on with management.  You have to be friends or related to someone in management to advance. A lot of favoritism is shown and they don't care who knows it. There is (No open door policy).
bad,"Working for Walmart was a job I needed right out of high school, and it worked for the nine months I was there. The work environment was very structured and fast-paced, the management was okay, but I felt as though I was only a number in the company. I did not work there long enough to receive any benefits, if they do offer such. I would not suggest Walmart to any of my friends on the one point that it is not a happy place to work."
bad,Very fast paced. I enjoyed working there. I like the fast pace and helping customers with their queries. I also enjoy meeting new people everyday &  provide great service for them.
bad,Would be a great job if management cared for their employees and did not have favorites among the employees. Customers are enough to handle but like in every business you have good ones and bad.
bad,Its very stressful because you always have to be on your game the hole time if you mess up the customers will complain about you and to you the hole time I was there I just wanted to cry.
bad,Not at all what I was expecting. At first was good and later just got worst. No I wouldn't work for them again. My last management wasn't up to par and differently should have been better. Just because you are management doesn't mean you know how to run things. Not all my management was bad just the last. Also some upper management bad as well. So I understand why there are so many bad reviews!
bad,A typical day at work is working as a team to complete the work load projected which will vary according to consumers. Due to this you may work extended hours one day and the next be sent home early.
bad,"Walmart had a had a very flexible schedule to the lack of training and poor management the culture of the work place slowly went down, There was no more room for growth with in the charlotte office."
bad,I cant speak for ALL Walmart's but the Newington one was a nightmare. Horrible hospitality from all associates and poor customer service as well. Its as corporate as corporate nonsense can be. You sneeze the wrong way and you're in trouble.
bad,Just not happy or satisfied at walmart! Like the customers though! At lradt some or most of them! Manager has attitude never smiles at employees! There's a lot things that we atr not allowed to do!
bad,"The best part of my 3 years was when the manager was promoted and I ran the store.  I started with a great boss, who quit 2 months after I started, got the next one who was COMPLETELY INCOMPETENT, then transferred around a few stores handful of good and bad managers. Finally landed at a store with a great manager only to have him promoted 4 months after I got there.  Then again another ungrateful moron who didn't know his job.  Had to go."
bad,"Jobs not bad it's the company itself that is. Good pay, rotten benefits. Overall feeling of your job is not secure. Can be fired over little things. I recommend for short term."
bad,A typical day of work was receiving merchandise . What I learned was receiving duties . Management could be a lot more caring . Hardest part of the job was when people called off sick and you had to pick up the major slack .
bad,"Start the day with having to zone your area because it was not done by the overnight crew. Then go to bins in back room and scan them pull any and all freight that will go to the floor.Stock it,Order what you are out of. Make sure you do all price changes.Work out of stock report, And make sure you have no test to take.Help customers when they need assistance. Reset department when it is time. The Management team well only a few have time for you. They seem to forget were they came from. The hardest part of the job was not getting the proper help when it was needed, Or the proper training. The most enjoyable part of the job was the family i did make at Wal-MART. In the beginning when I started with them in 1999 it was a wonderful place to work, Could not ask for better Management than what we had. But as I said Most  Management this day and time there forget were they came from, meaning no compassion or anything but I also believe that is because of who is in charge of Wal-Mart now."
bad,This isn't a place for a mature adult to work and it's a call center environment with a lot of young adults. I was never informed until my 2 week of training that it was a production base position.
bad,It is good for a temporary job or for a single person. You can't support a family with walmart pay and hours. The management is awful and should really be worked out
bad,New managers come in looking to make a name for themselves and fire hard working employees that have been there for years and find a loophole or there way to justify it .
bad,Job can be very boring which makes it unpleasant sometimes. Sometimes you have customers/kids come through and leave merchandise all over the floor and everywhere else. Management thinks one area is supposed to stay clean and neat 24/7 but that is not possible with people constantly coming through wrecking it.
bad,love checking out customer helping them. We did not receive our breaks on time and lots of time we did not get our 2nd break. We never had enough cashier to help with checking out and assisting customer. Lines always long.
bad,"The company is some what stressful,  but it has nothing to do with the customers (I loved my customers). It was the employees. The employees were like crabs in a bucket."
bad,"Temp agency paid low $7.25,Hr,worked 40hrs,provided transportation.Errors with paycheck.I always showed up easter weekend had a problem collecting my paycheck wasnt paid correctly ."
bad,The store I worked at was okay in a sense. The other cashiers were nice and so were the Customer Service Managers. The biggest issue I had was upper management. One particular manager wouldn't give time off even if asked for in advance and didn't want to give weekends off even if you didn't have daycare for your children. I wouldn't go back to that store or that company. The third time was NOT the charm for me.
bad,"I enjoyed working at Walmart, but my hours were not consistent.  Management/communication was not good.  Double standards!  The moral at my location was not good.  My manager did not really take an interest in everyone in the department.  Sometimes you were spoken too and other times not.  It made for an uncomfortable situation."
bad,I t was hard to contact my managers and supervisors when i need to. This became a daily occurrence and impeded my work constantly. The facility was vary unsanitary with poor janitorial services.
bad,Very fast paste working. You learn a lot with in a few days on the job with learning videos. Hardest part of day would be the rush times on busy days.
bad,"The job only pays minimum wage for a lot of things you have to put up with. It wasn't the job that makes it hard, it was the people. It was always tense and people would have the poorest attitudes."
bad,Walmart's employers are the type of people that are quick to play favorites. once you get to management level all responsibility goes away. they aren't help accountable for their actions yet constantly punish associates those of which do exceptionally well at the company only to further secure their position from any young competitors. The place overall is just Toxic
bad,"You get hired for a certain department, but the minute you come in, they put you everywhere. There's no communication, so one manager tells you to do one thing, and then another to do something else. Then the first manager yells at you because you aren't doing what you were first told. Also, good luck changing your availability or booking anything off. There have been times I've booked things off a year in advance and on multiple occasions. You still get booked for it, and when brought up it management it's always ""well you're scheduled now so you have to deal with it"". Same thing when changing your availability. One of the worst places to work. You get treated terribly"
bad,Walmart gives decent pay. They have horrible management that never listen or even allow you to put your input in. The benefits are awful for part timers with no paid vacation or anything of the sort. If you ask for more hours they will give you less just to spite you. Advancement is hard to do because they hate change and would like to keep the people they already have even if they don't know/cant a do their jobs properly.
bad,"Nice people to work with; managers are ok; the work itself is very physical, and sometimes difficult; we were able to tale appropriate breaks; a lot of scheduling issues"
bad,"Very busy, stressful place to work.  District managers care very little about the stresses put on the pharmacists, technicians, and cashiers.  Biggest stressors are rude, irate customers, constantly having to counsel patient on meds they have already been on, and phones constantly ringing.  Very easy to get distracted and make a mistake.  Planning a vacation was joke.  Made you plan vacation a year in advance.  Very inflexible in this regard.  Gave you plenty of days of vacation, but if people in other stores already asked for the week - you would not get vacation during that week.  Compensation ok.  Pharmacy manager good.  Initial training and program rollout lacking in communication, coordination, and efficacy leading to employee dissatisfaction with programs.  Healthfairs a waste of time and resources.  Stop treating Pharmacists as marketers.  If you want marketers, go hire some - you are the biggest company in the world! Stop discipling pharmacist for not giving enough vaccines!"
bad,"As a manager, expect to work a minimum of 60 hours a week. No support from Market. You can be acknowledged for good work, but are recognized and torn down for anything that is not going well,"
bad,"Employee treatment is horrible and they need to take care of people. Overworks associates. Somewhat questionable upper management motives. Not all Walmart is created equal. Management needs to improve, not everyone there care about the employees unless they are liked."
bad,Boring repetitive work with nasty customers to deal with. Best part was laughing about the worst customers and their weird demands. Slim to zero chance of promotion or transfer except for the worst employees. Good vacation policy though.
bad,The company is very unorganized. If you get sick and have to miss a few days and you have not been there for more than 6 months you may get fired. Customers are rude
bad,Event though there were several thousand people working in the corporate office there were many instances of the good ol boy network. CEO got into politics too much instead of working for shareholders.
bad,I hate to say it but its true. I worked for this company for over 18 years and the culture has changed drastically! Pay is not worth the stress to say the least
bad,"This one is in no way worth it. Underhanded dealings, shoddy hours, over worked and under paid. Store remained understaffed 99.99% of the time. "
bad,"The store I work at is awful. Associates complain about management regularly. I have volunteered at different stores, and the associates there speak so highly of their management team."
bad,"Coworkers were great, management was unhelpful and rude. Customers think they are always right and are super rude and inpatient. However, there is opportunity for advancement"
bad,"not a great place to work, management didn't communicate very well. didn't care to much about the employee even tho when u get hired they act like its about being a family"
bad,"Work is ok for the most part. Management are the ones who make your life a wreck. The actual associates are the good ones, and make your work night more productive and fun. These are the ones who make you enjoy coming to work."
bad,El ambiente laborall es pesado ya que la gente no se presta para trabajar en equipo empezando por los gerentes hay preferencias y favoritismos.
bad,Not really something to live off unless you're ok with working your life away. Basically enough to suffice your necessities but not enough to escape financial woes.
bad,"Your manager determines your experience. The pay is enough to survive on and not much else, so if your manager feels that way about the job they will make you hate everything."
bad,"Managers didn't seem to care about the state of their departments. There were times where I offered to fix problems, and I was told to leave it alone because it would ""take too long""."
bad,"politics and salary management are tough, most employs attempt to be a joy around and assert themselves. H.R.s workability is mundane at the least and seizes to put any energy in to others"
bad,"just 15 min. of overtime can lead to a write up. managers were constantly non-existent for questions or direction. This company holds a policy that states any employee can be promoted at any time regardless of tenure/experience which sounds great but I quickly found that this policy leads to the ""favorite"" employees being promoted while the less fortunate employees are never allowed to transfer or be promoted out of the original department they were hired for. E.G. my 2nd shift instock supervisor ""Bill"" spelled the word grocery wrong (grosery). One would think that alone would disqualify this individual from promotion pending further educational progression, however, he is now an assistant store manager at a walmart in the Denver metro market. We had 6 pallet jacks three of which were broken and two of the other three were malfunctioning. the store manager, once made aware of this fact, ordered replacements six months after he new about the equipment issues. to save money management also forced the 2nd shift instock crew to overwork ourselves by refusing to hire on more employees for the holiday season."
bad,"The reason I left was because the Company was taking away benefits from the associates, such as no paid holidays (except Christmas) and very basic healthcar"
bad,"Daily tasks include scanning coupons, applying discounts, processing payments, and ringing up sales on computerized cash registers for Walmart shoppers."
bad,"Managers are nasty rude , nothings in order , pays okay depending on amount of hours , and trust me you barely get Any . "
bad,"No A/C in summer months, no heat in winter months for night staff. Employee's treated horribly by upper management. Fast paced work environment. Lots of work needing to be completed and small staff to complete expectations. Very minimal time for family and social life. Most of your time is spent at Walmart. Stock, merchandising and inventory for night crew."
bad,"So stuck in 1960s top down management they don't relize it.  They say all the modern management things, but they are so set in old ways it isn't even obvious to them."
bad,Worked for Walmart/Sam's Club for 4 years.  I always assumed jobs were terrible until I left.  Walmart treats their employees like garbage and hires management that has the same mindset.
bad,I was a young girl when I started working there it was amazing my first three years but hitting the fifth year the management team was very unprofessional and not very helpful the communication is not very good.
bad,"I think things were poorly ran. There are some good managers who actually care about the employees, then there are those that do not give two cares about realistic expectations."
bad,"I have worked at Walmart for 2 years, and as a Department Manager I make only 12.50 an hour.  To put that into perspective, as a department manager at Costco, I'd make 65,000 a year, salaried.  As a department manager at Winco, I would be started at 24.00 an hour.  But at Walmart? 12.50 an hour, to be in an extremely stressful management position, where virtually everything gets blamed on you.  I make less than a starting stocker at any other retailer, as a supervisor.  "
bad,"Walmart will hire you regardless of almost anything, it's an easy place to get your foot in the door. However, should you need any kind of accommodations from Walmart, such as a reasonable schedule or enough hours to make up for a commuting cost, don't bother."
bad,The bmjob wasn't terrible just a lot of work. Underpaid for too much work. The lay off rate was crazy!! You work to not keep your job get all comfortaboe and get laid off.
bad,"A typical day at work consist of off-loading goods from trucks and palletizing them according to each department in the store.(3-4 trucks on average). One big offload 3- 4 times per week which is what I was schedule for, depending on the season. Picking stocking/picking merchandise in the back room. To me it was easy work, being in sharp and all but definitely wasn't worth what I was being paid. Most days we were under staffed which made it very difficult to have the trucks offloaded in a timely manor or you would be written up is what we were threatened with. "
bad,"The title pretty much says it all. Everything you think working at Wal-Mart would be, it is. Overworking management, reprimanded for exceeding designated hours, doesn't want anyone to be full-time because they don't want them to qualify for benefits. Hours not conducive for anyone with children/family unless you have tenure."
bad,"Pay isn't great so you can only afford to shop at walmart, hours are constantly being decreased, stores are always understaffed, work is pretty straightforward and easy but the stress isn't worth it"
bad,terrible place to work. stressful and inappropriate staff. drama. did have good donuts. i hate reviewing things so im just going to keep typing. gooooo typing
bad,"I love some of the coworkers that I was working with, but overall they don't care about what you have going on in the world outside of Walmart and that is why i left."
bad,The overall culture appears to be supportive at the first initial perception when hired.  After you are employed the Executive Senior Management structure turns to an unacceptable Structure.
bad,I can honestly say that I thought Walmart was better than what it really is. I've only worked there for a year and have moved from an overnight stocker to an overnight bakery stocker and yet I'm getting pulled from my job to do someone elses every other night. There is also a severe lack of safety for the employees and the upper management couldn't care less. Most of my fellow employees are friendly and easy to get along with so that's a plus.
bad,"Walmart is incredibly stingy with management to a ridiculous level. I was fired because i had to go on medical leave for more time than they were willing to give me which was two days. I do not recommend this job. It's straightforward and simple, but the job is basically walking on eggshells around management."
bad,No communication between Managers and associates and not even between managers. No cross trainning in any department. Lack of associate appreciation. Favoritism Between Managers and associates. Not willing to work with associates schedualing among other tings.
bad,The hourly employees were great to work with. Some of the supervisors and management need to improve on their people skills. They seem to talk down to you and show no respect.
bad,"They treated me well for the most part, but you can't live off of the money you make and the hours they give. In conclusion I would say Walmart is a great place to get work experience as a young person but not an actual reliable source of livable income for an adult."
bad,"Not a good place to work. The management is overbearing and abuse their authority. There's no coordination among managers, which causes confusion among employees, as well as the desire to enforce their authority on employees who are under a different position in the workplace. They are also not very good at showing respect to their employees, yet they demand respect from them, just because they hold a higher position. The only good things about the job are the employees, who have a pleasant atmosphere to them, and the benefits."
bad,For this to be one of the most busiest and known company in the world. they want you to put in all the work and not pay enough its not fair to work there for 20 years and still make 10.25 an hour.
bad,"a hard review to write, but everything is of course entry level. really a job for teenagers and young adults to get there feet on the ground in the job world."
bad,toy sales  associate-  cleaned toys zoned toy changed mods  changed prices  organized bikes how too use a scanner stock items  very stressful job  but good learning experience
bad,"Walmart will not hire fulltime employees. People looking for work needs benefits. When your hired as a part time you cant have benefits till after a year. Becoming a fulltime will take a longtime. The pay rate is very low. They change all vacation time earned, all hplidays, personal time into what they call PTO. Which most associates that have been with the company for over 10yrs. Lost vacation hours."
bad,"Was nearly taken by member of the management "
bad,The envirnmetn was good. The hardest part of my job was lifting boxes over 50 pounds without any help. the most enjoyable part of my job is helping my customers find items. I really enjoy helping others.
bad,"I am a very busy every day, I do price changes set modulars, zone, stock shelves and anything else they need me to do. I have learned a lot from this company in the 11 years I have been employed with them. The hardest part of my job is the fact that we are short handed so sometimes it makes it hard to get everything done in a day."
bad,"Overall, A very easy job as long as you were able to put up with some of the other employees not doing their jobs, and the management not teaching you how to do things correctly."
bad,"safety first ,always busy one of the key things about it. Team work is a key word for this company. Striving to do better and serve the customers needs and to be more work oriented are main goals."
bad,"No work gets done, no one wants to do their job, no effort even from the managers to get things done until it's too late, this store is just terrible to work for because nothing gets done at all."
bad,"Very fast paced and alot of work but I insured that i got it done. The most enjoyable part is when you can help other coworkers or they help you. I did my work and made sure i provided the best customer service, I also made sure I kept a clean work area."
bad,"Not a  place you can be yourself. Management shows favoritism. I been there a year and they had 4 Mass Fires, hundreds of people lost their jobs. Jobs are not secure at Walmart at all."
bad,Management & assistant management have no clue how each department is truly ran. Favoritism is in all departments with little or no open for new employees. Mangers never stand up for employees.
bad,Walmart is a good starting point for working but it's not a life long commitment. The hectic scheduling makes it hard for any of the associates to have a life outside of work
bad,"Learned that there's a lot of mandatory training that is not applicable, and that it's mainly there to cover themselves, but not to be acted upon.  Most managers were decent, but some were horrible.  expectations were continually beyond the scope of what I was hired for.  Customers always wanted extra for free or lower prices.  Beware of ""Black Friday""."
bad,"Good benefits however no work/life balance. Days off are split and changes weekly. Lower mgmt. abused and unrealistic expectations."
bad,No communication from management. No set schedules. No matter how hard you work they want more and no complements for your work. Cutting hours and expectations are that you can get all your work done with less hours or when hiring they cut hours.
bad,"*The customer is number 1* is taken overboard when customer can can be rude, swear at the cashier, and treat them like dirt and the cashier has to stand there and take it. Cashiers get no respect...by customers or management."
bad,The people are wonderful but its the management that messes up this place sadly hopefully they can do better in the future and not tale advantage of hard working associates
bad,If you are sick you need to have not only pto but the sick time to cover it. Managers are biased in the way they treat employees and aren't punished for doing it.
bad,"In a typical day I prepared about 10-15 cakes. I learned that customer service is key in a successful business. Management is vital in company. The workplace culture is very welcoming, yet demanding. The hardest part of the job was cleaning the area before closing and the most enjoyable part of the job was making people smile through hard work."
bad,"Workers are treated like robots, not expected to have any life outside of Walmart. Little flexibility to deal with personal or family matters or illness."
bad,"soul crushing, dead end job. waste of time and life. it's not a career. no job security. no future. getting worse by the day. billion dollar company doesn't care for its employees"
bad,it is a great place to start off working at but the managers are very rude and the company as a whole can care about their employees more but the actual people are amazing
bad,"There is a lot of favoritism that goes on, a lot of people get overlooked when it come to promotions or moving up within the store."
bad,it  was very stressul and manger was very mean and rude it was mostly easy i loved learning new things hardest part o my job was being ion the freezer
bad,"In the summer time, it gets sometimes to hot in the trailers to work some time. The upper management kept changing thing for the bad i think. They could use a different sick policy"
bad,"The managers were very grumpy. They didn't give me the full training and expected me sell to their Rewards Mastercards. The store manager even threatened me that if i didn't get any Mastercard, they'll fire me."
bad,well with this company the store in Senatobia was a nice and organized place to work. I transferred to horn Lake store and it was a horrible place to work so some are bad and some are good just depend on who you work for.
bad,"a typical day fun"
bad,"Rather refrain from sharing.  Working harder rather than smarter mindset. "
bad,get to work and i'm always on belt. other than that nothing other the normal working standards. you get at least one break if your working a 4 hour shift. but its just a tactical job
bad,It was one of the most stressful work experiences I've ever had. The other workers there seemed to not care what you or any others thought about or did.
bad,"I come in package rolls and bread. Go to break, finish packaging. Go to lunch. Start cleaning and markdowns for bakery for next day, Usually by myself from 4pm until 8:30pm when I finally go home after being there 9 hours. best part about working there is 1 hour lunch."
bad,Advancement can be hard to accomplish when working third shift. Need to be on first shift to be able to advance in wal-mart unless your night manager is willing to go to bat for you.
bad,What can I say. This was a job to pass the time and make a little money on the side while attending school. Easy job. No room for promotion. High turnover rate.
bad,"Raised pay - good"
bad,"I was told to choose between my college education and my job. This, after dealing with rude customers who would cuss me out for taking their ID. There was no sympathy from the vast majority of management and expectations were outrageous."
bad,"Working at Wal-Mart is horrible. Most of the staff are not friendly, and management do absolutely everything (including being on their phones 24/7) EXCEPT manage!"
bad,"Unrealistic expectations for management.  Other than my training, I hated every minute of it.  I became a target for senior management.  It wasn't for a lack of trying.  I've excelled in every job I've ever had, except this one.  But once those who hold the power over your employment get an itch that needs scratching, there's really nothing you can do.  Salaried managers are treated much worse than hourly employees.  My experience at WalMart ruined me for retail management."
bad,"I have only worked at one Walmart and it is in a very small town. The management is very unfair and not helpful at all. I feel like I can never go to my Manager for help, Because she gets mad at you and just walks away when asked a question. You only move up into management, because of seniority not if you know everything about the department. My manager also will talk about you to other coworkers, I think it is very unprofessional."
bad,"Management is never found when needed, not enough employees for amount of work given, no employee appreciation, management is rude and does not care about employees. Will not work with you if you need to change schedule. Orientation is boring but easy and informative. There are opportunities for advancement"
bad,All about money not employees or customers. Lack of communication from all levels of management . Love my coworkers. No holiday pay anymore and work every weekend.
bad,The work to life balance is not good. If I had to work there again would. The drama and favoritism is really bad though. Everyone is in your business and people are very lazy there. If you do your job well you're expected to do everyones work on top of yours and if you can't you're some  how  in trouble for it.
bad,"A lot is is expected from their associates. Family is said to be the focus, however, there is no regard for an individuals family needs. There is an expectation from management that work comes first. The compensation is competitive to the market for similar work, but low in regards to what is expected from their associates. Leadership is not well trained and moved through the ranks quickly to fill needs. Very high stress and management deals in passive aggressive threats mixed with guilt trips."
bad,"The company culture changed a lot in the time I was there.  The company does not focus on the Associate the way it claims.  If your focus is solely on career and do not mind a disproportionate work/life balance that is weighed heavily on work, you will be fine."
bad,"They are like any other retail giant, profits are the main concern. Were not very flexible when working with college kids. Notified them on schedule change due to classes and they would not budge."
bad,Tro begin with the wages for the position I worked were not fair based on the responsibilities of the position. The management takes little to no responsibility for the training and permission of new hires in their department my
bad,When they train there employees they don't really teach them the job they want you to do. They start in area that  has five areas to work plus help customers. The mangers get mad at you for doing your job correctly and they have no respect for their employees.
bad,"For a first job, it is okay, But they do take advantage of anyone they can. They have favorites and do not treat everyone equal. A good amount of fellow employees are so kind. I've learned that you have to start somewhere in the job field."
bad,nice friendly place to work but the benefits do not match the wage this is a place for a college student working their way through school or a supplemental income for retirees
bad,"Very special from a start Wal-Mart is with a loss of their employees through time without listening, taking suggestions, realizing a team is pulling bad production for a reason and should focus on managers not getting to friendly and chubby chubby enabling mis-focusing on production."
bad,"At Walmart, one definitely meets a plethora of individuals.Whether these individuals are the staff or the customers, one tends to learn various ways in which to handle many different individuals."
bad,"Definitely not somewhere I would ever work again, maybe it was just my location. But my experience was awful, way understaffed, and overly demanding for 1 person to carry out on their own. Not always but most of the time it became very difficult and the people they hire are incredibly lazy."
bad,"Was not my favorite job, not as friendly as one may think, oddly hostile. It started as a great job that seemed to offer great opportunities, but soon all the work would seem so critical and unfairly overwhelming for a part time who worked like a full time."
bad,"The lack of tact, good treatment, and human relations skills with the staff is poor. The culture of the supervisors is more like the treatment of prisoners."
bad,"Walmart can be a good and fun place to work but sadly management is always fussing at you and you are always understaffed in every department. They never hire enough people for the job. They cut hours too often and try to get 5 to do the job of 15. Management will never back you up and you are always left to defend yourself. Walmart is not a team based company anymore. Nobody strives to help one another. Management is too set on trying to get the job done than making their associates and customers happy. Because if you make your associates happy and treat them right then they will then in turn make your customers happy. But it doesn't seem like management or anyone higher seems to care about that anymore. Just ""work work work, get the job done, we don't care how many people you have we expect you to get it all done no matter what, just make it happen."""
bad,"Too many managers to deal with. I never knew which manager to take orders from. The old saying ""too may cooks in the kitchen"" is applicable. The management culture is very political and is not employee friendly"
bad,"This was a job that could have been more. I love assisting customers with their problems but I would get yelled at for assisting them. I would be working for a different department and I would get yelled at for not working in yet another department. Management is a joke, there's constant political infighting and at the end of the day, the only reason why I stuck it out there was for the money."
bad,Working for Walmart is a good starting job but not a good career choice. From my experience working at Walmart they expect you a lot more at of you then you are capable.
bad,This job is not an enjoyable work environment.  Since the death of founder Sam Walton this company has been on a downward spiral. Management is vast and employees are scarce. Most do not participate in the productivity of the store. They are horrible at giving direction and often it varies from one manager to the next. Listening and following through are not skills required to be a manager at this company either. Also the customers here are very difficult. They are angry because they can't find what they want or anyone to help them and they have to wait in line to leave. They often don't want to be there and for some reason feel it is ok to take it out on the employees.
bad,take the job only if you don't have anything else! fast paced for low pay and the management is horrible! slave driven. You will only move up if you brown nose.
bad,I learned different departments of the job. some managers faor people. the hardest part was trying to get to solve some customers problems but I got the problems sovled for the customer. most enjoyable part was when customer tell me I should be a department manager/manager because I'm good working with customers
bad,"A typical day at work involved standing at the end of the register-aisle for one or two hours, not allowed to sit, while waiting for customers to check out. I learned that customers do not consider retail employees as ""people,"" they consider them ""the help"" or ""the workers."" Management was not organized, even during inspections, nor were they sympathetic to any lower-ranked employee's concerns. Fellow employees were very nice and supportive; the break-room was cold and only the floor was clean. The hardest part of being a cashier was the pressure to scan items faster than 200/minute at entry-level; in my first ten days I was unfairly compared to another employee whom had been working as a cashier for six months; new cashiers were often told that we would be ""let go"" if we could not meet the speed of more-experienced coworkers. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I would finally be allowed to clean my register and register-aisle."
bad,A typical day at Walmart was assisting customers and working with other associates.  The hardest part of the job was remaining organized.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers.
bad,"You don't mater  your just a tool to be used and discard  when  you're  worn-out "
bad,"The managers were nice at first, but then they started showing their true colors. I was yelled at for having a fidget spinner on the front end. Mind you I have one to help calm my anxiety, and I only ever brought it out if it was really slow and I had no customer. I would get yelled at for every little thing I did wrong, and I was even forced to leave work 30 minutes early."
bad,"Would never recommend this job place or type of work to anyone, especially if one wishes to have a positive work atmosphere and environment.Not a good career choice to make!"
bad,"Worst place I have ever worked. Job is not bad, but management is horrible. They do not treat you with any kind of respect whatsoever. Question everything you do."
bad,Walmart DC's are better paying but the benefits suck. Management really are there to harass you and their open-door policy sucks. I would not recommend anyone make it a career. Good for people going to college.
bad,"i watched coworkers and myself have to carry unnecessary load, daily. We did so many things we were not paid for and put so much unnecessary time into doing this job."
bad,Must work a fast pace to accurately check out guest in a timely manner to minimize long lines. Price match competitors ad to satisfy guest to save money on items. Resolve guest problem in a friendly professional manner.
bad,Boss always on you about doing everything at one time every hour of a 9 hour shift ... rotating You from One Department to another expecting you to know everything about the other department even when you were not trained in that department
bad,El trabajo es mucho en relación al sueldo ( la remuneración no es compensada con el trabajo del día a día) muchas exigencias a diario.
bad,"wal-mart was okay its just that some of the staff can be unprofessional. "
bad,"This job has good benefits. The work is hard, but the pay is okay. Management is clueless. To me, they don't care about the employee's or the customers."
bad,"Walmart has a point system in which it ensues 4 points (or absences) within 6 months. This also included leaving more than 2 hours before your shift or closing in or out more than 10 minutes before your shift ends or begins. This system did not take into account my disability (random abnormal blood sugar drops) until a year after working there. If you do not get sick easy, this is perfect for you, however us with disabilities have a tougher time working here."
bad,upper management had a complete smile in your face thing going on.  All you heard was how good it was to work there before the new guys came in.  maybe it was the facility.
bad,"The job itself was great and fun. The pay, hours and management lacked greatly. Hours were always changing without notice, pay was so-so and the management was clueless as to what needed to be done."
bad,The only good thing about working for Walmart is the pay. Management is awful and the customers are even worse. It would be better if they would let us get overtime but the second we get even close to getting overtime w get sent home.
bad,"When I started working at Walmart, things were much different.  Over the years, the company has reduced benefits in order to increase starting pay.  Most positions offered are part-time, which limits the benefits that are available.  Despite many efforts to eliminate favoritism, some stores still struggle with this, promoting people they like to positions for which they may not be qualified."
bad,consist of making sure the cashiers have money at all times opening and closing the store management was not very supportive they mostly stayed in the office culture was not good everybody was tired and over worked trying to get management to listen to complaints and concerns associates who really cared about
bad,"I liked working there, it was management and some co works , shouldnt be working there They think they now it all.  and bossing people around  the co workers need to mind there own business and  not boss people around"
bad,"With my rather, longer than anticipated time working there. I really just had to make friends and make the absolute best of it. I think I got lucky with the people I had worked with. We made the best of it and sometimes, nights were tolerable. If you work overnight, I suggest getting headphones since they had allowed everyone to listen to music the entire night. But if you can't do these things, I suggest staying away."
bad,Leadership should teach you how to lead by showing you how to do it. Then they act mad when you mess up after they haven't taught you. Computer simulations shouldn't be how you train people.
bad,"Each Walmart is different. I worked at a Walmart close to the main office in Arkansas and it was one of the best places I had ever worked. The management was well-maintained and kind, hours were enough for each person without wearing anyone out, etc. But the other Walmart I worked for was one of the worst career experiences. My crew was always cleaning up after the previous shift and unable to finish our work. We would me kept from going home but written up for overtime. Management was rude and unkind to employees."
bad,This company is not good for long term. They are not at all that good for making money if you have a few bills to pay every month or if you have a car.
bad,Management and associates are very corrupt and unprofessional. Does not take into account serious matters. Alot of unprofessional drama there. Restrooms are filthy.
bad,"This job was my least favorite. Everybody that worked there seemed as if they did not like their jobs. No coworkers spoke to each other unless necessary, and customers did not result well to that."
bad,"Wal-mart is not a great place to work in Oxford, MS. Management does not want to help associates and they show favoritism horribly. It is not worth what they claim benefits you. The store manager is rude, and people only tolerate him because he is the store manager. He makes you feel lower than dirt by the way he commands you to do things. Assistant Managers do no know how to talk to their associates either. Co managers are just as worse. When you become something like a Customer Service Manager, Dept Manager, Support Manager, or anything under Assistant Manager be prepared to be talked to like an animal just at this location. I used to love my job, until the store manager changed. Now this store is like a zoo. You can get a coaching for one thing and even if someone else does the same thing you've done with no penalty they still try to justify why you got coached. This store was so much better when the other store manager was there. They will overwork you with no raise. If you are a cashier, you'll be placed as a people greeter, stocker, cart pusher, etc. It doesn't matter. If management needs you regardless of how important it is for you to do your position they will still pull you. They do petty things that are uncalled for. Overnight management is not any better. I would not recommend anyone to work here. People get hired so much that remembering names is becoming difficult."
bad,The job it's easy but you have very dirty co-workers you have to share the trucks with the shifts change from 5 days a week to 4 it's hard to get the hours no overtime pay after 60 hours I honestly can recommend they reward laziness not hard work very disappointed there it's not a professional attitude towards drivers
bad,Me despidieron al momento en que cumplí los tres meses.
bad,The store I worked at was miserable. My cashiers constantly called in. The other managers didn't want to deal with anything so they hid hoping someone else would work. Sales associates never knew where things were. Nobody ever wanted to help myself or the customers. It was a constant nightmare.
bad,"This job is a clock in and clock out kind of job. When you first start working people can tell because you are happy, but when you've started to work there for a while it is miserable."
bad,"Raises go up so slowly you'll stay pretty much right at minimum wage. A new hire doing the same job as you can literally be making more than you. They claim to be spending 2.1 billion more dollars on employee wages, and since this announcement I've been getting 2% raises per year. Promotions only come if you're female or a new hire, just so they can prove politically correct statements."
bad,Nice environment hours are always available to work. Sometimes busy and the day can get pretty hectic but when everyone work together it go by great. Ive learned that if you do your best it always great opportunites at walmart with better positions. Management uis okay but could be better.
bad,"I used to love working at Wal-Mart now, management does not seem to care about their employees. I come in on my days off, stay over and go above and beyond my job duties and no appreciation is ever shown."
bad,"Most of the training you receive is on computers, the training does not prepare you for the real thing. My cashier training on the computer used a completely different model of cash register than the ones used in the store."
bad,Working for Walmart was actually fun. If you are a hard worker they will give you hours. My only problem was they were not willing to work around my school schedule.
bad,"I did enjoy working with the public and did my job well.  However, I did not like the hours which were different every day and every week.  Some early mornings, some late nights, some half days."
bad,Caring about what you do for your people is very important. Mangers their can be very rude to their associates.The people their can be great to work with
bad,"I really had some great coworkers in my department, but the hours would always be changed without notice.  The manager's kept changing frequently, causing a mess.  The store is extremely disorganized, and most of the employees do not do their part causing more work for those who do.  I would not recommend."
bad,"Where to start..."
bad,I hated this job. The workers were given more with than the time limit allowed and the managers would belittle you if you were not finishing. The amount of stocking was unreasonable for the amount of hours.
bad,It's a job. But not exactly my cup of tea. That's about it. Only work for here if you need money. I enjoyed working with the public but the management made the job kind of intolerable at times.
bad,"if you have no respect for yourself or hope for anything better you work for walmart. No career advancement and no respect for emplotyes. just the worst. but the pay is good,"
bad,"The pay was good, I had NO experience and ended up starting at $9.45 an hour as a part time cashier."
bad,Just working here while I'm in school. The management of the place and the pay for the amount of physical labor is not good                                           .
bad,"It doesn't matter how hard you work or how much you give, it's all about the money they are making. They hide what the plans are for your future and tell you misleading facts to keep you there."
bad,"I enjoyed working for Walmart up until I started having health issues. After that, it was difficult do gain understanding from management about mu condition."
bad,"The job itself wasn't bad, the management however, that's a different story. The hours weren't too bad. Some of the associates are just difficult to work with."
bad,"Tilton Walmart has a Management that doesn't pay any bit of attention to the regular associates. There is no open communication like the Plymouth Walmart. I saw the store Manager a total of two times the entire time I worked at Tilton Walmart and I think he only talked to me once. At Plymouth, the store manager actually comes to me, even if it's only to walk by and say hi it's better than not knowing him what so ever. Also I started as a seasonal employee so I made $7.25 an hour then I came back on as a truck crew associate making $7.50 am hour. Plymouth Walmart have a starting rate of $10 an hour for truck crew associates!"
bad,I loved working with some of the people but the management team was a little lacking in the area of managing associates. Hours were okay but unwilling to work with availability change with me.
bad,Not sure what to say on here. I understand we are now ruled by the corporate world but for real this place needs to get it together. I am highly disappointed in how things work here.
bad,After 10 years of service they gave me a severance package on the day I returned from Maternity leave.  Needless to say I am less then impressed with this company.
bad,I worked in so many departments and i felt that you had to up in management position to get some respect from other manger and dept mangers...........
bad,"Wal-Mart was one of those companies who took advantage of meeting the minimum requirements to avoid paying you at full-time rates. 38 hours weekly was the required schedule, and 40 hours would allow full-time benefits. We could still work beyond 40, but not in consecutive weeks. Training was minimal, and coverage was so dismal that I rarely worked the position I was actually hired for."
bad,"They didn't go with your work availability. They could never have the schedule right, one minute it would be in the system, then it wouldn't it was just not stable scheduling. Also was told I wouldn't work every weekend day, only to be working every weekend both days."
bad,never really had a full 8 hour day.. they gave me a ton of work the was impoosible to finsih in the hourly time they gave me. never was in my section because of short staff.. the workers were nice.
bad,"The store was very stressful to work at. Too many jobs to handle not enough people. "
bad,"Out of all places I have worked , my experience there was horrible. You would think being such a huge company they would be organized. They would give me my schedule for 2 weeks and it never failed I would receive phone calls from management saying my schedule was changed. Always had to cancel plans in my personal life. I do not recommend this job to no one."
bad,"Walmart provides ample opportunity for you to advance within the company. However, if you aren't a member of management they will treat you like dirt. They are corporate machines and will replace you with the flip of a switch. They have no regard for your personal life, and constantly schedule against your provided availability.  They take pride in the fact that most of their management team has worked their way up from being a part-time associate. While that may seem attractive to some, it generally provides the stores with extremely inadequate levels of management. Great place to apply if you want a job quickly, but turnover is almost disgustingly high at these stores. Highly recommended to avoid Walmart."
bad,"Working at a supercenter be prepared to stock 14-18 hours of freight in a 8 hr shift. Bad management, good coworkers but will sell you out in a second"
bad,"The workplace was fine and I got along with my co-workers, a typical day involved me organizing and restocking shelves, and helping out customers when they asked."
bad,"This job was terrible. As a college student, I don't want to work 40-hour weeks over the summer, but I worked too many hours to enjoy anything else. It was terrible."
bad,Management is lazy and not very helpful. Sometimes lied to and false promises. Have to pick up slack from other people in different departments. Work all holidays but Christmas.
bad,"Poor management skills , managers are constantly being changed  from store to store . Not a good environment to work in , very stressful not enough pay."
bad,The managers are great if they see potential they push for you to keep doing better. But my reviews are due to my work adding from others not doing their part.
bad,"Clean and respectful work place, can not rely on pay to survive any more .  My family and I need more,  I am a hard worker and im very dependable about being there and doing my job great.  I do great with customer service and cleaning and stocking or restocking .  Front facing items on shelves .  I enjoy the most being actifive all my shift."
bad,Definitely a good place if you need apart time job or something to get you on your feet. not too many hours they give you so you can balance your life out.
bad,"Walmart was a great company but since Mr. Walton died it's changed ,I cannot say to make it your career,i loved my job ,have been at the same store 27 yr,but not anymore."
bad,"Always more work then your shift, Learn not to talk to the people you work with,or management will put more work on top of the work y0u have,and will find a way to right you up,The store manager say your should clock in running no time to talk, work place culture is very stressful, The hardest part of my job is getting threw the day with out management talking to you like your nothing,and having the items you need to perform your job, The most enjoyable part of the day is clocking out."
bad,"In the past, Walmart has strived harder to be a better company to work for. I feel that has fallen by the wayside. The company has been systematically eliminating upper paygrades from its hourly job tiers for more than 5 years now. There are not nearly as many choices or opportunities there once were. Attendance and scheduling policies make it very difficult if you have a family. There are too many people working for the company that are stuck at part time that want to be full. Walmart has very bright hard-working people working for them, they just need to get serious about keeping them."
bad,"A typical work day for me would consist of arriving early, picking my equipment then starting with a group huddle followed by a morning stretch then quick morning meeting. I would then be given my assignment/ truck to unload then start unloading the truck until empty then receive another truck after until my day was over. I would receive merchandise into the ware house that would later be distributed to different stores."
bad,"Most of the managers were always in a bad mood, made your whole job experience a non enjoyable time, but other than that being a cashier was pretty easy. While I was there I didn't receive a discount or any type of benefit."
bad,The company was good depending on the market and management. Different markets brought different challenges. It was an ok place depending on those....
bad,"Opening the bakery or deli departments, stocking items for the day, and working one-on-one with customers.  Communicating with co-workers to complete the requirements of the departments.  Following all safety and sanitation rules."
bad,"Expect next to nothing. The work conditions are exhausting and physically demanding despite the outside appearance of minimal demands."
bad,"Advancement opportunities, great at developing skills, great place to learn a skill and grow your resume, or grow with the company"
bad,Walmart is by far the worst business I have had the pleasure of working with. The managers are usually rude and don't answer any questions. Workplace culture is awful. Hardest part of the job is working around the customers and other associates.
bad,Employees are not treated as well. Benefits are not as good. Time off is a problem when there is a death in your family out of town. Hours are constantly being cut at bad times for families around the holidays. I enjoyed working with my coworkers.
bad,"this was probably my least favorite job, nothing about this job was stimulating. the hardest part working here was I felt like I was too trapped. it felt like nobody truly wanted to be here."
bad,"Chefes fazem muita diferença entre os funcionários, assediando e humilhando alguns, passando a mão na cabeça de outros."
bad,This particular location was run by a moron (I'm not just being mean. I was his cashier once. It took him 3 tries to figure out how the card reader worked.) The day-to-day operations were run haphazardly and HR was nonexistent. I was promised a couple of raises and benefits I never received.
bad,"Retail/Sales Associate"
bad,"I was miserable working here.  They never taught me properly how to work with their idiotic couponing policy and even if I asked questions about it, I was put down like I was some sort of moron.  I was absolutely stressed out and I got panic attacks quite a bit due to being pushed.    I wouldn't recommend this awful place  to anyone."
bad,"management is terrible. no overtime unless the company authorized it, usually at busy time. ie thanksgiving/christmas.  Work is easy. pay is commensurate with the job. in other words stinks. usually only gets 25 to 30 hours per week. dont expect 40."
bad,"The pay is whatever , raises are BS! In order to move up in this company you have to kiss the behind or know someone. Your work will not matter. Breaks? Forget about it. Only thing is a bonus up to $500 every four months."
bad,"Enjoy working with everyone there, no chance for advancement or full time hours, labor intensive, working with the public in the area that you know most people is very special."
bad,"unfortunately the pay is fair"
bad,They expect you to do more than what's possible. The hardest worker gets fussed at at the end of the day. Its hard to please managers and employees really get no type of respect. They talk to you like you're lower than them.
bad,"Tough place to work for the most part. I started as a backroom manager, which they dropped me into with pretty much no training, and had to learn on the job, and three months later finally put me through ME Management essentials to teach me how the Out of control paperwork reports helped me do my job, and then plopped me into a different store where I was constantly belittled, and guilted into working mucho hours without pay  (salary) in overtime, and even then being dragged through the mud for after cutting my labour having challenges being perfectly clear of stock from day to day. Assistant manager roles are under appreciated, over worked, over stressed, and paid only ok.  Target paid better but the hours were even worse."
bad,Not a real good place to work. To many issues with management and co workers. A typical day was usually chaotic at best. I already know most of what i had to do. A lot of heavy lifting. Had the same shift every night.
bad,"The management was not good. The managers were not willing to work with the employees, made the employees feel like they were not good workers. They also make employees feel like they can't advance in the company."
bad,"People are fairly decent around Walmart but the management is poor. They are always reactive, rude, they disrespect you and belittle you instead of helping you and try to help you grow with the company. The store manager is the worse in this as he will shoot down request to transfer or even advance in the company. Many people have had to leave the store in secret in order to actually begin to get ahead."
bad,a typical day at work was coming in clocking in and straight to work. learn a lot about the company and the people. Management was so so only a few was for the employee's. love the work environment. The hardest part of my job was always being the only working never was enough people to help. But I did love my co works and grest parts we would have like thanksgiving time ect.....
bad,"I worked at Walmart for several years. During that time, raises became drastically reduced, staffing was seriously cut back, and many grandfathered-in perks were dropped."
bad,"Managers are not leaders and dont have experience in the fields they are managing, they are not team oriented and dont care about the employees well being. There are very few benefits and it is nearly impossible to move up in the company. You get hired on to a position and you are stuck there."
bad,"Nights were always understaffed. There was no communication between managers. Day shift and night shift did not communicate well. Was required to take computer classes on work skills and walmart, but was never given enough time complete them. Upper management always blamed night shift for things not getting done without figuring why it wasn't done (were busy trying to clean up mess day shift left and process clothing that came in on double truck nights). All around ridiculous situation."
bad,"I was a cat pusher so we were just responsible for making sure the parking lot was clean and clear to make it easier to customers to get there groceries to their vehicle easily. Management was rude, but was flexible."
bad,"Its walmart. Does it need and explanation? Garbage pay, hire anybody off the street, because they need the bodies. Management changed out every quarter to scare employees about how they can lose they job."
bad,"While working at Walmart, it felt as though no one cared about not only the customers but also the fellow workers. Whether it be managers or just a Cashier..."
bad,"I did learn a lot of interesting things, such as dealing with inventory, checking the inventory to see what needs to go out on the floor, and learning which section each product goes to. I learned some extra customer service skills. I learned how retail gets ready for sales, new products, and holidays. I also got to deal with new shipments coming to the store straight off the truck."
bad,"I am a hard worker and love to learn new things. Did change positions a couple times and last position was suppose to receive a raise. Ask a few times too many and never received one. Other issues are some employees got to slack a lot with no consequences and people who actually did their job did not get any rewards or much gratitude. They also wanted more, more, and more! Did not like the hour lunch that was not paid for. That is too much extra time given to the job instead of home life."
bad,"Walmart is currently known to be rebranding itself for it's employees.  Having worked there, I can assure that they are still just as bad as before.  When I was there, they underhanded me with promises of benefits and increase pay.  I have a degree and, not only was I denied benefits for the amount of hours I worked (which I had no control over how many I received), but I also was the lowest paid person in my department."
bad,"This store is a giant yet they treat their workers poorly offer no benefits or incentives. Do not have store properly staffed or organized for that matter, management was terrible."
bad,"I did enjoy my time there. Upper management was over worked and im sure under paid. I believe in ""lead your people by example and the Store Manager led by intimadation. Its a domino effect."
bad,"Expectation of getting things done with no help gets hard to balance work and life.  The benefits are great, but every day is a walk on egg shells with fear of losing your job."
bad,"The workplace was clean, and productive.I enjoyed working with other Associates.Having a New Store Manager who knew how to get things done was a plus."
bad,"Ridiculously unorganized company. No training at all, hostile employees.Required to work until 11 and the buses stop running. Rude and cluesless management. I would ask for time off and they would always mess up the days. Very stressful and under staffed. Would not recommend to a friend."
bad,"The best part about working here is the other associates you work with, and sometimes they are not great either. Management is generally a joke, and many associates do NOT do their fair share of work. If you are a cashier, the most important thing is selling mastercards. Not customer service, not being fast and helpful, but selling mastercards. Many people that work here are pleasant, but the morale is usually quite low when it comes to work life and how associates are treated. If you work part time, there are no benefits, and they hire as many part time associates as possible so that do not have to pay benefits. Management has no respect for peoples personal lives, such as when somebody I know had their mother pass away, they called two days later and asked if they were going to be at work. Working with the customer really taught me a lot about people, and I think I learned some valuable skills, but in general it is not a good place to work."
bad,staff was amazing. new pharmacist not so amazing. was terminated after being told that they would help me with my situation. pharmacy received a new pharmacist and he refused to stick to agreement previous pharmacist made.
bad,"The people you work with are great. Day to day there is always something different happening. The hardest part of the position for me is working to close, as I have worked days for many years and still can not get use to working later in the evening.  I am more of a morning person."
bad,Gave many years and was let go for a minor reason. Management did not stand by rules and chose times on when to enforce them and who to enforce them upon.
bad,The hardest part about a job in management is you have to be able to understand both sides of each story. You also have to ensure that the balance of a personal and a business relationship with employees doesn't get mixed. You want to be personable and show that you care but business is business and things must be ran a certain way. I've learned alot in the past few years in management and I'm looking for more experience.
bad,"Empresa com benefícios inferiores a outras do gênero, com pouco ou nenhum incentivo ao funcionário,  ampla desigualdade no tratamento com pessoas,"
bad,"learning new things and wanting to be at the work place. the winter time was hard, but I could do it. I liked be out side. liked helping people with their stuff out to their cars."
bad,"Poor management, low pay, no compassion for associates a typical day consist of demanding managers,short breaks,fights with other associates, no work place culture."
bad,I would work 2 to 11pm every day but Friday and Saturday. I would come in right as the rush starts and not go home tell after 11 usually trying to finish all the work I had to do with it being so busy and unable to get to it.
bad,Full-time positions are scarce and customers are always right. You are constantly talked down to. There is never enough people on staff to handle the amount of people coming through the door.
bad,"A poor environment to work in, very stressful and most everyone there did not want to be there, they find any reason to not promote and do not honor or appreciate tenure."
bad,Wal mart does not care about its employees. They schedule more hours and cut back so that you do not get paid for overtime. The pay is not even minimum wage and there is too much work that isn't worth the pay
bad,"The people doing the actual jobs were great, they did such a good job for the amount of time and the pay that they received. So much was asked of them for such little time. We had to jump in and help them finish the job at times because we did not have enough people to do the job. The amount of hours demanded from us that were on salary was outrageous."
bad,Ambiente de trabajo regularmente divertido y calid
bad,"I worked at Walmart for a year and a half the pay was less than decent, it was ok for first time working or if you have little to no work experience. Management was the worst with no training or treated you less than human. will not go back."
bad,Didn't enjoy my time there. I had to take on extra shifts due to my lazy coworkers. My managers were not the best neither. My pay was miserable. I didn't get paid the extra hours I worked
bad,The people I worked with and what I did was amazing but my managers were so terrible and rude and disrespectful I couldn't handle it. Good place to work for benefits and pay but I wouldn't recommend it unless you can take a verbal beating on the daily from your managers.
bad,The reason why I labeled it what I said was because of the reason I got terminated. I had family emergency that came and they did not care for it. I had to miss my own grandmother  funeral.
bad,"Walmart would be a great company to work for, however the store that I work at the Management, mood, teaching, training fall short real short on my scale of jobs that I have had over 30 years. The United States Army ( which I am so proud to serve for 10 years ) was way more informative, training and advancement and the mood and to camaraderie was excellent. Something that Walmart is so need much,much more improvement. and their scheduling and their advertising they help and support veterans: well this veteran Walmart has never helped me on anything, I have been there almost 2 years in July and not one member of Management has ever thanked me for my service. I think that is insulting and very,very sad. however the group of people minus the supervisor in my department the Associates that I work with and several others that I deal with are great as are the customer."
bad,"Too many bosses, unorginized management system. co workers in general are good to work beside. slow workers did not help and could get away with doing very little. managers were alaways hard to find."
bad,"was hired in to stock new store, cross trained for cashier, men's and boys wear, door greeter and answer phones. new year day manager waited 15 minutes befor shift end to say was laid off due to not enough business."
bad,"Horrible work life balance, horrible upper management.  Best aspect 49K a year, although it nearly cost me my marriage! I thought I hit the motherload when I got hired at Walmart.  I did a 5 week training in Cincinnati that essentially taught me nothing, but it was all paid! I was hired in making 16000 dollars more than any other job I ever held.  I transferred into my new position, and it was a train wreck, the store manager could care less about the store or employees, she got fired and a new manager came in and we all thought he would be amazing... we were wrong! He was uncaring and if he didn't like you he would work to get rid of you, although if you were a cute young girl he would overturn any attendance issues or coachings so he could keep flirting. I worked just over a year and nearly lost my marriage, I was at work more than I was ever at home.  You are forced to stay after your shift end regardless of needed or not."
bad,"To much drama, felt like I was in high school again. A lot of gossiping. Job was pretty stressful for being minimum wage. Always covering for other people"
bad,a work day at Walmart starts of slow then slowly gets busy as the day goes on. if t get really busy we cart pushers are constantly harassed about the bay not being completely  full. the management at Walmart have no care of there employees and do not recognize when an associate is working hard at there job. management refuses to request the proper equipment required to do the job efficiently.
bad,"Es un trabajo bajo mucha presión se aprende rápido por necesidad pues el flujo de la gente no para y te obliga a poner alerta todos tus sentidos pues en muchas ocasiones los rateros tienen mucha imaginación y uno tiene que adivinar donde se guardan mercancía  para no genérale mermas a la empresa, también para detectar billetes falsos en ocasiones se presentan personas con habilidades para envolver al cajero o confundirlo y hacerle perder a el."
bad,"Great employees to work with, always something to do at walmart so teaches employees to be autonomys workers. Learned a lot about conflict resolution and customer service"
bad,"I can't see myself working for Walmart ever again. Its unfulfilling, and unrewarding. There's no overtime allowed and its something that could get you fired. Starting pay at 40 hours a week in almost impossible to live off of."
bad,"The Walmart Home Office is not the place any designer wants to be. I learned quite a lot as far as the retail business goes, but Walmart is not a place for a designer. The pay was terrible, the office was dark and dirty, the equipment was 5 years old or older, the software was not up to date. I had to work on my own personal computer most of the time just to get my work done. Plus, they expected me to work on average of 65+ hours a week. There's absolutely no job security within Walmart."
bad,"Very unprofessional, they never knew who was working, management was lazy and sat in their offices all day never rarely moved. We always had to work extra because they never scheduled enough employee, it was a huge mess."
bad,"a good company , enjoyed my time there , good employees "
bad,At first when I got hired I felt like I was going to be part of a family. shortly after I realized that was false. Managers will not work with you to give direction. You will be given 5 task by 4 different managers and given short time periods to complete said task. I have 2 friends in other states who have and also currently work for wal-mart. Both have had similar experiences
bad,"They say that this IS a new project . But that is a lie. They say there is great room for advancement, also a lie. They promise a lot, with a laid back work environment and good life balance.  If you like to see your family in the morning before they go to school, and after 9 at night, never on the weekends, then I quest that is balance."
bad,You will be promised a promotion but not get it. Be told that you will get full time and not get it. And get scheduled to work late at night then come back early in the morning. Some people will do their jobs others won't and some people will smell had you'll complain and nothing will be done about it.
bad,"Lack of leadership the managers don't know how to do their job and don't help you or show you how to do yours... If your new you get no help and the only way to get ahead in this company is by kissing up... I was left by myself to do the job of 5 for 3 hours straight on multiple occasions, and every time a costumers gave me a complement on a job well done the managers didn't seem to care. The only good thing about working for walmart was talking to my costumers and meeting new people."
bad,"Working for Walmart was a blessing and a nightmare. They allow for flexible scheduling of work hours, even as a member of management. This is great if one has a complex out of work life, such as school or a family. However, there is a pervasive, overwhelmingly negative culture permeating the entire organization. The corporate attempts at a warm and positive culture are so transparent and fake that they have the opposite effect. The pay was terrible for the work done. Management seemed to bully or treat associates badly as if it were to ""get back"" at the company for how they were treated prior to becoming management. Its also very discouraging to lose an inventory management position to an automated computer based system that worked very poorly."
bad,To be honest walmart is a lot more talk action. Each of the 7 years there got work worse. No holiday pay and pay raises were small. Not agood team of managers
bad,Management send a lot of time sitting in the office eating and talking and do not do much to help you. When you do speak to them it usually feels like you are interrupting something or they are telling you that you are not doing something right - usually because you were not given the proper training and things change so often its hard to keep up.
bad,"I did my best and was torn down a lot."
bad,"The job is not hard at all, it's just the way you be getting treated the reason I want to leave after 10 years. I want to find something that will let me spend more time with my children."
bad,Even hired as part time they schedule you 40 hours at part time wages.You're expected to work every weekend and holiday without holiday pay
bad,"In my personal experience, I have had the pleasure of having a wonderful team to work with and awesome managers. But since then, management has changed and store policies are making it difficult for anyone employed there to have a permanent job. I have had the pleasure of helping customers and enjoy when I help disgruntled customers leave satisfied with a smile. I take my time to listen to the customer complaints and offer suggestions that helped the store and the customer get what they want out of their experience. I have also went out of my way to learn different departments and make myself versatile if there was a shortage in a department. Learning was always my thing, and teaching was what I gifted to my other coworkers."
bad,"After working at WalMart for five years you are considered a ""lifer"" and your odds of finding gainful employment anywhere else diminishes greatly. Don't expect to ever get full-time hours as that is considered a promotion within Wal Mart. Wages increased, but raises have been reduced to compensate. Sneaky, evil, WalMart."
bad,Had to unload 1-2 trucks a day and sort them out onto pallets then stock them or place them in our back inventory. Learned how to use a Gemini (Scanner). Management was abusive and terrible. work place culture was mixed. Hardest part was dealing with management. Nothing enjoyable.
bad,"A typical day involved sending money, money orders, cashing checks, returning merchandise as per Walmart policy. Customers would either get cash, store credit, or money returned to their respective credit cards."
bad,"Not a lot of accountability among associates or lower level management. Seemed like a lot of ""redoing"" jobs. Mixed messages abound. Inconsistent goals and directions. It's a paycheck though."
bad,I feel there is favoritism within the department.  Not a friendly atmosphere.  It doesn't seem like management is taking care of issues or concerns from associates within the department.
bad,"not every person follows procedure, those who do get chastised. Some understand that quality is key but pricing gets mixed up and the cashiers take the brunt of it and we get called names because of it."
bad,"While Walmart has made strides to improve their PR, the compensation is still lacking as is the respect they show their associates. For years I could at least count on a minimum of 38 hours a week as a full time associate. Now, however, that appears to going away as well. There are quite a lot of advancement opportunities, if you are interested, however, advancement seems to hinge more on a persons attendance and their ability to get close to management rather than hard work."
bad,a typical day at Walmart  consist of me aiding and helping customers with there individual needs weather its answering questions about certain product or helping the elderly customers lift heavy items to there car after purchase. the most enjoyable part of the job was I got a lot of hours working there.i would page for help and the managers would arrive hours later.i had to switch my schedule to part time after a while because I was going back to school and it was difficult for the managers to approve my request I had sent in weeks in advance.
bad,the store manager was not to be trusted!! Had an open door with her and all management seemed to know I was the one to say  these things. Names are left out of the open door conversations and she used my name with other management associates !!!!
bad,"If you work under the right management, it's a decent job that pays good for what you do. However, poor management results in a very poor work culture and drains you quickly. Decent job for high schoolers or beginning college students."
bad,"Can and will discuss this in further detail with future prospective employer. I worked there 14 years. and witnessed the changing of a giant company, to a company in which store closings and employee layoffs were predictable. Lack of training will never achieve success or maintain it. Especially when it's at all levels."
bad,"Everyday a csm tells you what to do. It can be anything. Your job to be a cashier but you will also be randomly required to greet customers, clean counters, clean windows, carry boxes, take out trash, and organize shelves."
bad,Not a very good place to work. My options are limited. Not very good with working around my availability. The management is not so helpful. I enjoy my co workers but the only issue is the management and the lack of providing me with my options.
bad,Walmart has there favorites. They are not organized but i still go in every day with a positive attitude and get my work done as fast as i can and as efficient as i can.
bad,"I had a main section of the store that was my special job. If they needed me to work in the Customer Service Department, or in Cashiering, or pushing carts, then I was assigned to those duties until not needed anymore. At a regular store(like a Superstore, not a Neighborhood Market) it feels so difficult to successfully accomplish your job with excellence from Management, Customer, and your own personal perspectives. This is a good job for those who like fast paced, confusing, and difficult environments. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with nice people and truly feeling at I was successful at serving people well despite any problems or challenges."
bad,I appreciate the opportunity that was given for working with the company of Wal-Mart.  I was hired to the company in mid 2013 and enjoyed the working environment but some of the management are a bit difficult to work with.
bad,"Keeps you busy from when you start your shift. Doesn't work with you the best when needing to only work certain hours for school or other job. If you do, you start to lose hours at times. Expects things to get going and done in a hurry with little time. They don't realize at times others in the same position before you left a messed and messed up the process. You have to fix things before you can do it taking more time to get things done which they don't like, but don't do much of anything about. Lack of fixing schedules and not explaining things when needed. Barely any to no training for the position."
bad,"my time with Walmart was a nightmare.  they never gave you breaks on time, management didn't listen, the supervisors didn't care, schedules were erratic, lunches were always late.  the discount for employees was hardly worth the trouble."
bad,Management is not receptive to my needs to advance. I am often given work that does not challenge me. Not willing to train me in other areas or allow me to learn new things.
bad,Walmart has traveled far and then down a drain. Management does not care for their employees. the employees are underpaid and over worked. Micro management is nothing to them.
bad,"Will not work there again, even if only employer in world.Their management is so hands off no one cares. They have departments but why as they move people at will."
bad,"Advancement opportunities, great at developing skills, great place to learn a skill and grow your resume, or grow with the company."
bad,"under staffed "
bad,"Wal-Mart is not the company they were or claim to be. They don't care about the associates or the customers. It has become all about profit for them. While you might work for a good supervisor or manager, it won't be for long."
bad,"Schedule was all over the place.  Worked with some that didn't want to work, nor had the willingness to try to do what it took to make the customer happy."
bad,"The job overall is quite average I would say. The work is manageable and anyone can do it. You can only work with so much feedback until you're not sure what you should do that is actually better than what you were originally doing when on the job. Either way the management team is never satisfied, and basically the way they talk to you they make it sound like they want to fire you, yet they don't.. It's not that I can't do the work, it's that the people who overlook our work don't seem to actually understand what it's like to do the work. We all are only human at the end of the day, not robots."
bad,"Worked for both Walmart and Sam's Club. At Walmart, you almost never see your actual salaried manager, only your direct supervisors, which I didn't mind. At Sam's, there is way too much interaction with your salaried manager. Too much pressure to sell credit cards and upgrades with a manager that only wants to stand there and tell you what to do instead of help out. All the while, you are making little to no money."
bad,The work overnight was good at the beginning but some managers expect more  and more every day without knowing that you could can not handle all by yourself
bad,"When I began at Walmart I loved my job. As the years went and upper management changed, everything changed.  There was no work/life balance. The responsibilities that were given to one person was impossible to complete in one day. The company took away floor associates so there were less people to help customers, which in turn caused more customer complaints."
bad,There production numbers they expect you to make are ridiculous. They have no understanding or learning curve after you first thirty days. They might keep people if they weren't write up happy every week and people work together
bad,"I learned how to do all different sales for all 6 major carriers. "
bad,The managers don't want to do their job but yells at you for working slower than they want you to. All the employees treat you like you're nothing. The pay is not worth it. You have to wait a year before you can get health insurance
bad,Very races and judging... They don't care about what you are going throw in life ..... No respect for the workers and the managers will laugh and talk about you
bad,"Walmart is a bad place to work the co-workers overall are good, but the managers need more training  and don't know how to do their jobs properly. they definitely have their favorite employees, and have no problem showing it. overall I do not recommend working at Walmart in horseheads ny"
bad,"The management did not do their job, they would stand around and do nothing, and they would disappear when it got bust. The people who worked alongside me were hard workers and I feel they had to cover for their lack in management."
bad,"First of all the job requires you to do the job of 2-3 people with very little pay to show for it and always have the feeling that you are expendable. If you are going to work at a grocery store, look elsewhere where they actually value their employees."
bad,"Retail is not easy, especially at Wal-Mart. If you have a good store, things are good but if a new manager comes in it causes panic among the employees. Work life balance is terrible."
bad,It was ok working there but it was not a full time position.. There were no benefits for me while I was employed there. My co-workers were great and never had a problems with each other
bad,"Only a decent place to work if you are going through school. If I would have taken full-time, it would have made no difference in pay. The management and many other protocol are highly skewed. I do not have all bad things to say about this company, I did learn a lot of skills. I worked in many departments and worked well with people. "
bad,"I worked in the bakery and overall it was nice working in there and loved my department manager. However, I got sick while at work and had to be helped out the door by coworkers and they still pointed me for that day several others afterward. I lost my job there because I got sick and couldn't work. They have no sympathy."
bad,Not a family enviroment but all in all was a good place to work for. They could have been more compassionate in the work enviroment.
bad,"The Company has taken to promoting from outside, and when that doesn't work they fire and rehire from outside.  In the last two years 23 managers have left the company or transferred out of this area, work has suffered because of this and upper level management loudly and publicly blames hourly associates."
bad,This was a good job but the benefits was not worth it. A great place to meet people. The work was not hard but it could be at times. If the chance is available I would work there again.
bad,Basically work like a dog. not much off time or free time. the managers didn't help you if you needed it or would have shown how to do your job easier except complain about it
bad,Walk in and run across the third shift associates that are not happy  because of the short staffing and not being appreciated because of the job expectations are still needed.  I go through the store looking at some direction on what needs to be done that day.  Walking through the whole store and acknowledging everyone as I walk to make sure that the associates know and try to understand that I do appreciate their hard work.  I need to have a plan together because at 8 am the other assistant managers come in and then we can go over the daily direction so they know about the expectations for the day.
bad,some days good. favoritism is a big part of that facility. a lot of the co-workers knew what to do and a lot of them had no clue or did not care. days off would be a good thing about that job.
bad,"I come into work but cannot do my job because the person that worked the shift before mine did not come in, so their job was not done. Therefore I have to do their job before I can do mine. I have learned at Wal-Mart that you have to document everything. If you do not have proof they will not admit that it is true. I really enjoyed working with my co-workers. They were like family. The hardest part of the job was trying to do my job without the  necessary resources to do it. The most enjoyable part of the job was when we were able to pull together and get a difficult task done."
bad,"A flying ccircus of keystone cops, unable to see what really goes on for their heads so far up their colon.  Couldn't find their way out of a paper bag if glass belly buttons were installed.  Pathetic display of ""team"" players, which should begin with the ""top""."
bad,"Very fast paced.... Somedays, very loud and hectic. "
bad,Never enough employees on to cover the customer volume. Claims to want to move you into hire positions but never does. Unfair treatment of their employees.
bad,I worked for the spring hill TN Walmart for 10 months and was sexually harassed by two guys and reported it twice and ended up having to contact corporate about it I also have severe anxiety and it wasn't taken seriously I ended up quitting due to a hostile work environment.
bad,"Strict and punishable policy's regarding working more than your allowed hours per week. I.E. if you are a cashier and there is need for more cashiers, if you work more than 32 hours average 3 weeks in a row, you risk termination."
bad,"I was pregnant so they really didn't let me do the position I got hired for."
bad,They have no respect for their associates or any hourly member for that matter. Unless you're a member of management they truly could care less about you or your concerns and its very immature almost feels like being back in high school with clique and gossip and drama.
bad,"Walmart is a very demanding job for very low pay, I wanted to work there because I wanted to experience retail...I found that I did not like It as much as i thought I would."
bad,"Wal-mart is known to be quite the no good company so my review is no surprise, no good management, no good pay, but also good pay if you are just starting out, job culture is not good, after 5 or 6 months your odds of being laid off are increased exponentially they may call you in and schedule hours that are inconvenient for those trying to balance work and personal lives."
bad,Job needs to pay more... Management are not knowledgeable. Drama from morning to night shift. The company no longer offers holiday pay. They slave the good workers. Departments are always understaffed.
bad,Managers will only promote you as long as you go along with the way they want things done. The minute you steer away from their desired path you are nothing to them and they will do what they can to hinder your advancement in their company.
bad,You are not treat like a person at walmart you are just a badge number. If u cant get production there you will be fired.  No matter how long you been employed there.
bad,"Come in and relief 2nd shift or start on 3rd shift duties such as cleaning under all the registers, picking up items that are out of place around the store and near registers, begin to sort items to they can be claimed out or put back on sales floor. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing my co workers and regular customers that would chat while I was doing their transaction. Management switched every few months some were very bad at organizing workers and tasks as well as getting onto workers who were not doing their job. My hardest part of my job was picking up the slack of co workers who refused to do their part, they would vanish and hide in the store or go out and sleep in their cars. It was a job that I had enjoyed overall minus feeling that my hard work, being a team player and shaving off my over time were not appreciated."
bad,"To start, I learned my job, but with little help. Managers don't know how to be managers, and last they don't care about you or your family! "
bad,"overworked understaffed"
bad,Incompetent management and devastating morale issues for most of the staff. Many employees quit within six months from starting.
bad,these people are only out for what helps or benefits them. they say you are like family but treat you poorly. they have no common respect if you are hurt or a family member including your child is sick
bad,Walmart managers don't seem to care at all about the physical well being of there staff. I find problems with the store on a daily basis and when brought to the attention of those incharge they shrug it off and ignore or cover up problems but rarely fix them.
bad,"From the three months that I had been employed with Walmart I had noticed several problems. Not only was I not properly trained, in less than a week I was already put out on the floor. Only completing online training, certain modules only teach you the basics. We were never taught in depth, we learned from ourselves and other employees who also had no idea if what they were doing was correct or not. "
bad,"Unfortunately, Walmart seems to be a very political environment to work in. However, I have met some of the greatest people there. It's very difficult to advance with this company, but it's something to pay the bills until you find something better."
bad,"An average day in Walmart Stores, Farmingdale for an associate is not scheduled as the associate is subject to multiple and often conflicting chains of authorities. Line responsibilities are most often executed from the Co-manager's level to the department manager on the associate, hence creating atmosphere of confusion for the associate, who often finds it difficult to reconcile responsibility."
bad,It is hard to advance to any type of management position was the main thing I felt was wrong for the most part. I enjoyed the people I worked with and I enjoyed most of what I did.
bad,"Too much ordered, Too much to throw, too much to bin. Everyone was miserable from management and people not knowing what to do. Something was wrong and it was always the employees fault"
bad,"While Walmart is a great place to start working in the work arena learning responsibility and in customer service skills, i find that there is not many positions to work up to as i have been here for 8+ years working part time only because that's how they structure there hourly paid employees."
bad,"Bad experience didnt like the people and not alot of friendly people. "
bad,I was able to make it through school working at wal mart and I am appreciative. I enjoyed working with people and helping customers on a daily basis.
bad,"Start with PT job offers and pay basic salary only..Working environment is very good.People are very friendly."
bad,The supervisors acted like you were always wrong. If you went to them with a problem they didn't care to help fix it. I worked third shift and I hated it. A typical day consisted of first picking the product for the floor team. Then while you're waiting you reorganize the stock which is no problem but if someone messes something up on first shift and they do not know who it was they assume it was third shift and write you up.
bad,I felt insignificant and very replaceable. I didn't know I was appreciated until I had put in my 2 week notice. They didn't expect me to come in the entire last week.
bad,"mistreatment of employees, "
bad,Good people work there but walmarts all about its profits and how to make more. they expect to much from one person to do in a week done in a day and get made when you fail
bad,"maintaining the sales floor, I learned what not to do as a manager and how not to treat them. certain managers are good at their job and others are not. the hardest part of the job is dealing with management. What I enjoyed most about working for Wal-Mart is the associates i gave instruction to and worked alongside."
bad,"Overworked and understaffed, workers constantly getting yelled at...even in front of customers. Not a good place to work for if you care about customer service."
bad,Management duties are largely delegated to part time hourly associates with the expectation that they accomplish organizational tasks best suited for salaried employees with management training. Very little transparency. Overbearing electronic training requirements. Individual associates given arbitrary individual responsibilities with no accountability. Impenetrable scheduling.
bad,"management and company was very poor, was very hard to deal with the management staff and there were so many of the management staff in different shifts that the right hand did not know what the left one was doing"
bad,There was a lot of bending which wasn't a good idea at 7 months pregnant. didn't really learn anything I didn't already know it was prity much basic things. co workers were ok. Management was ok.
bad,"I was required to multi-task everyday. While I had my own duties and expectations, I also assisted other associates with the completion of their tasks."
bad,"Not a good place to work. Occurrence layout isn't fair for early morning workers. Brakes and lunches are fair. Benefits aren't to costly initially, if your a smoker have fun with that bill."
bad,"I very much enjoyed matching a customer with the product that best fits their needs. "
bad,"Dealing with the customers can be rewarding but the biggest downfall of a Walmart store is the management. Some are fantastic, wonderful people and others are awful. I have seen stores keep nearly 70% of their original employees at opening and then that manager leave and within 6 months only have 20% left. Some management bullies and threatens employees. Tons of favoritism goes on and lots of false promises."
bad,"Your expectations are correct. Walmart can be terrible, but it really depends on the staff you're assigned to. Luckly, the SC mod squad is usually easy to get along with."
bad,"Liked working there until they started the PTO stuff,store manager was unfriendly, pharmacy manager overworked  and followed policy instead of thinning about his employee's, didn't care iif employees having problems like vehicle or family stuff going on.loved the co workers worked as a team and looked out for one another, fast paced busy environment"
bad,"The work was routine, and tasks typically continuous throughout the day. I found that while positions of management were highly organised, there seemed to be an overall lack of accountability and communication between various levels of management and the associates. Frequently, managers of different levels would give conflicting directions."
bad,"Hardest part of the job was trying to please all levels of management no matter how hard you tried to follow their ever changing directives.  There was no support from management."
bad,"I worked for Walmart for 5 months and couldn't take it any longer. Management doesn't do anything but expects you to do everything. they're always understaffed and play favorites. As long as you are cool with a manager you can get away with doing nothing. I watched a coworker assault another employee, unprovoked, start several other altercations, amd was reported by a customer and still works there. I've also seen an older hard working employee get fired for ""wasting company time"" by having a conversation with another employee while working, mind you the other employee did not get fired. There are way too many managers who don't know what they're doing. The benefits, which don't kick it until after 3 months of employment are just 10% off but only on certain things. Your get an extra one time discount on black Friday but I couldn't stay any longer to recieve it. There are many hard workers there but they aren't the ones rewarded, rather the employees thay kiss the managers butts and do nothing get employee of the nonth. I would not recommend this job unless you're a cashier, or working in the back. The best part about this job was when I got called up to the registers and interacted with the customers."
bad,Pizzas management wasn't the best management they would often just leave the cook in the kitchen by his or her self. The Hardest Part of the job was doing every thing by myself in the kitchen when it was busy sometimes the managers would just be up front talking to the servers and sometimes the other cooks.
bad,"Walmart treats their employees poorly. Despite working 40+ hours a week, they refused to list me as full time, thus keeping me from gaining proper benefits. When I started school, they did not want to work with my class schedule until I was forced to threaten legal action. Worked there for over a year, yet I never felt like I had any job security. Management was overworked and under experienced."
bad,Management was unreliable. Managers would not cooperate or help associates with customer related situations until guest has already left or yelled to the associate. Schedule changes and availability never matched with coworkers to swap out for breaks or lunches. Asset protection coworkers were without a supervisor for months.
bad,When i worked for Wal-Mart it was a good experience in the beginning of my employment towards the end not so much. The store was chaotic employees not following the break rules taking break longer than was suppose to. Customer service managers talk to employees how they want when they want to being disrespectful. I ended up quitting because I was threatened didn't really like working here.
bad,The coworkers were great people to work with. The job itself was great and self-fulfilling. The management on the other hand are something else entirely. They say one thing do something else completely different and are very uptight people.
bad,The main reason i stope working with walmart is am not fulltime worker and no any benefit like insurance.and the management the suppervisors are not serious with they jobs
bad,"Working a day at Walmart would contain of numerous of jobs for me. Handling cash and checks mainly of the day at money center. Helping customers pay their bills and cashing money orders. I learned a lot of things working at the money center, such as dealing with some customer that is trying to commit fraud with checks and money. With Management, it was hard to reach out and express opinions such as how to make the company more secured and how to grow.  The hardest part with working at a company such as Walmart would be the management, since I really wanted to grow within the company and there was no one willingly to help."
bad,"A typical day is answering the phones, and giving customer services daily. I really have not learned much at the position I am in. Management has no communication with one another as well as the employee. Co workers some can communicate and others cannot meaning by speaking English.The hardest thing about my job is nothing really; except when the phone is ringing, management is speaking to you on the walkey, and customers at the same time want to be serviced The most enjoyable thing is I interact with customers.."
bad,"wqlmart was certainly not my favorite  company. The bosses were rude, good workers, But bad staff . All in all of was a job I needed at the time and it paid my bills"
bad,"1.Sometimes we have to Unload Truck"
bad,"It was overall an alright place to work with flexible hours, but the management team lacked care for associates. It was a good workplace except the management team didn't show a lot of appreciation for the hard working associates."
bad,"typical day at work is very hard and very busy, I have learned that working in the deli department, there are a lot of good people out in the world. the management team I have learned that they are there for only for themselves, so that they can get the higher benifits that is offered to them. some co-workers like to keep drama going. the hardest part of my job in the stress."
bad,My experience at walmart had its pros and cons. Overall the staff was a delight to work with . Management on the other hand was out of wack. Poor customer service to customers and employees. Upon the years of me working there I tried to change that. But There's no I in team.
bad,Piedmont walmart is not the best place to work. Everyone talks horribly about each other and plays sides. Manager's play favorites and if you not a favorite they treat you badly. You will never move up in the company at that walmart. People are very hateful there. It has been one of the most stressful jobs I have ever had just because of the new management team they have there.  I'm glad to be out of that place.
bad,Customers are so crude and very pushy. So i just take care of customer's material and tell them how much needs to be paid. Nothing big in this place..
bad,"If it is a Walmart within Arkansas, especially near Bentonville where their headquarters is located, the Walmart's are great."
bad,"Like many other places, always shorthanded, poor management  at this location, poor scheduling. Coworkers are great. Customers are generally great too.  Management hasn't got a clue, and the few that do, leave."
bad,Walmart is a very good company to work for. I'm looking for a company that's more in a medical setting all around that's my dream. With more income for my family.
bad,"Walmart isnt a place, i would work at for too long because they are very unorganized, management is poor, they play favoritism, and they have this wierd thing to where if you're a good worker then they will have you do everyone else work. They did that too me alot. It wouldn't been as bad if they offered a compensation like extra pay or get a half day."
bad,A empresa  em si e boa porém algumas pessoas que estragam a empresa
bad,"Walmart is not a fun company to work for. Management wasn't the best. The job was not good. Long hours, constantly being asked to work overtime then getting overtime pay cut. Just no."
bad,"They expect you to get all of your job duties done while telling you that your job duties are irrelevant compared to other tasks. They do not speak to you with respect, unless you brown nose you can expect to stay rather stagnant in your position."
bad,"Be prepared to mistreated, deal with angry people, and have higher up's who will treat you like trash . It was the worst experience I ever had working for a company."
bad,They refused to comply with my school schedule and the employees were very unprofessional as were the managers. They were very inconsiderate of our outside lives. There was always conflict between employees and managers. They never kept it professional and business related between one another. There was a lot of work to be done but low salaries.
bad,"a typical day 8 hrs, what you learnd changing tires, working with customers, poor management, i like working with co workers, the job was easy."
bad,"Walmart, though being a great provider for public consumerism, had poor management (at least mine) and very inflexible hours. Along with poor organization of both stock and work duties."
bad,"I consistently and accurately performed my job on a daily basis. I performed all other jobs the manager requested of me to the best of my ability. The manager seemed to feel I was not doing my best and after a couple of conversations I felt it best to look for a position with a company that better respected my integrity and my word.  I work hard and always do my best, I just want to be respected at work."
bad,"A typical day at work for Wal-Mart, was spending my time focusing on customers while getting them in and out of the store as quickly and accurately as possible. When no customers we were to stock shelves, spend time pushing candies forward and getting items that didn't belong off the shelves, and checking for expired products."
bad,This is a great company to work for if you are just looking for a temporary job to help pay the bills or to get through school. There are plenty of options to move up within the company but the work load is ridiculous. The managers do not follow proper guidelines on FLSA and do not adhere to proper FLSA-Overtime guidelines. Was asked multiple times to stay and work late the last five minutes of my shift then told I was not allowed to go home until the job was done but I was also not allowed overtime. Was constantly being forced to stay and work 14-18 hour shifts but then told to leave early the next day to cut overtime before time would go in. You would also be coached in the office for productivity even when the managers admitted that you were 6-8 people short staffed in the department. Managers constantly made inappropriate jokes while on the clock and premise. There is a lot more about Wal-Mart that makes my blood boil. I only gave a second star because there were 3 managers that made my time with the company bearable.
bad,"Scheduling was pretty flexible. There was no room for advancing. I got trained and was told to do 4 different positions, some of which had a higher pay grade than I was receiving yet I did not receive it. Co-workers were easy to get along with and I often became great friends with them."
bad,"Typical day at work was tiring, I was on my feet all night. I did learn how to stock merchandise by using inventory data sheet. As far a management, I didn't like the way spoke to the staff. While I was there I did make some new associates that I keep in touch with. The job wasn't difficult however I wouldn't want to work for Walmart again."
bad,"A typical day started off with finding a manager to find out what to do for the day. Usually I got ""Just start on this until I find something else for you to do"". It wasn't always like this. They expected me to automatically know what to do on a daily basis, but they keep pulling me away from it or starting me on something else completely and ignoring it. I also got written up for it, twice. The hardest part about this job is trying to understand management (and keep your sanity). They run based off what they're told, and they tell us what needs done, then forget that they told us and punishes us for doing it instead of our ""daily routine"". Seems like management grew up as middle school bullies and just were itching to pick a fight with anyone who looked at them the wrong way."
bad,"""The customer is always right"" means the customer can cuss you out and throw fits and they always get what they want. Even though you're being blatantly demeaned, management couldn't care less."
bad,Walmart was my first job and it was completely terrible. From the employees to the management. I honestly felt like I was in jail. They'd walk around the store yelling at us asking if we wanted ours jobs......
bad,Very busy job I'am lucky if i get two breaks in any one shift.I find Management is not very knowledgeable  about labour law and work safe rules.
bad,Productive and a fun workplace that every one is comfortable to be in. the most enjoyable part of the job is to see a customer satisfied with the service.
bad,Did not like the environment surprised I stayed a whole year some upper management is very rude. Expect things to be done that they personally could never be able to do.
bad,"Avoid this company if you plan to accomplish anything in your life. The corporate structure is terrible and they do not care about employees. The pay is somewhat reasonable, but management is not anything to write home about."
bad,"I worked as a cashier, and I didn't mind the work, cleaning, stocking, running registers and customer service desk, the problem with working there was management. They could not possibly care less about associates, making the work ethic there non - existent. I felt unappreciated, over worked, and everyone was mistreated. The thing I miss about working there the most was the co workers. They all felt the same way, and I got along great with many of them."
bad,way too much negativity and quality remains overlooked. Please see most recent Walmart posting for more opinions.
bad,Good for a temporary Job to get on your feet then move on. very understaffed. low moral and unsatisfied customers. you must either sacrifice quality of service for basic store maintenance.
bad,"started as a full time job, at least i thought it was, they told me i was no longer needed after the thanksgiving / blackfriday rush turns out i was a temp. they did not make that clear when they gave me the job"
bad,If u work for Walmart make sure that you are good in health and have planned out well if u have kids....cause  they work is first there
bad,Walmart is cool to work at if you're on your last leg and can't find a job. other than that I think you should stay as far away as possible. My manager actually got me fired because i was absent from work due to hospitalization and he still counted it as an unexcused absence which marked against my record and lead to my termination. Walmart is evil.
bad,"Mantener estándares de llenado y surtido para venta al cliente, solicitando y recibiendo mercancía."
bad,Managment does not care about employees the only thing good about the job is some co-workers and the pay is decent Everything else is terrible
bad,"I left because of life/work/school balance issues. It was very difficult for management to give you a schedule to balance all of these things. I was never given part time as I asked for, and there were so many employees that they couldn't accommodate my schedule."
bad,"It is a good place to work and you can move up but they no longer care about employees families like they use to, they need to have more of an open door policu"
bad,"The employee's that do the actual work day in and day out are the business. The stores are managed all the same: employees are asked to work more then one department at a time, raises are once a year with a max of .50 cent, you can move up if you know the right people, when it comes to accountability, there isn't any when you    know the right people."
bad,"Zero respect from management, even when you go above and beyond what your superiors ask of you. When you complete something they ask you to do, they criticize something else about you, I have never gotten a sincere thank you from a direct superior, and I've worked there for a year."
bad,"Empresa grande y muy reconocida por su variedad de productos de toda índole, a nivel laboral con la gente contratada es muy malo el trato, no dan descanso suficiente,no proveen cambio. La educación de los supervisores y el trato a los empleados es baja."
bad,"Walmart sucks to work at as an employee. The only advantage to it is so long as you show up to work in the right uniform, on time, and able to work (not stoned or drunk) you will almost never lose one of these jobs because nobody wants to work for them."
bad,"Its a simple and easy job when you work with competent co-workers, management is blunt and direct, expectations are not high just outright ridiculous."
bad,"Not that great. not great pay, no benefits until after a year. The managers are so and you wait forever if you need them so therefore so does the customer. They are very strict about attendance so far that its ridiculous because they don't accept doctor notes. Never heard of that.If you want a life long career, go for it. They have advancement available. I don't plan on being there long."
bad,if you have family this is not the job for you. the have a poor policy for abscenses and do not care if your childrens are sick
bad,a typical day at work was eventful and sometimes fun. i learned how to stock a store. i also learned how to stack pallets and clean a warehouse. the hardest part of the job was being in the truck putting the merchandise on the line to be sent down.
bad,"working at wal-mart was not what I thought it would be,I did like working with customers  helping them find things they were looking for,and overall just doing my job."
bad,"I learned basic training from other associates while the managers basically threw me to the sharks, most associates are very nice but there is definite favoritism in the building without a doubt. The hardest part of the job was showing up every day without crying, managers treat people very poorly unless you suck up to them."
bad,"Working there for almost 10 years I learned a lot, how to work with customers, be a cashier, work on the inventory team, mod team, and stocker. Sadly the new employees now don't get trained in all areas"
bad,Managers are on a mega powertrip! don't know what they are doing most of the time. co-workers were great. write ups for no reason.
bad,"I worked there for almost two years on the overnight team. I made full-time within 6 months and was promised more training in the months to come to prep for becoming a support manager. Including electric skid mover training and training on the gun used to find items in the back. "
bad,"Not much to say. Walmart on its busiest days will test even the most patient of employees. With a constant barrage of complaining customers, an incompetent and disorganized management staff, and employees that call out every other day, this is a place you're going to want to avoid."
bad,la parte mas me gusto dela empresa el contacto directo hacia los clientes y poder atenderlos de la mejor manera  la parte mas difícil trabajar sin personal suficiente el ambiente entre colegas en bueno. la dirección y personal de gerencia con poco involucra miento del sentir de los empleados y de sus necesidades
bad,"A typical day at this position is very stressful. Management is not very helpful unless absolutely necessary. Most of the people who work here are constantly complaining about how they hate working for this company, therefore creating a negative work place."
bad,poor management. only 10% discount. have to wait 6 months before benefits or raise is kicked in. Unorganized staffing and always out of stock on several items.
bad,"Todo dia era um desafio;"
bad,"The hours were the exact opposite of ideal at the time. The management kept interrupting the work I was doing to tell my team and I to hurry up and get our work done by certain times that we could only achieve if we pushed beyond our limits. The job itself had the second highest turnover rate in the entire company. The pay was far less than desired when compared to Sam's Club (about half of what Sam's Club pays their inventory management associates/unloaders), and the team itself was a group of individuals who were disorganized and did not work well together."
bad,Wal-mart is a big company and always busy with customers. A typical day at work would be me stocking a aisle by myself and then do some extra work when I was finished.
bad,let go after 5 yrs job contracted out. management changes so often its hard to get a good rapore.co-workers are great. not a career job unless your management.
bad,"I don't say that title lightly. This place sucked. When management wasn't getting onto you to work faster when you were already working your hardest. They were pulling you from your job, to do another job because there wasn't enough help. Ill trained, I never got any formal training nor computer training until ""necessary"" or management got in trouble. The pay was subpar, which made for a negative atmosphere. We were worked as $20.00 an hour employees and got paid under $10.00 an hour."
bad,"Pretty miserable, but what can you expect from a mega corporation famous for its lousy treatment of employees?"
bad,The management wasn't good at all and the pay should be much better for all of the work that has to be done. Also a lot of people are noisy and messy.
bad,"operate cash register"
bad,what i learned about being at this job was not to let anything get to me to make me upset. The managers were the worst ever. They did not make the job environment enjoyable. It was kind of like being in  a jail cell
bad,"Management did not care about their associates, which resulted in a plethora of individuals quitting, relocating & drama created.Everytime the store received a review from a district manger it would be horrible. The store seemed as if it was falling apart. Although the management was beyond horrible, the customers would never know because the associates kept smiles on their faces and were always willing to help."
bad,Walmart may pay well but you are part of the machine and they will grind you.  They have cut all the benefits that used to make it a great place to be.  I would not recommend any long term commitment to them as they will not do the same for you
bad,"Ever want to work in a soul crushing environment where taking sick days is punishable and employees end up going to work throwing up or getting other employees sick? Then you've come to the right place."
bad,"It was an alright place to work for the summer, nothing I want to do long term. It wasn't a very fun job because I didn't want to work there in the first place"
bad,Did not enjoy. Never felt that I was valued. Poor Pay. Would not return for employment. Felt as if i was just a name tag. I will not be an employee
bad,"Daily duties varied being a maintenance(janitorial) associate, always cleaning however. Morale, at least from my perspective seemed very low. Personally would not recommend working for walmart. The company raised minimum wage, but for overnighters instead of getting a real pay raise the company cut overnight differential so as to not pay us more."
bad,"Eastport Plaza Walmart has a history of moving goalposts.  The qualities they look for from year to year change to whatever they need to so you don't get more than a minimal raise.  They don't pay attention to your work quality, and instead make assumptions based on talk around the water cooler."
bad,"the hours are good but that's it, no room to advance unless your friends with a manager. and the attendance system is ridiculous."
bad,"Has too many people who want you to do all the work, Physically strenuous, too much to do in a short period of time. No training at all, they just put you there & you figure it out."
bad,"Employee moral was quite low, but management would work with you as best they could to fit your schedule. Despite this, management is underhanded and petty, doing only what is company mandated to keep their jobs. Extensive training for beginners teaches almost nothing about what you actually do on-job and does not adequately inform their employees about the various policies involved with Wal-Mart employment."
bad,"management Does not care about Employees, Policies always changing, employees work hard because of other lazy employees."
bad,los  gerentes   en esa tienda  en perecederos   te tratan como objetos   te quieren  tener trabajando  y no te quieren pagar horas extras  a ellos  solo les importa  dar el numero  y no te ayudan ni te enseñan   ni te involucran  en trabajar en equipo  todo lo toman personal  no los capacitan  ni  les dan un trato para que hagan carrera   en la empresa    simplemente  si se acopla  o no  lo presionan  para  que renuncie  poniendo horarios  difíciles  y que renuncien   a mi no  me querían dar mis vacaciones   yo en un año  y medio no falte  no llegue tarde  y me trataban muy  mal    la gerencia   de ai   hablo   de  enero 1 del 2016 para atrás asta  marzo 2014  los gerentes  de area  si alias algo bien se lo colgaban ellos    como triunfo  y el puesto que te daban  jamas lo era   te  tratan  asiendo otras funciones  y si ya te avian asignado a un area   los problemas  que surgieron   te los  suman a ti sin importar que estuvieses   apoyando otro  departamento    el personal de recursos  humanos  les  pongo  5 estrellas  por que te tratan bien  te apoyan  pero  au  le temen  a las decisiones de la gerencia el líder  o jefe  de  panadería  te robaba  mercancía de producción para su departamento afectando al jefe  o lider
bad,"• Repetitive and mundane ."
bad,"Wal-Mart Stores, the second largest corporation in America in 2009, is a department store chain known for providing consumers with goods at extremely low prices. A member of the retail sales industry, the contributions of the Wal-Mart Stores political action committee to federal candidates and other political committees has grown rapidly during the past decade as new stores continue to be built across the country."
bad,"To much drama, management is not fare. Hours will pick up and then go down. You work full time and do not get any benefits. Other than that, the new raises are the bomb, but they half way  work with your school schedule."
bad,"I worked at Walmart on and off for 8 years. Times definitely have changed since I first started there. It's better than nothing, but I would look at other retail companies first."
bad,"Management was poor, understaffed, Pay was decent, horrible schedule balance. he hardest part of the job was being understaffed and dealing with managers about productivity because of it."
bad,My day at Wal-Mart would start busy and productive and I learned about how to take care of plants. Everybody I worked with was awesome. The only hardest time of job when we would get really busy and trying to cash the customer out and bag everything out. I like working with customers and talking with them while I'm working and hearing about there day.
bad,"Job required me to pull product from moving conveyer and load onto 3 to 4 trailers at a time, at times temp was over 120% in trailers. Had Heat exhaustion, almost heat stroke, was put in office for couple of hours and given Gatorade, Was finally sent home later with no medical attention. When I got home was very ill, parents came and got body temp down, and got nausea and weakness stopped. I went back to work at 5am next day. I never missed a day of work and was never late, others on my shift were constantly missing and running late, but they were not reprimanded. After 8 months of busiest time, and after wage compensation from Texas Workforce ran out, I was written up by Supervisor in another Dept. 3 times in less than a week. They said 3 write ups were cause for dismissal and fired me for safety. I proved thru workforce appeal that it was not a safety issue, They hired Me knowing I had a disability that prevented Me from working as fast as others and that is what they fired me for."
bad,"Walmart policies are constantly changing. The Customer Service Manager, my superior,  is not a ""people person"" and has a hard time communicating with the general public as well as myself. Most information is communicated second-hand to third shift."
bad,Having a job here can be so much fun if you have the right people around you. You learn a lot and it has so much opportunity to grow and provide a sustainable environment.
bad,"At the wal-mart I worked at, it typically started off as me doing work that the morning shift didn't complete. I finish that and started on the work assignment that I had to complete. "
bad,"Daily was running freight and helping customers. Management was uncaring, most co-workers were very nice to work with, the most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers."
bad,"While working at Walmart, I felt I was not being respected by my managers. They were extremely rude and did not seem to care about the well-being of their employees."
bad,"So I had a bad work experience with Walmart. I was pregnant, and I let my managers know but they were still super late on giving me my breaks. The customers were EXTREMELY rude, and so were the managers. My co workers were fine but a lot of them were very old."
bad,We just try to make the most of our day at Wal-Mart. We meet really nice people and we meet really nasty people. The management is horrible and the wages are atrocious.
bad,"I worked for Wal-Mart for over 2 years and made my way up the ladder from the bottom. I worked every holiday and every weekend for the 2 years I was there and felt my accomplishments were overlooked due to the unhealthy condition of the store. "
bad,"This particular store has a nasty reputation of firing you over the smallest thing, especially if you are not black. Also, if you get any ""write ups"" with the company it will stay on your record for a year and if you get another one before the one year is up it gets added to the new write up year. Also, it doesn't go away even if you quit and come back!"
bad,"Worst company I have worked for. They do not care about your back or legs they over work you to be under paid, No benefits , And mang work for who they want"
bad,"The company was a place that I loved to work,and I took pride in my job. Then processes and management began to change.There was no longer any respect for the associates as they imposed too much work with shorter time frames.Which leads us to this:"
bad,You are one of many working at Walmart. Your superiors may seem like they are listening but they do not put much effort into manifesting your words.
bad,"a typical day was drama and stress, I learned that everyone doesn't care what you think. The management does not care about their employees, i liked my co-workers they are easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job is dealing with supervisors who who talk to you crazy and cuss you out but say we are suppose to show by example."
bad,"Too much pressure put on the cashiers. "
bad,"opening register, greet customers, help them with their items they wish to purchase. receive payment for items purchased."
bad,"Things noted in public news media are true but also things not mentioned in public outlets are true.  Like education donations, food donations, high school GED programs for associates, etc.  However, the bad only counter balances the good, leaving a neutral position."
bad,Typical work day depends on the day of the week and what time of the month it is. It also depends on who is the manager on the day your working as well. The hardest part of the job is dealing with management and the heavy work load.
bad,I have learned how to use power equipment safely and efficiently. I also have learned how to communicate with other associates and customers in a meaningful way.
bad,"the staff at walmart were great, the management have no communication. too many people trying to run it different ways."
bad,Management team are young people with no experience. They will mistreat you to move up the ladder. Company policy are not favor at all!
bad,"Walmart Managers do not really seem to care about the employees or how much actually gets done in their store. Often employees would deliver little work or no work at all and the managers did not seem to notice. There were some good managers but most of them were physically and emotionally exhausted to the point where they quit.  "
bad,the people are ok just management think people are robots and they just don't care how you feel and that it can make you preform in a different way but I spent long enough there
bad,"A typical day at work is following directions and makeing sure everythings was in proper and to make sure everything ran smoothly. I learned Valuable work skill to help futher myself in the wooking career as to work a cash register and to make sure things get done in a calm and oderly fasion. The managment was nice and helped answer any questions I may have had that day. The co-workers were fun and pleasant to work with. The hardest part of the job may have to to deal with a unpleasent coustomer, I could handle them in a clam orderlly fasion. The most enjoyable part of the working experience was meeting new people every day."
bad,no one was friendly and the managers were mean and evil and disrespectful. the customers were always grouchy and mean. I didn't learn anything. coworkers were the best part. they were actually friendly.
bad,Not a good day at work. I haven't learn nothing there but cashier work. Management is bad they don't treat you right or congrats on your good work. My co-workers are good never had a issue with non of them. The hardest part is customer who don't care about our policy and when we explain they get mad and disrespect us.
bad,"During a typical day at walmart one might not feel as they are of much importance. If you are the type who needs to feel they are changing somebodies day in a positive way then walmart is not the place for you. Walmart's customers come to walmart to obtain the supplies they need, they do not often wish to have little to any interraction with you as an employee. To them- you are an employee, not a person."
bad,"Management didn't provide breaks during the middle of summer in the garden center which resulted in heat stroke. Loss Prevention employees often harassed me in a non-joking manner regarding a mild disability i have, several times with management standing beside them laughing. I made some life-long friends in other departments, and gained experience with multitasking in several departments."
bad,"Working at Walmart I loved my coworkers but management were scums, if you wasn't their favorite you will be getting horrible hours and attitude all day. The work schedule was a few day on and a day off, I never could balance life and work due to scheduling."
bad,"dont work there.the management sucks, the co-workers always talk about each other. the hard part about wal-mart is getting out on time. the most enjoyable part about working at wal-mart is getting paid."
bad,"My work place was filled with people who weren't friendly, and made it really uncomfortable to work their because of their person"
bad,They had the worst management team in the universe I was still training and they just threw me on the floor and never wanted to answer one single question for me.
bad,"A typical day at work consist of gathering shopping carts, and putting them in the proper place. My title was a courtesy associate.  Sometimes we assist customers in loading and unloading merchandise."
bad,A company that strives to be an Equal Opportunity organization needs better trained personnel and management that will not belittle those with disabilities and who would handle situations with employees with disabilities better than I witnessed. Disappointed in policies and management on how they handle sensitive issues with employees with disabilities.
bad,Went in and checked customers out and cleaned.This job was always on your feet and even if you were on break you had to help customers.
bad,management was horrible! i would never work here again.  they do not work with peoples schedules and are very rude and dismissive.  not a genuine helpful environment at all
bad,The employees are treated in decently. They cut the hours bad i would work for one week and wouldnt be schedualed for two weeks. the co workers lied and caused drama for others employees.
bad,"one of the worst employers I've ever worked for"
bad,"people aren't treated well at walmart. or fairly. they make you work past your shift, sometimes long into the morning hours when we should've gone home at 7:00Am. and then make you take that same length of a lunch the next night so they wouldn't have to pay the overtime."
bad,"The lack of communication between management and amount of favoritism going on in the particular store that I worked at was ridiculous. The only good thing that ever happened while I was there was the raise in their minimum pay, and it ended up being a bad thing because the corporation starting making budget cuts not long before I was terminated, which caused management to have to cut hundreds and hundreds of hours to reduce payroll, which then lead to management firing about 50 employees, me included, for any little thing (small infractions, attendance that had not mattered before, etc.). I did enjoyed working with most of the other employees. The worst part was trying to follow store policy, and then being undermined by a couple of certain managers and being made to look like an idiot in front of customers. I will never work at this store again, nor do I advise anyone else to apply."
bad,"co-workers were great, upper mgmt. was terrible.  Store was dirty, Cashier were timed as to scans per hour and had to reach a high goal.  Mgmt was not supportive of employees.  Roaches at the registers."
bad,"Bad scheduling, very understaffed especially during the holidays. Overall learned a lot of skills working a fast paced customers service environment."
bad,"It didn't seem like there were many people there with much experience, and even team leaders and managers were fairly new which led to disorder and complications. The inexperience of management also led to loss of productivity at times."
bad,"I was only able to work there for two months before I had to leave, the equipment was faulty and unsafe to use, management was notified several times of the faulty equipment, but no action was taken to fix the problem. The work load was that of a 3 man crew with only one man, hostile coworkers, ineffective management"
bad,a typical day would be to sit at the fitting room and direct inbound phone calls. I was trained in other departments as well and helped out when needed
bad,Walmart is a poor place to work it is hard to advance its management has no idea what they are doing one minute you do this the next minute it changes and they never make up their minds
bad,"Clock in Complete objective given that night"
bad,"I worked there for a year and a half and was turned down for an advancement in my own department repeatedly for being too young, nevermind me being the most qualified and the only person who wanted the job, I was too young, so they pulled people from furniture and the deli instead of promoting from that department."
bad,"you barley get any training and they are always rude. Your breaks and lunches are NEVER on time. Lord forbid you have to use the restroom, thats part of your break. Management is never around when you need them and they ALWAYS have an attitude"
bad,"I worked there for one year and for the first six months I was the only person working the store during the day. The assistant managers expected me to get the work of two or three maintenance associates or janitors done by myself. There was always fires to put out, the customers were rude, I never got any help when I asked for it and I was responsible for keeping the work associate's break room clean when they should have done it themselves. My pay was terrible and when I asked for a raise when the allotted time had passed for one, I never got it, I was still earning the same wage I started with by the time I quit. I did get time and a half on Sundays but that wasn't enough to compensate what I was earning per hour. In the end, the work I was given did keep me busy, but my supervisors didn't give me enough time to get finish which would have meant a better job done."
bad,"Our beginning management team was pretty good to work for and with, after the changes in management it became a dead-end job with a manger that did not care about the employees. I had good co-workers that for the most part was easy to work with."
bad,"Coworkers were nice and the job wasn't difficult, but management was falling apart and was very behind your back with your employment."
bad,"work was very good, I enjoyed coworkers and customers.  The biggest and worst issue with Walmart is management.  Walmart fires and hires more than any other company in America."
bad,"False promises, horrible management and staff, would never work there again or even consider recommending this company for anyone else."
bad,"Had some great co-workers and managers, but the overall work you're assigned and time given to complete can be impossible. A lot of times we were short handed by about 6 or 7 people, but e were still expected to get the same amount of work done. It's really what caused me to leave. It probably wouldn't have been so bad if we weren't short handed all the time, but it was a constant problem the whole time I was there. The hardest part of the job, was trying to get two or three aisles completed eight hours, when one aisle might take seven to finish. The best part would be, having finished or mostly completing all of the tasks you were assigned, and getting some acknowledgment from management about the job you did."
bad,"Loved my co-workers. Not a pleasant work place. Very stressful workplace, Management team is very unprofessional. The hardest part of my job for Walmart is not being able to finish my job before I was needed to finish or start someone else's and being reprimanded for not finishing my job. Enjoyed my customers got to build a good and long lasting friendship with a lot of people"
bad,"Process Phone Contracts, develop film, issue fishing licenses, give product functionality and life expectancy, inventory and restock."
bad,My lunch from the brake room would get stolen all the time.I would not all ways get my 15 min. brake.the manager's and supervisor did not get a long.the one thing i did like i was nerve bored at work.
bad,It pays the bills barely. Management lacks in reality.  WAY TO MANY bosses shouting commands   They give you unrealistic times to get things done and then you have the ones that have never even worked in an area take and tell you its more then enough time
bad,Management sucks and they dont care about anything that happens to the employees unless they get hurt on the job. Only apply if you are desperate for a job.
bad,I just didn't like how Wal-Mart said they was a family company but they didn't care about the employees and family. No communication at all
bad,"A empresa(Walmart) é bom de se trabalhar, mas, os que comandam parece que não sabem usar a cabeça, não tem jogo de cintura."
bad,The management was the worst. Mean unforgiving people. My direct supervisor was great though.terrible pay and hours not a lot of chances for advancement
bad,"Hard place to work, with the recent changes being made, as the company struggles in the face of competition. Stores have very little leeway to run their stores as it fits in with their community. Very heavy handed control from H.O. No job secureity."
bad,"Working at Wal-mart was an alright experience. It was clean and easy once I got the hang of it. It isn't a great job for a young person I felt though. After about 3 months, I hated the job. There is never any real change of pace, nor is there ever anything to make one day distinguishable from the other."
bad,it was a pretty horrible place to work overall not so much fun. it can be annoying as your co workers move into management because they let anyone be a manger.
bad,"Walmart is one of those places that only works for two kinds of people, the type who have no desire to do anything besides show up, do minimal work and go home, barely scraping by the system, and those who want to be career Walmart employees and work their way towards a store manager position. If you're the latter, then fine, I'm sure it is a decent employer with close to adequate compensation. However, for those who need a job to further their skills while working towards an entirely different career path, this job is a nightmare. You will be disrespected ,disregarded and otherwise mistreated. You will feel like a modern slave. The pay is mediocre, the benefits for part-time employees are virtually nonexistent and don't you dare take a vacation at any normal, decent time of the year. Which means you won't get one if you're a student, as they will expect you to work every school holiday."
bad,"Management did minimum for employees i felt unappreciated , the way they schedule you was ridiculous there's no way to manage life and work"
bad,In All Walmart isn't bad but my experience their with the management and workers was horrible. Child like workmanship and lack of caring.
bad,"Well I started out moving to the area and immediately got a job with my local Walmart. Everything was fine and I was told I would be stocking lawn and garden overnight. I was trained in lawn and garden for a week, then I came in for my first real overnight shift and was told overnight lawn and garden doesn't exist. Well that was ok with me. I was constantly moved around the store which was weird to other employees that I didn't have a home isle to stock every night. I was ok with that as well. Then I was moved to the mod team with no explanation why and I trained there for a week (which I didn't get paid their salary as well) and was taken off for no reason. Then I was moved to putting things up in the steel and taken off again for no reason at all. All of this is somewhat annoying to me, but I can manage with it."
bad,"Cart pusher. rain or shine gathering carts, which wasn't to bad because I like the outdoors. Co-workers and management were not very polite ,"
bad,the people for the most part are friendly and work within the policies. Its a fast pace to work. You will learn a lot but you needed to follow up with the managers to make sure that the trainer is training you right.
bad,"Un-productive work place, plenty of drama and disorganization."
bad,Customer communications and cashiering. Enjoyed helping people and communication with them. Enjoyed co-workers. Hard physical work beyond capabilities.
bad,"I was on time every shift and worked very hard, but it never seemed like it was enough for the management!!!  Too much drama and not being appreciated for hard work and doing extra tasks."
bad,"Working there varied day to day, Some customers were hard to please where others nice as long as the cakes were done like they asked. The job was exciting to learn"
bad,No matter how well you do you are still told how bad of a job you have done for the night by members of management and are always expected to do more even after giving 110%.
bad,"Most managers do not know their jobs and only do enough to get by. The standards have fallen considerably over the years. It is frustrating that newer associates were given substantial raises, long term loyal associates were not, and now the hours of all are being cut. Depending on the manager, your job can be fulfilling but if your manager is not properly trained, it can be a disaster."
bad,I did not like working there because the managers would always tell everyone they aren't working hard enough or pressure us and stress us out. Also the managers were NEVER a team. they would constantly disagree with each other about everything and when one manager tells you to go to aisle 6 you will have another manager come to you and tell you to go somewhere else and then they will argue with each other over that...Over all just a bad place to work. Very unprofessional people there.
bad,"I learned how to help customers dealing with cell phone setups and contracts.  I didn't get to stay long however as I was seemingly let go without any warning, write ups or talk to just as my probation was about to end."
bad,Not so great if you do not like working retail. Management was decent though.  Jobs available around the clock to accommodate all different schedules.  Depending on the department you work in the customers can be horrible.
bad,"The job itself wasn't bad. It was a manageable workload. But in my opinion there is WAY too much management in that store. 5 different managers would tell you 5 different things to do and because of being short staffed you were also expected to cover the unfilled jobs. It was complete and total chaos most of the time and I would not, for any amount of money, EVER go back. And there were a couple of the assistant managers who were VERY unprofessional and it was very much inappropriate."
bad,"At the location I worked, management did not communicate well with each other let alone employees. They had far higher expectations than were possible to accomplish by 90% of employees."
bad,"Walmart is a great employer, however it can become stressful if your trying to balance school and other responsibilities. I will say if you work hard and make sure have good attendance you won't have to worry about job stability. I enjoyed working for Walmart, however the hardest par for me is they got rigid when I'd ask for time off to go visit my family. Although I only requested 3 days every month..."
bad,"Walmart might be a multi-billionaire company, but the hrly wage paid to employees and well under paid for the amount of work they put in for part-time and full-time schedules. Not to mention management does some under the table stuff for employees who work seasonal. They hire and fire people without truly giving a career based opportunity to their workers. I would't dare recommend this job to anyone who has morals."
bad,Management is a mess. Coworkers are usually great. Employee turnover is always high-pretty telling for a corporate company.
bad,"I start the day with many different tasks for many managers, while i provide fast, friendly, good customer service. I learned how to manage my time to get thinks done while cashiering and assist customers with what they need. the management members are a little unorganized there's a lack of communication which make the job harder, but by me using logic sense, I got to manage important things getting done, the first priority is customers satisfaction and good shopping experiences, then of course there safety and the fellow associate safety, plus the team work. the hardest part of the job is not having the equipment to get the job done but it doesn't stop me from getting my job done perfectly. the most enjoyable part is putting a smile on a customer and hoping that will make their day go better."
bad,"start earlier then most, leave at the same time or later then most."
bad,a typical day at work consisted of getting organized and making sure job is done correctly. the hardest part of the job was getting all work done around holiday seasons when the workload was heavy
bad,"The scheduling works great around your classes, but the pay is low and the hours are usually very short. Sometimes I would come in to work only for a 4 hour shift."
bad,A typical day was spent putting out stock helping customers and doing what ever task management deemed necessary.  I learned patience in dealing with the public and helping customers. Management was lazy and degrading towards associates. Co-workers were great but beaten down. The hardest part was dealing with upset customers and lazy management. The most enjoyable part of the job were my co-workers
bad,my experience here was very interesting.  learned how to put a new store together for opening.  I learn a lot about electronics being that was the department I was assigned. I had no clue about the difference in tvs
bad,"At first when I started at Wal-Mart I was somewhat excited. But that changed very quickly, Management is rude. I've had customers ask me if Management talks to everyone the way they do. AND THEY DO. The hours they give you are ridiculous and jump all around one day you might work at 530 Am and the next day you have to be their at 530 PM. And they don't want to work with anyone's schedule. 4 or 5 people have quit since I started, do to poor treatment or just down right not enjoying there job. However, I've noticed a lot of advancement among management. The most enjoyable part of my work day is talking to fellow associates."
bad,I felt like working at Walmart was a modern day slave plantation. They expected you to pick up other people slack do your work load and still help in other areas . They are unappreiative of what you can do the pay is not great i believe you get what you pay for if they want top notch service they should pay more
bad,the managers were very unskilled and mean. the hours were not good approx. 17-24 hours a week. no raises no advancements
bad,I was responsible for getting merchandise off the truck and pulling it to the sales floor. I would stock all the shelves making sure they were neat in appearance and would answer any questions the customers may have.
bad,"I working in Clinton, IA 2889 Wal-Mart. I loved it! Great management and overall great team. I recently transferred to Ames, IA 4256. It's been tough getting up everyday to go into this disgusting and poorly ran store. So disappointing. So disorganized. I would quit if I could."
bad,"Walmart needs better management. They treat employees like dirt, or second rate citizens. When management asks you to do something and you do not understand or ask for clarification, they do so with attitude, and treat you like you are mentally challenged."
bad,"I love my coworkers and pharmacists, However I do not agree with the changes being made within the pharmacy that do not make any sense."
bad,"I was employed as a part time cashier, but still with being part time I was working everyday but with a limited hours. The pay was horrible, I would've expected have a higher hourly pay with having 3 1/2 years customer service experience as well as work in Customer Service Management as well Office experience."
bad,"Everyday it is required to view the schedule and start the day. I, myself, has learned more about handling money and how to do problem solving. Everyone for the most part are very friendly."
bad,"Loved the diversity in employees, coming from all walks of life.  Employees are definitely over-worked and pushed hard for productivity. It proved to be very slow and difficult to move up in management and is my main reason for leaving the company and returning to school."
bad,I worked cashier most of the time on occasion they would have me work customer service desk when short handed and also reset modes when needed. I enjoyed working with all they other cashier i had great immediate supervisors. Unfortunately Upper management  cared very little about their employees and schedules were bad. The hardest part of the job was definitely holiday seasons. The most enjoyable part of the job is making customers happy.
bad,"Same as the first review. Good as a high school job. somewhat flexible hours. Great co workers. Good hours, sometimes you are hired for a job but really have to do other jobs in the store"
bad,Fun place to work until the store would become hectic then you would dread having to go in the next day. Managers split between caring about everyone's needs and not caring at all.
bad,"Por ser do setor de loss sempre segui os procedimentos da empresa,todo aprendizado que foi passado e para os associados terem noções de atendimento e processos da empresa."
bad,"work "
bad,"Management lacks communication amongst themselves, contradicting each other everyday. They do not follow company policies, specifically attendance policies and drug-free policies."
bad,My experience at Walmart was horrible. If you weren't a favorite you would not be treated with respect. Time off and holidays were only given to friends of managers even if you requested it ahead of time. Managers wrote people up unfairly and it was not organized at all. Priority was given to those who were friends with management not those who deserved it. They did not show appreciation to all staff who deserved it.
bad,"Management cared far more about being in charge than about their employees. Never felt like I was doing anything of meaning. I did however learn about hard work, even if that work kinda sucked."
bad,"This is a company full of favoritism and does not have a code of ethics. There is no job security and associates opinions don't really matter. This company advertises integrity, but it is not applied. The hardest part of the day is making sure there is coverage in the department. The more you work for this company the less respect you gain from the company. The most enjoyable part is being able to assist customers and being able to enable the best customer service I know that I can give. Most of the people I work with are just there because they have to be and that I can understand because I used to love going to work and being a part of a team that was willing to work hard and make a difference. That isn't there anymore."
bad,"The store culture is typical: mostly nice folks, clear job description, PITA customers, poor management."
bad,"it's the most unsafe place I've ever worked at.  If you get hurt they try to talk you out of going to the ER.  If you go to the ER expect a big write up on your write up sheet.  it takes managers years fix problems.  ice cream sits on the dock for 5+ hours sometimes to the point were it is liquid.  then they put it into the freezer.  you can't re freeze ice cream.  it goes bad.  I've seen berries and vegetables all over the floor, then they use a shovel or a dust pan to pick them up and put them back into the containers and send them to the stores.  managers see it all the time and are fine with it.  that's why I will never buy food from walmart.  if the FDA did a surprise inspection the walmart DC in Johnstown, ny would get closed down.  they know when the inspections are coming and start cleaning like crazy.  the equipment malfunctions all the time to the point where it launches the person of it.  there has been a lot of injuries from that.  most people don't report there injuries.  they like to get ride of you when you report injuries or write you up saying you should of know the equipment was going to malfunction.  I know people there that worked with brokens bones.  I got wrote up for getting a splinter.  I stopped reporting injuries after that.  when you work at the  walmart DC in Johnstown, ny ,production and cases per hour are number 1 and safety if last!  be careful if your going to work there.  And there is a write up for everything.  they even have a category called other on your write up sheet so they can make up write ups."
bad,"Everyday was different, depending if the store was busy or not. The non-busy days were easy. Follow my own designated routine. tend to dirt, mulch, stone, brick and sand. tend to the plants if some else hasn't done so. Find empty pallets and stack them neatly. Bring pallets and plant racks to back of store when there is a time to do so. Help with customers when necessary. Go on water and ice runs when necessary(a lot of departments in the store had an ice chest full of ice and bottles of water for associates). Complete tasks given to me by managers when necessary. "
bad,"Decent working conditions."
bad,micro-management is how they operate and in the long run seems more inefficient that way and makes the job a bit more difficult to get done. Also always short handed and the company will make promises to you like overtime and not give it to you.This was my worst work experience.
bad,"Typical day went by with stocking product, helping customers, locating product in the back room and keeping a clean presentation of the product. Management was fairly supportive and the coworkers were easy to get along with. The most enjoyable part was the interactions with customers, however to that same extent it was also the hardest part."
bad,"I worked very hard at this job and went way above and beyond what I was initially hired for as requested by my supervisors. My job description just said I was supposed to clean the restrooms/general store, take out trashes, clean up any spills, and help any customers I can. I went above and beyond that with processing and disposing of hazardous materials, being trained on a register as cashier, taking inventory of all the supplies in every department (aside from actual merchandise customers purchase), downstacking pellets of new merchandise, stocking merchandise on shelves, and anything else I was asked to do. Towards the end of my employment with Walmart my supervisor said I needed to clean the break room more, so I made it a part of my routine to clean the break room everyday after lunch. So I would clock in from lunch, and go back in the break room and clean it for about 10-15 minutes. There is no security camera in the break room, but there is one  just above the clock in computer and leading into the break room. After two weeks of me cleaning the break room after lunch my supervisor asked to see me to inform me that I was terminated for stealing company time, when I tried to explain I was just doing my job he, Derek Stiez, flat out called me a liar and said I was dishonest and my employment was terminated. "
bad,"Clock in, may receive a write up or error report before you do unless you decline until you are actually on their time. Attend morning meting for which you don't receive downtime, log in a machine if one is available then work at a ridiculous production rate. Assuming you don't have any problems for which you usually don't receive downtime. Other than that the money is great and the shifts are okay if you don't mind waking up early and working."
bad,The coworkers were great. Typical day of stocking shelves is quiet. Distribution centers don't stack pallets properly and my store had a habit of never having pallets stacked safely when they were brought out to the front. Management is usually under qualified and don't communicate with one another.
bad,"Management was neglectful to the staff as far as appreciation and also with customer assistance, also would spread the staff thin between different responsibilities around the workplace"
bad,"I worked for this job for a year but it felt more like 5, we were understaff in one of the most popular awl-marts within 5 cities, management wasn't coordinated and was always on a different page and lastly hired and fired the wrong people all the time"
bad,"While working at Wal-Mart I quickly learned how to cooperate with many different personalities from many different people. Wal-Mart taught me how to deal with different behaviors and how to keep peaceful working environment. The hardest part of the job, although not as difficult as it may seem, was quickly being transferred to a different department, doing different task without training in the middle of the shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with coworkers in a team atmosphere."
bad,"terrible hours, hard to get more and they are always scattered, never expect any plans you have to be on a set day. don't pay alot of employees enough."
bad,"Extremely un-professional in the way they conduct business, the store is more concerned about protecting haphazard managers and covering ones own backside than the customer or employee care, half the equipment is broken or in a state of disrepair which is extremely unsafe for employee's and hours can be erratic."
bad,"My mother told me if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all. Sorry. Just an overall bad experience. I have heard better tales from other Walmart stores"
bad,"bad not fully staff to many problems not need help "
bad,"Was a very hard job for the pay and title. Always had kids who didnt care or have any kind of morale. I learned that anyone could advance and make the most out of what they were doing if they actually tried. Management was a joke literally. They were so rude and disrespectful behind close doors. They had a mentality, that EVERYONE, is replaceable. Co-workers were okay. The hardest part of the job was management. There was almost nothing enjoyable there. Except for my Co-workers."
bad,"My time at Wal-Mart taught me that it was one of the worst places to work that I have encountered yet. The management clearly had no idea how to properly perform their jobs, all employees were shown a large lack of respect and they failed to uphold wise and proven work ethics."
bad,A normal day included unloading trucks and separating products onto pallets to be stocked in various departments. I would pick and store items in inventory as well. The people I worked with were very nice. I suffered a torn labrum in my right shoulder in high school and the constant lifting of heavy products made the job difficult.
bad,"The typical day working at Walmart started at clocking in in the back of the store, heading out to my department to clean up after customers, reorganize the product on the shelves, and provide customer service. Employees get two paid 15 minute breaks and one unpaid 1 hour break, making the typical workday last 9 hours."
bad,"This is a job ,not a career place, good for a fill in job or in between job."
bad,"Overnight is horrible a lot of products to stock with a little time and no help. You do meet some characters though! You do get hours, and they will work with your school schedule. Some great managers, but mostly annoying one's."
bad,"Really depends on management if you enjoy your job here, my first store had managers with actual management skills, but I like my coworkers and customers, no advancement unless you're in management, too much work for little pay, a lot of cut hours no over time unless on holidays, a lot of favoritism due to management, if you're a hardworker, you don't get a day off even with vacation days because they have no one to replace you, oh and that new raise that they keep bragging about, it doesn't apply to employees who've worked there several years so you'll  make about as much as people just hired if you've been with the company for years. The money isn't worth it that's why they raised minimum wage... too many people keep quitting."
bad,"A typical day at Walmart would be immediately jumping on a register, helping customers find what they needed in the store, doing returns and exchanges and/or money transfers and cashing checks. I've learned a lot at Walmart as far as how to better myself and my skills dealing with customer service."
bad,"I have been a cashier at Walmart for almost 2 years now. I was first employed in October of 2013 and was 16 years old at the time. My starting wage was $7.65 as a cashier, but was $7.45 when I transferred into retail. I really enjoyed my co-workers, but the members of management are ridiculous. The rules that have been enforced are absurd in my opinion. The biggest conflict that I have with Walmart is being excused for 3 absences in a 6 month time frame. It would not be such a struggle if the managers allowed their employees time off when they needed it, but they don't allow their employees the time off. I have missed the past two Thanksgivings and Christmas Eves because I was scheduled to work those days. I had to write multiple hand-written notes and ask for time off on the Wire so that I would be able to make it to my own graduation party and commencement! I strongly advise for anyone not to work there. Regardless of the $9/hr raise, the frustration is just not worth your time."
bad,A typical day at work is checking out customers. I learned to pay more attention. Management could be better but overall there pretty good. My co-workers were some of the coolest people I have met. The hardest part of the job was red lining . The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and making new friends
bad,"A typical day includes price changes, ordering products, stocking freight, floor plan resets, planograms, putting away returns, zoning products, ringing register, and any other duties they pull you to do. "
bad,Since I was there for seven years. I knew a lot and did a lot but they took that for granted. Wal-Mart is the worst company to work for. You do to much for not enough pay. You can work three departments and only get paid no more than nine dollars.
bad,"Managers were harsh, critical, and demanding with unrealistic expectations. Co-worker drama involving harassment."
bad,"Duties include serving the customer, sharing information with other associates, maintaining assigned areas of the facility in a safe, correct, and timely manner; identifying and adapting to changing work demands and assisting others in doing the same."
bad,I can not speak for all stores but the one I worked for. Worked for them for two years with too many broken promises. Very slim room to move up the ladder for overnighters. Even less for those who deserve it. Extremely difficult to achieve even full time hours.
bad,I have learned that this job requires alot if patience when you first get the job it can be fun and enjoyable until you meet the managers that have no respect for the associates. They have horrible leadership skills and rather than helping out they hide in the office and relax on a day to day basis. They are rude and unwilling to work with you or your schedule.
bad,"Want to work in a place with low pay, almost nonexistent benefits and management who would throw you under the bus as opposed to actually be helpful? Then look no further! The only redeeming quality was the food."
bad,"The shift usually starts with associates and assistant mgr meeting, going over the assignments of some of the associates. Thed floor is open to complaints or questions. This would take thirty to forty minis at times, never mind that  we have time tasks, or that our times are not consistent with the freight that may or may not be staged in whatever department. It can also take more time to find 'Geminis that are hidden all ovr the store.  At times it feels like we are setup to fail to be honest. The most enjoyable pare to the job is the client or customers who appreciate us doing our job right. The confusion that occurs when you are ask to do someone else task, but are not covered by the manager who ask you to step away from your assigned task, no acknowledgement from management when you are being the best possible team player. I've learned that everyone is cut from a different  cloth in focusing on the strengths of individuals you manage, sometimes acknowledging their hard work will make a company, you and your co-workers extraordinary any given day."
bad,"If you're young and like working at a SoCal clothing store, PacSun is the place for you. I can't say too much else. It's just another job at the mall."
bad,Worked in various areas of the store and learned a lot of what the company stands for. Management was rather decent but there was room for improvement throughout all levels. Coworkers made the job go by fast due to all the different personalities they possessed. The hardest part was having to overcompensate for some of the coworkers lack of motivation to get tasks done by exerting more of my time and energy. The most enjoyable part of the experience was assisting people with questions and having a chance to interact with particular coworkers.
bad,Walmart doesnt keep a full staff. Most of the time I was working by myself covering multiple departments. The training is a joke. They hire people who have no clue about what they are doing
bad,"I  don't have much to say , i like working here but at the same time i don't."
bad,"I worked almost 5 years for Wal-Mart. I never became full-time because they don't believe in giving full-time. I was hindered repeatedly by 90% Of the managerial staff, 75% of them didn't even know how to manage people. Wal-Mart hires managers from people who get B.A. degrees in Business. I have seen managers come and many more go. Unfortunely they recycle bad salaried managers to other stores for ""more training"". I haven't see this, we mostly see them get shuffled to another store."
bad,good working envoirenment providing by them....but the salry is low and their incriment system is not good......i like theremost is to learn many things like manage team.... store management.....
bad,"The thing that I enjoyed most was working with customers and my co-worker's. I least enjoyed that change in department managers. The new department manager came in from a department, she was real messy, had 0 respect from employees, always lied on employees, and always threw off her work on her associates. I learned different skills that I could take to another job, I also learned how to teach myself new things around the deli because most of my training when I got there was inaccurate."
bad,The management here was good from certain people. A day at work consisted of a great deal of work I usually got done. I've learned how to make use of my time when it was limited.
bad,Walmart is a company known for its lower salaries unless you move up to management.  Walmart is a great company to help jump start you into a better career.
bad,"Typical day at work: The new freight goes out quickly and it is not difficult. I'm usually done by 2am, lunch time. Back from lunch is usually overwhelming. Picks from the stock room are overwhelming most times. Sometimes more than the new freight from the night. Less time to put the freight out and no help available. Time goes too fast and I usually have to move extremely fast to keep up with the time. I only have two hours left to put out as much as I did in the three hours of the beginning of the night. I finish this and after last break I begin to zone my isle or department. I am an excellent zoner. Management rarely checks me as it is always done with excellence and they have such confidence in me. I may work 6 or more pallets of 20-70 boxes each. I never bring any freight back to the warehouse without making sure it is overstock. My co-workers are wonderful people who pull together to get through the nightly crisis. We usually work with little or no assistance and have few employees to get through the heavy stocking load nightly. The hardest part of the job is not having enough help. Having to do so much every night is like running a marathon or saving yourself from a drowning situation. Sometimes I forget to breathe. The most enjoyable part of the job is realizing I perform seeming miracles every night. Managers at work rely on my ability to achieve impossible goals in a reliable manner. I am frequently put onto the more difficult task of the night. I have learned that  I am great at crisis management. I know how to calmly handle emergency situations and perform with"
bad,"A typical day I'd show up, clock in, report to a CSM, go to the register. Then the scanning and bagging of items. Clock out, go home, repeat. I learned how to talk to customers, co-workers, and management, in addition to the systematic way with which one should bag items."
bad,"Long Hours, Rude customers, non motivated associates, and unprofessional managers. Compensation is good, hours are long and nothing or no one else matters but the company. No one holds company values to standard. Tried it 1yr..no room for advancement unless coming up thru the company."
bad,Being sent to work in other departments then being reprimanded by management for neglecting assigned department. I enjoyed satisfied customers.
bad,"My day would consist of checking the chemical balance of the developer, stocking the paper, taking orders from customers, developing and printing film within an hour time frame, camera and camcorder sales, collecting the film from the drop boxes to send out to the five day service. "
bad,Lack of respect from supervisors. High turnover of supervisors. Co-workers uncooperative when asked for assistance.
bad,"My favorite thing about working for Walmart was conneccting with my customers. I am a people person, so that is what my job was about all day long. I am  complete customer service ready at all times, so it was a very rewarding job for me. My managment skills were updated working for walmart also, as it is a very fast paced position and being in two spots at once was a trick I learned quick!"
bad,"need to put more work into the matix system, how they have their employees on grocery routes . every employ should be in the seasons that they are best in."
bad,"I found that when I started working for Wal-Mart, I loved it. Then I realized there was no room for improvement. When I moved from Cashier to CSM, that was the end of the line. There was no room to grow any further. "
bad,"chegava 15min antes no horário abria meu caixa."
bad,"The overall experience was not pleasant due to the amount of work the job asked of me, far exceeding the expectations of a cashier. Furthermore, this job in particular is under constant review for worker's rights violations and job ethic procedures."
bad,"Managers were untrained/unskilled. Too many unrealistic  goals."
bad,"Their are the obvious good days and bad days and you know how by who is working,,, some managers don't give a flying feel about how their employees feel or are doing while others are very generous ive no problems with employees, but customers and managers are the rudest and most unsympathetic."
bad,"Lively environment"
bad,"This is a good place to work while waitng to move on to a long-term position with another company."
bad,"One thing I did like about working here was how easy it was to move up within the company. However, with the new structure being put in place, the CEO has severely limited how far you can go. Best position you can get in this new program without giving up your entire life (Assistant Manager) besides a pharmacy tech or Vision center assistant is a department manager, which is only a 40 cent raise from a Customer service associate! "
bad,A typical day would be providing administrative support to 3 Directors and approximately 250 associates.  Set up meetings and travel for the 2 Directors.
bad,"I felt as though I was actually part of a team, albeit a small one. The receiving associates position was only a group of six people but we still got everything done we needed to."
bad,"The whole place is Micromanaged, a lot of favoritism is shown towards certain people, can speak with management because they will send you to someone else unless your getting fired.discrimination has been thrown my way."
bad,"When you work for Walmart over night stocking the shelves, you must bend down onto the floor from a standing position to ground level repeatedly to stock shelves. This is a routine that is carried on for the whole shift through out the night. Even after you stock the shelf you must then organize the shelves then repeating this routine, to make the store look presentable. You must stay clean, organized and throw away any and all trash. It is practiced when possible to recycle when you can, even with damaged items. At the end of the night you restock freight you had no room for and work your inventory. I had to use a fork lift that you walk behind, a motorized pallet lift, pallet jack, utility knife, scan gun, printer, computer, shrink wrap, recycling wires, shopping cart, large plastic bag, pen, pencil, marker, gloves, jacket, printer paper, and sticker."
bad,Wal-Mart is not for long term employee's.  If you are not salary it's a great place to work.  Good benefits for full time employees.  Very stressful environment.
bad,"The work itself is not difficult, the pay is not awful, the benefits are terrible and non-existent, the management team is inept at properly delegating duties and leading a positive environment."
bad,I clocked in went to the back room and started unloading trucks then I would take the merchandise and put it onto the shelves. I also helped customers find what they needed.
bad,more about the custemer not the assocate pay sucks people they hire are not right ones for job as need hours suck bouses suck
bad,"Customer Service was pretty easy I was to process returns, cash checks, send and receive money and out of the USA, prevent fraudulent returns, checks and prevent money laundering, help customers find products in and in other stores, also with online orders, follow all walmart policies, and provide excellent customer service, also help out on the front end by returning items to the right departments and help out by checking out customers. Learned how to better cash handle, use the customer service computers, learned how to watch for suspicious activities, prevent theft. I enjoyed most of the managers but most of them need work, need to hire more people in and help out if no associates come to help instead of complain to the supervisors and blame them. nothing really hard and I enjoyed the customers."
bad,"Training is at the core of all business /Company pillars of foundation.  It teaches everything from how to clean a restroom properly,  to how to run an effective and efficient business, which in turn generates positive sales growth and declining loss/increased profits."
bad,"Very controling, love to run your life, not understanding at all to any life happenings. Co workers can be ok the older ones that have been there longest but others not so much. Management is on you constantly harassing you making your day miserable. I put in 12 years of heart break while there and I gave my all while I worked there. I met some awesome people"
bad,Working at Walmart can be a positive job experience but unfortunately it depends all upon who you work with.  The individuals make or break the job.
bad,The hardest part of the job was being constantly short staffed and the hostile work environment.  I loved my job and what I did for Wal-mart.  I love to research shortages and count money.
bad,"I enjoyed the job learning about electonic items, stocking shelves, helping customers, and interacting with my fellow associates. The hardest part of the job is when something is overstocked, you have to enter the items in the computer using a talzon then put it on the shelf in the backroom. I did not like the fact that there is no union and they don't accept doctor excuses when you are ill and can't make it into work."
bad,I enjoyed the co-workers but not the job. A lot of standing around because you had to be in that area. It didn't keep me busy enough and hard to be nice to a lot of very rude people. Advancement wasn't easy because of the test needed to take that didn't comply with the job
bad,"poor management personnel. They claim to have an open door policy but they never listen to suggestions that would make the job easier, more efficient and more effective. They micromanage almost all the time, they also have their favorites. Stay away from this company unless you really really really need money."
bad,"Basic zoning duties, keeping the merchandise stocked. "
bad,Walmart just wasn't a good company for me . The pay was well under the deserved number for the type of work walmart associates do. The meeting new people and getting to learn about different cultures was exciting but at the end of the day the walmart staff was not exciting at all.
bad,"The work environment needs a complete turn around, and employees deserve way more than they are being paid for the work that they are required to do."
bad,"A day at Walmart is a day wasted.  I worked there for over a year and the management there still looked down on me as though I were an imbecile.  Management sees employees as numbers, not people, and it really shows."
bad,"it wasn't worth working there.... drama, management texting, high school clicks"
bad,"Taking OSHA documents and turning them into PDF documents, designing and developing Business plan, Website, business cards, company logo and time sheet, finding employees and doing new hire paper work, setting up email accounts. I learned what PDF documents were, how they worked and how to set them up. I learned how employers post jobs on Indiana Career Connect, how they find and screen employees. Manager hard to work for."
bad,"I had the worst experience of my life working for Walmart, when its below 20 degrees outside the still made go out and bring carts in. No matter what the whether was like they still made us go out and bring in carts. but you do have a guaranteed 40 hr a week."
bad,"This job was insanely stressful. Customers are not very forgiving and they are not afraid to let you know it. Walmart, as we all know, does not have the best pay. I do, however, miss my coworkers very much. It was like a little family (:"
bad,"A typical day at work is making sure products is ready for sale by 5:30a.m.I have learn how to work at a high speed and have good customer services.My department manager is nice and understandable!My co-workers work as a team at times!The hardest part of my job is waking up at  2:00a.m going to work.Having a job to provide for my family is what workings is all about,thats what i enjoy."
bad,"I've worked at Wal-Mart for years, doing many different things and I've seen it all: management sleeping with associates and those associates ""earning"" promotions shortly afterwards; associates brown-nosing management that get away with multiple absences and not doing work; management thinking that they know more about a particular department than the guy who runs it even though they have never stepped foot in that department to work it before."
bad,Great company and awesome co-waorker but very demanding of your time.
bad,"I enjoyed working here, as everyday i got to meet new people, i offered advice and gave my opinion to customers in need when asked questions, managers and co-workers were all nice, and i also worked in different departments when needed, which i liked because it gave me the chance to know many different departments an their jobs as well."
bad,"i like to be busy, trying to put a smile on everyone i meet. but the management team wasnt the best and there were constant turovers"
bad,"I have worked for this company off and on for 7 years. I have had the opportunity to learn many things during my time here. One of the downfalls of this company in my opinion is the management because many of them do not want to pass on knowledge. The store is always short handed which makes the workload too much for the few associateAlso, Walmart's starting pay is too low and they do not pay for experience. It is a decent job for high school or college kids."
bad,Walmart was a great place to work back in the late 1990's...now it has gotten to political and money hungry. they no longer care about the associate or the customer just the bottom dollar. they work their associates to the bone.
bad,"Management is not flexible, they make it hard to be flexible."
bad,Six different managers on duty all with their own opinions of how things should be done resulted in chaos and a lack of productivity. When the managers would mind their own business the store ran smoothly.
bad,"A typical day at Walmart consisted of making sure we had enough registers open to accommodate our customers, balancing breaks, lunches, cashiers calling in sick, and maintaining a seamless transition throughout the day. I learned that no matter how hard we tried to do our jobs, management was always knocking us down. They were not supportive, nor were they trustworthy. There are policies in place for a reason and management seemed to pick and choose which ones they would abide by depending on the day, the customer or the situation. That hardest part of the job was firing an associate for misconduct. The most enjoyable part of the job was actually helping the customers no matter if they were irate, happy or confused."
bad,One person will do the job of 5 people. Co-workers were great.
bad,"I was an employee of Walmart  and it was the worst experienced place I worked for. Walmart lies, cheats, and abuses their associates. I faced harassment from one of the Assistant Managers and nothing was ever done about it. I was accused of editing my time when in fact I more than likely cheated myself out of time. Management needs to show more respect to their associates and listen to them. To be honest actually, Walmart did me a huge favor and I will never work for this company again. Treat your people right, pay them more than what you do, and maybe give more to their bonuses. I mean really, they are doing the work while you sit up on your Walmart throne earning the living that the associates deserve."
bad,"shift will sometimes run together"
bad,"This taught me job responsibilities and that the store depended on me to get my job done correctly. However, due to poor staffing I was often the only person in my department, which was split between opposite sides of the store. This made it difficult to complete my daily requirements because I would often have to leave a task to assist someone in the other section of the department. Management and co-workers were friendly but had a lot of politics and it was difficult to move up in the company."
bad,"this company is not what most people think it is. the management is horrible. the managers are the most selfish people in the world, they don't care about any of their employees , they all want to get promoted so they creates with all kind of false accusation . they all want to look assertive in front of walmart`s big boss."
bad,"bosses all over the place, got 10 diffrent people telling you what to do. No one seems know how to communicate. Bosses quickly get agitated and inpatient . Customers can be come ruthless!!!!"
bad,Disliked it from the beginning and everyone who works there does
bad,"The typical day at work on average was decent considering the fact that the average co-worker was pretty easy to get along with, and not so hard to productively cooperate with. The main issue is that there are too many team leads and too many overseeing managers resulting in the directions passed down being contradicted by team leads, and excessive folly among the leadership often leads to poor morale. I would have to say that a more disciplined and structured leadership base would make all aspects of Link Staffing and Walmart more successful."
bad,"No one in this company cares one tiny bit about doing their job properly. They don't care about customers. They don't care about employees. "
bad,A lot of customers or not very many at all. Usually one way or the other. You had to keep yourself busy at all times whether you had customers or not. That could sometimes be a problem. I learned how much I like meeting new people and polishing my customer service skills. And I learned how to make an angry customer happy or try to. Management usually doesn't appreciate the workers very much and are always making sure you stay busy. I loved my co-workers and we got along and helped each other out. Hardest part of the job was when something didn't ring up right or didn't have a bar code on it. Also when a customer is very unhappy and is letting you know about it wanting you to do something that only a person in higher authority is allowed to do. Meeting new people and having return customers come through your line.
bad,"Not very concerned with the overall employee experience. There were some dangerous situations, such as poor storage placement and outdated work materials.They was a strong sense of camaraderie in some instances. But some situations lacked professionalism. Most enjoyable part was being able to implement proper organization and feeling useful. Hardest part was attempting to use effective communication."
bad,"I will admit, I have worked at a different wal-mart where I would rate it five stars overall.  the one in Ruckersville, Va is barely worth the two star rating.  Most of the management there believe that they are better than everyone else.  They are lazy and will not even make the schedules, they let the computer generate them.  They refuse to change days that associates need off or need adjusted, but quickly adjust the schedule when they need it adjusted.  Some refuse to talk with associates about important matters and shrug them off.  The store is extremely cluttered and unorganized.  Some managers are very nice and try to help associates as much as they can, however most do not.  The other associates are nice and all try to help one another."
bad,"its a job, flexible hours, managers can sometimes be rude and inconsiderate, they have 'favorites' who are quicker to get promoted than employees that have actually earned their promotion"
bad,When I worked there it I stock shelves but it was hard work and at this company. and we never had enough people to stock the whole store so the people that worked there had to re-stock more than one department  at night. I really did not learn anything but I know for a fact that they had mangers who only had a third grade education what I mean by this I from other state and this manger thought I was from Canada because did not know or had learned in school that Colorado is in Untied States
bad,"not a very good company to work for . I dont know of anyone that is happy working there . its just a job . they dont treat their people very well. They dont care about you as a person . They dont listen , They have the good old boys club and if your not a member then your not going to advance."
bad,"They provide no help in building your business."
bad,"first 4 yrs were great after that it went downhill from then on."
bad,"What can be said about this particular Wal-mart? well, it was the worse job I'd ever had, I clocked in and worked solo for four different departments because my coworkers hardly ever worked. My Managers were all lazy and liked to put all their work onto the lower ranked associates. The hardest part of this job was trying to clean, maintain and provide customer service for Dry Grocery, Pets, HBA, and Dairy throughout the store by myself. The most enjoyable part of this job was when I went outside to push carts, as I could relax and only have to worry about one job out there."
bad,"Its just not the place people assume it is when walking in to start their first day.  Advancement is easy to do but when you get promoted the weight of that store is on your shoulders.  Acountability is an issue, people get away with to much and no one is held accountable for their actions. instead we clean up the mess and sweep it under the rug."
bad,"Unload truck, the zone all of the day"
bad,"A typical day was very hectic and made time pass quickly; however, the treatment of workers when it came to breaks was terrible. Though I learned to use a cash register and how to deal with all sorts of people, the hours were long and as such, required breaks. If you worked a full day (8+ hours), you were given two 15 minute breaks and a lunch. These two small breaks were not actually breaks however, as time to get to the breakroom, which could take up to 5 minutes, counted against you. Taking that into account, 15 minute breaks became 5 minute breaks as you are reprimanded for not being back at your register on time."
bad,"Not a really good job unless it is your first job to gain experience, perfect for newcommers, horrible managment experience with them"
bad,A typical day at work is you walk in fine and by the time you leave you one big stress ball just waiting to explode. What I've learned working for this company is you have no friends everyone is for themselves just waiting for you to turn your back so they can stab it. Management for this company is closed minded with no common sense they are just there to get you to do the most work for every dollar no matter the circumstances or consequences. The bottom line is all that matters to them.  If you think you're going to move up in this company then you are wrong.  Unless your a brown noser that the only way.  The most enjoable part of the job is when you clock out to go home.
bad,"Built the distribution center, enjoyed my co-workers everything was hands on perfect job for anyone who likes to learn and work hard."
bad,"As a business walmart does what it can to produce at the cheapest level while still providing excellent customer service. This mission is impossed on their employees. Loss Prevention is one of the highest prioties, while management did not seem to care about the level of trust and respect between coworkers and management."
bad,At the end of the day I need to feel that something was done...at this company I never felt that to many obstacles to complete anything. Too much work not enough day or money.
bad,Poder contar con gente que apoya con información sobre el proceso. Aportar con la información oportuna.
bad,un reliable workers. my managers we always rude. i understand its a job but when you ask for help or need something the manager or supervisor should always be there. i really was un happy there at walmart
bad,a typical day at work for me is coming in checking to see what reshop we have are the drawers ready to be open and to count the merchandise in the department to see whats out so i can refill theshelves
bad,"Helping customers with money services such as the sell of prepaid cards, money gram, & money orders."
bad,"- hardworking co-workers that aren't paid anywhere near what they are worth"
bad,learned a lot about decorating cakes and taking cake orders
bad,"I did not care for it, I was never home and was given unrealistic expectations to accomplish. When we were unable to attain the ridiculously high goals we were publicly berated in front of the team and treated as though we were all children. Respect for the individual is a hollow policy in the store that I was in."
bad,"They had me in the same place every night and that was Dairy. I didn't mind that I had the most freight in the store every night because they trusted me enough to leave me alone every night. I usually had 1-2 people helping me at night, depending on the freight, and they came to me for instructions. Typically I would start the shift by looking for carts because we had to down stack the pallets before we had to work them on the floor. I would have my help work the easy stuff first, which was normally the juice pallet from inside the cooler (1 or 2 depending on the night), and I would get out the yogurt and cheese on the floor (each pallet took 1 hour not including down stacking time). We would have to take a break every 2 hours which was kind of a hastle. Because we had the hardest department, we had lots of cardboard, so we had to always worry about that along with the heavy freight. I would always finish on time and do more then expected. The last 2 hours we used team work the most. One person would go out and ""zone"" the department. By zoning I mean pulling everything forward on the shelf's and flipping the product so the labels are out. While getting rid of expired things, and cleaning up our department. The other person (which was 95% of the time me) would use a Telxon to bin in all the extra freight into the steel then clean up the cooler so the next shift can keep doing nothing."
bad,It can be a nice atmosphere to work in as long as you are willing to kiss butt to climb up the management latter.
bad,In my opinion management is not very good the only nice thing about working here is some of my co-workers are amazing.
bad,i wasnt happy. i didnt like a management or atmosphere. co-workerswere cool. I just didnt enjoy this job.
bad,"Not enough associates hired to handle work load."
bad,"Okay place to work, long hours standing. Management is very rude and not polite. Coworkers are nice."
bad,"I work 8 hours a day, getting at least 36 hours weekly from  am-  pm. My job description is to stock, zone, and work with our customer for a sufficient shop at Wal-Mart. My job consist of doing a lot more than that, I work Toy, Groceries, Photo Lab and Connection Center, also just started working Layaway. I've learned that our management team is rude, improper, and they retaliate against their workers. For example, a Department Manager in the Deli got my order wrong and blamed it on another associate when my order was through her. The Department Manager gave a full time associate less than 23 hours for the following 2 weeks after the situation. My co-workers in the same department will not work and I'll report it to management but they turn the other way, leaving me in the Electronic Department by myself. It's hard for me to work there when I'm the only one handling customer service. The good thing about working there is that I get so busy and my day at work ends quickly."
bad,Its a job where you do the same thing everyday and don't get paid very much money to do it. Quite often you are scheduled to work late at night to turn around and have to be back early the next day. They also make sure you do not hit the full time amount of hours to make sure they do not have to give any form of benefits.
bad,"Experience has been eye opening, truly a everyday learning experience !"
bad,"Communication from Management is poor at best.  Work load is far more than can be done in one day.  You will be told to cheat on reports and score cards for the in inventory system by management.  Day and Night do not work together.  Not every person is held to the same standards, its a do as I say not as I do culture.  Make sure you never ever speak up on things that are wrong, just shut up and do what the managers want not what the home office wants.  Pay and benefits are terrible for the world largest retailer.  You will never have enough help labor is always getting cut even if you are full time."
bad,fast past ...Customers service desk fast and fun all at the same time
bad,I have learned that there are really great people out in the world. Management shows no regards for the needs of their employees. I would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,From the Top to the Bottom the Company is in serious need of restructuring.
bad,work like crazy the second i get to wal-mart because a lazy employee leaves over 200 carts outside in the parking lot for me every time i work. the hardest part of the job is having to organize all 330 out of wal-mart by 10:00
bad,It was wonderful to work with amazing individuals and learn a variety of tasks in the time employed.
bad,They are rude to the employees.  They change your schedule without telling you.  Some co-workers just make your life miserable and they don't give you fair process when problems are presented.
bad,"This is a difficult one. I do not have much good to say about a multi billion dollar corporation that feeds propaganda and empty promises of bonuses and promotions. In fact my suggestion, if you decide to work here, would be to do the minimum amount of work to just get by. during my time there they were the ones getting the raises and promotions while the hard workers were left to carry the slack. there logic behind this was to keep good workers on the floor so work would get done. Management was poor."
bad,Working directly with the customers was probably the best part.  It was a pleasure to talk about the things I knew best.  It was hard to work where your coworkers seemed sad or angry.  I tried to learn something new every day though and got to give practical advice.
bad,"Walking up and down in front of cash out lanes. Suggesting to customers which lane could be faster.  Zoning (putting items returned back on shelves and organizing areas)"
bad,"A typical day as a Wal-Mart cash supervisor starts off by viewing the schedule and counting the float for the front cashes, so that cashiers can receive breaks on time as well as the correct amount of change. As the day goes by I might have to go on cash to help reduce line-ups, or help on Customer Service returning defective/unwanted merchandise and send Western Union transfers. I am not only responsible for the cashiers but also the maintenance team (making sure the front end is clean, as well as the wash rooms) and the cart crew(making sure the cart carrels are full). At the end of the day have to make sure all 24+ cashes are counted and left with a float. "
bad,You meet interesting people in walmart. Its a good job to learn customer service.
bad,"dealing with stock, cleaning the shoes off the floor, putting shoe back on the shelf, helping costumers find shoes or sizes. costumer service. working as a team member, meeting new people everyday."
bad,"I have been with Walmart for  years. I have come to the conclusion that most of the associates are not happy with the pay or the way that they get treated."
bad,"If you want to work at Wal-Mart be prepared for managers that don't respect you and and don't train you on how to work some of the keep. They expect the store to be perfect, but they expect you to learn as you go."
bad,Horrible place to work for. I would never want to work there again. The only reason I worked there twice was because I had no choice and really needed a job. The managers treat the employees awfully and there is no room for growth unless you are a preferred employee with management.
bad,Stocking and cashiering work. Prepare to work various hours.
bad,A typical day at work would start off with clocking in on time. Then I would have to bring carts from the parking lot to the front of the store and repeated this progress until it was time to clock out
bad,Good starter job. Learned cashier experience and customer service.
bad,"The walmart neighborhood market i had worked at was absolutely horrible. Compensation was terrible and management was verbally abusive. They will employ you for one position at full time and then have you work all areas of the store for less than 20 hours a week. Constant theft from store. Attempts to stop theft has been fruitless. Not to mention the gaggle of homeless men who would panhandle infront of the store completely drunk or high. Security was hired, but they stand at the front of the store and do nothing. Would never come back to the store!"
bad,"they will work you to death and not care, push production to a point that no one can possibly make it and then fire you because you can't make it, they always put numbers before quality and safty"
bad,"Uma cultura impecável. Sam Walton fundou uma empresa que até hoje prima por uma cultura exemplar. Trata-se de uma empresa administrada de forma transparente onde fazem reuniões semanais de apresentação dos resultados e atuação das áreas para correção. Uma Cia que tira constantemente seus profissionais da zona de conforto para darem seu melhor de si e assim entregarem seus resultados. Foco muito grande em entrega de metas e resultados. O crescimento profissional é a consequência do atingimento de metas de cada um. Uma bela empresa, orgulho de ter trabalhado na mesma."
bad,"Somewhat consistent, job isn't too hard you just have to get use to the management style that can vary when they change managers time to time."
bad,"Desenvolvimento da capacidade analítica e organização."
bad,"Over worked, no appreciation , no overtime, when I worked there I was full time  for over 2 years and before I quit they cut my hours down to part time. I was promised promotion after promotion. when I was required to work over they would make me leave early at the end of the week."
bad,The Associates you work with are great.  The management is horrible and holds unrealistic expectations.
bad,a typical day at work was a hassle not to enjoyable. I learned how not to treat employees who work for me. I also learned how to do inventory in retail and stock. some of the  management was not as pleasant to work for. But my co-worker made the time to go by easy and being able to have fun with the co-workers. the hardest part of the job is the harassment of some of the management. the most enjoyable part of the job is the employees.
bad,"Walmart does not care about their employee. The assistant managers work over 15 hr per day per shift and that is because you are not provided the staffing required to get your job done properly. And since the assistant managers are on salary, we end up working more than a 40 hr week. I do not mind hard work extra hours, but I think it should be a limit to it and right now my work week consist of 50-65 hrs per week and it never seems like enough for Walmart. They have a very high turn over rate"
bad,"The deli is a very fast paced environment, I learned how to prepare food. I also learned safety guidelines that go along with that. I got along well with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is keeping everything ready during busy shopping days. I enjoy working with customers."
bad,"The managers expect you to be pristine in an environment where you are being screamed at all the time doing the same things over and over again all day. No matter how high your spirits may be, you cannot help but be emotionally and physically drained from this day to day experience."
bad,I enjoyed working in the daily because I had fun and outgoing coworkers. I also enjoyed working with customers and making them smile was a goal and to make sure they were satisfied with my service.
bad,it was a lot of product to put our and organize before morning...
bad,"managment there was almost usless, you could be asked to do a job 20 differnt times from 30 different people who all thought they were your managment"
bad,"investigation on internal or external, orc investigations, court liason"
bad,God awful environment to work in. Can't say it enough. God awful environment to work in. Never work for walmart. Get a real job somewhere else.
bad,"A typical day at walmart consists of customer service either as a cashier, service desk associate or Customer service supervisor. As  a cashier you are assigned to a specific register until your 15 minute break. After your break you scan your badge and then get another register assignment. I stay at the register until my lunch or until Im needed at the service desk or as a css. As a manager I try to keep moral up, answer customer service calls promptly and as efficient as possible. I keep up with all calls and tasks at hand with a smile and positive attitude. I love to engage with my co-workers. I am  a problem solver and everyone feels comfortable enough to share anything they are feeling or whatever is on their mind. They trust me to have their best interest in mind. The hardest part of my job is not being able to be in more than one place at a time. Having so much to do at one time that it is sometimes overwhelming. Not having the compensation I should have for the job responsibilities I do on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to do everything I am required to do and more. Even though this job can get overwhelming, I take pride in it and still over exceed all expectations."
bad,Stressful but a job that helped me get on my feet. A lot of hours spent for little pay. Management was pretty hands on and helpful at times. Loved my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was being there more than at home with my kids. Missing my sons games and etc. The most enjoyable part was helping people and making our store looking good and safe. The co-workers were like family.
bad,"Seasonal inventory  associate, work was decent, hours were decent."
bad,"Work was simple."
bad,"A day at Wal-Mart is somewhat exciting. What I do is greet the customers, write customer car orders up to be serviced, run the register and check customers out, and then I help customers out on the sales floor as needed."
bad,"Typically my whole day consist of stocking shelves or checking  customers out on the register. "
bad,Walmart was a good place to start and get experience for the next place to work!!!!
bad,"Management was horrible. If you had a problem the managers would only stick up for each other & never really will solve your actual problem. They talk to associates like they are not even human beings. They show a lot of favoritism. They act like they are the only ones with a life, for instance if you are sick they don't even approve of you leaving work early. Management is all for themselves and don't really care about the well being of their associates. They will lie to you in your face to cover up what the actual problem really was. Overall my co-workers and the customers are the main reason that actually made a typical day at work much more enjoyable."
bad,"When I started at Walmart I did enjoy working there. I enjoyed my department (fashion and infants) I was part-time but they had me work full-time hours but wouldn't upgrade me to full-time. My co-workers had to be the greatest part of my job and why I stayed as long as I did. "
bad,"Working at Spencers was an ideal job. I wore jeans to work and had amazing co-workers and a great boss. I learned how to operate the registers, read a plan-o-gram, deal with customers, make deposits and change orders. I enjoyed working here and would do so if I could again. The hardest part of the job was leaving and the pay. Great job but was only minimum wage."
bad,They short change you and make statements that are not true. It is not a good company to work for longer than 6 months.
bad,"This job was very unorganized. It seemed as though throughout the workday, there was no help from any management. Most of the managers were rude even when you showed them the utmost respect. The managers walked around as if they were the best when in fact most of the complaints were about the managers."
bad,I worked at Walmart for almost 2 years. There wasn't room for advancement and the management was the worst!  They could care less about their employees not to mention they all had bad attitudes when approached with questions.
bad,Needs to develop employees to retain trained work force.  Misled during interview and training program.
bad,"this company offered at the time I was in school, the option to work around you class schedule. Management was understanding of testing times and my availability."
bad,"A typical work day varies on how much freight overnight left for us. Alot of the time there was merchandise was in the backroom. I already learned everything before I came to the company. My co-workers were great friendly and helpful. The hardest part of my the job was they didn't separate the work evenly, they didn't care how the work got done long as someone did it.I pulled most of the weight in my section. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with great co-workers."
bad,"Bad attitudes, lazy workers, horrible management team. No organization and communication skills what so ever. Scheduling issues every week. Did not like the work unconformable work environment and the treating of employees, I put in my two weeks. and walked away happily."
bad,"A typical day at walmart was to walk in assess your area. Start working freight that was left from the night before and start paperwork, price changes, then get notes from management. Helping customers is always number one. Co-workers are awesome but usually they are to busy to help you out. Hardest part of the job was trying to work 6 departments with barely any staff. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to converse with the customers and help them find what they needed."
bad,"Not the job itself but the managers can make the job very stressful."
bad,"A place that is not understanding or sympathetic to the needs of the employees balancing home and work. A place where there is no incentives and the morale of the employees is very low. Long time and great employees are unhappy with how management treat them and also say the ""old"" walmart and managers was better and more family oriented. A lot of employees will tell you it is just about a paycheck and are miserable while they are at work. Even new assistant managers tranfers or want to within a few months of being there. Management make you feel like they don't care about you as a person and sometimes try to devalue you.  And  not to mention it is so much favoritism. It isn't about how well you do your work it is about who you know and who is in your corner."
bad,The company is not good to work for. The complication inside is way over prescribed!
bad,"empresa con muchas vacantes por el mal manejo y trato"
bad,"Working in the back was tough, but coworkers tend to entertain everyone by telling funny stories and jokes while they do their work. The companies management was atrocious, they treat their employees as they they are less than human, you are constantly being told you're worthless or you have no goals because you are over eighteen and working at Walmart, there was no inter- department communication. They pay for some of the jobs was wholly inadequate. All in all do not work for Walmart unless you have no other choice."
bad,"Helping customer meet needs and products wanted. Assisted with customers checkout , payment and returns."
bad,"Typical day-overnight stock"
bad,boring work you to hard managers are not polite all together not paying you enough
bad,this job has very high expectations with very low pay. Management is always stressed and pass the torch on to there employees.
bad,"Management style is very poor.  Management does not communicate well with their employees resulting in a lack of cohesion during the working shift. When management does communicate, it is very confrontational with little respect for the individual."
bad,"Assist customers, stock shelves, inventory products, unload trucks"
bad,"A cultura da empresa é muito forte, aprende-se muito. Porém hoje em dia não há muita possibilidade de crescimento em Curitiba."
bad,"great customers, co-workers, bad upper management. Typically liked working there; except management made it difficult to work there."
bad,"This job was constantly in motion. Most employees that worked there were not happy. The management was not organized or fluid. However, everyone there did work hard to try and keep the store at it peak. The hardest part of the job was being thrown from assignment to assignment without being told entirely what was your job."
bad,Walmart has really poor management when it comes assistant managers and even higher then that and they treat their employees with no respect at all
bad,"I have worked out at the distribution center for almost six years.  While the schedule and hours are nice, I find there is little to no opportunity for advancement within the company.  Every time a management job opens up it is simply given to the most attractive female employee that hasn't already been promoted, it's ridiculous."
bad,There was nothing I enjoyed about Walmart except it being my first job and the people who worked there
bad,"Provide speedy and efficient checkout experience"
bad,Wal-Mart is a great place for college students to work but i do not recommend making a career of this place. This company is so stuck in their ways that it would take a miracle for them change. Management does not she appreciation for their associates. The pros to working for wal-mart is the fact that you receive your schedules 3 weeks prior and they provide a lot of extra hours. Besides that i do not recommend working here unless its absolutely necessary.
bad,It is a demanding job to meet the needs of customers and employer. The customers are great but the physical demands at minimum wage do not meet my needs to balance my home life
bad,"Typical day at work is the same everyday. Come to work stock shelves go home."
bad,"This was one of the worst employment experiences ever.  I worked my butt off for these people for almost 6 years.  Then they came up with a bunch of false reasons and didn't even bring me through proper discipline proceedures as required by their own policies.  They real reason they got rid of me was I was full time with benefits, my stocks were about to vest and I was about to reach over $10.00 per hour.  They used me and then betrayed me.  Let's just say my co-workers saw what happened and are looking for other jobs due to how I was treated."
bad,"Typical day at work is extrwemely busy"
bad,Stores vary depending on the management and employees at a store but the particular store I worked at was not good.
bad,I worked in store management and hated every second.  The manager job is very demanding on your time so you have no life. The only person in the store that makes good money is the manager. The assistant managers make poor money. They also work terrible hours.  There are some good store managers and there are some terrible store managers.  One thing I found funny is the secrecy of what store managers made moneywise. It was always top-secret.
bad,"In the short time I have worked here the management team made me think that advancement would be easy. It was not, I tried to change departments and some of the co-managers gave my a bad review even though I was one of the hardest working department leads. Then a month later they made me take over another department on top of the ones I already had, came out to seven total to take care of in a day. Then they would yell at me when things didn't get done when they wanted it to. I stepped down and now work in the backroom where there is a lot less stress and I don't have to worry about them pilling work on me. Over all I would not recommend any one work for Walmart, pay was not worth what all had to be done."
bad,"A typical day at work would be to begin with a meeting,then proceed to your department & make sure the shelves were stocked"
bad,"Not the best place to start, especially if you are wanting a career. Unless it's specifically within sales or something related to your field, only work here if you need income of some type while you pursue other fields of interest."
bad,I interacted with many people a day as well as fulfilled orders and kept a clean sanitary work area. I unloaded and  stocked merchandise. Prepared hot foods to order. I enjoy working as a  team to accomplish a task. The most difficult  part of the job is getting people to pitch in.
bad,"only thing i can think of is that the management needs work, HR is never there when needed"
bad,"Conducted audits on register invoices.  Managed cashier station as needed by upper management. Assisted customers with questions and concerns dealing with apparel. "
bad,"company wasn't quite what i was accustomed to.  the lack of professionalism from the co-workers up to the management left little to be desired.  perhaps my standards are too high, but that is what is in my blood."
bad,"Being of service to the customer was great.  If it wasn't for the customer there would be no job.   Most CSM's (customer service manager) would take 10-15 minutes, if not longer, to arrive at the register when called.  Most co-workers would complain about everything, backbiters, slow  and do as little as possible to get by."
bad,"Fast pace and officiant working environment. Learned how to work faster and be more productive, management could bring more of a caring and listening as having a heart to ones concerns and interests to make work more easier environment for employees and customers. Hardest part of the job is getting problems and concerns to one that will hear it then work on it to make it better. The most enjoyable part would be seeing once you invest money and then see the end result its amazing what can be accomplished."
bad,After six years working nights my body clock just had enough and i was becoming ill through working long hours and not having a life outside of working there
bad,Everyday you try your hardest and the manager still complains still.
bad,"Long unsociable hours not great if you have a family."
bad,"I clean up daily because i am a neat person; first thing, I get register up and running and then am ready to begin a day of returning and exchanging; sometimes i am on the front registers where i am cashiering.  I have learned to always observe my surroundings. Some of the co-workers, I consider family.  There is no hard part because i love my job. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people i meet; mostly the seniors."
bad,"Adapting to work demand, ensures work is done correctly, work in top priorities first"
bad,Bias atmosphere but great benifits.I think that its a good job but some time the logictics is very off and it has a bad effect on the sales associates that work there
bad,"My one bad experience is not going to be the one and only answer to this companies review. But my time with this company has not been the easiest. The benefits, or ""benefit"" is hardly one at all, 10% off of limited items in the store, not including no fresh foods. The management at my location is slow and work awkward hours during the day making it hard to reach them when you need to ask for hours off or talk."
bad,the job was ok but management need some work good people to work with
bad,I worked here for over a year and from day one the management was unkind to their staff. I worked here in high school and they consistently scheduled me as soon as school was out to too late at night.
bad,"I would clock in and report to the front CSM to be told where I needed to go.  I then would log into my station and begin helping check out customer's goods."
bad,"Have to have available for all days of the week to move up at supervisor, work well with schedule if you're a regular associate. Have to fix or do things on  you're own without relying on anybody."
bad,Would neevr work for wal-mart again if it was the only job hiring. The only place where you can work extra hours with no kind of overtime
bad,"Typical day of work would be coming in, working freight, helping customer's, and performing job duties."
bad,"Long work days"
bad,simple jobs and assignments just not enough pay. East to move up if the right person likes you.
bad,Employes and management are bad and top talent is hard to come by.
bad,"Management is poor. Company policy is vague on attendance and paid vacation days. Policies, rules, and regulations are ambiguous."
bad,"There's no place for advancement, unless you do something disgusting with a manager.  Management really doesn't care about there employees. It's just an easy check for them."
bad,nice people everyday even though had to deal the people yelling and screaming at me if I'm not moving fast enough or on there time doing something for the manager.
bad,worked cash register and stocked shelves periodically. Supervisors were great to work with.
bad,Enjoyed working with the people co-workers. Long days and short days always had different tasks and different people to serve.
bad,"poco compañerismo, una sola ves vi al gerente, no te explicam ,mucho , no les ineteresa tu ritmo. Llegas le das tu codigo te dan tu caja y bolsas"
bad,"Começa com a organização da area que se vai trabalhar cada operador tem uma função a fazer, aprendemos que se cada um contribuir com seus afazeres o trabalho diminui e todos ficam satisfeito."
bad,"If you have any self respect I would advise you to stay the heck away from this place, Its not worth the amount of work you have to do, and the whole time I was here it just made my depression worse then when I was unemployed. Non of the other workers who were store standards didn't bother to help even when I complained to the other managers they didn't even care. I now look at this place as a big giant blue tumor on the face Leduc."
bad,"Worked any hours I was needed including early morning, afternoon, or overnight without question. Management was never helpful or easily accessible when needing to voice concerns or asking for clarification. Oftentimes I found myself being delegated things that had nothing to do with my job code; which I was able to complete on top of the daily duties I was responsible for just for the management team to take credit. Never really felt recognized or justly compensated for the hard work I put in day in and day out."
bad,Operava o caixa e as vezes ajuda em outros setores.Recolhia produtos q clientes largavam no meio da loja.
bad,"Pro;friendly and helpful people to work with."
bad,"You start off by going to a meeting and they assign you a spot in a store to work. Then you begin stocking all merchandise, once finished you move on to the next to help others. My co-workers were excellent, i disliked all my managers with the exception of 1. Their is nothing really enjoyable about this job except the pay is decent."
bad,"I had to quit this job a month into working. Horrible management. Everythings unorganized except the electronics, the coworkers are very lazy, and maintaining a clean workplace seemed to be an issue for some of the workers. Not much to say about this place, I didn't like working here at all."
bad,Typical work day involves working in two departments because of lack of staff. There is very little to no room for advancement for minorities! Managers barely communicate with associates. I love my co-works they get me through the day
bad,"A typical day at work: Grab carts for trash and cardboard, go to my department, find 14 to 18 pallets on average stacked taller than myself to sift through, work what I can, about halfway through the shift, manager lets me know that I have more pallets accross the store in another department that I am to work as well before my shift ends. Somehow, most days I could get most if not all of it done. They expected more out of me because I worked harder, which is understandable, however, my pay never increased for the extra work i was doing, nor was I offered a higher position. Not worth my time. the hardest part of the job was trying to go above and beyond when so much was asked of me. Being a manager for almost for years now, I would never go back to it or ask that much out of one specific employee. I didn't pay attention to most of my coworkers a lot of gossipers that i wanted no part of. Though one or two would help me take my pallets back to storage upon occasion. the most enjoyable part of this job....honestly, was leaving it."
bad,"Do not treat employees with respect.  Failure to acknowledge appreciation for a job well done.  Consistently place goals impossible to meet.  Management is demeaning and constantly belittle employees in an attempt to reduce their feeling of self-worth.  Constantly change schedules, reducing work hours to the point employees do not earn enough to live on.  The constant change in work schedules make it impossible to secure additional employment to supplement income."
bad,"A day working at wal mart is not for the faint at heart. You have a job title/disruption however it will soon feel as if they should have added two or more titles to it. always understaffed, You will never receive a wage suited for the amount of work you do in a giving day. often you'll get that one manager that makes working there enjoyable. i would not try to raise a family with this pay unless both parents are working. With that said Wal mart does have room for climbing the ladder to management. I have heard from some of the manager that I am close to say “it is not that hard of a job, if you want it”. I always say no to it, it’s just not the type of work place for me."
bad,"Wal-Mart, the place that doesn't sleep, and is crazy to work for."
bad,"No job security, they expect as an example, 27 hours of work in 7 hours. That's based on their own computer model/program."
bad,"Walmart does a great job at using their full time hard working staff to their full potential. The harder I worked to get caught up in my own dept, the more depts I quickly became the manager of. Not nearly enough pay.."
bad,"monitor stock levels"
bad,This job is awful. The management doesn't care about you as a person at all. They lie to you and there is 0% chance of promotion unless you are their teachers pet. They change schedules with no notification and then accuse you of not showing up or else you come in then get sent home. You will have to work almost every weekend and only have off 1 major holiday in a calendar year.
bad,It's all about who you know. They try to cross train you & assign you to different departments so your not really one or the other & that way they don't have to pay you higher salaries.
bad,"I have been working for walmart as sales associate for 8 months and the outcome is little pay for doing a managers job. My manager was unable to perform his job to their satisfaction so i was recruited to correct department errors. The people to work with are wonderful, however you kept as a part time associate in order to not be obligated to give you benefits. and work full time hours."
bad,You never see any employee smile because they work you to death. Only get one holiday off which is Chrismas. Management is not very friendly
bad,"I've worked for this company for three years and it's not too great. Favoritism definitely runs this company, its who you know and who you blow. You could bust your tail off and it won't get you no where. Management usually bullies the hard working people and the people who follows the rules instead of the ones they need to coach, write up, terminate, etc.... The only good thing is what little raise you get every year."
bad,"Walmart provided me with a job and benafits. I work as an overnight casheer.duties were costomer service , stocking and cleaning"
bad,"My time with this retail juggernaut was rather sour. First off I was hired as a Overnight Maintenance worker making 8.00 an hour, just to receive a cut to minimum wage (7.25) and demoted to Lot Associate for no apparent reason. My time as a lot associate was monotonous, and it just so happened to be during the worst summer in a decade for eastern North Carolina..they were stingy with water and breaktime and management was horrid, so we were ran ragged, like slaves almost. I'm glad I moved and found better work"
bad,management is terrible its a lot of favoritetism going on in the store they block you from going up in the company and all associates except management are under paid
bad,"A typical day at work would be long hours that are hard to stay up with, frustration of not wanting to get up late and work, You don't really learn anything but to stock freight, the management doesn't really care only when there need your best efforts or when you brown, suck up to them, the hardest part of the the job is getting up late at night, working all night for five days, then getting you day off but spend 90% off your day off sleeping because you work into your day off, when they laid me and 10-15 other workers they didn't give us 2 weeks they gave us a 3 day notice and the work environment is horrible, the people are rude, vulgar and lazy, the only enjoyable part of the job is the discount card and a 25% off for working on black Friday. This id a horrible job i wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they absolutely needed a job"
bad,"I learned that working for Walmart was a big mistake for me. Out of all the years that I worked in retail and as a Cashier, their management team was viewed as a joke to me because they let the store get so far behind in areas of stocking departments and cleaning  in certain departments. Maybe things are different now as it has been two years since I worked there. But, many female workers in the back stock warehouse would not button a single button on their shirts to attract male employees. The conversation in the air was despicable! Unfair treatment was witnessed by myself and other co-workers from supervisors toward co-workers. Their use of words to get things done for them were as if they were talking to a child of theirs. "
bad,"The work day is the same routine day in and day out for the most part. I learned store and department layout. How build modules,end caps and display pods. How to display and market products. Auditing and inventory. Process damages and claims. Management varies from store to store. I have noticed at each store I've worked at is that some managers care about the people working under them and others only care about themselves and looking good for the home office and home office only cares about money. They do not care about the people that work for the company. The hardest part of the job is working under the stress that is put upon you."
bad,the work is easy and enjoyable but the management wont help you out and will only show cons.
bad,"At the branch I worked at, the management was unfriendly, pushy and very critical of overnight workers. The policy included a time management protocol that impossible to complete. The job description included more tasks than the wages were worth."
bad,"The summary and Cons say it all, the managers only care about their employees when it can benefit them. Quick to hire new employees, that they know and cut the ones that actually work hard. It's walmart do we expect any less than corporate bias and red tape?"
bad,"To much micro management, only hold certin people accountable"
bad,i love the customers. the customers kept me wanting to work.
bad,"Management is awful, no respect for workers. Day consisted of breaking down pallets, pulling in trucks and stocking product."
bad,Long  hard work for little pay. Too many responsibilities for 1 associate. No recognition from management. Management too worried about pay and staying under part time hours then the woirk they want employees to do
bad,"A typical day at work just includes scanning your employee badge to see what activities needs to be completed by you by the end of the day."
bad,"Work overload, don't get paid enough for what you do."
bad,A typical day of work consisted of overly angry unsatisfied customers  just looking for assistance and knowledgeable associates willing to help. In finding this on every shift I quickly did my best to become informed in all departments to provide excellent customer service. in seeing the problems I informed my superiors that seemed not to care in the slightest so I then chose to seek management it the hopes to make a difference. once i succeeded in doing so i encountered a company that had a lack of care and communication with expectations that were to high for the resources provided and a lack of compensation to be able to preform all of the tasks assigned. However I did enjoy being able to provide customer service to as many as people that I could so that there day could go just a bit better they always left smiling.
bad,"a day at work is walking in to 3 to 4 pallets 7 feet tall and I was the only one to work them to make sure product was out to the floor. by the time I would get one meat wall filled the other one would be in shambles. I learned to give 100% of myself to my job because customers come first. I learned how to do different areas of the store from hba, fashion, housewares, hardlines, to the fresh area. I made a lot of friends with me co workers and we worked together to get the job done. yet no one would help in the meat dept. the hardest part of the job was trying to balance out enough time to get everything done. most enjoyable part was helping customers"
bad,"While I made some good friends here, management was poor, work expected of you was absolutely mental, and you were treated poorly. Pay was decent for the area I lived in, but I wouldn't suggest this employer unless it truly is a last resort."
bad,didn't like working there it was the worst job ever. I didn't like it at all the people working there are not nice. management doesn't care.
bad,Some of the managers were great to work with but most could be difficult to be around.
bad,Management not communicating with one another made things harder and more stressful than they needed be. But the customers and co-workers made work enjoyable.
bad,"Work is repetitive- can vary depending on the amount of customers that shop. Weekends are insane, while mondays and tuesdays are calm."
bad,Underpaid overworked understaffed                                   management*  security*** compensation*
bad,": A typical day at work could be better than it has."
bad,"I work overnight, it is a good company to work for but there are not a lot of advancement opportunities. I am looking for a career not just a job"
bad,This job was a learning experience. It was very hard on your body with all of the physical work you had to do.
bad,"My typical day at work would begin with giving associates breaks that work first shift, sorting out clothing and assessing how badly my assigned area needed attention. I would then plan out how to make the area more presentable and allot times for certain tasks (giving lunch breaks, taking breaks myself, etc.) On certain shifts, I would be required to pull items from the backroom to replenish shelf stock on the sales floor. Also, I would be asked to cover the jewelry department with no training for the position (I ended up teaching myself by watching co-workers) and was never compensated for wage differences. On occasion, I would unload trucks and sort merchandise boxes in the stockroom. The most valuable skill I learned was customer service while working here. The management staff at my workplace were very rude, unapproachable, nonchalant, unreasonable and oblivious. I have overheard management staff making fun of associates, and have witnessed them sitting in the management office playing solitaire when they were purposely ignoring the staff that needed their help. My co-workers were like family to me and I still talk to them regularly. The most enjoyable part of the job would be befriending my co-workers and satisfying the customers I helped. The hardest part of my job was advancement. I spoke to my manager on several occasions about possibly getting an interview for higher positions and was told I would get the position, then a few days later they had hired a new associate for the position. They would not promote current employees."
bad,"WalMart does not have enough employees to do all the work necessary and does not allow people to work overtime to get their work done. I learned how to zone, how to set a mod, how to use their handheld computer, how to do inventory. My co-workers were mostly nice. The hardest part of the job was working so hard all your shift and feeling like you had accomplished nothing. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers and customers...helping others.  We worked together, some of us, to accomplish tasks."
bad,"Enjoyed the type of work, filled all prescription from all Wal-Mart Phamacies in the state of Texas, management was less than effective, the hardest part of the job was dealing with pharmacists with low work ethics and poor production, most enjoyable part of the job was being the number one producer, pharmacist of the quarter, and working with pharmacy technicians"
bad,retail experience was great. walmart was ok company to work for
bad,clock in then find out which register your assigned to. check out customers and help them with any problems they have had while in the store. we change registers after every break and lunch
bad,"I come in, to unload trucks, our station is supposed to be set up every day, they rarely have it. We have to spend half an hour to get ready, then get yelled at for not starting when we get there. Our management doesn't seem to care for us, or the problems we have. Everyone they hire is now temp, no job security what so ever. The only pros is I have a Wal Mart discount and an hour lunch."
bad,"Management sucks, pay sucks hours suck.  No choice needed a job to pay the bills"
bad,Uma das piores empresas que trabalhei salario ruim gestao horrivel  aprendizado zero udo ruim
bad,"A typical day at work: unload trucks and organizer freight"
bad,"Getting told by 9 supervisors a day you are not working as a team fast enough, got jerked around with my hours to avoid being given full time benefits. It was ran like a sweatshop in the backroom had to work and fast. I learned some customer service skills as well as you are never appreciated for the work you do in big chain stores. Management only ever saw the manager once, in a year of working there. But they always had way too many supervisors. My co-workers were fine to get along with no one to ever complain about. The hardest part of the job was making sure the work you were assigned for the day was done, they overload you and expect you to do 60% of it then complain when you don't do all 100% of it. The most enjoyable part of the job was it's good for entry level grunt work and getting customer service experience."
bad,they care more about the product then employees they replace like a light bulb  they need to listen to what employees have to say instead of jumping to conclusions
bad,"standing,  haevy lifting, bending, suggested of sales, cashier, restock products, worked where ever needed,"
bad,"A typical work day would insist of getting a few task that should be completed by the end of the day such as empty pallets, clear off rolling racks, zone departments and tell the people in my area what needs to be done for the night shift. I learned how to manage and area and time control.What I learned about management was they will be one way in your face and another behind your back. My Co workers for the most part did what they were suppose to do and things moved smoothly. The hardest part about this job was knowing who's instructions to follow. The most enjoyable part about my job was when I got to take a look at my finished product."
bad,"I feel theres to many managers on hand  with no real team effort, also no preparation  as far as maintenance dept is corncerned. not as structured  as i imagined it would be."
bad,"It is a good place to work if you are going off to school, or if you do not wish to go into management. You learn a tremendous amount of different skills. Main skills that are utilized daily are stocking, customer service, inventory, merchandising, and much more. The one major retractor is that management needs some major work. After going to school for business management you realize many flaws in the management styles being implemented. Unfortunately they will not listen to suggestions or advice on dealing with certain situations. Also the company is not family oriented as it once was. Every year I worked Thanksgiving and Black Friday, 18-20 consecutive hours."
bad,Work at 4pm Unload truck until about 8pm. 9pm start taking merchandise to the floor until 11pm. Use tell-zone to scan merchandise to stock low count items on the shelves.
bad,"Wal-Mart has lost its culture which was the one thing that made it a great place to work. Now the company is guided by what ever they determine can mitigate the company against lawsuites. They focus entirely on the bottom line under the guise of ""helping people live better"", while demanding extra ordinary efforts from their management, with little or no appreciation."
bad,I worked there for 2 years and busted my butt for them and was a very hard worker. In the end they fired me because of missing work because of pregnancy complications. They have a few good managers but most are lazy and show favoritism.
bad,I enjoyed being a cashier and meeting new people. Loved working in the layaway department. Was a fun and laid back environment.
bad,"This walmart can not be compared to any walmart I have ever been to. I feel the managers are very unprofessional, loud, and boisterous. They need to have an undercover boss attend the store and fire and rehire managers."
bad,"I was one of three employees, one of which was pulled frequently to different departments while the other barely did anything at all, in a department which needed at least four employees. We were worked to exhaustion, and although some of us were pulled to different departments, no one was pulled for us, and the managers never bothered to try to get more employees for our department. Finally, after almost two and a half years of working there, I was fired for using ""threatening language"" toward my supervisor (basically I lost my temper and cursed at him). Despite information from my former coworkers that the department I worked in is basically falling apart without my help, I wouldn't come back if they asked me to. Even if means getting my job back, I would probably get less respect and have to work even harder than before."
bad,"lack of responsibility, most negative happenings get passed from the top down and cashiers and stockers are easily replaceable there"
bad,the hardest part of my day seeming I was usually the one closing the bakery was getting out of there on time I would usually stay to get my job done but everyone else would leave by 4 pm and about 5pm is when it picks up and I would have 7 hrs of work to do plus wait on lots of customers and they always changed the rules on how they wanted things done and they didn't communicate among themselves if you told your direct supervisor something it most likely wouldn't go to the person that needed to hear it
bad,"I was 19 years old at the time it was just a temporary job, It was a good place to work."
bad,I already knew how to be a cashier. I was manager for 3 years in another store
bad,"A typical day of work consist of coming in and staying outside most of the day. A lot of walking required. Management at times aren't always on the same page. The store is very unorganized with employees having to fight/hide the tools needed to the job most of the time. Unless you work yourself into a higher paid position often times you are overlooked."
bad,I didn't feel like this company really took care for the employees.
bad,Walmart pay and benefits are awesome but they treat their employees like they dont matter they dont want you to have a life outside  of walmart...im never going back
bad,"Considering I was attending college while working at Wal-mart, the steady work hours and flexible scheduling was a huge benefit to working there. Unfortunately however, the amount of work allocated to the understaffed departments, along with poor management, poorly maintained equipment, group evaluations and a yearly scheduled raise made it a highly undesirable job for me. It is near to impossible to get overtime, let alone move up in the chain of command at the store and because they cycle through dozens of employees every month, it was hard to stay motivated while working there. Worst of all, they would force you to stay past your scheduled hours, force you to leave early or take an extended lunch to compensate for your extra hours and threaten you with termination if you receive overtime."
bad,"At one time Walmart was an excellant place to shop and work, but it changed drastically and not for the good. The morale in one store, the one I worked at is very poor,working conditions are horrible and working relationship with management is at an all time low"
bad,"I enjoyed my co workers at walmart. I learned from them daily. Management at this store is non supportive, not present, and very little involvement with associates."
bad,Assisting customers is great and the people that are employed there are wonderful. I have been given opportunities to learn more and given an opportunity to advance but not provided time to take the test necessary to pursue the advancement.
bad,"Uma rede varejista como as outras:"
bad,"A typical day in claims is perfect lots of work. I learned how to distinguish between hazardous and non hazardous. The management some were nice to work with and some were just plan old rude always had a bad day and everything mad them mad."
bad,"Working at Walmart has its up and downs. Dealing with customers was always a highlight. Most co-workers made the job fun and enjoyable. Hardest part was dealing with management and the way they dealt with employees and policies. As a Customer Service Manager I was responsible for, but not limited to, accounting money, inventory management, customer service, compliance with policy, and associate management."
bad,"poor management, low pay poor benefits hard workers for what they get paid"
bad,"On a typical do of work I completed cash, check, credit card and WIC transactions. Bagged purchased merchandise. Greeted customers, and answered customer’s questions. Assisted with safety and sanitary maintenance of store. Management wasn't around when need, they were very unreliable. Unpredictable work schedule, it would change without notice. Co-workers were alright but not the friendliest bunch. Wasn't hard, and wasn't much to enjoy."
bad,"It's Walmart. It was my first job getting paid to wrench on cars, so it taught me the basics of working on automobiles, dealing with customers, and working quickly."
bad,"A typical day at work involves being verbally and emotionally abused by customers and fellow co workers. You're pulled away from your primary task to do other employees' jobs and you are then held accountable for not completing your primary tasks that same day. Advancement requires playing ""Game of Thrones"" type politics. Hardest part of the job is not letting your frustrations get the better of you. Most enjoyable part of the job is clocking out each day."
bad,"A typical day at work consist of helping customers with their shopping needs. I run into all types of customers, fun and not so fun. I've learned patience with this job, it takes a lot of patience and self control to work here. I enjoy working with my co-workers, we are a team and we look out for each other. The hardest part of the job is feeling unappreciated. The most enjoyable part is just getting to see all different types of people, and seeing what they like and sometimes getting to talk with them."
bad,Empresa no momentto sendo conduzida pro pessoas totalmente perdidas com relação a continuidade de programas vencedores no Nordeste o que mancha a imagem de uma empresa sólida como o Bompreço.
bad,"I have worked at 3 Walmart stores and I can say that only one of them is worth while, which is the Shawnessy Walmart in Calgary. Every other store gave me ridiculous hours, barely scraping above minimum wage, and the employees seemed spiteful of everyone around them."
bad,"The people I work with are honestly nice however, the management places rules and regulations and they want us to abide by them but when we follow the rules and a customer wants to speak to a manager they override us anyway so technically they do not abide by the rules. It is stressful to be a customer service representative because half of the time the customers are very rude and expect us to know everything."
bad,A typical day would be clocking in and checking to see what register you might be at which could include working at the self-checkout. I learned that you need to have a good attitude and a good job value to keep the customers coming back to the store. It seems as if Management was really never around whenever you needed to talk to them about any type of situation. The hardest part of the job would be  dealing with upset customers and the most enjoyable part would be seeing the customers and helping them have a great shopping experience.
bad,"I have worked with them for a little over 3 months as a Cart pusher they work you to death with such little pay with working in snow,rain,wind, very cold, an very high heat. they really don't care if you are about to about to pass out from heat they will force you to go out. they let the cart pushed for a full 8 hour day work by themselfs with no one else on the lot so if the store is busy you might as well just leave cause you wont get any help. benefits you have to wait a long time to even get them hell 3 months you just get the discount card that is just 10% off of your total cost. "
bad,"Physically demanding job, with an extensive training program behind the scenes. Given a high level of responsibility and independence. Fast paced atmosphere with strong demands."
bad,"I enjoyed working with a variety of people, but overall there was never any respect given to associates. Seemed everyday before work we were threatened about our jobs. They don't schedule enough people to do the amount of work needed then you get in trouble for not doing a perfect job. The new store manager completely ruined the morale and friendliness of almost every aspect of the job. Everyone came so disposable since then and it's nothing but constant negativity. Some amazing hard working people work there and don't get any respect they deserve. It's really sad. But that is just one store...not all Walmarts are like that. It's a good company...just one bad store when it comes to morale and how people are treated."
bad,"My thing is this I was a top notch worker,did my job effieciently and effectively but it felt like I wasn't,Honestly I felt a big sense of racism,Certain races their act like they can't speak which is very rude and can't even humble themselves to say thanks from time to time,way too many attitudes for a place like that!! Reality check needed for many it's only a job, not the most important thing in life!!"
bad,wouldn't refer anyone to walmart. no good benefits and no good holidays off. walmart is a good place to work if you are in a higher position.
bad,I worked there for a short time and it is terrible. They say that you will be on a certain shift then change it sporattically with no warnings.
bad,"Zoning the areas to make sure the areas are stock and neat, I learned to make sure the store is presentable for the customers. I work well with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is standing and walking all day. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting the customers."
bad,"always busy"
bad,mangement dont go buy policy not to happy for the time i was employed there 
bad,"Where do I start? "
bad,"I check dates and make sure the produce on the floor was fresh for purchase. I would get rid of this produce then begin to fill the floor with new product. I check all produce as I'm putting it out to make sure it is good. I help fellow associates put out fresh produce. I help put produce away and clean up after finishing work."
bad,"They let the customers lie on you and talk to you any kind of way. They also have managers that speak to you like they're your parent. Management could really use some customer/employee relationship improvement. Also, even with a full-time postition open, they wouldn't give it to me, but kept working me full-time hours as a part-time employee."
bad,"rude customers, would have to work in other departmants rather you were expierenced in that department or not"
bad,What I did not like the job working at Walmart is some managers and associates were disrespectful to other associates and customers. There was no insurance for part time employees. Hours and pay were being cut. I like working with some associates that had respect and I was glad I was able to help all the customers when they needed help when others would not help them. 
bad,"the management when i worked there has been replaced but when i was there certain managers knew nothing of leading or time management, they would send whole departments at a time without even thinking of the customers to go unload the truck. the same certain managers gave little to no respect towards any of the employees or really assist in helping any of the customers, my supervisor earned my respect and my comradery because he encompassed all to what a leader could be in my opinion he transferred to another walmart though, "
bad,"My main gripe is with the management who is narrow minded, and has no care about their employees or their well being."
bad,"Trabajé por 9 años como  Asociado y Líder de Departamento. Me gustaba mucho la libertad en temporadas de montaje y mercadeo y que están abiertos a ideas de mejorar. Sin embargo, cada vez la responsabilidad era mayor, el balance de vida/ trabajo era cada vez peor y la presión era más, los sueldos son muy bajos comparados con otras cadenas aún para Líderes y las posibilidades de aumentos eran aún menos. De promociones ni hablamos, a menos que seas ""amiguita"" del gerente o subgerente, lo sé yo estuve ahí. La empresa se guia por valores muy nobles, que por desgracia pocas veces se cumplen y las represalias están a la orden del día. Muchas ocasiones no me dejaban salir si no tenía la autorización del gerente, aún cuando llevara más de 12 horas laborando y si te ibas por que tenías una urgencia, al dia siguiente te sentaban en el banquillo de los acusados y te ""asesoraban"" (algo así como una amonestación). Las dobles y triples jornadas eran casi de rutina. No hay la mínima preocupación por la salud o bienestar personal y familiar del empleado. Muchas veces entraba a las 7 a.m., salía a las 10 p.m., me bañaba, comía y a regresarme de 11:30 p.m. para salir a las 11 o 12 del dia siguiente. Llegué a tener 12 departamentos a mi cargo, sin tomar en cuenta subdepartamentos y sin ver un solo peso extra por la carga de trabajo. Los subgerentes hacen pagar a los asociados por sus problemas personales y sus frustraciones. Ah! y pese a ser la empresa minorista que más vende, no dan utilidades a sus trabajadores."
bad,"A regular day was clock in, go sit in the break room for daily meeting. Get a hand held computer, go to the backroom and start picking items out of the Inventory. Break. Go back and pick more items until lunch break. You get an hour lunch break. Come back after the stockers have worked their merchandise, and bin the items back in the system until work the next day. I learned how to work and inventory I've learned how to stock. Use pallet jacks. How to help customers while still doing my job."
bad,We do to much as an employee in one day to get paid what we do. Walmart makes too much money.
bad,"There are no typical days at Wal-Mart. Other then you can expect to be talked down to on a daily basis, either by management or customers.  I learned how to use most systems in store on my own, as there is no real personal training involved. The only training one receives indirectly (via computer based education) is how to use the cash register, and greet customers. "
bad,"My typical day as a CSM involves me answering many questions for the customers and the employees under me including cashiers, service desk associates, and cart pushers. When I'm not answering questions I am doing whatever it takes to keep the front end of the store running smoothly, which may involve, but is not limited to, stocking merchandise, directing customers to open lines, keeping the front end clean and doing any of the jobs of the associates under me."
bad,The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with the customers and having the ability to purchase things I need for home before I leave my job. The hardest part of my job was dealing with management. Every manager had a different approach for how they handled a similar situation and it was annoying to me. My co-workers and I worked well together. 
bad,"horrible place to work . manag,ent was the worst . pay was horrable "
bad,"Go in  and lead a few guys through unloading the GM truck(s). Once done with that we would have to go to the grocery truck which had someone to do it but was constantly not doing his work picking up a broom and sweeping in the middle of working on the truck. Leaving and not coming back for 20-30 minutes with no consequences. On the other hand if we didn't get there truck done in the time given to us by management we were talked to about productivity. From there we would stage the pallets throughout the sales floor for the overnight stocking crew to put on the shelves. From there my small team of unloaders would move onto picking merchandise that didn't come in on the truck that night but was still needed to fill the shelves.  We had a few overnight pickers that would help us 1-2 every night but for the most part me and my crew did all the GM picks which range from 800-4,000 every night in three hours or less. Management had there favorites and it wasn't hard to tell some of the employees even had there phone numbers and text messaged with them during hours they were at work which is not appropriate. My team of guys were great they listened to me did what i asked without making me take them to the office to speak to managers never talked back to me or questioned me. Some were lazy but it was a physically demanding job so they didn't last very long. The best part of my job would be going into work each day and working with my team of unloaders. They were such nice people they made it easy for me to do my job and make sure they were doing there job. Easy to talk, to easy to get"
bad,the most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers. I once worked 2 weeks straight without management knowing.
bad,Management is no good the need a total overhaul of the El Dorado walmart
bad,"Everyday at work was the same, put away the returns, ""zone"" the shelves. Learned that whenever there are complications in the workplace to let them be known immediately. The hardest part of the job was when they put me in other sections of the store to complete other employee's jobs when I know nothing about those departments. Another hard part was being faught over by two managerts. I was a cashier but never recieved cashier salary,The customers were the most enjoyable part. Customers would tell me how nice and helpful I was and they would even make a point to address me by name."
bad,I have enjoyed my time working at Wal-Mart because I've met so many amazing people. I don't have any major issues with the job but since there is not a set schedule it's hard to always find child care. The only other problem is the pay isn't that great to provide for a family. 
bad,"A typical day at Wal-Mart is clocking in and going to the part of the store that you work in. You will have good customers and bad customers, that is with every business. I learned how to work a cash register, as this was my first job, and I learned how to work the customer service desk. The people above me were okay, when I first started they were all nice but after awhile, they started to show their true colors. I liked most of my coworkers;I am usually reserved but I could go to a fellow cashier and talk and joke around, I never had a problem with them. The hardest part of working here is that you have to have work whatever hours they give you, as there is no set schedule if you are an hourly worker.Also, the pay is very low, but since I do not have any bills, the paycheck is just fine to me."
bad,"las unicas personas que importan en la empresa, son las que no ponen ningun ""pero"" unicamente se valora el esfuerzo cuando es para bien de la empresa "
bad,"My jobs was working in the garden shop with the different flowers for the summer and fruit trees for the winter, i also worked at the register. I learned so much about the flowers and how to take care of the flowers and the yard. Management was ok at times. The  hardest part of my job was working in the heat. I enjoyed working with my co-worker they were team player!"
bad,"Walmart's reputation is widespread by now.  They pay you as little as they deem fair, work you for more hours than your contract says, have ridiculous sick day policy, and often change your schedule unannounced."
bad,"I was a cashier. Self-expanatory. "
bad,"Cashiering was the position that I held with this company. Part of being a cashier at a store location is being fast and proficient because there's a lot of customer overturn and there can be a lot of volume of customers. During my employment, I was up-selling a lot of company products and services such as credit card applications, payments, and product warranties."
bad,dont work here unless you have to and even then think hard on it
bad,they expect you to do ever thing. coworkers were ok to work with.
bad,"you punch a time clock, go to work deal with primarily awful customers, (you tend to get a few really nice ones on occasion) go to lunch and then go back to work then finally go home."
bad,"It's walmart. You know what you're getting into when you accept a job. Hours that aren't guaranteed, low pay, being overworked, terrible benefits, no advancement at all."
bad,It is a very friendly place to work. Many ways to connect with customers but management was very harmful towards my work days. Many times I was accused of rediculous accusations and at one point was accused of things that the manager refused to approve that caused me to quit. Co-workers were the best to work with. Great friends who I treated as family. As well as customers. These were the reasons I loved going to work everyday.
bad,"WalMart Distro was a very rough work environment. Safety was lacking. The pay is outstanding, but the goals are fairly unrealistic."
bad,A typical work day involved being looked down upon when asking questions on ones second job. I learned little during this specific work experience. The management appreciated high school social values over hard work and intelligence. Wal-Mart co-workers were mostly supportive and nice to be around.
bad,I put up fresh produce throughout the day and made sure the area stayed clean.
bad,"Worked at Wal-Mart for over 6 years. Benefits are pretty good, if you can obtain full time status. Store I worked at was way more about themselves than they were about being family oriented. Moral store wide was way down when I left and has been for nearly 3 years now. Used to be a great company to work for, but my views have changed. They want way more than maximum work done with very minimal crew."
bad,its a okay job if you need something asap but its hard to get full time been there for 2 and half years never got fulltime but they gave it to someone who had been there less then me and have people play favorites
bad,trabalhei como repositor de mercearia e quimicos
bad,"There was no way to advance in this store, everything was based on favouritism"
bad,As a cartpusher they treated you like nothing and you did the hardest job in the workplace but got the least pay
bad,Ehh will never work there again. Same things different days.
bad,"I learned a lot about dealing with difficult, angry, and sensitive customers and associates. Communication skills are key. You must know how to communicate passively. If you appear to be too assertive, you come off as being mean and rude. Some of my co-workers, the adults, were fun to work with. I enjoyed mentoring, training, and teaching some of the younger ones. The Management staff at Wal-mart only cared about and did what made them look good. They really don't care about the associates or the customers. The hardest part of the job was being yelled at and practically degraded without being able to respond. The most enjoyable part of the job was that every day was a learning experience."
bad,"My everyday task were to first check if there were any expired products, second always clean my station, then distribute products to customers to be sold."
bad,"I worked for walmart for two months. I was fired for sitting in the office while in training. They waited till I was out of training for a month to fire me. The funny thing is, my training was on the computer. Which required me to sit in the office. After being fired I went into overseas protection. They put out a warrent on me for stealing over $10,000 worth of items. I am currently in a law suit with them. Little did they know I was in germany when they said I was in the store stealing."
bad,"If you are seeking a part time job for supplemental income, Walmart is the place, however, the pay is minimal."
bad,"I have worked at Walmart for 5 years. When I first started I had high hopes of becoming a manager. I consider myself to be a good employee and a hard worker. I rarely call out of work, I always show up 10-15 minutes early, and I always go above and beyond for customers. However, I have yet to be promoted. It seems like the only people who get promotions are the ones who are already managers and then they just get name changes. (ei manger/supervisor). You do get a paid vacation and the offer 401k and insurance."
bad,"I feel that I am challenged everyday to meet the needs of my department, Health and Beauty. A typical day is bringing out my carts of freight needed to be worked from the truck to the salesfloor, stocking the freight and zone my department as I work. I throw away my cardboard garbage in the compactor and go home."
bad,Meet lots of new people. The associate are always happy and ready to help. organized and respectful
bad,"As a member of maintenence I had to pull my weight as well as the others that would not work We had one man that would spend 6 hours cleaning 4 restrooms a job that should have taken only 3 hours tops.I talked to management about it and was told ""thats the Walmart way some people will not work hard and others have to make up the difference"""
bad,"No matter where you work in this company, your speed is very important. I enjoyed working here but was disappointed that I could not transfer to a different work position considering my weight lifting restrictions upon becoming pregnant. I was never in a set area where I stocked. I often ended up with the more complex area that had the tallest and fullest pallets and not enough space to stock them in the department. That was the most challenging part was to complete the numerous of overstocked pallets alone while others had extra employee help. Most of the co-workers were helpful to me when they could and refused to allow me to pull or lift very heavy boxes or pallets. The managers however did not assist me with restrictions except for one manager who was relocated/promoted out of state. I learned how to create product displays and that was the most enjoyable part of my job."
bad,I was on track for a promotion by one Co-Manager until she was promoted to run her own store. Shortly after the management change their were several under qualified employees promoted and morale dropped greatly
bad,The management for this company varies because some are really nice and work with you but others are entirely rude and useless.
bad,"What can I say? It's Walmart. My experience was horrible, with terrible management, unbalanced workloads, at minimum wage. The conditions were so bad, it was not so very uncommon to see even managers break down and completely lose it. They use promises of job advancement to keep you, but even the higher-level positions are just not worth it."
bad,"I worked from 10pm to 7pm i didnt mind working over nights but i rarely got off at 7am. They would always have me help another co-work finish stocking there department, which didn't bother me into i relized i wasn' getting paid for over time."
bad,"Wal-Mart was ok as a part time job. I worked nights. Unloading trucks , checking the inventory and putting it in the system. I used the fork lift and scissor lift. If I was needed I would help take the merchandise out to the floor and help stock. There were not many on the night shift."
bad,"not a safe and productive work place, management is horrible"
bad,overworked and underpaid. part time has too many hours some weeks and not enough on others. management is amazing and co-workers are fun.
bad,"cutting meat (trimming clogs) 5 differnrent ways, liked my co workers, didn't know my supervisior, but i liked working there"
bad,enteracted with customers on a daily basis was very rewarding
bad,Co workers are great to work with. When you go to work no matter what area your in they are understaffed. Management cares only for them selfs. Best part of the day is going home. HR is the best management there is here.
bad,Keeping to yourself.
bad,customer service cashier cart pushing fun coworkers management vary poor didn't listen to employees at all treats them like dogs i learned how to multitask with everything and become a cashier at that time also a better one my favorite time was seeing the customers vary happy and satisfied with and how i helped them with what there looking for.
bad,i learned that the management team there cares nothing for their employees and will hang you to dry if they need to cover themselves.
bad,Walmart is a cattle call. They do not take care of the customers and most employees clock in with the full intension of doing as little as possible. Management is like the old high school click that if your not in you are not giong to be.
bad,"At work it was confusing, figuring out what was expected of you for the day because the people over me were not on the same page so I was being misguided on multiple occassions. I learned a lot about myself, for example I've always considered myself a patient person but working there I found that there is more to my patience than I thought. My co-workers were amazing. We worked well together & made the best of things. Though, I would have to say that the hardest part of the job was pleasing the management. It would've been easier if they all expected the same thing from us. But the most enjoyable part of my experience was meeting all the new people. To this day, I could go in & shop & customers still ask ne where to find an item!"
bad,lo que mas me gusto es el ambiente que se hace con los compañeros es una empresa muy negrera ya que tienes hora de salida pero no de entrada los gerentes jamas reconocen tu trabajo y a veces ni sales a comer
bad,with walmart teach good customer service but lack in pay another good place for students trying to better their life and keep pocket change not for no bill and no other excitement
bad,"I learned alot about retail. I also worked with large amounts of money. However the down side to Walmart was didnt matter if you or your children were sick with a doctors note, if you had to miss it still counted against you. I have 2 children so if they both get sick at different times and I have to miss they dont care. And thats how I ended up getting terminated from them. I might have had my 3rd coaching due to absences and what put me over was my son having a temp of 104. Sorry my family comes first. Walmart is no longer a place to work at if you have a family."
bad,"I was told I was a full time employee yet only worked 20 hrs a week. I was not able to get a certain schedule. They had me going in at different times every day I worked. Pay was alright, you did 30 mins of training. Then left you to spend your time finding out what to do. If you have kids, or are going to school. This company isn't going to work with you on hours."
bad,The job pays the bills. Or most of them. Everyone's experience is different. Loved the people I worked WITH. The people I worked for? Not so much.
bad,"Provided excellent carryout service for customers, answered customers’ inquires regarding product location, and responsible for retrieval of equipment."
bad,"Managers would make things personal with their employees. If they didn't like you, they made sure to let you know quickly. The first store I worked at was awesome, then next one was great but the last store was just hell. I enjoyed the work at the other 2 stores but the last one literally almost killed me. As long as you work at a store that the management is true management it is a great place to work. I would go back to work there just not the last store I worked at."
bad,Management needs to make more sound decisions based on actual performance and not just waht looks good on paper.
bad,"When I was first hired I was under the impression that I would be there temporarily for three months, which was fine with me. I would work to get a second job within that three months and so on. As far as I can tell the management and staff at the new Wal-Mart are very nice, the only problem is that there is not enough of them, and customers coming into that store barely ever see them (except at the check out). During my two weeks there I was trained, but I did feel as if the training were adequate. To be fair they have a lot on their plate, and on talking to some people I was told not to worry about certain things (such as cash training), and to just focus on the basics (stocking shelves, making sure department is presentable, and providing good customer service). During the second week I was let go; I was informed that I was only needed up until Christmas Eve. I have no problem with being seasonal, but as I mentioned before I was to be there for three months--not two weeks!"
bad,"Long days, alot to do and not enough time. Walmart was always short handed and could never seem to keep help."
bad,I really loved what I was doing. The hardest part of the job was no professional supervisor.
bad,"The Job Was Basicly Come To Work, They Don't Care About Your Personal Issues Etc"
bad,The current company that I wwork for is very misleading. I feel that this company should be able to provide a higher pay and that there should be better benefits offered.
bad,"I pushed carts,stocked shelves,unloaded the trucks,some janitorial inside and outside store. Walmart is an alright company if they didn't have so many many managers for just one store."
bad,overworked= underpayed
bad,Came in whenever they felt like putting you in. Did not care if you have children or go to school.
bad,"The management of the branch does'nt seem to remember what ""respect for the individual"" for which Sam Walton founded the company on mean anymore. They seem to have lost it into there own translation forgetting about the individual."
bad,Management is terrible have no clue what they are doing no communication between co workers
bad,Wal Mart being such a big corporation I feel they have lost sight of what Sam Walton started out the business as. All my team members I enjoyed working with and would help out when and where ever I was needed.
bad,The Job was somtimes dangerous and you would only get minimum wage. Unloading a Large truck on a conveyor Belt onto skids can be painful on the lower back if you dont lift right.
bad,"Typical day would be to get out on the sales floor and start putting up merchandise if needed. Also, returning items to their right full place. Cleaning the department and assisting customers."
bad,"service automobiles, repair and replace tires. uneducated management and coworkers"
bad,Wal-mart's managment is rude and has no previous experience in training people. They will work you as much as possible with little pay.
bad,They make you work 6-7 days in a row and make sure to split it into two different work weeks to avoid paying you overtime. The management seems like they are better than you and don't give much positive feedback on a job well done.
bad,"unload truck one (palletize all merchandise, clean truck, clear off conveyor line) then first 15 min break, unload truck two as well as freezer truck and remix truck (already palletized merchandise), then lunch break, return to backroom and pull all new freight to sales floor (palletized and loose freight), or stock new merchandise if required, then second 15 minute break, return to backroom and clean (sweep floor, stack empty pallets, empty cardboard baler or make cardboard bale, pull old merchandise from steel bins, make plastic bale if necessary), stock merchandise if necessary. end of day"
bad,"The position is very easy. But, you have many, many bosses. You have career associates that are not in management positions that believe they are bosses. So, it is constant chaos. The pay is very low and the amount of head games it too high. If you have a college degree do not accept a low paying job here. Apply for a Manager in Training position so you can jump right to Asst Manager in a store. Otherwise, you are stuck in a low paying job for 6 months. After 6 months you can transfer to another position or to another store."
bad,Don't mind my job too much
bad,they are very selfish they don't try to work with you jus a horrible experience for me. i learned that walmart is not for me
bad,"Management was okay just constantly reminded me to keep a look out for opening in other departments. Co worker were okay. I learned to operate the buffer and do floor detail. Most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and being able to help the customers, unloading shipment as they came in and stocking products where they belong. The hardest part of the job is growth within the company, and receiving a decent raises."
bad,"Honest work. Love working hard with some good people. Just feel undervalued and underpaid. Sometimes its a zoo, which feels like it will never end. Have to wait forever for benefits."
bad,- Run the register and help push carts
bad,I enjoyed working there i learned a lot of different aspects of the job
bad,They are not fair to their employees when they are having family problems. Some management don't care about their employees would rather just get rid of them for no reason because they can.
bad,I went to management school for walmart and I was taught to respect the individual. The store I worked at in Greenville treated people like they were nobody. My co-workers were great to work with if one of use could not finish something that was dew that day we would all pitch in and help each other. I was also a department manager to. and learned all about the hand held telezion. It not only was used for ordering but for stocking things in the back room when the shelves were full. I liked very much going to other stores and helping to get ready for inventory and doing remodels and new store set ups.
bad,The store I work for has changed alot from what it use to be. It use to be a company/store that use to care for it's associates and now it seems to be more of a personal gain than helping one another out. There are some people in the company that believe more in the people than the money and help one another but as I said before it has changed from what it you to be.
bad,Walmart was a very fast paced environment. Training was very limited once I was hired.Management was not available when needed. The co-workers didn't seem very concerned about guest service. The hardest part was observing poor customer service from Leadership and employees. Bonuses was the most enjoyable part of the job.
bad,Horrible management they showed no respect and treat you unhumanily.
bad,I had no choice but to work there i had troule finding another job. If i had a choice i will have never work there in the first place
bad,Hard to be happy due to lack of employees and lack of training.
bad,"I loved this job but I didn't like the management! The coworkers were great but it was hard having no money after all the double shifts! I had a child on the way so, needed higher pay!!! I enjoyed the people I worked with!"
bad,A typical day for me would be to come in process freight and then continue to stock freight. I would also pick and bin in the back room. And make sure the store is clean and presentable for customers at all times.
bad,Walmart could really be a great place to work if they didn't have their favorites they move up
bad,• Provided excellent customer service
bad,Walmart is a very unfair place to work. I got fired for not telling anyone I went to lunch. So that should tell you alot.
bad,Being that i was in my first years of college it was great. I came in before work left for school came back after school and still had time to have a life and for homework.
bad,Very labor intensive Not very much support from management when asked.
bad,I loved working with the public and getting to know them personally.
bad,I love helping my customers. And enjoy working with some of my co workers. Wal mart don't treat their employees right.
bad,"Looking at how I rated this company, there really isn't much else I can say about it except I was more than anxious to leave the company once I had the opportunity to do so. They are not consistent in how they treat their employees, and their customer service is far below any other company I have ever done business with."
bad,"Loading, unloading trailers, labeling, building pallets and replenishing shelves."
bad,"I worked at the Deli and enjoyed meeting customers and interacting with other employees. The hardest part of my job was during rush hour, making sure we served everyone timely and to their satisfaction. The most enjoyable part was making the food and interacting with the customers."
bad,The work was fun. But there is a constant fear of being let go. I watched many very good workers being let go for no apparent reason.
bad,"When I began at Walmart I enjoyed my job interacting with customers and learning new job duties. I became a manager quickly and it was fun at first, i was able to relate with the customers and employees. I needed more income so I went overnights to earn $2 more. I enjoyed it because I was able to train the employees to work effectively in the time we had allotted. With the economy, I was down a few employees but of course required to get the same amount of work done. With the great employees and my direction we were able to perform miracles."
bad,They don't promote.They do not reward their best workers with decent enough raises.My biggest gripe about this company are the layers of management. Its typical to have a kid with a college degree waltzing around and obviously green behind the ears with no prior experience. This clashes with the lower positions of people that have a ton of experience and have no degree. Working at Walmart is a good job if you just got out of high school but I wouldn't recommend trying to make a career of it. Use this company as a stepping stone.
bad,A typical day at the particular Walmart I worked at was stressful. The lack of support from team members and leaders really took its toll on my every day duties.
bad,"stocking product, rotating product, clean , help customers"
bad,"As soon as you clock in it's straight to the register, it was a very repetitive job and it wasn't what I wanted anymore. I needed a change, so that is why I went to school to become a pharmacy technician."
bad,I worked 3rd shift and worked independently had to process 48 or more bags and have to finish by 7:00 am
bad,This Jobs core values in which it was built on is not what it should be. The typical work was not equal to the pay.
bad,No input allowed from staff. We were not able to make positive changes even when the situation warrented it.
bad,The managers are terrible to the workers. The workers are normally rude to the customers.
bad,"Walmart is by far the worst place i have ever worked at, The employees are diverse, some are nice and will be your friend others are flat rude and make you feel miserable. The Reputation of walmart between its customers are totally different. people enjoy shopping there because its cheap. People Hate working there because the pay is barely enough to pay bills and get gas, not including the cost of food. Some management is nice but you have some that are power hungry and will make your life miserable if you dont kiss up to them."
bad,To much favoritism with some employees and not given the opurtunity for advancement.
bad,"A typical day for me is great, I love the job I do."
bad,stocked and replenished shelves with merchandise
bad,"Ambiente um pouco pertubado para trabalhar, os colegas não se ajudam é cada um por si, direção e gerencia boa."
bad,"Long hours standing, walking on hard floors, pay is not enough, very under staffed. If they paid more, maybe people would not quit as often. On the plus everyone there was nice and easy to get along with. Some managers nicer then others. Little chance for a raise."
bad,A typical retail store with typical retail store good and bad
bad,I have worked for walmart on several different occasions my previous stores we're much better with its associates. The co workers were fine to work with but the management needs to learn to treat their associates better.
bad,poor management. too many responsibilities. good co-workers. dealing with customers is hard sometimes.
bad,The managers and higher ups are biased and completely offput by anyone with their own ideas. There were threats on mine and others' jobs every day by the superiors.
bad,I normaly walk into a mess when I first go to work. We are short staffed and still exspected to do the work of 10 people. But on the other hand I love the people I work with. Working has taught me a lot. How to deal with people and all the health codes.... not that Wal-Mart fallows them.
bad,"The work load was variable. Some nights were busy than others mainly during the weekend, major holidays,and during bad weather. Enjoyed working with many of the employees. Several managers were great to work with but on the other hand some were unrealistic & plain out mean. I learned how to be patient & to pace myself to get a job done.The hardest part of this job was sometimes working by myself wore me out. Trying to do 8-10 live pallets was a lot for just one person."
bad,"The associates that work there are fun to work with and enjoy taking care of their customers. Management has expectations that are unattainable and are willing to terminate associates rather than train and correct issues. At the management level there is no work life balance, you are on call all the time, you are lucky if you get a lunch break that last more that 15 minutes, and when you are off they contact you daily about issues in your areas or associates instead of waiting until your next scheduled day."
bad,Nothing special. Could be better for employees. Management lacks responsibility and help.
bad,didnt not want to offer insurance so they cut my hours and did not notice all the hard work i put in and never gave me rasies
bad,TIpo produção.
bad,was not a good company to work for and wouldnt recommend anyone to work for them
bad,"A typical day of work with my current employer involves teamwork, the ability to stay focused on a task, the ability to multitask and have great communication skills. Working for Wal-Mart, the largest retailer in the world, I have learned to take responsibility for my own actions. The management at my current employer has many responsibilities. I will admit it was hard to trust individuals and many policies were never followed through. The hardest part of the job is not having the sufficient support to complete the daily tasks given that are given to an individual. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with amazing people. Every day there are always those special people whether it is a customer or a co-worker that makes your job worth working. I am also a big believer in a greener more sustainable future and admire Wal-marts efforts but feel discouraged to do the lack of teamwork and focus on that particular aspect of the company."
bad,stocking and cleaning salesfloor from beginning to end. learned how to maximize space. Management very lazy and rude. some co workers willing to help in difficult situations. Hardest part was trying to get so much merchandise with limited room. Most enjoyable part seeing new product.
bad,Sold food and learned how a food business runs. Management was horrible and the co-workers were not friendly.
bad,They have just got to big and have for got about the people who work for them. I never even knew who my manager was
bad,This company use to be such a great company until they became to big of a compnay. It became how little can they give. The company has went way down hill since the new CEO took over.
bad,Management makes bad choices and cuts hours when not needed.
bad,"Stocking, Merchandising and Featuring. I learned the inventory management technique for the retail business. Management was normal. Hardest part of the job is meeting challenges. Team work was the best part of the job."
bad,"A typical day working for Wal-mart is you have to put 110% effort into your area, then you have to go do other areas, even if your work is not done. At any given time a manager will come tell you to do something else, in spite of other managers. The only enjoyable part is when it is slow and you can take your time making sure your area is good without managers swarming around."
bad,"Depending on your management, advancement is nearly impossible. High turnover rate of managers. Great place to get exposure to truly international systems and cultures. There are several people that want to help you succeed although it is ultimately up to management."
bad,Worked new and old frieght
bad,Helping people find what they are looking for
bad,"It doesn't matter how hard you work it's who hyou know in order to move up. the more you kiss up, the better things are for you. You can be the hardest working person in the store but unless you kiss up, you aren't going anywhere. And don't be sick or have kids that get sick. These are unexcusable abscences. There is NO EXCUSE for missing work at walmart. (Even laying in bed with 103 fever or sitting in the hospital with a sick child.) The most enjoyable part of that job for me was the day the terminated me."
bad,Busy place that was understaffed. Not much interaction with the management. Job was very tiring.
bad,"Horrible work place. No security, horrible pay for so much work."
bad,I enjoyed my time with this company it was however not for me. Some people love it.
bad,"Working as a Employee for Walmart really was not fun.. it was a job yes, but wasnt pleasurable.. no. Management thought 'they were better then everyone else' didn't care about their employees at all. very strict about everything for paying their employees NOTHING. They say they give discounts for employees? That discount is nothing..."
bad,i did enjoy at least having a job but was not satisfied working for this company. I did how ever learn to organize at a fast paced and multi task between helping customers and finishing my task for the day.
bad,"I was termed an inventory control specialist. I handled the unloading of merchandise and delivering them to their appropriate departments to be stocked. I also managed the backroom inventory, and salesfloor inventory when necessary. Coworkers were lazy and uneducated. There was limited communication between supervisors and management personnel creating many issues. Many decisions regarding individual employees were made by district management that have not even met the employees whose jobs depend on them. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers and seeing that the store function in an organized manner."
bad,"A typical day being in wireless sales, was more of a detective job to see who was a scam artist and who was legitimately buying a phone. Keeping inventory of phones was the easiest part of the job and was important to see what phones were being discontinued or just arriving. We also had to record each phone that was sold to see our net profits the company would be receiving for the phones. Writing out a contract was the hardest if you were a first time customer because of all the information we needed in order to run a complete credit check. The biggest problem I had with this company is that I was not allowed to take time off when my daughter was born."
bad,Walmart can be a fun place to work but you have to be prepared to work hard and as a team member
bad,"Well when I get to work we have a meeting and the after we start work. I work in the back of the store where we we keep are inventory at. An we pick the product out of the bins so that we can old product out and new product in, we do that from 10pm to 2am. after that we go to lunch then we bin the overstock from the sales floor. An then after that we go home. at 7am"
bad,I loved my co workers. The managers make the job suck. They don't work just sit in the office especially when the head manager is not there. Where he is there he does the same thing. I liked the customers.
bad,It was a job. There isn't a whole lot to tell about Wal-Mart. I think everyone who has shopped there knows the way that they operate and how they treat there customers as well as there employees.
bad,"a typical work day was going in and unloading truck. i learned how to stack pallets and unload trucks, my managers were not the best. my co-workers were ok to work with. nothing to hard about the job, and i never enjoyed any part about the job"
bad,"Walmart have the worst management a company could have. They hire, fire and lose associates everyday. They treat their associates like bad. Although there are some good in some of them management is still horrible. I like my job to an certain extent but I have been here for a year and just recently started having problems because a lot of associates have left. Since I have been working for Walmart I have been working full-time hours but yet I am still considered part-time. I am just through with this company and I would rather continue being a customer."
bad,"Wal-Mart is only as good as the management working at the store you are in. The work is hard. Sexism is prevalent. The best employees are not rewarded/acknowledged for their hard work, at least not where in Lebanon, MO."
bad,I learned that people need to treat others like human beings. Don't think that just because I work as a cashier I am used to be treated badly.
bad,I loved the customers. The managment team show favortism. It is hard to move up with in the company. I was there all together around 10 years and expressed interest in becoming upper management.
bad,Not a good Management team. The co-workers are good. the hardest part of the job is the Management.
bad,"interacting with the employees, greeting them at the door when the come to work, walking around talking to people giving them feedback on whether they are working safe or unsafe, cross training in other areas."
bad,"Being a cashier at a Walmart seems easy, but the customer is always trying to save a penny. So is the company. Meeting different people was the best part of the job. The worst part would be how they only give benefits to full time employees and they hire people part time with 39 hours scheduled."
bad,"The truly enjoyable part of working at Wal-Mart are my fellow co-workers, they make the shift go by fast. I truly wish Management would get better at listening to the associates."
bad,"values off course, favoritism through the roof; do not look at peoples work after shift ends..they wait til morning. workers are often told one thing about their job assignments by one person, and another from another person whom resides over them. they do not enforce the need of workers upfront(some workers)& some workers throughout the rest of the store to take the correct amount of time for lunches and breaks and no more; when workers are swamped and their coworkers in their dept either called in or didnt show, they do not offer help. when front end has alot of people who call in to work; they do not fire them or hire people who will go in and work the days their schedualed unless a emergency prevents it. managers only see one side to a situation or conflict that arrives and if workers do not get their work done and explain why its not managers write them up or give them verbal write ups when they do not send people to look at workers work before or after shift ends. they'd rather look at work after done one day the next days morning like at 6am-7am for second shifters. managers and higher up workers think that even pregnant women should be able to do their job the pace the mngrs do; even if a pregnant woman has a complication pregnancy, and if a complication pregnancy woman does not get their job done; they get wrote up. i learned how to zone, how to use a gemeni, how to get items from the back to put them on shelves. i learned how to get pallets and work them; i learned how to re-set an isle with new items and or switch shelves, pegs & items. coworkers were sometimes nice"
bad,Walmart could care more for there associates and they dont. They never recognize the hard work you do for them but they can point of the negitative.
bad,"disorganized management, unappreciative, terrible work conditions"
bad,Typical day was sorting and stocking the shelves with products and changing out the displays. Part of managment was great to work with and some of my co workers were a joy to work and be around.The hardwst part was when no one wanted to help pull pallets and at times could weight up to 200 plus pounds.
bad,"Bosses that won't listen, production rates that are almost unreachable, benefits that are horrible."
bad,"The managers never talked to me. they assigned one job, then come back 10 minuets later to give another job. very unorganized"
bad,No room for advancement only if your friends with someone of a higher position.
bad,that was the only thing i did not like about the company and they did not want to pay me basic on my experience.
bad,Walmart has ok Benefits. I'm sure the benefits are better for the office workers. The photo Lab is the best Department to work in. To bad the labs are disappearing. Fewer pictures are being printed.
bad,"This workplace is reaonable with schedules, but offers very few hours. It is a good start for individuals trying to achieve work experience. Appreciative customers that are friendly."
bad,"Walmart is an ok work enviroment, but far form great. Work hours are strenuous at best, and very with a open schedule. Benefits get worse every year as the health insurance goes up every year and what is covered under it gets dropped. Even if you are happy with the company many of the jobs for advancement in the store have been cut."
bad,"My view of Walmart is negative. They had promised me full time, and then laid me off. Even though my job duties and review was positive. My friend and former coworker was rehired back after a layoff, then laid off again a week later. Walmart also is a drama environment. There is much negative talk among employees and managers."
bad,"On the whole, they have a grt yrly bonus, which all staff share in, if the store had a grt income over all for the yr. benefits after 3 months."
bad,at this site advancement only came with telling them what they want to hear there was no regard for many company policy's. favoritism was practiced daily i loved my job just unable to fulfill my job duties to the company's standards
bad,"I know this is one of the biggest companies handing out jobs, but they do not treat their employees as valuable team members or with an ounce of respect. The management have no backbone and hen push comes to shove, its you they throw under the bus to save their own jobs. You almost never get recognition for any hard work done, but they will get right on repremanding you for a customer complaint weather you are in the wrong or not. Cowards."
bad,"It wasn't bad, but I didn't like the people I worked with, they were rude and snotty. My manager didn't seem to care about the department i worked in. He seemed very uninterested in what I needed as an employee. You don't get a raise for a year, and they pay you based on your experience. They start you out at a low rate, and you must be there for 6+ months to start getting benefits"
bad,"Working at Walmart has provided me experience in customer service, as well as understanding of the dynamics of retail apparel. Walmart has also provided me with the ability to handle different situations that accure in the work place."
bad,It was mostly a gossip place. Management judge you at this walmart.
bad,walmart had good employees to work with although i felt the work we were doing deserved more pay
bad,"Although this was a fun environment to work in, the management did not make the day any easier. If a customer wanted to speak to a member of management, or an employee needed a member of management it took way to long for them to respond."
bad,my review on this job is if they hire the right managers maybe their employees will wanna stay longer
bad,"Restructuring always occurring.  You never know when or if your job will be eliminated.  No work life balance. They dont accept doctor excuses, so if  you have the flu, or other medical issue, you are still required to work."
bad,Will cut your hours drastically. Talk behind your back.True story. Don't have hours for you but will hire more people. At first its Great place then they change.
bad,You make good money but it’s not worth the headachet you have to deal with. i hated working at Walmart although the pay is good nobody cares about you
bad,Some people are very passive-aggressive and the company is kind of self-absorbed. I recommend not be a cashier at this location because the later time CSMs take forever when you page them for a problem at your register.
bad,"I wouldn't want my enemy to work their if they pay me 20.00 an hour. They have cut everyone hours back,you work less you don't get your full 40hours at all."
bad,"Didnt work there very long , but the time i was there i didnt get to many hours. When you need help the csm where pretty good at coming over to help. Cashiering there can be a bit hard when you have to stand in one spot for hours other than that its fairly easy."
bad,I do not recommend working here. Management does not treat employees the way they shoulf be treated. If anything happens in your personal life they do not help accommodate you or care to help you.
bad,"They don't really ""train"". They have computer based learning, which doesn't really show what you need to know. Management is not there for you. The coaching system is not helpful. I have customers that I adore, and most customers are friendly. Very toxic work environment."
bad,I liked working with the people I worked with but management makes it a difficult place to work. They change their minds a lot and you don't know which one to follow. They don't always tell you the changes. They don't take DOCTORS EXCUSES. You really need to know this in flu season.
bad,"The store that I worked at, was very cliquey. If you weren't part of that certain group, you were nothing.  The work was extremely difficult, and I was rarely given help!  "
bad,I worked for Walmart before they did the major pay increase. As for the time I was there. Managers would post a schedule and then change it with out notifying you they did.
bad,"The management needs improvement with being understanding about working around school. Also, Training new employees needs to be better so employees are able to succeed and not fail."
bad,I started as a cashier because it was the only open position. Which i was paid very well for my first job i quickly ran out of hours and often had to fight for them
bad,"Walmart culture in general is awful and anxiety inducing."
bad,It's a good place to work. Face paced environment. As long as you do your job to the best of your ability you will enjoy it there. Do your job get your pay and go home.  Never forget the customer is who you show up for. They are the only thing that is important.
bad,It became a very toxic environment.  They give you a 1/2 hour lunch period but you do not have time to take it. The company expects you to stay on your feet for 8 hours. Technicians hours are not given to accomplish the work required.
bad,"Work hard and fast! Don't be late or call off. They policy changes to fit the managers moods or whoever is in charge that day! The safety practices are not observed by any of management, so do what they say not what they do."
bad,"When I started, there were enough people to do the work and expectations could be met.  After a few years, part time turned into full time hours with little raise in pay and still not classified as full time so no benefits.  Worked hard to get everything done but wrecked my body in the process."
bad,The company is spiraling downhill. Upper management sticks together so any ethical issues do not get resolved therefore it seems very corrupt. Alot of broken promise made every day.
bad,"Management does not care about employees, unorganized, equipment is not maintained. Not a good company to work for."
bad,"Hard work everyday loading and unloading trucks and learned and earned my certification for powered industrial equipment. Management was helpful and had our backs,it was a good atmosphere to work with fellow workers and around wonderful customers.The holidays had to be the very toughest part because of the earlier hours and just the hussle,but the extra bonus hours and discounts to buy gifts for family was the most enjoyable thing about Walmart."
bad,"Through my experience at Walmart, I’ve realized I’m only a number to the company. All employees are just a number. I’ve seen coworkers be fired for their vehicle simply breaking down. I’ve seen associates have medical emergencies then be required to be at work the next day, or face consequences. Walmart will crush you."
bad,This would be a great first job for someone. The hours are flexible however management is hard to deal with and there are a lot of broken promises that are made.
bad,"Supervisors do not respect employees, its up to department managers to do so, they are rude, only give certain people weekends off, you have to fight to get just one day of the weekend off! They give you a raise, but cut you down tremendously on hours, they expect perfect stocking, and answering phones always available for customer naturally understanding, thats what your there for, but then get yelled at for everthing else not being completely finished, they dont help!"
bad,"Walmart treats their associates the way they treat their customers. Interpret that as you will. You are overworked and undervalued until you want to leave, then they want you to stay. There are so many good people there, but so many bad people too. Barely get any time with my family, or to sleep. They work you nonstop if you are salary. If you are considering a salaried position at Walmart,  say goodbye to time with your kids or spouse. If you are married or have kids, RUN!"
bad,Management doesn't care and just keeps assigning unreachable goals. So much favoritism it's ridiculous. They claim  flexibility but it's jumping through hoops to get it.
bad,They dont train you then expect you to know how to do everything by your self its always either overstaffed or understaffed which just shows how the area manager just throws random numbers in the schedule and doesnt care. always out of stuff managers doesnt know how to order stuff correctly. dont get days off until youre like a year in and you get points against you even if youre sick or in the hospital. like i said they just dont care at all
bad,"Walmart is a nice and steady pace work space I loved working there it’s a lot of smiles when I came to work they help you out when you need it and everybody is really encouraging,they work with you with hours"
bad,"The staff is kind and cares about other peoples."
bad,"The management at Walmart was by far the worst part about the job. There were multiple occasions where the managers expected me to go above and beyond of a task that had nothing to do with my skill set, or anything to do with my department. The managers at Walmart usually never remained calm in intense situations, and they would also lash out on the employees for minor things."
bad,"Work life was simple, Interacting with other employees was great. I never had any issues with customers. Management was good now not so much had some  issues with the new management due to lack of communication and scheduling of hours."
bad,"Walmart was a good job, however it’s always about who you know in a small town. So I advise you be prepared when going to work for Walmart in Marianna. Most of the management don’t know how to talk to you a don a"
bad,it is ok woring for Walmart. I was overnights and I liked it due to less customers being n the store. I did like the maintenance crew. hours weren't bad either.
bad,"Store went from ~400 employees to ~160 employees in about a half year, no reduction at that time in sales volume, lost a beloved store manager of 20-ish years and his upper management team (this happened shortly before I was hired).  Management went from friendly and supportive to fear-and-punishment based, not because they were monsters but because they were desperate.  In less than two years, I worked under two store managers, two co-managers (third was starting the week I was terminated), and eight assistant managers in my direct reporting chain (none for the last month or so of employment).  "
bad,The company makes cuts to the staff that end up causing management to scream and yell at the employees to go faster faster faster. You're held accountable for others mistakes or laziness. Management plays favorites and rewards brown nosing with promotions.
bad,They start off giving you good hrs then cut you down and then fire people and expect you do twice the work. The management doesn't encourage you like they should and it bunch of gossip and not being on the same page.
bad,"it had good insurance (kaiser for medical and delta for dental) and benefit, like 401k and Walmart stock. too much work for low wage. most of employees needed knee surgery after 3 yrs working."
bad,trabajava de noche. por un poco tienpo.me ofrecieron hotro trabajo...i pues entregue mi trabao.
bad,Good people sometimes work with your schedule sometimes agree with the schedule have  to keep talking to them about your schedule good company good benefits nice management
bad,"Como todas as Empresa tem muitos pontos de melhoria."
bad,Working with walmart is a challenge for anyone. Some people fully embrace their time there. It was an experience i am grateful for but realized retail is not for me.
bad,Most of the managers at Walmart talk to you like they are better than you. They treat you unfairly. It seems like the people that slack off dont get in any trouble when a hard worker does over little things.
bad,"Employees are not happy with their job but stay 5, 10, 15, or more years. The stranger you are the more likely you are to become a dept manager. Which has great benefits. Unmedicated bipolar? Your walmart material. Customers are never a problem."
bad,"Your experience working for Wal-Mart will vary depending on the management and workers at your store. Managers are constantly hired and moved around, and there's a high turnover rate for the entire store. Different positions offer different amounts of hour flexibility, and benefits vary based on whether you are part time or full time."
bad,Work days can be hard because associates work ethic and morale are low. Only certain associates are praised for the work they do. We only get paid minimum wage which isn't enough considering the things we go through with managers fellow associates and customers
bad,"Walmart is an average job . Easy to get hired ,however you do not get overtime, no holiday pay , and the managers doesn't care about you . It feels like working as a slave at this place."
bad,Poor management and leadership skills always sabbatical strategy used against employees and lies.when they should have stood and told the truth as far as customers concern they didn't very bad attitude disrespected
bad,I learned to be speedy. The good part of my job was to see happy associates and customers. It is not fun when everyone wanted to bicker. I had to learn to ignore some things.
bad,"Amazing team, great fast pace job for someone with a can do attitude. Easy job, hard work. Management single handedly destroyed the team. Impossible expectations with a time based schedule that's set up for failure. Management is unwilling to hear their teams advice."
bad,"To many people filling the position that are not real managers or don't care.  I had several people listen to what I had to say and said that they understood and would act on the information, then nothing happened."
bad,i often worked many jobs i learned how to build shelves and more i helped prepare the store for grand opening but one thing is don't get sick you will be pointed
bad,I hate to review a place that has changed so much in the last few years. They no longer appreciate their employees. They only want part time employees so they don't have to pay benefits. No incentive to work there.
bad,Very stressful during the day to day job and limited break times the hardest part was whenever an associate get assigned to a multi tasks with no with no help.
bad,Picking groceries and other merchandise for on line customers and staging them to be dispensed to customers as they come to store to pick them up. Some management of this particular store are not responsible with their job. First place I have worked where management doesn't make sure employees have enough tools to do their jobs. There really isn't an enjoyable part of this job.
bad,Working with little to no supervision.  Could not get help because no one was around to help.  Just didn't feel comfortable working there.  Always felt like I was doing something wrong.
bad,"productive . "
bad,Not a clear sense of direction. Kind of on your own and not included. Never got any direction from a manager it's all up to you to figure it out. Nice long lunch break though.
bad,"The management at the store I was working at was horrible. You needed a day off for something important, you either have to request it months in advice or hound them about it."
bad,"At Walmart the customer is right and you the employees are wrong. It is as corporate as you can get, so its not a good company to work for. They will use you up and spit you out they don't care about employee's lives or rights."
bad,Some positions they work you to death and don't give you required breaks..can be ran all over the store doing tasks in several areas..lawn and garden have to deal with flowers soils mulch etc regular frieght holiday frieght which can be fall Halloween and Christmas all at once and running a register
bad,Ok place to work. Most employees there do not care and are there just for a pay check. Managements is always changing the policies and prcedures. And they do not really train you its sink or swim
bad,Literally treated like a cog in a machine that can be thrown out at any time. Almost felt like my ideas or even my health mattered for that matter to management. speaking of management... It's literally a joke. You wonder why so many speak so ill of this place when you have managers that literally laugh in your face when you have an issue. Or threaten to walk you out the door because you were not completing tasks up to their immediate standards (Although under staffed). Complete joke of a job and i'd rather make minimum wage for the rest of my life than go back here.
bad,"They do not work well as a team. When someone tries to stand up and set the rules in place and set place balance, older employees and managers don't like it very well. If they make up part of the supervisor team they really don't take your opinion to heart. I also believe that there should be something set forth for employees when they are out sick. They know if you really are sick or not."
bad,"Walmart has a lot of problems with managers and employee work ethic. The culture that surrounds Walmart creates a cycle of people not thinking highly of it so they bring minimal effort which then makes it crappier to work there and thus persists the fact that it really does suck to work there. Especially if you have a strong work ethic because you are left feeling abused, underappreciated, and the pay just isn't good enough."
bad,Overworked and underpaid worked forced to do computer modules but ne:er hsd time or computers to do them or got hslfwzy thru and cslled you bsck do you were leff half  done. Then
bad,"Overall my stay at Walmart was productive. It allowed me to travel to Alaska and the Asia. In return, Walmart benefited from me pushing their darn credit cards to customer who didn’t care about them."
bad,"Opportunity to advance, yes.  Many Walmart employees only have a high school education. This offers great opportunity to those who work hard and can work whenever needed. Downside is that some employees are lacking in skills and also social skills. Walmart is very politically correct.... to a flaw. Store level management cannot make decisions with regard to discrimination issues. Corporate gets involved. Time-consuming, tedious, and often involves many interrogation sessions. .PPay is low to begin."
bad,"Working at Walmart was absolutely soul-crushing. The amount of coworkers I knew that cried on their breaks or simply walked out to never return. Managers were nasty and condescending, very little room to grow. It was an extremely emotionally demanding, unrewarding job."
bad,"Pay was not as good as I expected, but the hours and schedule were pretty good. Management was not good at all, constantly changing and then had people who were just out of orientation."
bad,"The culture of the building and the business has changed so much to worse ppl don't respect each other's manager talk to you like a child and your older than them, don't get me wrong that was a point of time that I used to love to go to work with be there an hour early just sitting came in for overtime in a heartbeat.  don't get me wrong at first I did not know what a PTL was because I used to always come to work after so many years in different buildings this last building was just a big stress people could do whatever they wanted to in this building and get away with it it was just not the same place anymore fun I did not know"
bad,I understand Walmart is a great employer to some people though I did not like my experience while working there. I had a good manager but there were too many other managers that were not the best which made the experience less than good.
bad,"WALL MART IN GREELEY ON 49TH AVE is absolutely abominable. The management is terrible, the aisles are never stocked, the shrink manager is beyond a hypocrite, and you get no respect for your school schedule."
bad,while pay is good how your treated as an employee is bad. your expected to do 50 things at once by yourself. and if you cant get something done you are yelled at.
bad,"There is lack of training, most days you feel like you are being fed to the wolves. You go to management for help they advise you to see a co-worker. I love the customers, and helping them find items. There isn't a consistent process, every couple months there are changes being made. The benefits were great, seems the company cares less about their workers. You work every holiday, and vacation time isn't always approved."
bad,Working at Walmart wasn't ever that great. The management there doesn't usually have the best interest in some of the employees it feels like and if your a student it really hard to take some of the days off that you might need off. The hours aren't terrible if your young and don't mind working all afternoon and night but with some of the people that worked there it seemed like myself and a couple other employees were always there 2 or 3 hours after we were supposed to be doen.
bad,"They don't care about employees. Hiring wage only goes up for new hires. 2% ANNUAL wage increase across the board. As a front end employee there's no set schedule or hours! And very little help from upper management, at least at Greenbelt while I was there.. "
bad,A trash company to work for it's not worth the 11 dollars an hour.! The management is horrible they think they're badge and walkie talkies makes them super powerful and they treat the employees like they're not humans too. Don't let the first impression of them fool you.
bad,"Overwhelming demands upon managers at every level.  No job security.  New personnel positions are overwhelmed, doing the job of 2 people.  Hours being cut and micromanaged.  Overall just not a great place to work anymore."
bad,Work here if you don’t care about communication and if you want to be a slave. They don’t care about their employees the pay is great but overall company benefits is there is always a catch to everything including bonuses or incentives. The communication between yourself and the employees are not great either. All they care about is the work loads gettin in and out. Managers play the roles all the time. It’s either your going to work or your going to get harassed about your numbers and accountability falls on you for everything.
bad,"You as a SM, are always looking over your shoulder because their is someone always trying to knock you down. Some associates will stand up for you but their is always a group don't like you because you are holding them responsible for their job."
bad,Needs better leadership needs better time management also needs to care about the common workers rather than the amount of money that it can make at one time
bad,"I believe Walmart can afford to pay there Cashier more money per hour because they take the most abuse from the customers and they are the ones that get the lowest pay and bonus. I also believe that each end of the store self check outside should have phones so they can page for prices checks, or a employee to a certain department."
bad,The job itself could be very stressful. The customers could be very disrespectful. The managers NEVER provided me the support I needed. The were not understanding nor did they care that I had anxiety. The job was just an overall mess.
bad,management hands off mostly. customer service number one. stresses customer service and clean working areas. well stocked and supplied. usually well staffed
bad,Hardest part standing on feet for long time.  I learned that I should return the item in right location after looking at.  Enjoyable part meeting different type of personality.
bad,"was an okay job, management is nice. Had a hard time balancing an actual schedule as they always changed it on me. Also had issues with other employees stealing ."
bad,"Its an average workplace, but it doesnt fit my need and i feel there is no room to move up in the company so i would rather look elsewhere and find the career for my life."
bad,"Deben mejorar varios aspectos internos, el personal es toxico y generar malas practicas en las tiendas, ademas de escatimar mucho en gastos esto genera ineficiencia operativa y genera dificultades ademas de generar como consecuencia mucha rotación de personal"
bad,You will be used and abused by management. You will not be taken seriously when you need help. You will not be respected as an individual. You will be talked about behind your back.
bad,"Work place it okay. Pay not that good because their strict on hours, and make sure you’re no where near overtime. If you’re looking for excellent pay don’t look this way unless you’re in a management position."
bad,"This company has gone down hill rapidly as far as employees go, they have gotten so big they forgot that the employees make or break a company, so sad used to be a great and fun place to work, now not so much."
bad,"they were very flexible with me as far as hours and schedule are concerned.The one issue I would raise is the lack of action once products have been stolen from the store,(policy is written as to not confront customers)  this has happened several times because customers know they cant be confronted once they leave the store,,  Overall I would recommend them to anyone looking for employment.."
bad,"I learned a lot from being a cashier. Dealing with customers questions, and helping them with their items were my main tasks. I also had to have knowledge of simple accounting."
bad,"Working for Walmart was one of the worst experience in my entire life.. the pay was not good, the schedule was day night day night, the managers were there to make you fail.. 10/10 would not recommend"
bad,"I had this as a part time job as a cashier , pretty okay , laid back , only real con is the management was not well organized and constantly made mistakes"
bad,"For me the Issue at Wal-Mart is there Culture/Management! Wal-Mart definitely has that sense of ""Where to big to fail"" mindset!They are sneaky people!"
bad,"Customers treat you poorly and higher ups don't support you. Pay was decent, but it was clear that Walmart doesn't care about its employees. The stress is not worth it. The point system makes it too easy to get fired if you get sick. And no they don't care."
bad,I liked what I did at Walmart but the way the business was being ran made me feel uneasy. Had I still worked there when my daughter had brain surgery a short time ago I probably would no longer have a job. Attendance policy is inconsistent
bad,"Decent place to get a paycheck. Terrible music policy. No incentive to work hard. Poor quality workers are treated equal to experienced employees. Management is hit or miss but the GM’s are mostly garbage."
bad,"very busy atmosphere, if you get a good manager your lucky, and if you get a great team your lucky, you have to have good customer service skills especially as a cashier"
bad,Managers do not appreciate employees and will run off new employees. They need to appreciate employees more. The insurance is too high and should have more benefits for employees.
bad,don not work here they treat you horribly. they judge you and mistreat you half of the time and put you down make you feel unworthy. they dont pay eniugh for osomeone to want to sytay here
bad,I love to do mechanic but walmart didn't paid enough for the job and my boss always was against of the instructions of what the computer said for the time of oil cars need it
bad,Managers arent helpful at all as theres litlle to no honesty nor integrity amongst management. Prejudice atmosphere! Staff workers are friendly enough until the hostile environment begins to turn even the best of coworker friends against each other!
bad,"Depending on what Department you work in the managers can and will vary from unprofessional to well rounded workers. My section I worked in had 2 different ASMs and 3 Department mangers  in the 5 months I worked there. The first ASM I had was amazing always helped out when were short staffed or needed help understanding something then he was replaced by another who watched our department struggle day after day. If we needed help he told us he would be right with us then wonder off and we wouldn't see him till the next shift would come in. I was harassed by the first department manager who would grab me if I had an attitude or didn't listen. She was replaced by another that didn't know how to run the department and spread gossip about all the other workers in the department. I left shortly after the 3rd DM was hired because I was taking an unauthorized leave of absence, I was having a baby and they told me I couldn't have 6 unpaid weeks off because it wasn't authorized the day my daughter was born so I called in the day after I told them I quit."
bad,"Lots of favoritism! Stay to yourself and just knock out what you need to do . You’ll end up hurting yourself if you don’t educate yourself on your position because they will have you do more than your suppose to do ,it will eventually lead to being terminated when they see you’ve reached your limit of being over worked !"
bad,"Over worked under paid. Always felt like I had to watch my back. Management never seemed to be great. The pay was awful. Would pull me from my position to help others, then yell at me for getting behind on my work."
bad,Too many managers not enough workers. There's 3 managers telling their employees 3 different things. Huge lack of communication on everyone's part. They don't care about your home life or children. They give 25 cent raises a year. Start their new employees out at $11 an hour. Ive been there for 4 years and made 11.90 an hour
bad,"If they invested in the people and paid better, maybe people would stay longer. The training is not there. Need development in people skills and experience."
bad,I have nothing good to say about how i was treated. Therfore i rather  keep my review to myself thank for asking me but i rather plead the fifth thanks
bad,"I’ve worked in customer service for 10 years or longer. Love talking to customers and making them feel like they’ve known me for years. Working at Walmart have taught me a lot I’ve learned how to work the hold front in working in money center helping people pay bills, cashier, and customer service."
bad,"I was paid fairly well and I loved the benefits, but Walmart has a tendency to hire bums off the street and place them in management positions even though they have zero experience working in retail. They ran our store into the ground."
bad,"I have been working at Walmart for almost a year and five months. Before working at Walmart, I have always looked down upon it for being disgustingly cheap, but now my feelings are even stronger. I started off as cashier for the first nine months. I was getting paid $11.65 an hour to put up with customers trying to lower the prices on items by ripping off barcodes, my managers playing Pokémon Go! on their phones when I need help and unhygienic customers speaking or even being around me. All I have to say is that I got lucky by even getting promoted at seventeen and start getting paid $13 an hour. It was hard and not worth the time nor effort. I say this job is good for high school students and nothing more. If you want to surround yourself by a bunch of failed abortions who take their jobs too seriously and stand in their college debt at age 80, then you do so. I say good luck to you and have fun trying not to get fired since you can only call out of work 4 times every six months."
bad,"typical work day is work fast work hard so you can get done and then go home for at least four maybe five months out of the year your working good hours forty plus hours from like November to February the rest is usually short days not making forty hours a week barely making thirty hours a week, paid every two weeks. for the most of the time I was there I was making about twenty eight to thirty hours a week. they pride themselves and even tell you in the orientation that you are first and the customer second. that I can tell you is not true. pay is high but they get you on the hours so you really don't make money. and the benefits are garbage you either pay everything out of pocket yes they have insurance that has you pay upfront our of pocket and another that has a company spending account for you when you reach the full amount then you pay out of pocket. overall I would rate working there a 4 out of 10 you work 3 off 4 depending on where you work and what department your in. shipping was 4 on 3 off. good place for young kids and college kids. most enjoyable time was leaving for work everyday and going home."
bad,"When I went on breaks, that was the most enjoyable part of this job due to it being an unhealthy work environment. I learned that not every company treats their employees equally."
bad,"While I enjoyed my schedule and the pay, it was not hard to find out that the only thing that mattered was hitting your numbers.  Those who can't are on the slow grind towards many talks and eventual firing."
bad,"No communication between management and employees, overworked and understaffed, under paid, they do provide flexibility in working hours and time off needed for personal for family needs."
bad,"Decent working environment, terrible management, when I asked to meet with my manager she never met with me, got payed the same as cashiers even though I did wat more in my job position."
bad,"not related to my experience and study, but if you just need a part time job along with your studies, you have option for flexible scheduling. so good."
bad,"The only thing that makes this job worth having is the pay. The benefits are below average, rules and systems change so much that you don't have time to acclimate before the next change. Plans from upper management don't seem to be very well thought out. Central dispatch system is a joke."
bad,I like shopping at Walmart but I wouldn’t really work there cause I don’t like how they move you around so much like if I’m a cashier why am I on the floor it just to much be going on
bad,"A typical day at Walmart was you clocked in and walked up front to customer service to see if you could find a CSM and find out what you needed to do. Nine times out of ten they would tell you to check with the other customer host to see if they needed a break, if so give them one and then move on to the next person. The hardest part of the job was if you worked nights you had a very hard time getting someone to give you your breaks. They always let the cashiers go first. There where only two or three CSM's that would check with you to see when you needed a break or had had your break. I guess the most enjoyably part of the job was talking to the customers as you checked their receipts and also seeing friends that would come shopping."
bad,Loved the people I worked with for the most part but lazy associates were kept on permanently after the remodel was over while people who had knowledge and half a brain were let go.
bad,"i didn’t really like working at walmart, felt like people didn’t really care for their job and kinda just did whatever... the pay is also low compared to other stores"
bad,"I don't have the best review for this particular site as my experience there has not been the best. Pay is good, but you are definitely going work for it."
bad,"The company allows management do what they want, in regards to coaching people who work hard even though you do the best you can with what they give u. The CSM, customer, service management, refuse to work with you, when you approach them with a problem."
bad,I enjoyed the job itself  but there was alot of management turnover. There was more mangers than employees sometimes ans each one of them wpuld be trying to male you  do diffrent things
bad,The schedule was flexible considering i was attending school at the time. But most of managers did not help you or sent help for you to complete all tasks for the department. Also they did not pay you fairly. There is no overtime.
bad,Supervisors are hateful they lie to you your work hours are all over the place they don't care about you at all you may work 16 hours one week and 30 hours the next week nothing is consistent you cannot plan on anyting you never get weekend off
bad,"Walmart was great to work at, At first but they prioritize customers over the workers who make the store run the hours takes up your whole day but they have great perks like the even app and paid time off and plenty of health benefits but they forget people are human and can run I'll or get tired or they seem to forget people have kids or other important  matters"
bad,"they do not care about the people that work for them. treat employees unfair. Make people come to work sick if you don't you get points and get fired, do not give wage increases."
bad,"At first, your feet will be sore after a couple of weeks of standing and nonstop working until they let you know when breaks are for overnight fulfillment associates. The management is rough, strict on numbers they get at the night before and we try to beat it the next day after. "
bad,I met some really great people working here. The management sucked. They will try to avoid solving problems or shift the blame onto you. My department manager was passive aggressive in the communication book kept in the department. There was constant conflict between day shift employees who tended to be older in age and the closers who were mostly students. The work place was very hostile. Complaints were not taken seriously. They are crashing and burning now.
bad,"I've been here for a few years and at first, it wasn't bad, but then I moved up and changes were placed for the worse. Other associates were horribly ""cliquey"" as if we are still in high school and if you are friends with management, they will let you get away with many things while other workers are getting weighed down by actually working their hardest. Being disrespected is normal here."
bad,"I worked in the food department most of the time, very hard work Some days were alright, other days weren't. Not a lot of people in that department, which we needed, it was pretty stressful i ended up quitting due to school and them not changing my schedule even though i gave them a 1 month notice that was i going back to school, i even filled up the papers doing so. Don't work there long term if you're planning on doing other things."
bad,I worked for a division of the Home Office in what was supposed to be an office environment.  Too many coversations going on....people shopping on line.....favoritism....butt kissing.  A huge disappointment. Supervisors were ineffectual.
bad,"I would say, walmart was an over all great working experience. Except when a manager is treating new employees they don't approve of unfairly. Other than that it was great"
bad,"It is a very unprofessional environment, and the management team should work harder to listen to their associates when it come to our work environment, and the overall business."
bad,Stressful. Did the same thing everyday. Management always found something to yell at you/ our team even for the most minor things. Always found a way to make something a problem when it was not necessary.
bad,Walmart is an extremely large corporation and I feel sometimes management and home office expects entirely too much out of one person and as an employee I do not feel valued or appreciated.
bad,Walmart was an okay place to work at in the beginning but after a while it is draining and stressful. You eventually realize that Walmart doesn’t care as much for their associates as they say they do
bad,"Its an ok place to work, Hours are ok. Days off are alternated. Fast paced for those who put a lot of effort into their work. Discount is alright and the insurance and bonus afr great."
bad,"I learn to stay to myself and work with the team that wants to work and keep pushing throughout the day. I learn to read numbers as in UPC learning the items, and working nights its peaceful where you really don't have to worry about a lot of things but your job. Its a lot of jealousy at walmart that can get you stressed out."
bad,"Although I enjoyed my duties, management was not supportive and often put the majority of the workload on a handful of workers, while letting the remaining workers to continue unacceptable behaviour.  Also, not a good balance of work/family."
bad,"don't like the environment for the Walmart. manager were always rude and so much work load and never get good response from manager."
bad,I only stayed so long because I can't live without a check. Worked there 3 years and only got a 24 cent raise. Changed so many policies that effect the associates negatively
bad,"At first Walmart was great but the pay is not enough to live off of. They do not advance pay or tittle, or compensate for there employees. There point system is flawed people get sick or have family situations come up. I would not recommend working at Walmart unless they seriously rethink how they treat there help."
bad,Walmart is an ok place to work just need to work on management sometimes they are rude and don’t want to her us out as employees other than that it’s ok
bad,"It was good working at Walmart at first but after about three or six months you get itchy to advance but they don’t give you that option. Pay is bad, not option for a raise. It’s been over a year and still haven’t had my first review. They cut corners in anyway they can and are currently making it even harder to advance your career while working there. I’m a cashier and I used to like my job, I remember going in like it was a good thing. The only good thing about workin for Walmart are the immediate supervisors all the rest of them are pretty bad. I was harassed and it took them a month before I could get a follow up on the situation. Thank you Walmart for caring!"
bad,"It was okay"
bad,Management only cares about the numbers not the employees. They are quick to write up someone over nothing. They do seem to have their favorites whom they allow to do anything. However others are expected to pull the weight and take the blame when things go wrong.
bad,"Day started with management paper work .price changes checking dates on product. ordering stocking shelf meeting with staff."
bad,Tagged items with security tags. Greeted customers. Insuring safety. Directed customer needs.  Checked receipts to ensure low shrink. Alerted management of customer needs as required
bad,Walmart es una empresa buena lo malo de la empresa es que sube a pura gente sin capacidades los jefes incompetentes suben a mas incompetentes hay solo subes si les caes bien si trabajas duro te retienen por que no les conviene subir a un buen trabajador por que si lo suben despues quien les hace el trabajo su cultura deberia ser los que trabajn bien hay que retenerlos para que nos agan el trabajo haci podremos subir a nuestros amigos mientras los demas trabajan sinceramente es una buena empresa pero sus jefes no tienen nada de jefes una no saben nada y solo mandan por mandar
bad,"Upper management was awful..  employees not treated well.  Got demoted because upper management blamed me for his incompetence... 1 week later he got fired and I put my two weeks notice, then Walmart wanted me to stay, told them NO!  Better opportunities are waiting.."
bad,I'm not going to say anything here.  Once they changed attendance rules job sucks.  They have  their favorites  - they don't let you apply your skills - would never keep this job on an ongoing basis.
bad,Good for short term work. Would not recommend for career. Takes a Year full time to get benefits but they're good once you get them. Management is poor.
bad,Management here seems to not know what they're doing at all no communication or any lack of idea what's going on always excessively watching you and never wants to help at all in my role which was cap2 we have in the course of three months for managers quit because store management was just too much stress and not enough pay they tend to stack everything up against you it got so bad that even started asking the part-time people if they wanted the position for basically a dollar more it's just not worth it do yourself a favor and save yourself the headache just say no to the management position
bad,I worked at Walmart for six months as a department manager in ladies apparel. The job itself wasn’t the problem it was no support from upper management. Not to mention a supervisor who nothing about the area itself.
bad,I hate working here the environment is extremely toxic and the managment treats associates like trash...I only still work here because I have a family.
bad,The job was okay but they didn't care about employees life. They would give points just for missing days that were critical to miss. Once you've received the max points they will let you go without warning and nothing to help move on or look forward to.
bad,No doctors excuses accepted.  The only option if your sick is to accumulate points against your attendance or ask for a leave of absence which can be denied.
bad,All that matters these days is numbers and not patient care and safety. Co workers create a hostile work environment. I have learned a lot for a pharmacy technician
bad,"Will not give full time employees 40 hours , you're lucky if you get 35."
bad,"Walmart is a bad place to work. Bad management ,they walk around and tell someone else to tell you what to do. They don't help out when busy. They have department managers doing other departments jobs because they don't schedule enough people."
bad,"Working at walmart taught me to be patient, and worked on my customer skills. I did not like working there I felt they did not want u to advance in the job title u would like instead they try and make u go to other parts of the store"
bad,The managers are rude the pay is horrible and the hours are unreasonable they don’t care about their employees and the staff are mean and sneaky. I didn’t like working with Walmart
bad,As a asst manager your pride and pleasure in your job comes from your store manager. If he/she is a poor SM you will be miserable. Wal-Mart as a company has potential to be so much greater. The freight that is forced on stores in addition to the operational expectations from managers is practically impossible to achieve within the guidelines and expectations of the company. I plan to leave ASAP. I am only there to support my family
bad,"I was coached 2 times in the 14 years there and was never informed that anything I did until I walked into being coached with no prior discussion of any type.  Very unfair because I had to show all steps in the process were properly handled before I even talked to an associate, I had no discussions before coaching was done."
bad,"Inconsistent, constantly shifting priorities for managers. No longer focused on customers. Everyone is encouraged to make someone look bad to look good. Servant leadership is now a sign of weakness. We promote good people without support and let them fail or quit in frustration. Very sad and far from the leaders I admired and wanted to emulate when I was promoted."
bad,"Management is ruthless and inconsiderate."
bad,"the people there work hard but usually feel undervalued. For a company that claims to be run on family values, it truly is not. I would not tell anyone to go and work there."
bad,"Honestly, between the policy changes and the managers, it was not fun to work there. They limited the allowable callouts which is understandable to a point, but insodoing they made it really impossible for parents to manage home lives and for people with health problems. They don't accept doctor's notes, so it's pointless to give one to them. I was given 3 raises, sure, but that was only because there was a state minimum wage raise and I switched to different store roles. Our service manager would leave in the middle of his shift for several hours at a time, leaving only two or three of us in the auto center to handle things on our own. He would make promises to customers knowing we couldn't fulfill them because of our policies and he wouldn't be there to handle the fallout. He treated all of us very poorly. It was a very frustrating experience."
bad,My managers were unorganized and never bothered to make the place a better environment. I didn't like to talk with the customers when they needed help because I didn't have much knowledge on what they needed help on. I was kind of learning everything on own.
bad,"Eu gostava do ambiente e das pessoas, mas por ser um e-commerce os procedimentos mudavam a todo instante, então era um pouco complicado ajudar os agentes de atendimento devido as mudanças repentinas no procedimento."
bad,Management made working for this company horrible. They don’t take their workers feelings or lives into consideration at all. Especially if you’re pregnant don’t even think about it.
bad,"Walmart is good if you want to meet new people, or if you're fresh out of high school or college, but it is not good long-term. The shelves are hardly stocked, some employees can be rude, and management isn't too helpful"
bad,"Working for Walmart has its benefits and it’s a good company but management were I worked was horrible , I got yelled at in front of customers by a manager for texting the store manager about an issue on my schedule  n"
bad,"I had been trying to apply to the 6082 distribution center for 5yrs after getting out of the Army and I finally got a hold of someone in HR there and he specifically told me that IT DID NOT MATTER THAT I WAS A VETERAN even though they had all their commercials out saying that they always put veterans first and they were re-hiring people that they had fired multiple times before I would even get an interview.  Then I finally got a job there working as an order filler for the meat and produce section and I was immediately met with a hostile work environment.  As soon as I started one of the other employees was going to my supervisor telling him that I was leaving things screwed up in certain areas, after this went on for a couple weeks my supervisor finally decided to have me write down things that I noticed were messed up and the times and locations that they were messed up at so he could track who was actually doing it, the next week the worker that I thought had been the one that was causing the problems ""transferred"" and I was back to work.  Then some of the other guys decided they were going to start doing the exact same thing to me and I even over heard them gripping about me actually turning them in for it like I had to do with the other guy when I first started.  It has decent pay but if you aren't in the special little cliques that go on there will be nothing you can do and they will either make you get fired or you will have to resign."
bad,"If you are a college student or a person with no kids. Walmart will be a great place to work and it also have great benefits. If you have kids or is older than it's not a great place to work because they are not family orientant at all. They only care about the business,"
bad,"I worked for Wal-mart for 5 years i loved working for that company and the positions that I did untill about a year ago.  Things change and when that happens things get crazy. Wal-mart hires associates for different positions and also has assistant managers divided up for certain parts of the store. Managers are never available in their departments, their always off somewhere else and when called for assistance requests are ignored. The only time the store is running the way it should be is when there is visits from regional managers and corporate, then madness occurs. In my opinion if you do your job right the first time and keep at it when regional and corporate managers come there wont be anything to worry about. Managers play favoritism and definitely have a favorite associate. There is an attendance policy but if your a favorite associate you will get multiple chances to correct your attendance issues. If your a hard worker, always on time and never really call in, be prepared to do your job and the job of several others for example if your a customer service supervisor (CSS) you have to cashier, be a self checkout host, work at customer service desk, get site to store orders for customers, work security at front door, be a cart associate, do maintenance and put away returns for every department all while running calls to cashiers at every register. They say there is an open door policy so that you can talk to the store manager about issues you might be having but if you do that and they do not like what you said there will be retaliation against your schedule and hours."
bad,Worked at Walmart for 9 years and never was compensated for my raises! Worked there for 9 years and all new hired I had to train and they all came in making my exact pay year after year! Horrible Management Program!
bad,Management threw there employees to wolves with little to no training on what exactly their job dutys were or how to come about them. My self included had to learn how to do my job on my own.
bad,"Te explotan para lo que te pagan, no te pagan tiempo extra."
bad,"Stressful work place, management cared more about themselves and how things would benefit them. Lots of rumors, and overall high school atmosphere. Moved to different departments as I couldn't get along with managers or certain associates, so tried moving to different areas to relieve stress to both me and them."
bad,"Not too bad if you are looking for a decent part time job."
bad,The management is to young and they don't care. After being there 3 years someone coming off the street maxed the same amount of money. There increases after you get hired isn't good. The employees are good quality of diverse people always wanting to help the customer until they've been there a few months and then most get the I DON'T care attitudes.
bad,While working here I was able to realize how important working under a leader is. This job has allowed me to learn and understand how to be a better leader as well as a better worker.
bad,The management is poor and they don't explain everything. They do not communicate much and expectvtou yo know everything even when you don't. It's hard to do the job when they won't let you.
bad,"Walmart is excellent for finding your niche in the retail world, great place to gain experience in all departments whether it be cashiering, management, backroom or customer service."
bad,they did not follow my availabilty very well  my fellow coworkers were friendly and helpful there is alot of standing I liked my customers it was hard for me to work five and a half hours with one fifteen minute break
bad,Too much micromanagement with upper management. Do as I say not as I do mentally with the store manager and asst. Managers.  Stay on process but do this before process.
bad,All in all its no a bad job for people who just graduated. It's not a long term job because they don't give you enough hours. The managers were okay and the work wasn't hard until you have rude customers.
bad,This place is horrible.  They dont care about the employees.  Its like a cattle market. I wouldnt recommend anyone work there ever.  There are better places.
bad,"I absolutely hated working at Walmart. The company as a whole is trash. They treat their employees like toys that are replaceable. Their policies are ridiculous and they don’t accept drs notes even if you are required to not be around people. They don’t care. Absolutely horrible company, morals, and what they stand for. Ridiculous. I wouldn’t let anyone I know work there."
bad,I spend 3 years waiting for a Full time and they never offered it. Managers are rude and they don't care about the employees at all. I will never recommend someone to work here.
bad,The management was lazy and always was in office. They were young and had no customer service skills at all. i noticed some customers would ask them questions and because they were talking it was like the customer was interrupting. I did not like working there
bad,"Working at Walmart is very draining. You are replaceable to them. They only care about making profit, not thinking about their employees welfare. It’s always understaffed and employees are underpaid."
bad,Walmart has very poor customer service. They do not treat their employees right with how they use them. They work them just long enough before they have to give them time so they do not get full time status.
bad,Very good and easy place to work depending on what position your willing to work some what good pay nice people and nice customers  and very good hours
bad,Come in scan out freight from the backroom.  Take inventory to sales floor to fill empty shelf slots where products where pulled from and purchased.  The workplace culture really depended on the store manager overseeing the store at the time of employment.
bad,"As a part-timer, hours are short especially during the wintertime after Christmas, where the working hours start to be cut down. The pay is near minimum wage. They provide lots of online training when you first start in.  As a Customer experience sales floor you need to like to be multi-task, doing zoning (put back articles customers left on the shelves), help customers and answer their queries, reply to the phone, online order, cover at the cash during peak or break coverage or short of staff. Lack of flexibility regarding vacations and shifts interchange between coworkers."
bad,"Managers must receive the same amount of training as hourly associates which is watch a video and then do the opposite. Manager encouraged harassment of coworkers, teamed a worker who picked on another worker together, creating a hostile work environment. When quota's weren't met he held new hires accountable but not the experienced coworkers. Work environment was unsafe with guys driving with loads in the air and forks tilted up. Maintenance trained drivers more than coworkers did. Broken equiptment took months to repair..workecrewttteamteamtrucks were"
bad,Awesome job horrible bosses awesome benefits and sick days paid vacation miss the people not the managers miss the multi tasking that’s all but they all are awful
bad,Did not enjoy being a cashier for Walmart. I was hired during the holiday season which was not a good time.  I also wanted to work full-time but was offered part-time plus low pay.
bad,I think Walmart is a unfair work environment because they play favorites and don’t let anyone go up they always choose outside of the company people who never done management jobs and it aucka
bad,Was in management for 6 years. Stepped down 1 year ago for personal reasons. Enjoyed my time with Walmart. Worked in several departments. Need a change.
bad,"WalMart is a large company and they are very diverse in their hiring, but my two experiences working with the company have not been to the professionalism that I know that WalMart is capable of. Scheduling has been the top issue that I have had with WalMart. I still think that WalMart is a great company and great place to shop, but not a very conducive place to work."
bad,"This could be a good place to work, if it only had competent management."
bad,"This is a great job for someone wanting a foot in the door to the industry. Low moral effects every part of the position. Upper management tends to pass the blame. Be ready to be told ""you signed up for this"""
bad,"Bosses had favorites and they always had a complaint, then when you either offend or dont get along with the wrong person suddenly you get fired because of a claim against you with no evidence just hear say, which wouldnt hold up in a court of law. Im not saying every walmart is this way, im sure there are good establishments, i just seemed to have picked the wrong one."
bad,"The one I worked at was awful...love my coworkers,but the management wasn't very nice...understaffed due to not giving people hours...1 manager was awful and mean but none of the upper management did anything about it...I worked there for 5 years and It was the most horrible place I had ever worked at."
bad,"It’s not the job it self it’s the people. Poor management is the biggest issue. The store manager sets the tone he is the worst, as well as some department managers, HR and most of the csm’s are all rude. All associates and customers complain daily."
bad,Had a muscle pain in lower back. Went to Dr got meds. On leave for 1wk. I asked for transfer for myself. Not to have this happen again. They approved transfer. It was sent to the SuperCenter Store. Went to Store for interview . Personnel said the manager in area was off. Called off and on every other day. Got same answer. Person is off. And somehow they were saying I had restrictions. But didn’t. No work 4wks now
bad,They are getting rid of a lot of positions so job security is horrible because of you’re no involved in the groups with the right people you don’t get treated fairly.
bad,The role of department manager is being eliminated in the new structure that Walmart is transitioning to. With over ten years at the company I will now have to interview to apply for the new supervisor position.
bad,You're always working holidays you don't get holiday pay and you miss out on your family and they don't really care if you're not home with your family.
bad,My brother injured himself there and shortly after management started bullying me and had no regard before I left that had been in the hospital and made me stock anyway.
bad,"Turnover with newer assoc. No matter how well you do your job, no JOB WELL DONE from mgr. Will listen to you but it's always what assoc.'s  do wrong.."
bad,My job consist of pushing in carts and helping customers out with large orders. Another associate and I would work out in the extreme heat pushing in carts with very little breaks.
bad,"Downhill fast, became more and more unreasonable as time went by. Not very employee friendly, horrible management, incredibly biased and just overall unpleasant. It isn't the worst job in the world but it isn't one I would recommend."
bad,"It’s an ok place to work, but expect to have a lot of demands put on you with little to no training or support. You will have to work holidays, and they are known to cut your hours after Christmas. They have a zero tolerance attendance policy and will not accept a doctor’s note as an excuse."
bad,"I worked night shift in the dairy/"
bad,Walmart gives you great hours and opportunities. The staffs most of the time seem to not have proper training. Sometimes they seem to mess with your schedules to compensate for personal goals.
bad,"Management is horrible as well as the pay and benefits. They will purposely limit hours scheduled to work so they don’t have to pay benefits out to you. No matter what job you work they will eventually tack on more responsibility and tasks without increasing your pay, basically they expect more for less. The company doesn’t care about their employees at all, they only care for sales no matter the cost."
bad,"Every store is probably not as bad as the one I worked at but the management is not up to par, they don’t care about their associates, there are little to no benefits left for working at Walmart"
bad,It was a really good job but I have really bad back problems and they didn’t understand that and they would give me hours that I couldn’t work so I quit because of my back problems
bad,"Working retail isn't really my cup of tea, but it has paid the bills. I learned that I don't want to work for Walmart the rest of my life, when Walmart doesn't really care about what I am limited to for my hours. I have to adjust to the hours they give me or only work like 2-3 days."
bad,it's a good place to work if you are in management they change the schedule every week those not really much you can do because you never know what your schedule is going to be the following week
bad,"Decent compensation but poor work environment, a clique place where you feel you have to ride along with the group or you become a target.  I would not go back to work there."
bad,"Arrogant management, started working over 40 hours per week than reduced to 16 flexible hours per week not allowing me to find another job. Always moving from one department to another."
bad,i didn’t like walmart because if the makers mainly but man walmart is not the best place to work. they always make you do random little things while in the middle of checking someone out and you have to listen but the customer is just as dumbfounded as you when the manager tells you take out your trash right now while in the middle of a customer and then finishes checking the customer out.
bad,"Too much favoritism went on in there and pointing fingers at people. I like a mature welcoming, bright, and nice workspace and presence! I give respect easily, id appreciate the same in return! If i dont know something because i am new then please help me!"
bad,I worked at Walmart on pines road and the mangers are very rude they try to talk to you like you a child and if they do not like you they will cut your hours
bad,It didnt feel like pay was fair. People would do nothing and get paid the same amount Most times theyd book one person to take care of an entire floor
bad,My typical work day involved unloading trucks and packing out freight to the floor. I learned to better manage my time in certain activities. Management was adequate at my store. My workplace culture was inviting yet distant. The hardest part of the job was the undue amount of stress placed upon my team of unloaders. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with.
bad,typical day at work would be clocking in and getting right to work helping customers and making sure they find what  they need while managing your area. what i learned is no matter how hard you work there's always room to improve
bad,"There overall work ethic ain't any good they run you in the ground and never stop to say thank you for anything you do. They claim they are family orianited they could care less about your family much less care about you, make sure that if their is anything wrong with you or a family member you don't call in because then that just gives them the motivation to let you go!!!!!!!!!"
bad,"Incredibly strict on lateness, work holidays with no compensation, manager was a bully, depressing environment, chaotic schedule, and often expecting multiple people's work load out of one person."
bad,Not great management and very under staffed. They have less then a third of the amount of employees needed to do the work properly and expect you to get everything done while still cutting hours.
bad,The managers at Walmart will not care about anything going on in your life. They will not work with you on schooling and will ignore any requests or availability you put in. The jobs themselves are not bad and rather easy going but dealing with management is not worth it.
bad,I didn’t not really like working at Walmart. They didn’t give me Enough hours and anytime I went to work I was always doing somebody else’s job that didn’t have anything to do with me.
bad,"Chronic understaffing resulted in excessive workloads for the employees. We could never keep up and the warehouse was a mess. Most management was great, but they did nothing to fix the problems. Maybe there was nothing they could do, which is honestly worse."
bad,They don't care about their employees it doesn't matter how long you been there you could have be there 20 years or 5 years and you easily replaced not a thank you or nothing to them like I said you're easily replaced and no matter how many years you been there which is sad because I'm sure Sam Walton who created the Walmart would be rolling in his grave if you knew how it is being ran now such a shame
bad,Typical day unloading truck couldn't get first break until truck was unloaded completely and sometimes that was four or five hours management always riding your back never happy always telling you to go faster customers are rude and you can't do anything about it
bad,"when I was working at walmart not only did they expect me to do the job of 3 people but they always expect you to have no life working here was one of the most stressful jobs every they want to work at the speed of a robot while all management stays in there office and sits all day and if you call off since they over work all of their worker , they will threaten to fire you do not recommend at all"
bad,Decent pay. Hard to move up. Managment would help only sometimes. Overtime had to be approved. Your schedules were 3 weeks out hard to get certain days off.
bad,"Stop making me do this when I dont have time, I just want to get away from here and go to may appointment but I am being forced to write this dumb review."
bad,"The Walmart I work at is poorly managed. There's no integrity with neither managers nor coworkers. Always short staffed so they expect the workers that do show up to work twice as hard. A lot of customers are just as stereotyped--awful."
bad,"The co-workers I met with I had made some tremendous friendships, the store itself has reliable hours and many of the regulars are lovely, but they need to work on who they hire for management as too many people become drunk on power an abuse their role in the workspace. They need better hands on training. All in all it can be a good place to work but it needs improvement."
bad,No help what do ever. People only look out for themselves and the training you get doesn’t help you at all. The managers are only out to fire people and that’s why their turnover is high.
bad,"working at Walmart always have great customer service. Some days are good and some are bad, Management wise could be better but i'm pretty sure that's a lot of places."
bad,the work is monotonous. you learn to interact with customers and serve people. the management is about the same as anywhere else. there is nothin special about the culture...its walmart
bad,La verdad estás más tiempo en tienda que en tu casa con tu familia y sobre todo muy mal pagado .
bad,"I work well and get underpaid."
bad,"They have no compassion for employees and they are constantly riding you to do things you physically cannot do when you have a doctors disability letter, constantly knit picking about small stuff but Allow people to constantly be late or absent more than policy allows with no consequences.  They don’t follow their own policies.  I would not recommend anyone to work there."
bad,"Most of the people I worked with were great people,however when managers are switched and it happens often some of  the new managers don't put in the effort to read current employee qualifications from applications or resume's nor to they listen to current employee's with more experience in the area they are placed"
bad,"Alot of pressure on xashiers"
bad,The schedules for a part time employee were non exsistent. 40 hour weeks with no consistency in the time of day or night you would be scheduled. The programs used in thier system for schedule problems were never shown on how to use them. If you could find someone to explain them and help you it was rare. Terrible system.
bad,"Compleja, favoritismo, cambio de dirección en planes"
bad,Management does not take care of problems. They do not want to be addressed of any issues and don't want to be bothered. Not always given updates or the necessary training to do my job properly.
bad,I found that the work isn’t too difficult and usually pretty straight forward but management has high expectations such as employees from one department working in other departments when they’re short employees. This wouldn’t be an issue if they wouldn’t promise raises and promotions for work you learn that you won’t end up getting paid for. They also don’t work well with part time employees.
bad,Co-workers were pretty nice and easy to get along with. The breaks were never set right. The front end managers were very slow at getting you what you needed.
bad,"If management is good, working can be efficient otherwise you're gonna have a bad time. Running low on man hours for your dept. well congrats because they will reduce them even lower. Dept. behind and not running properly well let me throw one random employee under the bus."
bad,"Great job 10 years ago. Hard work was done but you were compensated accordingly, your opinion mattered, and you felt respected. Not any more. More is continually demanded, conditions are unsafe, the associate is not appreciated. But the final straw... competitors have caught up and past Walmart salaries."
bad,"I lost my job because of poor management at the Adrian Walmart"
bad,"The business model Walmart operates on is based on infinite growth. Store management is strongly encouraged to increase profit every quarter, and entry level employee bonuses and benefits are withheld when goals aren't met. This leads to stores being continuously understaffed while employees are expected to still perform all duties. Supervisors will routinely assign unrealistic time limits to various tasks and reprimand associates who don't meet these somewhat arbitrary expectations. The stress is not worth the low wages."
bad,"Empresa de buen nivel en la que adquieres buena experiencia, dependiendo de la gerencia puedes adquirir las herramientas necesarias para desarrollo del las operaciones."
bad,"A typical day at Walmart involved assisting employees with various trainings, payroll questions, and recruiting new employees. Management was open door."
bad,"Walmart work environment is a product of its management. When salaried managers fail to help, or discipline, the whole place fails."
bad,Poor management and terrible attitude towards employees lack of benefits and no room for advancement in most areas. Pay is also not substantial enough for the work
bad,bad management and no respect for employees with little to no regard on how changes in the store effect their employees. poor communication skills between the managers in the store.
bad,I stocked well. One manager like me m others wanted me to speed up. I am legal blind without my glasses. So i got put to maintence. I hated it. Two managers?got in faced yelling for me to be faster. I quit.
bad,As soon as you walk in the door you are required to set up to unload the freight trailer.  When finished you have to stock shelves at a pace that is faster than the company believes is possible.  You are required to take 2 fifteen minute breaks and a lunch break at the exact same time as everybody else.  If you take a little too long to finish any job you get written up by a supervisor/manager that wasn't even paying attention to any job on the floor.  No matter how hard you work the managers look down on you
bad,"they had no idea what was going on witch end was upand what they wanted us to do"
bad,Some managers have no idea how to talk to or treat people will criticize you but not help people get better at their job some managers will call you out in front of other employees and get mad when to you talk back
bad,Management doesn't hold people accountable or follow processes.  Has opportunities for training for new hires.  Puts employees on sales floor immediately.
bad,Walmart eliminated my position no job security. I did not know why this survey appeared as I did not wish to complete but for whatever reason I could not proceed until. complete.
bad,I have been working at Walmart for over 4 years and have noticed a lot of changes and they are not always for the better.  We have great associates that get taken advantage of from time to time.
bad,"The store I worked at, overnight shift, was very hot.  It made it difficult to keep smiling  when assisting customers. Never want to work at Walmart again."
bad,"The management are liars and manipulators who attempt to trick you into doing things instead of being honest and persuading. I liked my co-workers but the management were always lying and pressuring. The customers were the worst I ever encountered in my life and they always took the strategy of trying to con us into doing things that would cost us our jobs and then reporting us to the management when we refused. Of course, what they tell the management is often not what they requested of us. The management knows this but puts on a show to please the customer by degrading us in front of them. If a customer harasses or even assaults us, the management usually just gives us extra break time until the customer leaves. I've watched managers put defective or shorted items that have been returned to the store right back on the shelves. There are never enough checkout lanes available (by design) so other workers are expected to join the checkout area when it gets busy. The veteran employees have figured out personal hiding places and disappear when they are called, however. Half the day is spent cleaning up after customers and we're not even a restaurant. It's a discount store that doesn't care about its employees and caters to the most difficult customers in existence: the poor, the uneducated, and the homeless. General turnover was horrendous and the person who trained me quit only months later. The store manager was a ghost whom I've never met. My greatest amusement was talking to salespeople (DirecTV & others) who tried to pitch things to Walmart customers. Most of them were strangely"
bad,"Wal-Mart is a good place to start,  but when you get tired of always fighting for hrs. It's time to move on."
bad,"Walmart required work. Supervisors Committed insatiable acts of disrespect. Associates were and are not valued, nor prioritized. The time spent was stressful, yet I maintained my composure and proceeded to work thoroughly."
bad,Walmart hours change and they have favoritism on who gets the most hours no matter who needs them they are given to who they want to have the hours so your hours can go from 40 a week to less than 20 a week.
bad,"Walmart is not as family orientated as many people assume, while they do  offer great incentives and amazing benefits the pay scale is sub par. Regardless of how long you have worked for them more often than not new hires would be making more as a cashier than associates who had been working there for years prior. If you are not someone that management likes your work life balance is tipped too far to the work side"
bad,"Used to be a good place to work.Now with all the changes , like cutting hours, full time people are working part-time hours.Its hard to make a living  with part-time hours."
bad,"management was not friendly, hours sucked, the pay was horrible, was not family friendly with work life, to much drama, rules were set, backstabbing people. I wouldn't work there again. workplace culture was not positive at all. they did not let you interact with customers very much you had a job to do and no talking."
bad,"Large volume walmart warehouse. Half refrigerated half ""dry"". Tough place to work people get fired every week. Most people dont want a back breaking job with no climate control. After working there for 2-3 years you will be capped out in pay around $20.00/hr. You will be working on holidays except Christmas day. They will not pay you extra for that either. Recently Walmart changed to a PTO system, most employees dont like it."
bad,"Make u work until a project is done no life balance to many areas to cover with no help around.you as manager are a cashier maintenance, money machine recycler fixer you are in general responsible for what happened or didn't happen."
bad,"They needs to have more cash register open,and if they customer get sick on the job they should let that customer come back to work.I like working there,the pay is good but they always want you to your job and other people job too, that's how come I got sick I was doing to much."
bad,"the job its self isn't so bad but management has unrealistic expectations, loved the co- workers but trying to do the job of 2 or 3 people is just to much"
bad,"It was an okay job, it gave me something to do for the time I was at school. It just wasn’t for me. If you want to work here at Walmart, it’ll be easy but you’ll definitely need to be a people person because it is a customer service type job. Wether you are in the front or back if the store."
bad,"The only positive I can say from working at Walmart was my interaction with a majority of the customer base. The job was fast paced and always had something changing or going on. There was claim for advancement opportunities or to be promoted from within, but it was rarely seen. With Walmart it wasn't what you know but who you know if you had any hope of advancing to anything over a department manager."
bad,Management always had attitudes and wanted to send you home the store manager wasn't any better he would side with the assistant managers even tho they where in the wrong
bad,Managers look out for their friends and single out the ones who are not. Expect you to put your family last. Not a welcoming environment to want to work in
bad,I am currently seeking other opportunities. When I started here I loved my job. Now that they have changed everything around it is nearly impossible to advance. New employees are brought in getting paid the same or more than an employee who's been there 5 years. Managers are not there to help advance you they are there for themselves. They have their favorites.
bad,Quiet and your always rushed even if your working as hard as you physically can. Time went by slow and someone is always over your shoulder. No restroom breaks unless you’re off the clock.
bad,"My issue with walmart is more about the employees and how managrmrnt handles problems. There was one particular employee who harrassed me my entire time at walmart, and i took all the steps they suggested i do, suchas speak to H.R and let my direct manager know what was happening. Both resulted in nothing. Instead he continued to spread rumors and have his friends harrass me and when i approached him about the situation he made it seem as if i was causing issues. "
bad,It is too difficult to cope up with such large environment. There is a lot of stress at work. The staff is very unfriendly and difficult to work with.
bad,"-Dealing with different customers on a daily basis"
bad,"Our manager messed with our schedules after they had been locked, and he had no regard for our opinion. Overall, the job wasn’t bad, but it was the manager that resulted in 3 associates quiting."
bad,They need one main leadership and the rest follow his guidance. I get told to do something by one assistant manager and get in trouble by another for doing what I was told in fair but they had to cover their selfs
bad,"Its not for everyone but there is potential for advancing and if you can get full time it pays the bills. They're running on skeleton crew more often than not and almost impossible to get fulltime (on frontend). Slowly but surely getting rid of positions and or creating robots/self check to do your job. Not taking care of associates or customers anymore. But most positions are easy enough if you can do the work of 3, don't want a co sistent schedule and like angry people."
bad,the only way to be able to have a stress free work experience is by having management that treats associate better than a dog. I would not recommend working here.
bad,"amazing employee and customers, lack professional skill in management although good strategy to getting the night freight done."
bad,"I liked the  job, I really love helping people out. I love assisting customer in whatever they needed help with whether was looking for an item for the customer or finding out the price of the item for the customer. I also like the I learned new things in cap one that I did not know before, But unfortunately I also felt like there was lack of communication."
bad,They say they are a great place to work... and maybe they are now but when I worked there (at least at the location where I worked) it was unorganized and the managers were not employee friendly & didn’t seem to be very interested in helping other employees learn and grow.
bad,"Management hardly ever makes sure to keep their employees safety an well being in mind. Not only that, but their standards are unrealistic and unfair. If you are missing X amount of points they take days of work from you which impacts the way you live. Even tho the M/O of walmart is save money LIVE better. That doesnt just go for their customers its for the employees as well."
bad,It was an ok company to work for. They were a bit unorganized and they were too inexperienced in much need areas. Wasn’t the most friendly place to work. Wasn’t the cleanest place to work either.
bad,Lack of communication. It is a good job but management do not communicate as well (at least at the building I worked for). If you are a good worker they overwhelm you with work.
bad,I had always wanted to work at Wal-Mart but actually working there changed my mind. The managers weren't really interested in the person just interested in delegating work.
bad,I like to work for Walmart but I would not go back they have this point system that I can buy by and they will fire you for anything you say you can't take no time off they have a four-point system
bad,I've had my ups and downs with Walmart but overall they don't treat people equally or fairly is a breeding ground for slackers corruption and favoritism despite any other claims they make this is the truth. I've worked there for well pass a decade 3 different facilities.
bad,It largely depends on the management at your location as to how good of a environment the store will have. in my time there it has only gotten worse though as we have moved to a skeleton crew only with no sign of change even as we ask for more people to just cover time
bad,The management is difficult the work itself isn’t very difficult and reasonable coworkers are a very big part of the job on most nights overall it’s a decent job
bad,Management was a joke and they didn't help at all in anything. They set you up for failure and overwork you with unreal expectations for the new people in the company.
bad,Management will tell you to work in different department that you have never worked in with no experience and they will watch you suffer. At the end of the day they will try to micro-manage and wont try to actually help the only time you ever see management doing actual work is ether when the store manager or a general manager comes to the store but other than that the are on there phones in the back playing games on the phone and it's honestly terrible. SADLY!!!
bad,I worked for Walmart inside and outside. Managers seemed to favor certain employees over others. I’d be working hard while we had lazy employees do nothing and managers did absolutely nothing about it.
bad,"they treat their people like robots, if you dont move fast enough or dont stay late enough they yell at you. their is never enough people so be prepared"
bad,"They don't take care of their employees or their customers. I'm not sure how this company stays in business. Pay is garbage and personnel acts like they are God. Don't bother bringing in a Dr's excuse...doesn't matter. You will not be excused because in the words of my boss, ""my definition of sick and yours may be two different things. ""."
bad,Walmart offers great discounts thru many different vendors. The pay is mediocre however the discounts are wonderful. The best part about the job is your customers
bad,"management was disrespectful to employees and they were very disorganized, unsafe working conditions, also did not have good scheduling for the outside workers."
bad,A typical day would be lots of customer inquires. I have learned to be patient and more attentive to my surroundings. Management is always busy with projects and helping customers and associates. The hardest part of the day is being away from my child. But I enjoyed meeting new people and making lifetime friends.
bad,Nothing to say it was a job in order to pay bills. Like all corporations and companies suffers from politics in the work place. Work make money then go home.
bad,Coworkers were great but home office was terrible and the customers were just as bad! Only reason I worked there for so long is I liked the coworkers there.
bad,"I really don't want to write a review,as each Walmart is different. Unfortunately consistent hours weekly can't be counted on. On the plus note most holiday time extra hours do become available."
bad,The company was better represented when sam walton was alive and aware what  was going on with his company. always seeking ways to take care of his employees. now the ones in power haveless care about you or your efforts in keeping there pockets full.
bad,"For the first year, it was fine. After that, it was bad. The scheduling made it so I had no life outside of work, the treatment was poor, and we were always understaffed. Job security was poor, and benefits were bare minimum."
bad,Management was not team oriented. Management did not listen to employees needs regularly but instead picked which employees they wanted to support and assist. There was a consistent overwhelming sense of being overwhelmed by managers.
bad,Fun job no pay customers dont care gossip factory for sure. Retail giant corporate focus on top dollar thats about it really. I had a fun time working there but dont think its a place to stay at for career.
bad,they are terrible the worker stuck they are disrespectful no one knows where anything is the pay is not enough for the work they make you do and it was just bad
bad,"Ridiculous expectations, little real-time training, bad management, few low job performance consequences BUT some extraordinarily, hard working, smart and positive co-workers that kept me there way longer than I expected"
bad,Started good but the environment was bad from Management always changing almost every month and poor work ethics from employees. then no disciplinary was done for bad employees and then it fell for others to pick up their slack or have to stay late or they got the blame.
bad,It was ok I wouldn't work there as a hostess it was not a good experience for me but maybe it will be for someone else. I did get paid well but it just was not for me
bad,A company that values turn around. Run people into the ground till they can't take it and quit or place unrealistic expectations on them till they get fired because they can easily hire someone else to replace them with. You are not an asset to the company you are purely disposable.
bad,"The culture there depends strictly on management. If they can delegate well and trust employees, the store works fine. If they don't,it creates a horrible place to work"
bad,"I worked for Walmart five years. They have a great benefits package. But between customers treating you horrible and unfair management it was a nightmare. There have been countless times I went home stressed, frustrated, and in tears."
bad,this company is very stressful to work for them and the management treat you badly. they dont pay you well at all. they over work you the ground  for not much pay.
bad,I enjoyed learning new things and working with customers. There was always something new to learn. Management is just like most places some are easy going and others not so much. Overall it’s a great starter place for youth.
bad,lots of jobs cuts. we lost  20 hr of pharmacist and tech help with the last round of cuts. Starting to look like CVS . Took this opportunity to finally retire and get out of pharmacy.
bad,I made a lot of friends while working with Walmart. However management treated the minors horribly. Multiple managers working together yet could not get on same page as to where or what we were to be working on.
bad,"They say people make a work place and mine certainly did, despite the corporation only caring about its customers rather than its employees. I made friends i know will be in my life a long time."
bad,For the most part you’re over worked and under paid. Management are over worked so they tend to take it out in the lower level employees. I would not recommend anyone work there EVER!
bad,Corporate has started taking over day to day operations and are cutting all employees hours to cut expenses.  Couldn't recommend them at this time.  They are reducing some staff as well.
bad,The management sucks! They are very disrespectful and the treat you like you are beneath them. They are supposed to be big on customer service but lack it especially when it comes to the employees.
bad,"Its almost as if they didnt want workers because they would make a minuscule issue into something more than it needed even when the issue would only raise morale and not pose such a ""safety risk"" as they told me, even though the store that trained me had this ""issue"" installed directly from the store."
bad,"I liked all of my coworkers and most of the management in the store."
bad,"Running on a point system for absences means that even if you are in a car accident, even if you are deathly ill, even if your grandmother is dying, you are only allowed three absences in a six month period or you will be fired. Leaving early or arriving late results in half a point, and covering for other people's shifts counts for nothing. You're saving their hide but we're all at the mercy of this strangely punitive system that does not honor employee loyalty. The pay is good but I learned that they have no qualms with replacing you and will treat you as such."
bad,"A typical day of work is stocking, helping customers, and zoning the shelves.  The management are terrible at helping you and move with no sense of urgency.  The customers where I worked always had a sense of entitlement that no one gave them.  The place was always under staffed causing you to have to work in 2-3 departments at a time.  Overall it is not a great place to work if you want to keep your sanity."
bad,no life bad place to work. they think you have no life outside of work. i wont recomment working for them. they need to figure out what they wanna do first
bad,I suggest no one work at Walmart. You don't get benefits until you've been there for 6 mths. The management is terrible. I got diagnosed with a tumor and whenever I told my manager about it he said well is it going to be a problem with your work? Just no sympathy at all! They are plain rude and disgusting. they don't care about their employees or their customers as long as they make their money.
bad,I enjoyed my job and the hours I worked with the company BUT my assistant manager lacked people and/or communication skills that made my job difficult. Myself and other coworkers worked hard but it never seemed to be enough. I recieved a great evaluation but was offered a fulltime position. Managment throughout the store seemed to not be on the same page.
bad,Not enough hourly pay for a single mom or dad. But if housewife or student this is ok.Need a easy application process. Should do 90 day reviews with better growth potential
bad,Managnent really poor. Dont appricate alot of youre work youre doing. Not enough hours and they change youre scedule on a daily basis. So it makes it harder.
bad,Management sucks! They play favorites and well change schedule without authorizing or a week notice. They are never around to ensure employee are in their assigned area so you are left helping 5 customer with no help.
bad,"The pay is just barely passable."
bad,"Its a desperation job."
bad,Nobody in my department knew exactly how we were supposed to do things and then would get in trouble for doing it wrong. The manager changed 4 times in my year there and each person wanted to start from scratch
bad,"It is easy to get along with the older people. But the managers do like to pick favorites, they have made fools out of so many times I can even count. And I got wicked sick while working here, I had a doctor's note for my absence and they fired me. As soon as I was fired they asked me when I would re-apply"
bad,Walmart is always changing & understaffed...over worked & under paid..there are alot of part time workers during full time jobs as well as the hours...that's not fair at all...
bad,"None, I liked it , they wasn't really family oriented like they said . I had to many points and they let me go . Didn't think it was right but hey things happens . Give me an opportunity to get something better."
bad,When I got hired I was made to feel like it was a family oriented business. It's the opposite. The production is almost impossible to make because you are dependent on drivers to get your freight. The managers are unprofessional and only care about a number and not quality. The pay was good but it's ok if you can deal with feeling like you're on a plantation everyday.
bad,you will have to deal with customers who think they are better than you. managers dont care what goes on and some managers are just fine and do care about us
bad,"Look elsewhere for a job. This may be perfect for a student, but if you've been in the market before, you know how companies can always take, instead of giving back to its employees. You can start out at 40 then it dwindles to 20 then 10 and so on. "
bad,Walmart call me in and started me right away lifting heavy item by hand and not by fork lift.  That was not the position I sign up for.  Once there they gave me all kinds of work to do but nothing dealing with that position I was suppose to have.  Eventually I left to find something more suiting for me.
bad,"The higher you go the worse you get treated.  Market Manager and Human Resources Manager are only in it for eachother not the team. Lots of being told you are going to get fired with things that are not achievable and watching others get displaced and then it happened to me and my coworkers. STILL waiting on the call to see how I am after losing job to restructure. The reddit reviews you see actually are real, they just start out in another part of the country.  Next is losing dept managers and assistants. Hope they are treated better than the ones who left before them.  Thank you associates that work hard and give your all. Better look for something else, cause it will happen to you."
bad,I do not recommend this place to anyone.  They treat their employees very poorly and with great disrespect.  I have ulcerative colitis and was accused of not working hard enough at times.
bad,It was ok not that fun but was alright managment was very bad constant change of hours was not very fun very bossy people did not enjoy working their a.
bad,Walmart is a big company work wide that fits everyone everyday needs wants I love going to work with a smile in my face and leaving with a even bigger one when my shift is over
bad,"I enjoyed working as a sale associated for Walmart Pharmcy. Although I was fired by new management."
bad,"Walmart was good to me the first year, but once they closed our small store, and we went to the supercenters it went all down hill from there. I wouldn't recommend that place to no one."
bad,"El ambiente laboral es agradable, con sus excepciones. Te pagan cada 14 días sin falta y ofrecen prestaciones superiores a las de la ley, como caja de ahorro y prestamos personales (después de un año de laboral con ellos). Sin embargo debido a que el sueldo es bajo existe una elevada rotación de personal y por ello plantillas incompletas y mayor carga de trabajo."
bad,Walmart was a good job especially since I didn’t have much I was doing... I worked with a crew and had to organize even after doing warehouse drops.. it was ok
bad,If u keep ur head and do ur job ur fine. Dont ask questions because they wont answer them. Very hard to move up. Scheduling was very all over the place.
bad,It’s a bad company to work for the way they treat there employees who work hard everyday and holiday when I got sick they let me go and when I talked to different managers everybody kept saying different things and blaming it on the other
bad,"I would not want to return there unless I don't have a choice. And, that is if they decide to take u back. No workers comp, and if u do end up with ot, u have to cut the extra time on your lunch break."
bad,"If you enjoy being yelled at by the most vile customers possible, or being given 4X your normal work load one week then getting no hours next week, then this place might be for you. The absolute best parts of the job though are when you get a manager that is chill, and the occasional free food cookouts, those are nice. Overall though the stress and low pay isn't worth it."
bad,Overall my experience with Wal-Mart was horrible. Had to argue with management about going home to my child who was in need of emergency care which tells me they don't care about family. The pay was $9 when I started. The job itself was easier but management just couldn't get it together. Bonuses were stolen by management. Very corrupt company.
bad,The job is a temporary job not one to stay at the pay is okay but the stress makes it not worth it. The years I worked at this company has made me think in investing time else where.
bad,I like the job and all. The people i worked with where awesoms. But managment had favorites and i felt where pretty rude. I like some management but not for fresh cap.
bad,"Working at Walmart was okay at first, but as time goes on you realize only a select few fit their ""standards"" and perform on par with their expectations. I've been condescended to, made to feel inferior, never really felt appreciated, and I truly feel that some underhanded and unethical behavior goes on. I can only hope that not every store is as bad as mine."
bad,I have worked for Walmart 2 times in the last 12 years and I left them 12 years ago because of the lack of family friendly. Currently I am struggling to get hours to be able to support my family and when I do need time off for myself or my families appointments it’s rarely approved.
bad,They are so under staffed all the time . refusing to open more lanes for customers to check out even when the store is busy . When you need help it is hard to find anyone .
bad,hours varied all the time and you never knew when you could leave your shift. management was never around when you had questions and even the employees were disrespectful.
bad,"The job requires little to no effort at all. It is a fun job, where you get to help people take care of themselves. Technicians are required to "
bad,"Management here has their favorites and if you are not one of them, look out! I did not mind the hours and pay was great but the way you are treated by management sucks."
bad,I work there for 17 years and it got to a point where I was going to work with attitude didn't want to go to work it has got just that bad. I work every department in each one there was problem it was to many out of date to much over stock sometime the produce had bugs in there bcuz the worker wasn't checking it daily.
bad,"Management will lie to cover the're mistakes and blame you, co workers are ALL back stabbers. Can't trust management to have your back or support you in decisions."
bad,Worked as a truck driver then a yard driver they would have you to move trl then run into the warehouse to help unloading of trl then back out into the yard all night long. If you don't meet your numbers then they would write you up.
bad,"Didn't get along with managers cause I passed everything to be moved up and never could get there cause i spoke my mind and was real not fake. They bring in new people to "
bad,The store manager is very rude and treating the  employees  like they have no value. He  also pushes the other members of management to  treat the  employees bad he don't care about the employees crys for help  he take away positions from others so he can gave it to people he likes he doesn't like anyone to speak their mind and he is very controlling.
bad,Enjoy the little time I was there assembling. Not much to say I was part time. pay was ok.  I like interaction with customers and working with employees.
bad,"Improved Wellness Program; check your stress level. "
bad,"They say they care, but they don't. They try to get away with the most limited amount of staff possible. Cut cashier hours, and replace them with self checkout. Keep pharmacy staff at a bare minimum, stressed, frustrated, and prone to errors. The culture of coaching, which is the wrong word for it, is more harmful than helpful. Retaliation runs rampant, despite a policy against it."
bad,Great immediate hire.  Great break room.  Cashiers were over stressed for several reasons.  Rules were meant for some people but not others.  CSM's would take too long to help Cashiers.  Breaks and lunches were not consistent.  Cashiers were told NO overtime but we're not  relieved on time.
bad,"Walmart is a stressful job that gives little hours not many benefits, little possibility for advancement of transfer to another departments.  Ok of a job for a short time."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my associates. They made the day bearable.  Walmart is no longer a family place. I had to transfer my daughter to another school and thus she could not participate in choir at the new school because they have their auditions at the beginning of the year.  She would stay til 4:15 on Thursdays and when I moved her, she only stayed til 3:15 on Thursdays. My schedule had been signed before this happened and I was scheduled til 3:45 on Thursdays.  They would not work with me so that I could be out on  time to go for my daughter. My supervisor said Sorry, there is nothing I can do. Well, I couldn't leave my child at the school for more than 20 minutes without getting the cops called on me. This caused me a lot of stress as I had no one else that could go for her."
bad,"While the pay was very basic, the duties expected from an associate were worth much more, lots of cut in hours for long periods, while there were actually not many associates on the floor or cashier even when they always complained of being short staffed specially in front end. Most of the time associates and others were expected to perfom the job of a cashier, while the managemnet questions you later on why no job was done in certain busy departments. Management is unable to treat employees fair, as only few people are appreciated, because they know how not to work and still go up the ladder. "
bad,Overall great job and absolutely love the customers. Management is just a issue and proper equipment. The lack of teamwork is a big reason why it's hard to succeed.
bad,When I say disfuctional That’s when the CSM run around and don’t realize what’s going on with the cashiers until the cashier has a line backed up to the clothing  department.
bad,"There is more bad than good to say about Walmart. Although I like the people (employees) that I work with which helps get you through the work day when it comes to management it is severely lacking. When there is someone in management that cares and is trying to help employees there is only so much they can do do to upper management and policies. I’m lucky to have a very good manager although my assistant manager is not so good "
bad,They are a big company that only cares about making money not the employees and if they dont approve of your thoughts they make your life miserable...
bad,Walmart is basically what you would expect it's mostly very young people all of the management is awful the work is easy and doesn't pay much. If you start in a bad spot it isn't easy to get moved to a spot that you would prefer
bad,"I went to work there because my dad work there and I thought it would be good experience, but I didn't learn anything and the people I worked with very lazy"
bad,"A typical day is stocking, paper work, scanning your depths, picks, doing mods, zoning.the most enjoyable part was working with people that had become like family."
bad,"I left there and they will not hire you back"
bad,"The experience i've had with Walmart combined into one word , would have to be ""Consuming"" . The management alone was ""OK"" to say the least .... Yes , although overall the associates were friendly as ever . Behind the walls of the Seagoville Walmart , it didn't quite match up to the workplace it was set out to be or never ever was it a great place to work at altogether . I couldn't recommend this job for anyone ."
bad,"The M01 - Original Fishing Shorts, now available in camo. These bottoms are made with an extremely durable poly / elastane ripstop dobby,  treated with a stain resistant AFGUARD treatment and features an extremely strong, but lightweight AFLEX 2-way stretch fabric. Demanding anglers can now enjoy Original AFTCO shorts in our popular tactical Camo print."
bad,Working at WalMart has indeed taken a toll on my body from having more joint pain to back pain. it has shown to me that working nights has also affected my emotional functions as well. lack of time with family due to my sleeping non-stop.
bad,"A typical work of a overnight associate is to replenish merchandised on the shelves, pulling out pallets at the back room & bring it to the sales floor, stocking merchandise in a fast-pace. Sometimes overnight managers assign you anywhere and they always asked you, ARE YOU DONE???...  they can see working hard and ask you, ARE YOU DONE???... some overnight assistant managers at walmart are rude!!! sometimes they don't work properly.. it's because the STORE MANAGER is not around...  the hardest part of the job in walmart is pulling out heavy pallets in the back room bottle water, soda, juice etc... the most enjoyable part is when you go home and the work is done finish..."
bad,"Temp job, I was just a college student who needed money. But management is sub-par. If you are 18-24 don't work here only work here if you have a bad background and cant work anywhere else. Even though $11-12 an hour is not too bad it still is not enough based off how much they expect of you."
bad,"I worked for walmart for over 20 years, started as a part time employee. I moved up thru the ranks and worked with some great individuals but there are some managers who I would never wanted to work for again. The expectations are super high even though the store is short handed so the work has to be done by management. Cashiers having to get credit card apps to offer surveys in order to improve store score to Dept managers, everyone is stressed out."
bad,"No where near the best place to work but it is a good starter job to understand customers and a good job to get back on your feet but nothing you can live off of.  Management wasnt the best especially in the evenings/nights for front end.  Overall okay job but they really dont let you advance unless you hound/annoy them, they have to really like you to promote you and if you're too good they won't let you advance either."
bad,"The company was at one time a fun place to work and the career was great, but over the last couple of years it truly is not the presentation that they give to the outside."
bad,Management sucked there was way to much work for one person in one area management never helped with anything I definitely did not receive any training had train self
bad,I have been working at Walmart few times. I have to say the other workers are very nice and the work seems so much easier with a good group of people.
bad,"Unrightfully fired, for doing what I was told. And then was told i should've known better. However, the people I worked with made it worth it. I do miss them."
bad,"Unsupervised all day . Everything is 3rd party, no communication with management.  Hardest part of job is the very fast pace and production oriented. Co-workers are the best part of my job."
bad,"Walmart maintains a culture of fear over their employees by maintaining unattainable goals and time requirements, so they can threaten to get rid of you at anytime for any reason. As the saying went with the employees; “ they’d fire the customers if they could..”"
bad,It is an excellent temporary job. I would not recommend staying long term. Your experiences will vary greatly based on the personality of your superiors. I've seen good workers get black balled out of the company and I've also seen terrible workers promoted above everyone else.
bad,It is an ok work environment but I want something else because we'll let's just it's not for me at this point in my life. It was decent at the time but it was just not my cup of tea overall
bad,Walmart was my first job I ever had. I worked for 4 different stores holding multiple positions in these stores. I didn't agree with the way the business is heading.
bad,"Working at W.M was like working for a factory. Never appreciated and a few managers were rude. They over stocked the warehouse & there was no room in the back. Alot, of gossip & back bitting in the work place. I was a floor associate in grocery & I had to pull heavy carts with merchandise to be put on the shelfs. The cart was over stocked and as a result I got Bursitis but never got workers comp. I just left since I was seasonal. However, it's been 8 yrs and my wrist and arm still hurts."
bad,"It was cool stocking, when I first started but once I was pregnant everything changed. I got a promotion to claims and was getting paid 12.50 but whenever I needed to sit down cause I wasn’t feeling well. People would come by and “complain” about me sitting down for a couple minutes and my manger told me I’m not allowed to sit down except for at break. Even with my doctors note “ this job is  standing up . You’re not suppose to be sitting down. That did it for me ."
bad,"job was decent and tolerable. It wasn’t too bad. Regarding the manager, sometimes they were rude, but overall it was okay. The hours were flexible to some people."
bad,"I have worked in the regular Walmart and Walmart Supercenter.  Everyone at the supercenter there are too many chiefs and not enough Indians.  In layman terms, everyone wants to be the boss it's not going to work like that.  These associates that are like this are running the good people away. Management  some of them wants to be buddies instead of dealing with the problems at hand."
bad,"They don't follow availability of employees,  schedule is posted on wall never emailed,  confusing when you first start there,  concerns are never addressed and hours fluctuate greatly.  Missed breaks and management doesn't care about their employees.. Feel like just a number. Don't teach new things very well you are just expected to wing it"
bad,"This job requires many long hours, up to 20, at work in a single day. Policies allow associates to come and go as they please, crippling managements ability to manage workday. Work/life balance is nearly non-existent, as many meetings and off work days are required."
bad,they promise you the availability to move through out the store and to advance but if you are actually good at your job they will not let you advance or move around.
bad,I was a cashier at walmart on washington ave in Albany and i worked there for a year then got terminated for something i didnt do. I just took care of customers. Ive learned different things. what i enjoyed was talking to the customers
bad,Enjoy working with the others in the store.  Hard to get managers to listen most do not want to listen.  Most managers walk around with energy drinks instead of helping.
bad,Walmart is completely out of touch with reality with regards to their views on public perception of their company.Employees are rude and never made you feel part of the team.Employees complain about customers constantly and go out of their way to avoid customers.No consistent schedule
bad,Walmart is a job I got on my own and worked in the deli.  Some co-workers were very lazy and didn't do their jobs.  Some would come in smelling like marijuana.
bad,"In the two and half years that I  worked there,   the store had 3 store managers.  They didn't care about the customers or employees. The area was a small area, almost like a ""mom and pop"" kind of area.  I was written up for talking to much to customers,  even though I ran the self checkout area. Customers would come in and shop when I  was working just to have me help them."
bad,Walmart is an ok place to work. Wouldn’t stress about getting into Walmart. I liked Walmart when I first started but after you’ll see people true colors
bad,"Management is not great, and has preferential treatment to certain employees. Especially if they are the same gender and likeable enough to be able to work how they want to rather than how they should. Slackers get rewarded by being able to do what they want, and hard workers are expected to be ideal workers that give no back y’all and do exactly as told constantly. Calling in for any reason gets your managers to give you a hard time when the system is in place to be for emergencies. Other Walmart’s may not be as bad. But Management will make or break the experience."
bad,i didnt like it. i was 19 weeks preganet and they mistreated me other than that it was an okay job to start out with for like a high school student or just starting out.
bad,Could be a great job if Walmart actually care about their associates. They are asking people to do more work with less people to actualy do the jobs at hand. If more work is required then so is more pay. Walmart has the potential to be a great place to work under the right management team. I stayed for 10 years until I couldn't take the lack of communication any more.
bad,"Pocas prestaciones, malos tratos con los jefes, mala capacitación"
bad,"The management had a lack of respect for the employees, the store itself was stressful and high-paced where favoritism for different employees ruled. You were given a lot of work with limited amount of time during your scheduled shift to complete. Lack of flexibility for compensating employees who gave more than 3 weeks of advancement. The help given within scheduling was limited and caused conflicts between management and employee. Learned how to properly de-escalate unsatisfied customers about different products and learned managerial aspects while working as a cashier."
bad,"This was a terrible workplace. I do not recommend this company to work for. Walmart is very opposed to unions. The company does everything it can to keep workers from being able to get overtime pay, not by ensuring that no one works for more than 8 hours, but by telling people to clock out early. You can feel that you are not appreciated or cared for."
bad,"Scheduling is set three weeks in advance but your shift can be changed 2 days before you work it with no notice, Personell rejects any time off requests, sometimes only 7 people will show up to a shift out of 15+ scheduled, management is rarely on the same page with each other, hours are not assured."
bad,I hate work for Walmart because some of their management are very basis.some of the management trys to get you fired just because they don't like you.
bad,"70 hour work week with only 1 holiday of the whole year, you never get to stay in your dept. that you were hired for. They will change your schedule every week."
bad,Walmart doesn't care about their employees. They pay well but definitely overwork you. They treat their employees like animals. Some management is okay.
bad,was part time and semi retired and was on absent with out leave from 8/2018-1/18/19 my wife passed on 1/18/19 from brain tumor and went back to work in about a week or so and had hours but hours were reduced. That's retail.
bad,Walmart managers are incompetent. They are unprofessional and I wouldn't recommend working at Walmart. They hire you in for a certain position then change it without telling you.
bad,"My typical day would start with clocking in, getting the required equipment needed to do my job. Scanner and printer.  Check the computer to see who has called in and check with my team so everyone is on the same page of what needs to be accomplished for the day. We would have a quick meeting and then go about our day.  Checking inventory and taking out what is needed on the sales floor. Keep checking in with my team to make sure everything is going smoothly.  I learned how manage a team and keep them focused on the goal for the day. Make sure the freight is making it to the floor to replenish the merchandise to be sold. The hardest part of my job would be having to fight with the managers to get on the same page stop changing the direction of the goals for the day.  The most enjoyable part would be the coworkers that I had the pleasure of working with. Your job is only as enjoyable as you make it."
bad,"While I was attending Bible College in Colorado, I worked at the Woodland Park Super center.  I had a good experience there because I had good management that was looking out for me.  The last store was a neighborhood store and the management was terrible.  It was a very bad experience and I don't ever want to go through that again.  Walmart would a very wonderful place if the management really and truly cared about there people and remain professional"
bad,keep changing things to get rid of full time employees who've been there a long time. they make it hard to want to stay with them when they don't seem to care about us.
bad,"Walmart was ok I didn't like my hrs but it was ok, they do not pay enough for the work that ask you do , the 10% discount wasn't that good , lunch breaks were ok. I didn't like the the black out months because you had to work & they were always around the holidays & being that I worked at the walmart in  houston tx. It was hard to get away to see my family, which I didn't like at at all."
bad,"They hire new people in but have a training system in place that they can just terminate anybody at 1 year.  "
bad,Walmart use to be a very good company to work for but as with many other company things change and not always for the better. I have had numerous positions with the company over a 25 year only to be notified that many of us are going to be replaced with a third party contractor.
bad,"Honestly everything there is awful the company and corprate, dont care for any of there workers. They never will allow a hard worker to go far they just want to leave them where they are so that they dont meed to worry about there job."
bad,I hated working for this company if you didn't kiss butt you got nowhere not a fun place to work unless you want to become a slave people need to be friendlier and more helpful and listen to others
bad,"There is constant work which is never a problem, but the lack of experienced management is one of the biggest problems within the company. No respect is given in the workplace and very poorly motivated co-workers."
bad,Was never trained.  The job was very physical i had to lift and pull very heavy tools weighing about 800 pounds i also got hurt because of an equipment malfunction.
bad,"Most people were miserable or contemplating leaving, Most workers avoided managers so they weren't constantly hastled, some days were very stressful due to managers being in bad moods."
bad,"Managers throw all their work on employees (saw 4 managers take 2 hours in setting up one display because they are lazy). If a manager doesn't like you, they will lie to get you fired. Somehow no matter how hard you work, they have a convoluted way of saying you didn't do anything. ""Benefits"" aren't insentive when they are taking $200 out of your minimum wage check."
bad,"I was told that they no longer was going to have my position open at any Walmart's around my area. Although, the other company's in the area still have this position."
bad,"Don’t get stuck working here to long, good job for work experience for young people, but don’t get complacent."
bad,Not all Walmart locations are the same. My current location is the worst location that I have worked at out of three. Management is poor and the workplace culture is not where it should be!
bad,They hire mostly part time. Then they cut hours for associates that have been there 1 year or longer and keep hiring people which lessens hours even more. It's hard to pay bills when you can't count on enough hours to earn a decent wage.
bad,"As a manager, there is zero work life balance.  One weekend off a month is not sufficient.  At minimum 50 hours a week worked.  Every holiday worked.  Only good benefit is the amount of PTO accrued for long tenured salaries manager."
bad,Walmart is to big of a company you're just a number to them managers really suck and the pay isn't even worth it but a jobs a job wasnt bad you are always busy that's  for sure.
bad,"Didn't seem to be any motivational output from management. All of the interaction with management i had was depressing and discouraging. I was often told by management that the corporate world within the company would never benefit ""us"" the workers ect. Not uplifting or positive in the least."
bad,"If you don't mind support managers that belittle you and that pick favorites then by all means this is your kind of job. They liked to turn their heads when other didn't do there jobs, but they'll look at you and tell you that your not doing your job and then to help others but then get mad that you help to much."
bad,"I was working for walmart for 3 and a half years now good thing i can say about it was you could have very Flexible schedules, it was stable company, discounts, and variety of career paths. But you never know when you could get fired , and the work process always change. Alot to keep up with at times but if you can multitask and ok with frequent changes good job."
bad,They do a lot of favoritism there. Others act like they are better then others. My opinion is no one is better then anyone and shouldn't act a certain way if you are hire up in the busniess
bad,I love my job its self...and what do in side of Walmart. I do not like our upper management team. They suck. They dont appreciate anything you do for them. You could work until your dead and they'll penalize you.
bad,"the manager was unprofessional. someone drop the ball. Instead of direct depositing my last pay, they cut me a paper check. when  deposited it , the payroll put a hold on it. I was unable to get the money for about 2 weeks."
bad,"I was an overnight employee so i had many tasks, such as stocking moving products on pallet jacks, taking items off of trucks. Helping with anything the management wanted me to do."
bad,"Bunch of bully managers. Do not get paid enough.,....................................................... That is pretty much it. Poor managers. Do not give us proper and working equipment"
bad,"overall, Wal-Mart was a fun place to work. I got paid to play with icing and be nice to people all day. Pretty great job but no benefits and the managers are constantly cutting hours"
bad,"Walmart itself wasn't bad, but the uneducated misfits that were management made the summer job feel like a soul sucking ""career"" choice. Encouragement to stay with Walmart was constant but for no real reason, I don't believe they were pressured. Pay was good and advancement is solid if you can deal with it."
bad,Good pay but they don't care about you as an individual. They don't listen to ideas. It's all about making every little penny they can. Everyone is replaceable and they make sure you know it
bad,A typical work day for me was going in overnight to make sure all shelves are stocked. On occasions I would cashier. Managed financial transactions and operated register.
bad,it wasnt that bad to work here but they work you like a slave and take advantage till you break then they want you to work harder and harder untill youre old or you get fired
bad,"Management is not the best, they don’t really pay attention to their associates as much as they should. Customers also almost always get rowdy. Although I have good days sometimes, most days don’t go well due to the lack of employees and disrespect of management."
bad,I was working as a temp slow work got laid off stocking shelves and unloading the milk truck so when you had no work I was unable to work i injoyed my job
bad,I work overnight and they put a lot on u is a hot place it's just a lot I'm thankful I have a job but management could be doing a lot better.  The way the store is ran is just bad.
bad,"This company was filled with great people. The management however were ""tell you one thing and do another"" people. I wouldn't recommend it to many people. My position made work uncomfortable. I would go back but not to same position."
bad,"Highly stressful job with no work/life balance. No days holidays off, heck even getting a regular day off could be a challenge. Bad management. Unrealistic exceptions and goals are given to us from corporate office. Absolutely horrible scheduling system. The pay is OK though and you get enough work hours to pay off your bills. Would only recommend this job if you need to pay bills and can not find any other job."
bad,"Perfect example of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing.They would gave you do something and then the next day change it back, horribly understaffed especially after 3pm when all the dept managers are off."
bad,"I loved working for walmart I've learned a few things"
bad,"Walmart has been my life for about 5 years, my mother in law lives, breathes and will most likely be buried in a Wal-Mart casket. My wife is the same way. However I can not get behind the idea that Wal-Mart is a good company to work for, yes it has a lot of benefits but the management is the worst part about the job, of course it could just be the store I'm working in. It's very hard to get promoted even into the smaller promotions like Department Manager or Support Manager. I had been promised multiple times that I will be promoted or considered for the position if I did a bunch of favors for management like pick up extra work or shifts or helped out other departments, but when it came down to the interview process, I never received one. They always had someone to fill the position from their back pocket as if they had previously talked about it months in advance. Now I'm not lazy by any means, I work my butt off for this company but I can't but feel like I'm slowly losing motivation and confidence in my work because of all the tricks, the lies and deceit thst managers will throw at you just so they don't have to do their job and can get you to do it instead. I've taken the management assesments multiple times to be accepted as a candidate for promotion. Been told by the higher ups when they visited the store that I needed a promotion. But the store management never will promote me. I will stay a lowly store associate forever and my talents are being wasted."
bad,"Most managers werent good save for a couple."
bad,If you get a good store manager and assistant  it could be a great place to  work but definitely if you have a bad store manager it can be stressful and just a bad experience
bad,"It depends on the store you’re working at. My store was in the high money section of Scottsdale, Arizona. All the managers have a gestapo type mindset and try to look busy instructing you on how to perform menial tasks. They are inspired to make you culpable to finish a duty so they don’t have to. Lots of tension when none is needed and personnel department is Gestapo headquarters. They stress that everyone is one big family but they treat each other like stepchildren. Would recommend you go the extra distance to work at the store off Pima."
bad,I would unload semi's when they came in. I would stock shelves. Poor management when it comes to family time off. They would put you in a job that you were not trained for.
bad,"Would start the day off slinging boxes off of a gm truck filled with 2,000 boxes. Each box weighed anywhere from 15-50 lbs. It took about 2 hours and a half of nonstop slinging these boxes. Then from there, we were rushed to stock huge quantities of goods under a time limit in which if you did not reach your time limit you would be penalized in some way. Atmosphere sucked because everyone hated their jobs and were only there for the temporary experience."
bad,some of the managers was lazy and did not care about what you did as long as you got it done. a lot of safety hazards and took over 2 weeks just to get my first interview and then a another 2 weeks to get my second one.
bad,They treat you like a nobody and they don’t listen  to you when you have something important you need to do the overall just have bad management .they don’t treat you  equally
bad,"I would not recommend Walmart as an employer for anyone that values family. They preach people first and work/life balance, but the practice is anything but."
bad,Great place to work if you dont have kids or major responsibility in your homelife. Great pay but quick pace and always busy. Great vacation time.....
bad,good entry level job not so much for a career unless you want to stay with Walmart then you can make the career but you would need to relocate to various locations to do so.
bad,But the assiocates work well with each other. We had each other back when it come to uncooperating customers. But it was good place to work. Been working 4 years never had a problem until this year
bad,"Trabajar en walmart no siempre es la mejor opción oh dependiendo tu manera de pensar, es un lugar donde no es justo nada y te utilizan para cosas que no tienen nada de sentido a lo que aplicaste."
bad,"The job went just about exactly as you'd expect for a summer job at Wal Mart. Being that I was courtesy though I was mostly left unsupervised up front bringing carts in and the very, very seldom times when someone needed something heavy moved that they were unable to."
bad,"No merit raises poor management.Employees not treated fairly.Only care if you are on time.I"
bad,my coworkers were so kind. management could get sloppy at times and could be rude. i told my manager i was pregnant and he loaded me with too many hours after i asked for a bit less. made me stand for hours at a time without breaks and shortened my lunch breaks.
bad,"This was a terrible place to work during my time at this particular store. The store managers ignore the rights of their associates to the point of lying to them about it. I found myself demanding management call home office on multiple occasions to protect myself from them, and despite the fact that management know they must call home office when an associate requests it, many tried to fight my request, and others out right denied me. You will also find yourself regularly being asked to go against company policy, or commit OSHA violations. When you refuse, you will be penalized. If you do what you are asked to do and someone else notices the violation, you will take the fall for it, not the manager that instructed you to do it. Walmart also promises advancement from within, and priority for staff, but will regularly higher from without."
bad,"They will tell you ""we promote we promote"" but they don't often do that ever. Also one bad manager can make working there a living nightmare because workers have no power. The pay is low and they do everything they can to cut hours and keep you from being full time. Avoid working here it's no good, they'll cut your hours and fire you for no reason because at Walmart employees mean nothing."
bad,"If you are young, black, and lazy, you can be friends with the lazy black assistant manager and have an easy job. If you are hard working and white, they won't like you because you make them look bad."
bad,Having to work with customers with no manager help makes it very difficult to help the customer properly. Also enjoyed my piers fast paced working place
bad,typical day-stocking/customer service/loading/product care/inventory control/cashiering/the giving of product knowledge to customers. mgrs.are never available unless they have negative input. the work place environment is it over yet. the hardest part of the job is the pervading attitude of uselessness. the enjoyable part was working outside .
bad,Need to pay more but it was a chill place to work. I came in unload the pallet & put stuff out on the floor that was low or needed to be filled. Then helped in other places
bad,"The pharmacy work isn't bad, it's fast-paced, when there's people to help, you get the excitement of dealing with drug addicts and people who're sick, but most of them aren't bad all told. The pharmacy manager seemed alright all told, he meant well and he worked hard, he also tried to keep us motivated, overall pretty good in my estimation. The only place he fell flat was when dealing with other managers. Other managers who were the bane of my existence. The store manager would seemingly-randomly change our schedules, despite the pharmacy manager trying to set a rational one. An unrelated pharmacy manager fired me because he was in the only functional bathroom, and didn't like that I knocked on the door."
bad,"Poor management,  lack of respect for one another. No disregard for breaks and lunch hr. If they need you they will short your break. Computer training covers more than departments. Managers are not hands on."
bad,Being on the lower end of the chopping block sucked because anyone above you can make you drop whatever you're doing and do something else and you're the one who gets in trouble later by your immediate supervisor.
bad,"I ran pets, toys, and hardware, that was until my wife had a baby. when I returned and found they gave away my job. Why, they said the time off made me unreliable"
bad,They pay didn't match the amount of work they have you do. You get more help from employees than you do managers. Fast paced work. I would work for the company again just maybe a different location.
bad,working at walmart was a  learning experience. I didn't like working there because I had track practice and they didn't understand that. The pay wasn't that good
bad,I loved working at walmart it was fun. It was always smiles and laughs every time you walked in through the door.. it's very beneficial you can take care anything you need and you have enough to save. Out of every pay check
bad,Hard work with little reward or motivation. Most employees needed better on the job training. Overtime hours were always available. Needs better benefit packages
bad,Walmart is a great place to work. Keep area clean and work your best everyday.ask questions if you don't know anything and you would get help from another person.
bad,The whole store’s integrity relies on the employees going out of their way. The managers speak and handle matters unprofessionally. Horrible system for assigning shift hours.
bad,Work consisted of stocking shelves daily and helping customers. They want a 16 hour work day crammed in to 8 hours. Very hard and unfair place to work.
bad,"As a Walmart associate, I do not look forward to going to work. The management at our store is a large reason why my shifts are not enjoyable. There seems to be no accountability when it comes to the front end Assistant Store Manager. The schedules are often unfair and inconsistent, with no flexibility. It is very stressful when there are not enough people scheduled and it is left to one or two people to do all the work."
bad,my review there should be equal rights and new management team for a good place like Walmart associates should be treated equal and  feel good about working for a big company not bullied or disrespected and
bad,The rules regardimg full time vs part time kept changing. About the time one would qualify for a particular benefit the changed requirements would prevent one form utilising them.
bad,"Company itself is trying on behalf of it's employees. People at this particular location are unhappy due to poor upper management leadership capabilities and feel overwhelmed."
bad,management does not communicate. They do not care about life outside of work. They do not care about health issues. They are not organized and put their employees down for anything they do wrong.
bad,"Walmart looks like a great company to work for, and for the most part it is, but once you become a manager of any sort no matter if your hourly or salary they own you. The company only cares about what they can sell, they do not care for the most part about their employees. They allow customers to belittle, and abusive their associates and then reward the customer with gift cards or money off. The only thing they are good for is promotion and their wages. But if you want to work somewhere where your respected and feel like your appreciated I'd advise you to not work for this company."
bad,It's ok place just very stressful at times with not so much good of pay . Managers need to be more understanding with employees. They put employees to work like 3 departments by their seft it needs to be more team work
bad,"the expectations of the company far exceed the reality of the average worker at their stores; associates are expected to not have a life outside of the bounds of the few days off that they're given in a work week. Any time off requests are judged and unless you have a dying relative or are dying yourself, management is unrelenting about how you're needed more at the store to benefit corporate rather than for yourself."
bad,"Did not usually go smoothly when the store was busy, csm's (Front Manger) were always talking with someone, not always the fastest. Either standing around, late to a break waiting on someone or too early, late to leave waiting on someone, learned how to work on the cash register."
bad,"i worked too hard when i shouldnt have because there was other staff to do work and their part. we stayed behind on all work and trucks, the back room stayed cluttered and messy, dangerous areas in the back if you didnt watch where you were going. pallets were out in the aisles and in peoples way made it harder for customers to get around and find what the were looking for. always had to go help out at the front on the registers because they never had enough help to get the lines down. in every department the manager was never around when help was needed by employee or customer."
bad,If you can avoid working there then please do so............................... Motivate yourself to look past WALMART. Management sucks there and it’s very unprofessional!!
bad,"A typical day being a cashier at Wal-Mart is pretty mundane. Clocking in, going to your supervisor to find which cashier you will be at, checking out customers, and keeping the candies and other miscellaneous products neat in the check out aisle. Two mandatory breaks if you are working more than 8 hours I think, which is nice."
bad,"If you need a job that will hire you you've come to the right place. As far as keeping you..thats up to you if you're a good worker and can take the stress, customers and the hours that are always all over the place. Schedule is different everyday, every week in my department. There is no structure. If you're only thing in life is to work then you picked the right job."
bad,I work there 10 years they treat their Associates so unfair cut hours ridiculous to benefit them watch their associate more than they do the customers just a horrible place  and very poor management I actually end up quitting because I couldn't take it anymore
bad,not much to say except that ive been there several years and cannot understand the management practices of this store in particular. New management is terrible at this store
bad,"It was a good place to work for at first, but then they took away all incentives to do better. They appeared to want to force you to do better or they would punish you even if you were physically incapable of fulfilling their demands, which far exceeded what they paid you for."
bad,"Walmart is not an employer I would recommend, they have great training programs, but they are very corrupted with corporate mentality. The company believes everyone is expendable."
bad,You must be reliable and responsible. a good worker like putting 100% in everything you do. You must be respectful to costumers and employees. You must know how to count good and be good with numbers.
bad,"I'll never forget working for Walmart, the workplace whom refuses to hire more associates when needed, and Point Systems which will ensure that the rest, loses their jobs. It was my crucible, and im glad I had the experience."
bad,"Most positions at Wal-Mart involve dealing with the public. Although there is initial job specific training, you basically need to be self sufficient and able to make instinctive decisions."
bad,"Average company, the work was average. I was kept busy by cleaning, greeting, stocking shelves, folding clothes.  Due to job eliminations was eliminated from the overnight associate job."
bad,This job became very stressful due to some store upgrades and it made things a little more hectic. Management was not taking responsibility for their jobs. I worked with some of the best coworkers and they really made the time easier at this job.
bad,"The occurrence policy is unacceptable. The management don't care if their employees are sick on the job that is at risk to getting the employees and customers sick. If an employee gets sent home, it counts towards an occurrence, I really depised that with a passion. I have worked with the stomach bug virus, the bad cold that is contagious, and I have worked with no voice."
bad,Its not the worst place for you to work but is not a place where you will like to grow because they wont appreciate your job and your time is a place for you to grow and learn they need to be more polite and friendly the managment wont work like they have to its just sad.
bad,"Working for Walmart was reminiscent of high school, if high school was a multi billion retail conglomerate. Management was poor at communication and regularly broke Open Door privacy procedures, gave good hours to friends and fired the subordinates of enemies. It was a regular, childish, game of thrones type atmosphere. The money was nice but it's not worth being subjected to constant degradation from not only managers and customers, but coworkers as well."
bad,"the scheduled hours here were mostly nights and weekends.  They did work with my college hours toward the end.  Saw a lot of people come and go, not much retention of employees, but that is typical in retail."
bad,"There was a lot of non-communication between management. I am disabled and let them know before I was hired. I was then told to get carts, which I can't do and was told I needed to provide a doctors note proving my disability. I told them what I was able to do before being hired and they kept trying to put me in situations that were bad for me."
bad,"Se tem muito trabalho, mas pouco empenho da parte gerencial, deixando os funcionários a deriva, um desleixo gigantesco de supervisores e demais que não se empenham em nada, tão pouco estão dispostos ao melhoramento ou aplicação de novas ideias."
bad,Its a pretty mixed place to be at if you enjoy working in a stressful environment and with  unrealistic expectations then this a job for you in this regard I have said enough.
bad,"I worked as an overnight maintenance crew and it seemed very fun to do, nothing difficult about the job itself but some of the other employees sure made it that way."
bad,"very busy store, always understaffed, never enough registers open, I enjoyed interacting with the customers, but the hardest part of the job was maintaining an above average enthusiasm and quality of customer service while working with some employees and managers who really were not concerned with going the extra mile for the customers or the staff."
bad,Walmart had terrible management at the location I worked at and as far as overtime went they put any over time I would accrue as a longer lunch break. I felt that I was not paid enough for the work they had us doing and as far as safety measures they definitely did not take those seriously.
bad,"You'll be removed & replaced around the 90 day mark so that they don't need to give you benefits.  Treat it as a temp job."
bad,"A typical day at work includes cleaness of sales floor,exceptional customer service,zoning time was great was able to help out in organization of different areas of store."
bad,My work day consisted of making sure the customer's were checked out in my grocery line in a professional manor all of my customers loved me management was not professional to me or the customers i did not enjoy my job
bad,"Because managers rotate which shift they managed every few months, none of them really care about what needs to be fixed as they can pass it on to the next."
bad,"I have been with the company for aver a decade and this store is the worst when it comes to management. They have no respect for their associates and to make things mind boggling is the new Store Manager was from an academy store. Good moto here would be ""Practice what you preach."""
bad,Working at Walmart was not a good experience. Management was unprofessional and they did illegal working practices. I would only work there again if I really needed money.
bad,"no fun activities, no support from management not enough salary, no overtime no , not a safe place to work for . not a friendly environment,"
bad,This company could definitely offer more incentives to it's employees. Without having your availability set to work 24 hrs a day 7 days a week it is hard to get enough hours to make Wal-Mart your only source of income.
bad,If you're being harassed by somebody they will not kick them out they will not be down there for the store if your paycheck is short they will not fix it and if you are to the point where you get injured and you have to be out for more than a set amount of days they fire you
bad,"Walmart,walmart,walmart,.  no, NEVER again, no I. Don't think Walmart is a fair place for some folks to work at. Came into the Walmart team as a supervisor over front cashier"
bad,as an assistant manager i enjoyed my job and thought i was making an impact. but one day you call your boss out on something they are doing wrong and the next you are wrote up and on your way out the door.
bad,Wal-Mart is a decent place to work if you are maybe a high school student. I would not suggest making a career out of it. They are not flexible with scheduling and will only give you 3 days to be absent from work within a 6 month period. They do not accept doctors notes.
bad,Since working at walmart i believe grocery stores to be purgatory on earth. the training was minimal and unhelpful. often times i got pulled from my own position to cover a job i was never trained on how to do. very stressful for that reason and due to the customer is always right mentality. Hardest part of the job is the working house. no set schedule or hours you get what you get. The best part of the job was seeing the paycheck whenever it rolled in.
bad,"A typical night at the job is walking into a negative atmosphere bringing positivity with you. Learning what not to do to people in managing my team. And the management that uses profanity on a regular, should not be managing people. Speaking for myself, when one knows himself and who he is nothing can turn me bitter. Hotep"
bad,"At first I was getting 40 hours a week. Then we we're all cut back, got between 30-33 which I guess was good compared to others. They keep you at part time so your not eligible for benefits. Right!? Who needs those!! A lot of drama with particular employees. Dept. I was in was poorly managed.  Schedule was all over the place, you couldn't get a part time job to compensate. Because no one could work around your schedule."
bad,"I've worked here for around half a year and at first you're starved for hours then you work 2 weeks with no day off despite availability. The managers that aren't promoted from your crew do not respect your work at all, I personally am frequently told everything I've done wrong with no positive feed back. Managers from other shifts/ departments have no issue with talking down to you and even showing up during your shift outside of their working hours to do this. "
bad,Walmart is a great job for a person that is retired or just starting in the work field. But a grown person that really needs the money and hours it is not the place for you.
bad,"I was commended for being a good worker and received good performance reviews. However it felt like it was never enough. Virtually every shift I worked I was expected to push myself harder and harder to accomplish whatever was given to me. I felt thoroughly exploited and trapped, and occasionally tossed hollow compliments meant to placate anxieties."
bad,"Was a great company when I started 10 years ago. Now, good luck getting your own truck and any weekends off. I had my truck taken off of me after 7 years with the company and was forces into a slip seat situation. Depending on where you run out of, wait time can be a lot and miles can be few. I finally left after 2 straight months of averaging 300 miles per day. I may have stayed, but In those same two months I couldn't even get the manager to talk with me. He would just hide in his office. The equipment is maintained very well the pay is good if you can get the miles or activities and a first-year driver will get 5 weeks between PTO and safety days. I was at 8 weeks. They micromanage everything you do and have cameras in the truck. The camera is outward facing but it reflect off of the windshield so they can still see you. This is not the same company I hired on with and had turned into a job I dreaded going to every week."
bad,"Management style is ""give them more work than they can handle and see how they do"", makes for a stressful work environment. Most of the workers were friendly."
bad,"As a sales associate the job was great but becoming and Assistant Manager was not so great! Co-managers made it impossible to love the job! 8 years loved what I did last 2 years hated. You work more hours then your salary! I know that it’s not all stores but the store I worked in was horrible to the associates and ASM. Calling home office didn’t help either they did noting to investigate! 4 ASM in two years and no investigation! "
bad,"I would start my day at 4am as long as I could find equipment to work with other wise I would stock shelves or clean. "
bad,"At first, I'd actually enjoyed working for Walmart. I've been an overnight stocker and CAP 2 associate. The longer I stayed, the more I felt the benefits they offered were like a bribe to get you to stay and deal with their constantly changing bull. But it has become a chore to show up to a place that is poorly managed, where we feel underpaid, overworked and underappreciated for the job we do."
bad,They dont listen to you and your concerns at all. Just show up that's it .if you feel you are not doing a 100 % they just keep in a spot where you are not happy.
bad,"Walmart is a ok place to work. You can grow here but the managers should listen to their associates. Walmart can be a stressful job at times, if you're isn't use to hard work."
bad,"it was a job, and while I loved working on the cars management and policies leave a lot to be desired. I don't regret leaving and would not have gone back even given the option"
bad,I worked there quite a few years ago but i do remember the pay was horrible along with management......... they worked you too much and didn't show any appreciation.
bad,"As far as customer relation is concerned it was a wonderfull place to work. The products available and in stock were of good quality, and selection was plentiful."
bad,Solo sirve para dar un poco de experiencia en el ramo de auto servicio sería mejor trabajar en un Oxxo y te explotarían menos y te pagarían mas
bad,"Place is falling apart. Store manager had to tell tons of managers from other store to come to this location. Before getting called by corporate, he quit. Multiple assist managers quit. Team member are always on long breaks and don’t get talked to. But apparently I’m the one that does. Getting in trouble with department manager for help other higher up managers then coming back to the department telling DM about the issue ( DM states “ well you didn’t tell me that you will be gone, you should at least tell us before leaving your department” (totally understand that but how would I know a manager would suddenly come up to me needing help.)"
bad,Its Stressful working for walmart. Management is very Favorited and you can not move up in the company unless you know someone. the pay isnt that great and the hardest part of the job is wondering if you going to be fired because you or a family member is sick and you need to take time off.
bad,it wasnt my thing they just break your back then when it breaks they get somebody else to fill your slot. i didnt think they cared about the employees that works for them
bad,"Initially I did not intend to work at Walmart. However,I am glad they gave me the opportunity. It gave me a chance to get into the work force. I did not work there long. I had quit because I was moving. One of the hardest parts of being in the overnight shift was the returns. There is no way you can get all the returns done on your own. Especially with how you have to run a register AND focus on the returns. The busiest nights by far have been Friday and Saturday nights. And after midnight,everyone goes in late night for alcohol which we are not authorized to sell after midnight. The one part I enjoyed was being able to hold conversations with many people. I met so many nice people when I worked. The workplace normally wants you to be fast paced. Also,you NEVER get any of your breaks or lunch on time during the busy parts of the night. The one thing I do know is management was very understanding. I give them my respect for being very kind and understanding when I handed them my badge and vest because I was moving. I learned a little on the register but I also learned a very important detail. Never do nights for your very first job. I learned my lesson on that. Granted,they work best for my reliable transportation. They do not work best for me. They did a number on my sleep habits for sure. The worst part about the benefits you'd want is that you don't get them for 3-6 months! Some people need benefits within their first month! As for a normal day at work,normally its either at self check out for an hour then to the register by the cigars and cigarettes for most of the night."
bad,"Taking advantage of people and overworking people with no sign of respect for an individual. Managers not listening to associates for their concerns. There's nothing wrong with fellow associates, it's management that won't respect associates."
bad,There is very little room for advancement. They dont like moving anyone from hourly to supervisor positions regardless of background. We also work 12 hour shifts which can be extremely rough. It can cause hardly anytime down between shifts so there is very little life to work balance. We hardly ever see or hear from management or the lab supervisor.
bad,Management plays favorites. They also tend to say one thing and do another. cut hrs to make sure you don't qualify for medical. Very unorganized and priorities seem to be in the wrong place.
bad,"Walmart started out well, but quickly went down hill. People hired was very unprofessional. Gossip was rapid, too many young immature people working here, prompting meetings about the dress code and among other things, the meetings was a waste of time. Training was a continuous thing because there was constant change which made no sense. Pay was not good. Supervisors didn't know their jobs so they were unable to assist associates. When questions was asked there was 20 different answers. No one was ever on the same page when it came to processes or procedures. Walmart employee discount was not worth it.  The only plus for me was my work schedule."
bad,I worked there almost 3 years as a cashier and I barely used any of my pto. The only time I got to use it was if I called out. They never allowed me to take a vacation. Management is terrible and they play favorites. Its difficult to transfer to a different department and my only regret is not transferring to a different store. The atmosphere and co-workers were great but the CSM''s and managers were awful and made it unbearable to work there.
bad,If you you apply as stocker or cashier even an over stocker.stay that position.Don't move up the work changes an not enough time to do anything.cause everything sells so fast an no one works to there fullest.
bad,"I appreciate that I was given the job and love some of the people I've met along the way, but i would not advise to work there because of how you get treated by management."
bad,"Not the best job, i guess it was okay. It was something to help get me and my family by for the time being but not a forever thing for me that's for sure."
bad,Short of employees leaves for having to work harder and take on more hats.  Overtime is discouraged. Associates are not happy to be there. Corporate rules have been tightened up so much anymore there.  If you are looking for a easy going environment this is not the place for you.  Constant movement and changes daily. To make it work for anyone is doing your very best always.
bad,"The pay is well, but the hassle of the people and managers are not worth the pay. If I had better and more understanding managers, I feel I would have stayed here. I feel as though only a handful of our managers truly care for our well-beings."
bad,"Very boring , managers are bossy are rude. Everyone here is always involved in drama. They believe the title gives you the rights to be disrespectful and arrogant."
bad,"The new benefits are nice if you're expecting a child/have a child. However, If I wouldn't have gotten paid as much I would have quit a long time ago. Some of the managers are great but some are very rude and lazy."
bad,"Walmart wasn't a bad job ,actually a nice organization, the downfall is the higher authority, managers such and such, cant try to teach new people by telling at them and cant be rude and to the people who are trying there best"
bad,"Walmart will definitely make you work like their donkey. Fill out a form for welfare and benefits, because Walmart will not be paying you enough to get by yourself much-less to support a family. Everyone will treat like a scum of society. tough road"
bad,Good training program for managers to learn the issues critic to the safety of customers and employees. Pay was good. A lot of compliance responsiblities
bad,Working at Walmart is an experience. You get told many different things from many different managers. It can  be confusing at times but the pay compensates for the chaotic environment.
bad,"Walmart is nice to shop at, but terrible to work for. The managers are rude and do not treat employees with dignity and respect. They focus on dress code rather than working."
bad,This was my first job and I know some of my issues with it I caused myself by being head strong as a child. It wasn't terrible but not one I would ever want to go back to.
bad,"I only worked in one section of the store the Deli. However, it was constantly understaffed. There would usually only be two people to run the whole Deli. And when lunches and breaks came by there would be only one. This often led to reductions in proper rotation times of hot food items and slow customer service at the counter. Creating an environment that was very fast paced and stressful, as the threat of a reprimand or punishment if the regional inspector paid a surprise visit constantly loomed over you. The managers were great and understanding and most co-workers got along. There was a comradery from this deluge of stress, traumatic bonding caused by it. Closing was equally the best and worst part. Because there were no customers one could take their time. However, one still felt the need to rush so as to not get reprimanded for getting too much overtime. But with the previously stated understaffing those who closed often had to cover what people previously in the day should have done themselves. Extra dishes, garbage, ect. So over all I would not recommend working there."
bad,"They don't treat employees right, you aren't paid enough to make a living for bills and food, they don't let you work overtime at all if you do even by a minute ot two you can get wrote up. it is a corrupt company"
bad,"though my time was short I had trouble with the management and their favoritism, they would not openly express it, but would often keep some over while sending others home. the ones that were forced to stay over had to clean up the others messes."
bad,"work place diverse culture , fast paced , most enjoyed being around the public and assisting customers find what they needed and resolved any issues they had"
bad,management sucked and the employees treated you badly. They work you like a dog and never give you praise for your time. That was the worst job i worked at.
bad,I think they could treat their employers better and consider they also have a family and a home they have to go to as well. But I do love the fact of all the jobs I had were very simple and I love what I did. Just wish management were
bad,"Walmart is a job for someone going to college to better themselves, or retired. I wouldn`t recommend it to a person trying to make a living in the area."
bad,"outside of the corprate enviroment in AK the walmart culture dont exsist , your job is always on the line, no raise in 5yrs terriable management staff..."
bad,"I was a contractor for two years and was constantly promised a permanent job, but never got one.They knew when they rolled out their Marketplace that Business Development was never going to be a permanent position at Walmart eCommerce or Marketplace, so they kept us on as contractors until they need for us subsided then let our contracts expire."
bad,This company is okay to work for if your looking for something to pass time by or just need an extra job. Customers have very polite at times and Walmart helps makes sure the job gets done.
bad,unloading truck stocking feight learned how to label product put product in correct areas of the store and teamwork working well with the other associates
bad,The manager there currently is awful. He cuts your hours for no reason and dosnt know what he’s doing. But the supervisors there are nice and considerate towards you.
bad,"Always worried about your job. Market manager treats you without any grain of respect. Hours at work are 12 to 14 hours a day, 4 days a week, and you are only paid for working 48 hrs."
bad,"The Job itself was easy Get the carts in from the parking lot. go help customers with heavier items when called on the radio. The problem was management. Some of them were OK, but most were never happy with us. We were always understaffed, and no matter how fast we worked, it wasn't fast enough."
bad,Most of the time i worked evening shifts i hated it . So i made up in my mind to go back to school and find something i would love . I love what i do now.
bad,Don't work there. It is fine to shop there don't work there.the mangers are not very nice. Some of the other people are nice.but if you do get a job the stay a few years that get out.
bad,"management is very rude and expects you to make walmart your like, anything other than that is seen as an ""exuse"". they are all on power trips which makes it a difficult place to work, alot of people re also doing jobs above their pay grade."
bad,"Was excited to work here and make a difference in the customer experience.  I quickly learned that while teamwork is spoken about to associates, the management team is inadequate and doesn't practice what they preach. Anyone who comes in with a positive attitude quickly sours due to the overall store attitude and culture."
bad,"It is not a bad job, but it not something anyone could live off of. No chance for career advancement. Management and coworkers were fun to work with made the day go by fast."
bad,"This job was only temporary"
bad,"Did not like that we almost never got a raise and the raise we did get was not much but excepted us to do the most work possible for little pay..I would not recommend working at Walmart to no one..could have changed since the last time I worked there, idk."
bad,I have been working for walmart for almost 3 years and they do not care about their associates at all. So many unrealistic policies and rules that made it hard to balance work and personal life. Works off of a point system. Plenty of favoritism and not enough pay in my opinion.
bad,"Always on the go making work fun, customer service and co workers make the job fun. the management is some what easy to get along with. I love working with my customers."
bad,Not bad but the management is not all that great . They have a no call no show policy so if you don’t call in 1 no call no show will result in termination . They do have a big break room .
bad,"No review is needed, most people in the general area know walmart, and have either shopped or worked there, so they know the environment that is associated with walmart."
bad,Beware of Walmart they will slave with little to no pay raise THEY'LL give sum hours all rite!! will have changing your life around just to cut you. BS i think!!!!
bad,"My manager yelled at me every day. She jerked me around and was very verbally abusive. I would not work for her ever again. The other managers in the store let her treat me unkindly for way too long. My coworker used very inappropriate language with me and I was terrified to work with him in the back where no one could see us.He switched all the produce I had organized in the back room all around and made me get written up. I did a lot of hard labor for the produce department and no one appreciated anything thing I did, they just let me be abused by my supervisor until I couldn't handle it anymore and was left without a job."
bad,"Walmart is a Goliath company that has lost it's way. It's a pure capitalist venture with no heart, or soul anymore at least. Great place to shop, awful place to work. Never saw anyone happy there. Saw many good people let go. I pray I would never have to work there again."
bad,Managers don’t handle things like managers should in some cases. Supervisors give a lot of attitude and rudeness plus employees start drama for no reason at all
bad,Its a job and it will feed you and your family. I wish there was more advancement opportunities that would allow associates to start a career oppose to just having a job.
bad,Did not commit to promise's. Would cut hours and only hire for part time but expect full time work. Management had ways of playing favorite. If you don't fit within there criteria you had a harder time with your job
bad,There was a clear schedule for lunch and breaks. Management is really not likely to give over time. They are very strict during the first 90 days and have a point system. If you do a no show no call more than once you are fired.
bad,Management are given tools ad training to help store and employees succeed. But they don't use their training for all employees and seem that they are out to find employee to write up or couch then to work to improve customer service and employee's self esteems. Employees are scared to say anything or to which member of management will help.
bad,Wal-mart is a place I try to avoid shopping let alone working there. The two times I did work there it was not a great place. They care more about the bottom line then their own people.
bad,"Unfair working environment, breaks were not on time. "
bad,"Management is a little outdated with a Command and Control mentality, requiring an almost military approach to not asking questions.  Management are not supporting the staff with providing tools for the job."
bad,very poor management. you never work the job you were hired on for. Too many mangers on shift. Poor communication between managers and team members. They start you out at part time regardless of what you request for hours
bad,"My experience at Walmart was not positive.  When I stood up for myself, and what was right, my ability to ""climb the ladder"" was eliminated.  Before that, I was considered a ""superstar""."
bad,"N?A???? not enjoyed stuck up people, many thing I learnedthe people are not happy, coming to work at 5 am. the best part wzs getting a check………………………,"
bad,"if they way would ofhave been better it might not have seemed so bad, all jobs were timed and those times were very unrealistic, always having to jump to different jobs that were not assigned to you, getting introuble for helping out customers cause ur times were so bad, things like that"
bad,Walmart is good company to work for.  Lots to learn and many opportunities for other experiences.  Workers are friendly.  Management is fair. Part time associates can always gain more hours when needed.
bad,I didnt like the working hours. i also didnt like working the holidays . Other than that i didnt mind it it wasnt a hard job to be a cashier. I didnt really get rude customers.
bad,Not to say that all managers are bad because their are some good ones but the typical experience is that they do not care when you are working yourself to death they just want more. They only see what hasn’t been done yet instead of all the the things that you have done.  They do not appreciate their hard workers and lack the ability to give praise for a job well done.  They micromanage you which is super frustrating for the employees who work hard.
bad,Walmart has its good and bad things about it but the pay is very good the stress you go through is not worth the money after so long. Walmart is one of the most biggest company around the world.
bad,"Unload trucks"
bad,Walmart did not pay very well but had you put in a ton of hours. Walmart is stressful and not worth the pay or worth the lack of benefits that they provide.
bad,Management cares about their job...making the store money. They dont care about employees. They dont care about customers. They care about money and that is it. Every thing else is policy. And if they dont like you  they will legit make up their own reasons to fire you (and have a fake paper trail to back up those fake reasons). Good luck.
bad,Over the years the management for Walmart really really declined to the point that management does not know how to speak to the associates or the customers. Management has gotten worse over the years.
bad,No compensation for the extra work that is put in and when you have issue that you take to higher management that manager gives all your information to the manager that you had the issue with and nothing is done to correct the problem
bad,"Not like it used to be years ago...Ha-vent worked there in years, sure a lot has changed. Left because of relocation.................................."
bad,"Depende de quien administre, por que cada año es nuevo maneger con diferentes ideas"
bad,"I helped set up the store before it opened. I was offered a job in the pet supply department. I had no supervision what  so ever. I had to figure things out for myself. I had to order fish, figure out how to order more stock. We were short handed. I reported directly to the store manager. He promised me advancement and pay increase. After a year of running the department myself and overseeing two other associates and starting to oversee the toy department, an outside manager was brought in and took over the job I was being setup for. I was set back up as an associate. No pay increase or advancement or an apology came my way. Big stores always forget their associates."
bad,i worked there for 7 years each time there was an opening for a department mangier in my department of other departments I thought i might be good at I would apply for them and I would get over looked all because of politics I should have gotten those permutations but because one upper mangier didn't like me i was over looked every time even though I was best qualified for the position
bad,"Not a great place to work."
bad,"Culture and benefits in place are industry best. That being said, it’s a shame field management has forgotten who their customer is and what their workers need.  No longer do the increases in sales drive profit as they once did. Cutting operational cost is now the top company focus. No job is safe at Walmart. Positions have been and are being eliminated often over the last few years. Customer service suffers. Just ask the customers. I fell in love with the culture, lived it, taught it. Dedicated 18 years of my life, personal and family sacrifices to support what the company asks. In the end my position was eliminated without regard to exceeds evaluation scores. I felt betrayed by the person who let me go, then I found out that person was eliminated later. If you seek a position with a future, this is not for you. Starting pay is their only inducement."
bad,"no consistency. no communication. false accusations leading to ""investigations"" which remain one sided and if questioned one was threatened with retaliation."
bad,"I have been working for Walmart for almost 3 years. When I first started I LOVED it. But as time went on I began to realize how much favoritism there is and how poor management is. I started to think it was just the store I work at but other people I know that work for the company say the same thing. Their new attendance policy is dumb. You get 5 points total. Being late is .5 and calling out/missing a shift is 1. After 5 points you’re out of there. They don’t take doctors notes or excuses for kids, family or emergencies. You get penalized regardless of the excuse. Literally.  They have “protected PTO” which you can use but it takes forever to accumulate it to use it because the hours are inconsistent. I honestly wouldnt recommend working here to anyone. They don’t treat their associates right. They’re open on thanksgiving ALL day and everyone works regardless of when you told them you were available and they’re always understaffed. Don’t do it."
bad,"The typical day at Walmart is up in the air, the job's turnover rate is so high that you may or may not have a team of employees show up that day.  You will be threatened on a regular by overworked assistant managers that have minimal leadership ability.  But who can blame them, the only tool seemingly afforded them is the ability to hire and fire."
bad,"Walmart is where you go if you're in a bind or in a transitional period in your life. It will never be a career move and it will never be a choice to be there unless you're desperate for employment. Unless you like working just under full-time for no benefits and just over minimum wage, Walmart should be a temporary job."
bad,"It was a great job until the new front end manager was hired. He was rude, sexist, and unfair. He runs front ends hours at 75%-80% just cause he wants to see how it goes. one poor girl only had 5 hours for a whole week. He got rid of customer complain cards so he wouldn't have to put time into fixing customer problems. Just all round bad manager."
bad,"every time something was put in place to benefit the employees 2 things where added to make things worse for them to compensate, and the there is a no excuses policy for absences, no matter the reason for your absence you get a point, 5 points and your fired, if you go home early for any reason even injury or sickness you get a point as well"
bad,It was a good place to work it was very  Challenge but nothing impossible.I learn alot working for Walmart as a sales associates and Department manager.
bad,"With it being such a big company, a lot of the little people get forgotten. There is little that cashiers can do and we dont get paid much. Would not recommend"
bad,"Since Walmart is a non union company they can pretty much do whatever they want to you and get away with it. From swing shifts to write-ups over nothing, they WILL do it and there is basically nothing you can do. But if you keep your nose down and just lay low it is an easy place to work and not to hard to get through your shift."
bad,Management can work on them selfs a little not the best manager working there. I won’t say there all bad manager. I guess some can approach situations differently. But overall the coworkers and the job was fun and a fast paced area I loved to work for Walmart only if things change in the near future
bad,"If you have a problem with a worker dont talk to anyone about it if they happen to be good friends with management. in my 8-9 years with the company workers constantly fraternize with management. Smoking cigarettes and weed are very much a bonding activity depending on the shift you work on and they dont even hide it."
bad,My time at Walmart was not a pleasant one. I was hired on as part-time but work 40hrs a week. But being hired on as 'part-time' is how they got away with not offering me benefits.
bad,I worked at Walmart for a short period of time. I was always looking to go back into health care work. I wanted to try customer service with the public. I had to work the hours they gave me. There was no flexibility.
bad,This job is very on organized. The managers do not listen. They are very unprofessional. I feel like I work in a high school where every associate and manager is a child there is a lot of laziness and they still have their jobs not many I can say work as hard as I do I can only say a handful of people have the same diligence as I and only two or three of them are managers .
bad,I've been working here for 2 years it's a horrible place to work and the managers dont know what they are doing and the workers like to slack off all the time
bad,"Walmart began as a good place to work but unfortunately management said they would be great but some turned out not to be great. Those that were great were helpful and appreciated employees and their work. These bosses were the ones who kept me there and helped me move up to a customer service supervisor. Three nights a week I am a stocker and two nights a week I am in charge up front. I was encouraged by few management but it was worth waiting for these types of managers. I look for managers who care about their employees which are who I work for currently. I am still learning but we all have to evolve into our work place. Hardest part of the job honestly is how hot it is in the store especially one side of the store. The most enjoyable part of the job is my fellow employees. We have a great group of people and we all work really hard and still seem to smile throughout the night and say goodbye as we leave in the morning. I've been working overnights and am ready to be a part of the ""day walkers"" as we call them."
bad,The people were good to work with management was not. Everytime you would do what they asked you they would change the next day. Then change back the next day. It was not a great place to work. Management team did not know how to lead or manage.
bad,My role was overnight so i didnt get to interact alot with customers. Work was fast paced but the managers did a good job of keeping us motivated. They also helped set a schedule everyday.
bad,They cut my hours after the holidays past and brought in more people to work for the remodeling. Shortly after I decided to leave because of the hours.
bad,for the pay Walmart isn't worth working for part time but work you as an full time without the bnefits in fair rather work at gas station for that kind of pay
bad,"I enjoyed being a cashier for a year, and then I was promoted to a customer service representative.  I gained a lot of experience with dealing with people from different backgrounds."
bad,"I was a seasonal worker so I wasn't there long, but I did see enough. Low pay and low standards means low morale. People pine for their next break. Seasonal showed me enough"
bad,"Would never recommend overnights unless you’re used to it,and they would take advantage of you and work you were ever they could without compensation!!"
bad,Walmart can be a good place for others to work but it’s not for me. Being a cashier at Walmart really isn’t what I want in a career. The environment here can be good at times but it can also get very messy.
bad,"Input and fill prescriptions, communicated with the insurance companies, ordered the medications,operated the cash register. Stocked the medications, filed the prescriptions."
bad,loved the job it was just really hard to stand on your feet for to long . most enjoyable part of the job was making customers happy that they wanted to return to the store .
bad,"Didn't like the fact how same level of employee would be treated different because of their disabilities. One shouldn't be pay the same if it is doing the job of 2 people, I'm just saying."
bad,I'm not sure if all Walmarts are like the one I worked at but this particular store is not run very well.  The managers don't seem to have a very good handle on what is going on within the store.  This store also doesn't treat its employees very well and it is almost impossible to get any real benefits from this job.  The managers have figured out a way around giving their employees full-time status even though the employees work full-time hours.
bad,"I begged for a hardship transfer due to a ill family member that was 4 hours away, and they denied me.i loved working for them until I was denied a transfer. I will never work for Walmart again, you are treated like your just another number and not a human being."
bad,"I enjoyed my job. It was very hands on. But training was minimal and they set unrealistic expectations for ya employees. They said they cared about what we had to say but don’t. Coworkers on drugs, didn’t perform well, people starting rumors and overall negativity. Walmart had a way of making the most positive people negative because the management was so poor. Customers are entitled. Managers that expect you to know everything and don’t know anything themselves. Overall horrible experience. I loved that I could move around and be on my feet, but the people there are what made my experience so terrible."
bad,"While I was only a temporary employee for a remodel, seeing how much the more permanent employees worked and how little they got paid put me off applying after the remodel was done. They applied for full-time, only got part-time, but were still expected to have full-time availability, giving them little time for life outside of work."
bad,I really don't want to talk about working at this place. This was a really stressful high paced environment that really didn't provide much reward or pay.
bad,I feel they were under staffed and bad communication. Had alot of angry customers complaining to me not having their bicycle assembled the promised time the management told them and failed notifie me when I come in the morning. When I was hired on I didn't get much training.
bad,Management wasn't the best I did nothing but work my hardest and also help others on the job without asking. its a shame because my hard work did not pay off.
bad,"this is the type of place that picks people to love and hate. the mangers like to pick on certain people. i literally got yelled at for going to the bathroom! they would change my schedule so often, that i had to start checking it everyday."
bad,"It has been almost a decade since i worked at Walmart. Back then, I was paid $7.40 an hour, just above minimum wage. It was not enough to really pay for anything. I've heard its gotten better since then however."
bad,I was a cashier at Walmart. I am friendly and Harding.i love working as a cashier and sometimes I worked at the customer service area and help out with the lines.
bad,Managers treat you like a dog  and do not help you in the lease. Will right you up for no reason and will not let you progress anywhere unless you are a manager  or higher up  it is a dead end job
bad,"Although the benefits can be good their terms of employment are based on a flaud seniority system that inhibits you from job security and advancement opportunities. Those that are lucky enough become lazy, less productive and bullies to those that are trying to work their way up. Walmart swears by this system. Management does not know how to lead. Instead of helping or teaching a team member how to become more productive they berate and belittle them. Im struggling to even make 30hrs a week while senior team members are being given OT. Ive spent 4.5 months trying to get trainned on MHE but management denies me the equal opportunity i was told i had."
bad,Good job for students. There is little growth opportunities and very low pay. Management is ok depending on your location. Work-life balance once again pay is poor unless you're the Waltons.
bad,"Unreliable hours each week, stressful, chaotic and poor management.  Benefits are expensive and not that great quality.  Very few employees are happy with their current hours and pay, and the company keeps making changes to benefits and amount of hours scheduled."
bad,"There are a lot of really good people there that worked hard and cared about the others they work with. But that didn't stick out as much as the other lazy, selfish, slow workers and management that I would see everyday. I could say a lot more negative things about Walmart but it was a job you got paid to do and I suppose that's all you really need in the end."
bad,"Where do I start? Walmart can be different depending on store. At the end of the day their main focus is money! Not customer service, not employees, not safety but money. Managers are stress and overworked which they will tend to take out on you their associates. No job security will fire people for stupid things if they don’t “like you” for whatever reason. I would only recommend Walmart for part time work during holidays or summers for extra cash not long term pay is ok but not worth the stress."
bad,Evaluó muy bien ala empresa walmart y pues no puedo decir nada mas
bad,Overall I felt more of a number than a actual associate. There was little to no information giving until the last minute weather to schedule changes or overall policy changes
bad,"it was vary competitive, they had a point system that kept track of how much work you did. co-workers where unwilling to help when others where having problems finishing there work. organizing the back room didn't feel vary safe, hauling large, heavy boxes up tall ladders didn't feel vary safe."
bad,Warehouse job. Spent a lot time looking or locating a forklift. You could get from the lift and go back to it and someone left with it.  You mostly needed to complete your job.
bad,"The store was not being operated or managed correctly very unorganized and chaotic, low moral with associates and angry customers, and I worked there almost 11 years and regreted it daily."
bad,"I worked their for like 5 months and the whole five months my csms were rude and unprofessional about their job, my schedule was always getting messed with."
bad,It has probably changed over the past 10 years so I really cannot say how it is now. I did enjoy the fast pave work environment and my coworkers at that time.
bad,wal-mart is harsh and unfriendly work place where the lower rank associates are used and abused. i wouldnt recommend someone i care about to work there. I had to go up in the ranks to stay out of the abuse
bad,"You get trained by a series of computer instructional videos and quizzes called ""Pathways"", these training videos only give a vague description of what you'll be doing in your job and not how you'll actually do it."
bad,work was enjoyable at first but then management starts showed a lot of favoritism and give much more work for the employees that was meant for the mangers. plenty of job opportunities was handed over to other employees less qualified. very stressful due to more management issues rather than from the customers
bad,"While some Walmart Stores that I worked for in the past were great, this is no longer the case. Super low annual raises, (40 cents), uncaring management, and increased work load make associate moral hard to build. Worse is that new hires are coming in at almost the same as associates that have been with the company for 5 years or more."
bad,"Being a cashier was very enjoyable and the responsibilities were fair. However, associates were never informed of policy changes after they started employment. Managers would frequently promise or guarantee something, only to have another manager deny it. Managers would also engage in ethically questionable practices such as dating immediate subordinates or giving away merchandise or credit with minimal to no proof of purchase."
bad,"Worked as a Electronics associate for about 3 years and it wasn't a bad job just be ready to work all over the store with very little or no training at all to help customers like working in fabric but having to go mix paint for a customer, or working in electronics and having to make keys for a customer in automotive because they are closed."
bad,Walmart wasn't a great job but it was a job where I learned a lot amidst its busy environment. The management operated poorly and played politics but our team kept our head down and always got the job done
bad,"I worked in the Online Grocery/ Ecommerce departmment, there you are overworked and stressed out to the max. Lots of orders with a handful of people to pick them and it's hard on the 1 or 2 dispensers (No teamwork). Wal-Mart never has enough people and always short staffed (in every department) because they fire people faster than they can hire them, most of HR is vertically challenged and catches an attitude when you need help. Overtime would be so easy to come by but they tell [not ask] you to kill it by taking a longer lunch. Better not take a late lunch because it's a write up!"
bad,Walmart uses their employees how they see fit. I was asked to stay late for employees who called out sometimes and then they ask me to take longer breaks the following week so I wouldn't hit overtime. The work place is toxic.
bad,Cashier positions are very fast paced and can be hard on elderly people. Lifting and standing can be difficult in this position. Management and pay has changed over the years to better benefit employees.
bad,Working there was fun but the manager i had  was always playing favorites and if you did wrong he doubled your work in the last two hours. i worked over nights it would have been better if there was a manager there who knew how to do his job
bad,Walmart  health  insurance  is good  many options  to  choose  from  new  associates  coming  in all the time   ok training  you will  always  learn  something new
bad,"Poor schedule, it would be one person by themselves controlling the deli, get written up for poor production because of cleaning up what the closer's didn't finish."
bad,Provide good customer service to all.Take care of disgruntled customers due to lack of staff and lack of productivity in some co-workers. Teamwork is a joke here! The lack of proper training for new hire is another joke entirely. Favoritism is a factor with management. Not really any recognition for hard work either!
bad,"temporary job when the store was expanding. i managed a team of 6 people including myself in the assembly of shelves for aisles, stock room and other rooms. Monitored of safe use of tools of team members."
bad,"This company could have so much more potential for how high it is. I feel the company can do more for their employees being how high this company is."
bad,"I didnt get many hours when I was working there, and I also needed a set schedule. The pay was better then my current job, but the hours were not. If I had a set schedule, I would go back."
bad,"The Walmart that I had worked for was very poor. My direct supervisors were uneducated in the sense of managing people. In my department our supervisors would come in the next day of work and not have a plan whatsoever to finish the task that we had been given, being in Cap 2, that would have been unloading the semi-truck/s and assigning associates to an aisle on the floor. On the other hand I worked with some really cool co-workers that made it a lot more workable."
bad,"busy place constantly day and night hard on feet, legs, and back standing for long periods of time, breaks were off schedule, but fun atmosphere to get to know and talk to random people"
bad,i work for walmart 2 days out the week not enough hours.i love working for walmart if they just give me more hours. i love working with my and and mangers at midnight.
bad,I enjoyed the fast paced environment and every day always brought something new. There was always something to do and keep busy. Enjoyed meeting new customers
bad,Although the work was good and kept me active. I did not enjoy working at the Wharton location. Management had no leadership and fellow workers were not held accountable for poor performance or attendance
bad,"Working at Walmart is very stressful and the management will not have your back, Walmart will use and abuse you and leave you to dry when they are done with you."
bad,"Don't do it. As a recent former employee, it's chaos and not.the good kind. The store manager is unjust and even chose to lock clock out employees in on Christmas Eve. He's and Mac Walmart are currently under investigation via corporate office."
bad,It has been several years since I have worked for Walmart so it would not be fair to rate or comment on what it is to work there. When I did work there is was an Ok job.
bad,"newest store manager hates his job constantly hiring from outside the store for higher up positions because ""no one in the store is worth a D"". No one takes responsibility for anything and everyone is willing to throw you under the bus to try and cover their own butts."
bad,Managers are not on the same page and seem to have it out for everyone but themselves. The associates are super negative and seem to put you down when you have goals of your own.
bad,"Wal Mart has a good training program, and encourages teamwork. Pharmacy computer systems are easy to understand.  Benefits are adequate for the industry.  It could be a better place to work if corporate management would focus of patient care via adequate staffing and less emphasis on reducing payroll."
bad,Some of the managers you could never satisfy... People would tell you how to do your job and try to make you do too many things at one and try to make you do other people's job.
bad,"Good place to start getting work ethic skills.   the hours were flexible, but would change rapidly and with little notice.   The expected you on call at all times"
bad,"I heard they are different now , when I worked for them eight years ago it was awful, they didn't value their workers, the managers sat around while the hourly worker suffered"
bad,it is sometimes a good place to work but not always they never treat their employees equally they have no reguard for the employees and their family when it comes to a loved one dieing
bad,"The best part about working at Wal-Mart are the people you work with; since everyone is in the same position, there's a lot of teamwork that goes on. At the location I worked, the senior members of the staff actually looked out for and helped to train the new staff members, and everyone tried to watch each other's backs. The work itself is tedious and thankless, neither of which is made any easier when you have to deal with customers, suppliers or contractors. A lot of people assume that what employees can and cannot do is by their own choice when in fact the vast majority of your day-to-day activities are planned out on the national level from the corporate offices. Attempting to change these rules usually leads to termination or punishment. Add to that the fact that management treats their employees as incompetent and will not take accountability for their own misbehavior; it leads to a rather toxic work environment."
bad,"However, the pay was horrible and no benefits. I really enjoyed the team I worked with. They did not have advancement or offer an opportunity to further or increase pay!"
bad,"Continuous change of management, or none at all was a constant issue. Promises made by one manager was overruled by another, Uneducated new staff would affect our times and quality."
bad,"Wanted you to work in someone else's department and then try to punish you for not getting things done in your own."
bad,"When I walked into walmart everyday for work, I felt horrible. Not because I was tired it was mainly the stress my management gave me."
bad,"Too many managers, very stressful, they overwork all the management. They give you so many departments and they are always upset when the work is not done but overload you with work. You never have enough employees to help in your area. Walmart hires almost anyone so you get lazy workers daily."
bad,For such a well-known company you would think that they would treat their employees better. I noticed that many times employees who were managers of higher rank treated lower employees poorly and made them know their lower position. It makes me disappointed that people can be so shallow.
bad,"The location I worked at was complete chaos. Management was quite condescending and rude, nobody really helped or trained (you were thrown to the wolves so to speak), no real structure, gossip was a big problem, no team effort, NO ENCOURAGEMENT, often went home feeling defeated, overworked. Definitely will get your foot in the door which is a good thing but I suggest that you get the certifications that you need and try to advance from Walmart."
bad,"When I first applied at Wal-mart it was for the Elizabeth store."
bad,I am currently working at Walmart and to be honest I hate it. They poor management and they say they care about their employees but they do not. They will put schedules 3 weeks in advance but you will have to keep looking at your schedule everyday because they will change it and give you 4 points for missing a day that you were suppose to have off.
bad,Walmart has bad management and poor pay for the position I was hired for wouldn’t recommend that position. Cashier position is a good position and pay is okay.
bad,I was offficially hired as a remodel worker; was promoted to the conflict resolution person for upset customers. This was a positive expereince in dealing with the customers.
bad,"There's no building in Walmart no room for growth unless you planning on being a manager. There's no benefits apart from 401k so retirement is out the question, no paid holiday nor vacation you basically have to earn you're own vacation time in order to go on vacation."
bad,Work hours available are limited.  Management was not willing to assist teammates.  Insurance and benefits package is below industry standards. Raises are kept to a minimum.
bad,"I would not recommend this job. Yes, the pay is good but the work is bs. Most of the time, they will make you do the work in your department and other departments. If you refuse, you get in trouble. If they pull you to work in other departments and you don't get the work done in your department, then you get in trouble. Most of the managers are lazy, there are a few that will work hard and help you but others aren't competent at their jobs."
bad,"When I worked there, some over my higher ups were very unprofessional. They would allow certain employees do things but write up if another person did the same thing. The hours were horrible."
bad,"A job at Walmart is exactly what you expect it to be. I feel like it was a great temporary job for me because it taught me many lessons about customer service, but the management is horrible."
bad,Horrible management. Hard to switch to hours you want/need. Very hard work. Always someone watching your every move. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone.
bad,"I cant really say anything nice about Walmart when I worked there, the management team were mean an rude an didn't have very good people skills, im so glad I got out of there, I feel sorry for the people that do work for walmart"
bad,"no structure, need to teach employees how to work properly not just by computer, do like the dress code now, do not like the core hours. Wish that they would work with your schedule versus what the computer puts in for you. Does not give enough to live on."
bad,Typical day after you clock in. Start setting up equipment to do the job for the night.Management was fair.I did'nt learn anything working there. The hardest part of the job was dealing with people attitudes
bad,I loved my job at Walmart! The pay and benefits not so much. They beg you to stay and work due to being short handed and then write you up if you worked more than 36 hours in a week!! Crazy!
bad,while i was working at wal-mart at first i thought it was a good store they treated me like a family but while the weeks and more weeks have gone  by and they started to treat me more and more roughly. it was a good start to come up with some money so i can buy a car and move forward for a better opportunity. but imma say i'm a work driven person who wants to climb up the work ladder
bad,"In my experience, Walmart is like a high school. Management is like the cool kids, if they don’t like you then they make sure your time there is very stressful. If you work hard, they want you to work harder no excuses."
bad,"Wasn't a bad place to work at for the most part. However, there are too many people working there that has been there for years on end. An entry level employee is destine to be in the same position forever."
bad,"It's a good job to start with or to do while you're in high school. Anything passed that and it is awful. Management would write you up for almost nothing, did nothing but gossip, yelled at you if you weren't doing the job of 4 people because they were perpetually under-staffed, and would constantly come in and bird dog you. Then I had one of the managers tell almost everyone that worked there that I had to go and get checked for bowel cancer. Awful place to work, at least in Fort Saskatchewan."
bad,Working at Walmart the past 3 and a half years taught me to be a more patient person when working in retail. No matter what position you hold at Walmart be prepared to learn everything else within the store as time goes on because at times employees will not show up for work and management expects you to take over two positions at once. My particular position required me to do the work of at least 2 people because we were understaffed and management refused to hire any new employees putting more pressure on a small team like mine. We had a total of 6 employees when at least 10-14 were required so work was always stressful and never relaxing. Management was unorganized and never on the same page so it was up to employees to set up the work plan for the day and execute it accordingly.
bad,Would have not taken the job if I had known about the inside of the culture and how it treats its employees. Leadership is lacking across all levels and has lost the human touch for driving productivity and fairness.
bad,Come in and then stretch and focus on loading the trucks. They are not very okay with making sure there is something to do when you are on restricted duties.
bad,"long days, good culture, good people, managers are to stressed, pay is not comparable to same field different company, the best part was clocking out at the end of the day"
bad,Management is belittling making everyone feel like they're not good enough no matter how hard you work they all have their cliches and if you're not in it you're noone.
bad,"I’ve bean working for the online grocery pick up for about two years and it’s bean fine for a shot term job but there’s no way that this will be a long term job. "
bad,A typical day of work I go in unload truck stock shells help other people find what they want and need and try and talk them into buying other things in the store that they didn't know we had to try and make there visit at walmart an enjoyable one.
bad,"A lot of hours and very stressful. Compensation is adequate but expectations are not reasonable. The company is constantly realigning and doing away with the high paying positions. They are not people minded anymore it is all about the bottom line and profit, People and their needs are pushed to the side and not taken into consideration"
bad,really gave me a lot of insight in what to look for in a work place provide training that help me obtain next level job that furthered my career im glad i had this experience
bad,"Very competitive and non rewarding after working 12 long hour shifts "
bad,Walmart was a best place to work when I was working at wart I was feeling free I get many advantage many thing work at Walmart was the best company wel propriated people
bad,"They don’t give many hours after the holidays and you can get treated badly by a CSM without a manager batting an eye. Good pay, but I wasn’t making enough to pay for gas so I had to leave. The highest up manager is super nice."
bad,Management is hardly helpful at times. This job is not for the faint of heart being a customer service manager I've been cussed out in various languages.
bad,"Store Managers are constantly talking at you and micromanaging. Always stressed and fearful of company visits. No clear direction, constant change and eliminating jobs and associates constantly."
bad,"I liked Wal-Mart, enjoyed stocking. Enjoyed the activeness of the job. Had some Problems with management. So it was better for me to do something else."
bad,I enjoyed working with my manager and the doctor.  The store manager was negative and toxic.  I was grateful to interact with him in a limited way.  He spoke to store employees disrespectfully and aggressively.
bad,"If I wrote everything I wanted to say, 75% of that store would be looked down upon, a few fired. "
bad,"Management does not care about you, They overwork anyone who works in the morning. Majority of the work falls on them without any appreciate of all the hard work, They do not listen and change their minds about how they want things done daily but expect you to already know. On top of that, you are not properly trained or equipped to do your job correctly."
bad,"did not really work there long enough to make an accurate assesement, but i went to target as soon as i could. I will never work for Wal-Mart.  they are all about the numbers and not about the employees."
bad,I worked here for almost six months. The day always began and ended with stress. I learned that everyone in walmart lies and often uses intimation to advance. Management only cares about their lives.
bad,"Always stressful,MANAGEMENT yells at employee.Always short on people not enough cashiers to help people out.They pay low,They cut peoples hours all the time."
bad,Management shows favoritism to workers that they like. Management does not take worker that travel a long distance in consideration of others. Also putting people in positions that does not care about the co-workers. They need to better about caring for their workers and also stop showing favoritism to certain workers or people they do for. Better attitudes!!
bad,"There was a lot of favoritism played towards friends or good ol boy system. There was a hypersensitive system towards individuality and if you didn't fit a certain mold, then you didn't advance."
bad,"little to say, the work load is stressful and little to no appreciation from managment, the customers walk all over you and look down on you for working their"
bad,Home office environment is highly stressful and competitive with fast paced duties needed at specific time increments.  Most workplace culture is team settings without collaboration.
bad,Awful environment. Nobody cares about the little guys. Don't even get me started on the people that shop there. Will much rather live in a cardboard box than work there again.
bad,I honestly did not mind working at Walmart until I found something I wanted to do in banking. The place is good but not for someone who wants to move up in a company.
bad,I tried often to talk to the management about changing my schedule to fit with schooling and was ignored over 3 times so I had to quit before I started failing my classes
bad,"wasn't too happy with double standards, and getting told to set examples that the managers themselves didn't follow. Wasn't supposed to be left alone as the only associate on the floor, but I was multiple times."
bad,Working as a cart attendant was fine but I just didn't like the way some managers would act towards me. As a cart attendant they treated me as the bottom of the totem pole without providing any room for advancement.
bad,Learned alot  about job and found it to be challenging. My co-workers were very enjoyable to work with. Upper management was not consistent with schedules.
bad,Unloading the truck and stacking items inside the store was a pretty chill job one hour lunch break and 15 mins every other 2 hours got allong with most managers.
bad,management isnt well put together. the open door policy is no good. over work you for little pay. you cant get in contact with anyone. mix up really bad
bad,That I hate it to my boss in hotel. I not like said not give me anymore fire to me. Cuz am deaf and plus am lost paycheck. It not cool about this. It not respect to me
bad,It wasn't good. You can have 4 call ins for your first 6 months. I got really sick and had to call in 3 times. And the other time I had no way of getting to work. I had 4 occurences for about 2 months and they waited until yesterday to fire me and technically I shouldn't be because one of those was supposed to be excused and it never happened.
bad,"Overall, I had the opportunity to learn of different aspects in Wal-Mart. In addition I was able to develop customer service skills. The workers were great team players."
bad,"You are pulled from your area, leaving you with a lack of coverage. Expected to overperform without proper training. Management does not care when problems arise from the lack of coverage and lack of proper training and scheduling."
bad,I think Walmart as a company isn't too bad. I worked with managers who were degrading and never did anything but complained about everything. It's all about who you are friends with not about how you work. It's super upsetting and not professional at all in my opinion.
bad,"It's difficult to follow company policies in regards to returns, customer service, price overrides, etc. It depends on which manager an associate locates and what they allow to make customers happy. Many times it feels like rules are made up as they go along, rather than stick to a set routine. "
bad,"Clearance & saving catching, open 24 hours, fresh food new product , online shopping, pick up today automotive, money center, customer service clean up"
bad,I am happy I worked there but unfortunately when you have a co-worker who is not happy with someone you know they will make your life miserable I am still hearing things thru other people I never new and it is not true Walmart has a bad rumor/gossip situation drama is not my thing. If you are working with the wrong person who you think is doing things right well my lesson is trust no-one. I want to note I was bulled into signing something in which I now regret. If I could go back I would but it is what it is all I can do is push forward and work with my degree in which that is why I went to school....
bad,"the hardest part of the job is when its most busiest in the store, especially during the holidays. you get to meet a lot of nice people including customers."
bad,I have work at walmart for 2 years and I work there because I need money to race my family and I did not like it. People there was not working together its like they were in the same company
bad,"I have had to deal with managers not caring about personal health problems CAUSED by work. Managers don’t seem to care about the sales floor associates or their well being. Also, trying to transfer is not possible. They ignored my request three times. I do work of department managers and I stay extra time after my shift. I miss breaks to get my work done for a pay that doesn’t even support me to pay rent and bills and groceries. I would not recommend it as a place to work unless it’s a beginners job. No room for job advancement.  And they cut my hours as well."
bad,"All though Wal-Mart is a good and beneficial place to work, somewhere along the line in the 14 years I have worked for them they forgot about family which is what we use to be."
bad,"the day starts  with a meeting.assignments are given and work begins.brakes are given for 15 minutes after 2 hours.lunch of 1hour is given after 4hours.the second brake is after 6hours and quitting time is after 8hours.work will depend on number of trucks,amount of freight, and number of workers"
bad,"Muy mal trato de los gerentes y supervisores, nunca te ayudan en tus dudas"
bad,"The hardest part about working here is the lack of training given. Many employees haven't had enough training in the areas of the store outside of their placement, making it difficult to help customers. Working here while being at school can be frustrating as management don't provide working students to request days off when needed, even when done months in advance. "
bad,walmart can be a very stress full job for supervisiors you are doing your price changes and they would stop you because the DLis coming in and zone or frieght would be left from other shifts and you would have to finish it .thats not the problem the problem is that shift is not held accountable
bad,"Well at Walmart my especially was cooking at dali department  doiing my Best  attending and professional  customer  service.."
bad,I would show up and start unloading the truck and taking freight of the line and start putting it on pallets. Then I would start taking the freight to the floor to out it on the shelf.
bad,"Being a customer and being an employee at Walmart are 2 completely different views. Being a customer, you see a steady-working convenient company. As an employee, it was h*ll. They took hours away from current employees to train and work new hires. Managers did not respect workers much and having a second job was prohibited for some unknown reason, despite the fact that my hours at job #2 never interfered with my hours at Walmart"
bad,"Job is fine, however the management is a joke. You have no job security it's like they want you to fail so they can replace you with someone knew. The management rewards those who follow what they want and do not follow what is effective and what the company says."
bad,"very unorganized, management seemed lost to their job responsibilities, it's an ok starting job to have depending on position. not a good place to start a career"
bad,Most days they did not have enough people to work so you were moved a lot to work a different part of the store to help because of not enough associates.
bad,Cold in the winter and hot I. The summer.   No real breaks. Called in a lot because of call in and the schedule was not flexible even in emergency in the family
bad,"awful company to work for, theyll over work you and under pay you, and managment dosent care at all about you, the only small benifit was and hour lunch"
bad,Overall the job became overwhelming as management would schedule poorly on busy days. The department managers would throw most of their work on the sales floor associates and expect them to put out inventory and also help customers. Overall the job is not the worst but definitely for people with a high tolerance and forgiving attitude.
bad,No promotions. Could be more better if they improved managment . Overall the customers that came in were nice and enjoyed helping find items or helping in anyway as possible
bad,"It's a very relaxed kind of environment, nobody seems to be working too hard. You have to keep yourself busy a lot or the mamagers will come around and yell at you. The managers are not that great."
bad,Ever heard the phrase under paid and under appreciated?  That's Walmart in a nut shell. You work your fingers to the bone and there is hardly anyone to help out.
bad,Always be pleasant when helping customers at Walmart.; that is one of the selling points of a good sale.  And know a little bit about fabric is also helpful.
bad,"The hours suck.The pay is ok,just not really enough to live off of.The management does not care about you or what you have going on outside of work.They also will overlook more suited employees for raises or advancement."
bad,"take over your life, no holidays off, bad hour, over work, low bonus in certain stores. Barly any team work every one only worry bout there own area. not worth it"
bad,In my opinion walmart is a great company as a whole i just had a problem with a staff who was a manager . The manager would say inappropriate things to me then when I told another manager they just brushed it off so i quit because i didn't feel comfortable
bad,It was ok working for people that were for the most part very polite. it was corperate management that came in every morning and just completely ruined the atmosphere.
bad,"when I started there it was a good place to work, with good pay and decent benefits. seventeen years later, is was a zoo run by rabid weasles, with good pay and half way decent benefits."
bad,"At the beginning of the shift I ha e to unload a truck, which could contain 2000 boxes to 4000 boxes and or have multiple truck in a day and we unload the boxes and place each one in it correct bin, the we stick the shelves after the truck is done, the management sucks, but the employees are all friendly."
bad,"Management is so poor at Walmart, you can get in trouble for just about anything. They use write-ups as a motivational tool. And if you slow down to less than a total sprint, you are more or less scum and unable to work there."
bad,I found this company to be not only disorganized but on the border of cruel to their employees.The annual pay raises were very small and the work load was extremely high.When I was laid off every employee was being pushed down to part time and no one could find part time work to adjust to their rotating schedule.
bad,The job itself was great but the management was awful. They pressured you into impossible timelines that you had to make work. The coworkers would all but sacrifice you to get ahead. Overall terrible place to work.
bad,Walmart distribution is stress full job where the management act like high school kids that neglect parts of there jobs because they don't like that part and expect the lower employees to pull there sick plus there current task there is no Ac or heaters and the water may or may not be cold by
bad,"If you want to just work and make money - this is the job for you. But if you care about work, management's appreciation, and for work to be done in some what of an ""orderly fashion"" - this is not the job/career you want. Management in Wal-Mart is beyond stressful. One manager says to do this, the other says do that, it's like tug-of-war. Most people do not believe managers set the mood for their employees, customers, and numbers in sales. My Wal-Mart is proof that do not excel in all those categories . They over work you, especially if you're the early morning CAP 1 shift. This is one place that allows ""bad workers"" to do what they please (steal time, walk around, work at a very slow pace) and ""good workers"" to constantly be picked on and over worked."
bad,"My experience with Walmart was a rocky one, they barely gave hours, costumers were always arguing. Walmart needs to step up on costumer service needs and after that they would be as amazing company but they don’t treat their employees fairly"
bad,I've talked to people at several Walmart's so I know it's not just my store. Management hides and doesn't answer calls or walkies; they can't seem to make a decision and/or stick to it; they have little to no compassion; they'd rather fire people than work with them knowing there is someone else vying for their job anyway; they do not treat everyone the same; they are inconsistent with disciplinary action; management acts like they are doing you a favor by helping you and/or like you are bothering them by asking for help in the first place; they are narcissistic at worst and egotistical at best.
bad,"Just like any retail company that you would work for. You are going to deal with crazy, rude customers and employees. Managers who have their favorites, and of course working crazy hours"
bad,"Management would hardly ever help, jus nag.  Always threatening, never complimenting.  Never could keep management happy.  The management did not care about people."
bad,I did not enjoy working at Gilroy Walmart because they had no type of human respect .. no training just throws you on the floor and makes you learn on your own
bad,The creepy customers and  people who bring kids in at 12 am and stay till 7 am when they should be in bed. Customers would mess up  things that you already stocked. The mangers suck and there would be no help  at all. There would be tons of things to in a little time in two big sections by yourself.
bad,"Use to love to work at walmart now new management running into the ground."
bad,Not a good place to work. Poor management that doesn't care about their employees. Customers are very rude and employees have no say in how they are treated by them. Very low pay.
bad,"I did not like working there, because , they only put me in cars and would not move me up or do anything else.  the people there are nice, but, it is hard to get advanced for people who are from out of town."
bad,Walmart is a good place to work in. I think maybe the location I worked in was a little messy and management wise it was a little biased. Overall it was and alright place.
bad,"Management overall is very poor. Lack of accountability for those that need it, while others are rode when still exceeding expectations. I worked just over 3 years for the company with no issues up until a few months ago when management switched and the favoritism began. Since then have been forced out of my position for silly reasons."
bad,Walmart is a good paying job but the costumers aren’t very nice all the time. management have low communication skills. And the environment around you is very stressful
bad,"Rien à ajouter"
bad,Customers will yell at you. Upper management can not come to cohesive agreements on how you should do your job. Overly fast paced. Takes a toll on your mental health.
bad,We had an awful person running our remodel. He thought we knew what we were doing on day one without being told. He immediately starting talking down to employees and many people walked out and never came back.
bad,"Non-stop work , walk in the door up and going, harsh reviews, lack of proper management, long days or nights, production is #1, 24/7 running, breaks are short"
bad,Larger retailer cut original benefits to pad managements pockets. Loits of favoritism. Backbiting and lack of trust issues. Company was great when I first went to work for them but as the years passed. company changed and not for the better.
bad,"I like the work and I’m good at it, but a lot of the people that end up working at my specific store are angry and mean. Most people end up quitting or getting fired quickly after being hired so we are low on workers."
bad,"clocking in , printing out my schedule of my associates ,placing associates in the areas where i need them, checking my call in list ,proving my associates with the equipment need for the job checking to see all picks and capping is done making sure freight is worked then make sure all mark downs are done , cleaning zoning helping customers proving associest with help when needed doing the throwaways and donations making sure all equpment is turned in."
bad,They used a bait and switch process to fill undesired positions. I went in to interview for a cashier position and because I wasn't pretty enough I was directed to a stock position. They incentivize this by putting the cashiers on a rotating schedule making a normally easy job difficult.
bad,"therefore an individual responsible for managing the inventory system of the company. His/her job description entails making proper account for items being brought into the company, as well as taking account for their sales or disposal."
bad,the management in this job did not know alot and were not helpful. working with fellow workers was ok but when it came down to it i would not recommend worker here.
bad,"Not the worst place to work, staff was good, management was atrocious, the audacity of the expectations they had for you was unbelievable. You were put under so much pressure for such little reward or respect."
bad,"I wanted to leave my job since the 3rd month working but I stayed for 23 months. Iv'e had enough, I know my worth and they don't care to give me a raise or any better opportunities."
bad,"A typical day at Walmart for me generally consisted of handling my duties in my department, then being given unreasonable deadlines for such tasks. Once about half way through the first assigned task, I am given 8 others with even more unreasonable deadlines, threatened with write ups if I don't complete all the tasks in that time frame and repeatedly pressured by managers to hurry up. When I say unreasonable deadlines, I do mean unreasonable, something that takes anyone 3 hours to do, they expected done in 20 minutes..."
bad,"Inventory control, heavy lifting involved, employee moral low, little opportunity for advancement, high number  of unsafe situations with unusual customers and employees."
bad,"a typical day you come in stock and go home rinse and repeat."
bad,"Its Walmart everyone knows Walmart. frozen department. pallet jacks, pulling 2000 pound pallets, cashier is crazy, management is crazy, co workers are nuts"
bad,"Alone and cleaning the deli most of the time. Had to send random people to help. Trained people on things we hadnt been taught correctly. Very late nights, get in trouble if go over but only 1 person there to work an cant close early. worst job."
bad,"Working at Walmart seems to be a great starting place for a high-school students first job, unfortunately, it isn't. Many of the managers and higher ups simply have no consideration or concern for any of the workers lives outside of the store. For example, my school has many mandatory events for it's various programs and showcases, my managers wouldn't allow me to have the days off to attend these mandatory sessions, since I was desperate for the money, I had taken the hit to my grades by not attending the mandatory events. Also, they'd see any possible opportunity to berate the younger employees. They start kind and benevolent at first, but after the first week or two, you're considered, common, replaceable rabble."
bad,"The managers are really rude, family deaths aren't taken seriously by supervisors. I was litterally told to stop being a baby when my aunt passed away. Yelling at you in front of customers."
bad,"walmart gives lots of hours, but rewards very little. a good company in terms of giving break time. great coworkers and very helpful managers, very flexible for hours."
bad,"Enjoy my co-workers, however the management team is hard to deal with. The communication is terrible. One will tell you to do one thing, the next will tell you to undo it, while the next pulls you completely from the project to do something else."
bad,"Walmart, Carbonear is not big enough, management is horrible to workers and do not listen to their concerns or help with time away for school activities."
bad,I thought it was a good job job to work at. But the managers can be a pain and The salary is to low. The hours are not enough to take care of a home. You can’t get any overtime
bad,"I learned that I needed more in life, which lead me to move forward. Walmart was an okay place to work but I desire more for myself. Hardest part working there was dealing with the difficult customers."
bad,"A typical day at wal-mart included gossip from your peers, stress from management who wasn't involved or educated, and some very strenuous manual labor"
bad,"Pay is good and benefits are good only if a full time associate. Poor management, they can be very disrespectful. When asking for help with things you never get it."
bad,"Salary and benefits were below average."
bad,"Lack of communication, lack of training, seasoned managers sit in the office on facebook instead of out assisting team with customers or helping customers. Overall lack of leadership."
bad,I wouldn't recommend Walmart as an employer as they don't communicate very well when hiring someone and could care less if you're sick or not if you're scheduled to work you better or else they will fire you.
bad,Crazy work hours. very fun at times when engaging with team members. customer service was always a priority both internal and external. A day at work was working as many departments as you can and help as many guest as you can while focusing on staying in tock.
bad,Don't really have much to say as this was a temporary position. I was on the remodel team where we stocked shelves. Atmosphere was ok but management doesnt really know how to take employees suggestions to change certain things that might help things move more efficiently
bad,"Working at Walmart PRIMARILY for the pay isn't too bad, that is if you get a decent schedule. The management is extremely horrible; there are a select few managers that try to run the business correctly, while picking up the slack from the majority of managers, all while the sales associates get the blame. The pay is decent but the income becomes quite small due to the fact that the schedules are incredibly inconsistent; most times I would receive 8-12 hours a week, while I would receive 20-30 hours a few select weeks (keep in mind that I am considered a full-time employee). Other than that, the job culture is incredibly dull and draining. Most co-workers talk about how much they hate their job, all while you endlessly feel like just leaving work because of how unenjoyable/unrewarding the actual work itself is. I would suggest this job for temporary employment."
bad,"I have worked three different Walmart and each one is different and run so differently from others. I was able to reach a new department from just sale to manger in a department. after leaving to transfer to another store in different state. I found out how bad Walmart could get. poor management"
bad,I had a hard time working here. As a part time employees they had me working just barely out of the full time hours. They were good about making sure you got your breaks and lunches on time. It was highly underpaid for the amount of work that was being done.
bad,"My summary says it all. There are too many people with manager after their name and nowhere nearly enough people to do the work. To be fair, I don't enjoy my job (it's too early in the morning - 6am, and how tasks are to be done can change nearly hourly, leaving me tired and frustrated), but I do like some of the 'worker bees' that I work with. I feel that many of the management got to where they are either through affirmative action, (meaning they aren't qualified to do  the job they are in through merit) or they have come from some other organization and don't actually have a clue how Walmart works because they have never been one of the worker bees.  It is a toxic workplace, but a bad job is better than no job... They do offer some benefits, even to part-time people, but in the case of sick days, you have to be off sick for at least two days, because you will not get sick pay (if you are legitimately sick and not suffering from ""payday hangover"") for just one day, and if you are sick more than two days, you have to bring in a doctor's note - fair enough.  Therefore, many people come to work sick, since they cannot afford to lose a day's pay, and thereby spreading the germs around. If you quit or retire after many years service, you will lose the accumulated sick days pay, even though, you have 'earned it', by being at work regardless.  (The only way to 'cash in on this'  is to be 'sick' for your two week notice of quitting - dishonest, but what else can you do?). The other thing is, the lack of accountability. Too many people do a lousy job, so that others who have their"
bad,"the empolyees were nice to work with, but the management was not good to work for, they were very rude and had to change my hours because I was failing school and they took me completely off the schedule"
bad,A lot of the managers at the Store that I worked at played favorites and set ridiculous goals for work load. They rarely follow they're own policies especially when its isn't benefiting them directly
bad,"They are a unfair company to work for, it's not about how hard you work it's who you know and can suck up to to move up. The customers are horrible the store is gross and you are expected to do way over your pay grade. My managers were really nice but in the long run it's all about who you know if your a hard worker and one person doesn't like you that has pull your gone. I would not recommend going there unless you have Nothing else."
bad,"I work in multiple tasks .. customer service, Money center and regular cashier."
bad,I did like work with the crew members that were on my shift my job description was to assist costumers with take out with large items. And stock shelves throughout store.
bad,I did enjoy working with some of my coworkers and I did enjoy my customers and being able to interact with them. I also liked the fast pace but it came to a point where management started to become poor and did not always do what they say they were going to do. If there was an issue it wasnt always solved and j felt like they ayed favorites because there are people that have exceeded the maximum amount of points and still kept their job as to other were fired right on the spot. I didnt really like that I feel that everyone should be treated the same and if you max out your points you should be fired just like everyone else does.
bad,"At first it was a great place to work as I had asked for every second weekend off which I did initially get until a new manager took over. I felt like it was getting to be too much as  I was hired as a cashier and not a sales person. Always had to ask if customers wanted to pay for bags, if they were interested in the Walmart Master Card, or if they would like to donate to what the cause was at the time. Customers would get very irritated and would get yelled at. Management didn't care though because they weren't the ones being yelled at. It was all about the numbers to them for Donations and Master Card sign ups. I found Walmart was very disorganized and multiple employees would quit all at the same time. The pay was absolutely horrible and if you didn't get enough master Card sign ups and it was time for a review for wage increase....you wouldn't get it because of that. I bent over backwards for them and never had a complaint from a customer but it just doesn't matter to them."
bad,"They're in the process of doing a whole shift of policies within the company and nothing is working out/making sense. On top of that, the first week I was hired, I could feel the toxic energy and negativity from coworkers badmouthing each other. Good people left, bad people were promoted and made my job more difficult than it needed to be. If you ever wanted to move up, you had to kiss up."
bad,"I worked at Walmart for an estimated time of 1year . while working I was pregnant and high risk. I was able to get a stool every time I clocked into my shift for this very reason. Now, they weren't required to do that, they had the right to refuse that request from my doctor and fire me. But they didn't and were always so helpful to me throughout my stay with the company."
bad,"Changed rules when it suited management, did not give credit for good work. Always critical of everything you did. Never sure of your job security, always stressful."
bad,A good place to work at for everyone. A typical day for me is great customer service with a friendly smile. Direct customer to the areas needed. Giving information about all products in the electronics dept. paging for customer service in other depts and cashiering. Restocking electronics items and securing with alarm spider wraps. Maintain a clean area and do safety sweeps.
bad,in order to climb the ladder at walmart you must live and breath walmart. managers dont really care unless your kissing their . they dont give associates any financial help unless your behind on your bills.
bad,"Walmart has been rapidly declining over the years. With the advancements in technology and the way customer shopping continues to change so does walmart except they seem to forget about their associates needs as they do so. The managers offer false promises and encouragement while talking disrespectful about you behind your back. If you don't brown nose than your chance of promotion or training so you can get promoted is almost nonexistent. You do form close bonds with the other associates that are at non salary position, but it is mainly formed by the feeling of being overworked and angry with the higher ups. If you are desperate for a job and do not plan to stay long than go ahead and apply. Otherwise look elsewhere."
bad,While you have the potential as salary to get some pretty good bonuses it is not worth the time and effort you put in. The overall culture is lacking and there is little to no accountability for those that don’t pull their weight.
bad,"typical day at work is make sure the self check out machines are up and running properly, make sure they are filled with bags and cleaned off, Learned about the customers and what they like or dislike abut it, Management needs to change drastically  there is no communication, lack of respect , hardest part of the job is to keep an eye on customers checking  out there items, most enjoyable about it is you get to see your regular customers  and also knowing that you are there to help them in any which way you can,"
bad,"Managers not organize, they get things done late at the last min. They let some department have slack why others have to work extra in other department than their’s."
bad,"leadership politics,favoritism,not enhancing associates skills and abilities and not giving enough training for associates."
bad,"Starting pay is good. Problem is everything is your fault literally. The lines go down it still your fault. Waiting on replens, slowed down cr speed, your fault. If someone knocks something down and it hits you your fault again. If someone runs into your car on the way to work your fault again. You get written up every week. High stress super hard labor. Nobody lasts long in this position. Wouldn't wish it on anybody. Production goals extremely crazy. High turnover and dangerous work environment. Lots of angry people working there.You will hear a lot of cursing and complaining there. I did have a cool manager though on my shift."
bad,"if your fast on a till...they will make use you  good as a first time job but hard for some"
bad,"long hours expected"
bad,A typical day at Wal-Mart would be standing behind a cash register for a few hours. The hardest part about the job would have to be how complicated the buttons were when I worked there.
bad,"I was employed as a dairy Associate. The job was fast-paced and always busy. With the amount of work in the department, it was a two person job, but the store manager only wanted one person working at a time in the department. As a result, not everything was restocked in a timely manner."
bad,"It's a good place to get your feet wet if you are seeking a career in retail or if you want to earn some extra cash once you have retired, otherwise you are just a number to this company. Sam Walton is surly rolling over in his grave because his once wonderful chain of stores have done to pot!"
bad,The on hands training is minimal. They throw you in and let you sink or swim. They cut back on staff to increase salary. They expect to much from each person. No one is happy there. The benefits  are not bad.
bad,"Management took advantage of employees. I don't recommend expecting to work there for more than a month. It's tasking and many of the managers will push you to the point of exhaustion. Lacking in a good balance in work and life balance and other major holes, Walmart is a business I wouldn't recommend."
bad,"Most of the Walmart’s I’ve been to shows that they don’t care about the workers. And to be honest, they barely care about the customers aswell........"
bad,I was a 3rd shift frozen stocker and consistently had too much work for one person to do. I never had consistent help other than when a remodel happened. Overall I was not a fan of the job requirements and most of the managers were lazy.
bad,"I am a long term employee, I hardly ever take time off, I'm punctual and stay until the job is done. Yet I am grossly underpaid and save the company the most money in the region. There is no reward for good work at walmart and they do nothing to retain good employees."
bad,Walmart is not family oriented. Your hours are very inconsistent and you rarely got your schedule on time which conflicts with being a full time parent and part time student.
bad,You have to go through so much to get time off for emergencies and it’s so hard to get somebody on the phone when you have to call out or even if you have to talk to somebody the longest I sat on the phone for personnel was an hour
bad,Walmart was difficult because management is not trained well enough to deal with all the daily issues and lack of adequate staffing. You always feel undervalued and overwhelmed.
bad,"A typical day at work. Preparing for the days tasks"
bad,Working at Walmart was a great impact on my life and choose to look at this experience in a positive way! I developed great people skills and helping others.i developed and learned the computer system which helped me later in life.
bad,"This position has solid hours, and is always needing more people. Some other associates can be frustrating as it seems they don't separate their personal lives from work. Everyone in this position is paid the base rate, but are required to do more work than most other associates. As long as you do your job correctly, and don't take people too seriously, this is a decent job."
bad,I learned how to use a computer. i didnt really like management because walmart doesnt care abouttheir employees. the hardest thing was honestly working there.
bad,"cleaned all areas of the store"
bad,"Was very unhappy they put you in any position they like, say you applied for a cashier position you werent likely to be put there they would put you some where else. the drama was bad the managers didnt care about you or anyone. The hours sucked they would cut hours so often."
bad,Managers usually bark orders from the back room office and rarely get there hands dirty. Work load most days was not realistic and managers only care if you got your job done so the manager above them doesn't fuss at them.
bad,Don't work for Walmart. There's no future in it. Your family will be used as weapons against you if they think you're a threat to them. You're better off working eleswhere.
bad,The management didn’t know what they were doing or how to do it. Upper management always took forever when they were need to be with you and a customer. When needed help or questions about a transaction asking management was useless because they would ask the employees the policy.
bad,"Walmart was inconsistent with my schedule , they had it mixed up , the managment was to bossy and rude. I couldnt clock in and the claimed they tried everything they could to fix , i was constantly looking for someone to help clock me in."
bad,"I  would just stand around and check people out"
bad,Been a employee for 9 years seen a lot of change and not for the better..time to move on to bigger and better things..walmart is not the only place to make a living which is what they don't want you to think
bad,The managers do not factor job performance or job longevity into your jobs salary or job advancement. They are only interested in giving raises and promotions to their friends.
bad,Customer service standard Level were kept with high paces and sanitary condition kept at the highest level customer service nice place to work for young person starting out
bad,Lazy management and needs to listen to others more often. They do not supply employees with things they need for their job until it is way over do. Store needs to be upgraded along with the registers. Never enough stock available. Never enough associates to fulfill every department. Not enough management available when employees need key turns and change.
bad,"My manager when I started was wonderful but she ended moving to a different store and my new manager was very flaky. He would sign off on vacation requests but not give me the vacation time off. I was constantly having to remind him about my days off requested."
bad,"Ok job, good pay, micromanaged to the extreme.  No room to grow as a person or as a team if lead tech is lazy.  Stuck doing jobs others don't want to do and not trained to do other more seasoned work"
bad,"during the time i worked for walmart, from start to finish of my shift everyone had their own job for the night such as sweeping the store, scrubbing the store floors, cleaning bathrooms, cart pushing in parking lot, it would change for most people every night, at one point in my years at walmart i learned to stock shelves and push freight to the floors to be stocked"
bad,hardworker help people kept place clean and very dependable. At one time it was a good place to work but over the years i have exprience that they dont care about the people that has been with them over the years..
bad,Have to be buddy buddy with management to move up in the company. This place not good to work for. Everyday something changes. There is not good communication with anyone
bad,"Never a dull moment. If you're not being yelled at by a customer because it's your fault that something isn't in stock, you're being yelled at by management for something stupid like not having all three buttons on your shirt buttoned up instead of two."
bad,"something i didn't like working here people was not pay right under pay, they want more out of you then you can give them. Some Customer where very nice and some was not."
bad,"Year after year this company gets worse and worse.  You work your butt off to be promoted to full time.  Then work your butt off to learn the company.  And even if learn as much as you can,  they will not promote from within. "
bad,Great environment and employees. Manage chose favoritism and pressured those they didnt have interaction or a great rapport with. Not a great experience and being timed while stocking felt like slavery becuase of projected time
bad,It pays ok but they don’t want to hire anyone full time so they don’t have to give you benefits and they don’t care about the employees they only care about making money
bad,this job was a little harder team members were rude other team members never use to do their work I didnt enjoy this job. I did do all my job requirements that i was told
bad,Night shift is very busy sometimes we have to unload the trucks and run the freight get it done before our shift is over and have over stock put up and zoned done before we leave.
bad,"Walmart started out great. I worked here for two years, and I enjoyed my job. I love the people that I work with, and I do enjoy my work, and the bonus in March is always super nice to have. "
bad,The thing about Walmart is they love to over work you and as much as u have to do isn’t worth it at all it’s painful on the body and very stressfull or at least my position.
bad,"I was given only an hour of training for my role then i was sent out to do my job with hardly a clue on what to do. The management could not and would not get their act together at all, they were always at each others necks and would go out of their way to take out their frustration by making the day harder on their employees."
bad,The managers suck at doing there jobs and they get mad at you for stupid things like going to the bathroom they are always standing around the back room talking and laughing and when you call the store it takes forever to get ahold of the manager your trying to reach
bad,"I did like working there , they weren’t really as strict unless you weren’t moving around and doing your job of course. The only reason I couldn’t work there anymore is because I got injured and they found someone to take my place so I couldn’t come back."
bad,"The raises are very very very low, you will receive more of a workload to cut down on hiring other employees. Pay is not competitive. Worked around a lot of people that could give more effort into appearance and their work ethic."
bad,"Poor management, understaffed and the workload is absolutely ridiculous.  As far as what is expected of you on a day to day basis is enough is never enough no matter how hard you work. Hard work is not not rewarded."
bad,I shop  at Walmart and recommend it to family and friends. Fair prices not competitive pay is the only thing I would have to say could improve on.....
bad,Interact with customers to make sure they find what they are looking for.  Make sure to maintain appearance of sales floor during shift.  Assist in bringing merchandise to sales floor.
bad,I worked there while in high school and the year I took waiting to Join active duty Air Force. I made minimum wage and lived with my parents. It was fine while in High School but no as an adult.
bad,Mainly at Walmart the jobs are  alright! Enjoyable part about the job is you meet new people. You are always busy which makes time go by fast. Downfall at most locations is the Bosses.
bad,"Managed inventory and conducting daily and weekly inventory cycle counts with accurate discrepancy reporting."
bad,"The worst thing about this store is they don't promote people based on their job performance it's who you know and who THEY want. I was told by management to apply for promotion's numerous times only to find out they had to have a certain amount of people apply before placing who they wanted.also poor management, treat there employees like dogs"
bad,"i wouldnt work here ever again, they dont know or care for ther customers and the associates dont know what they are doing or even help you when you ask them a question"
bad,"I would rather not comment on my time working for Walmart Pharmacy.  I had a great experience working for Walmart Pharmacy in Monument, CO but my time working in Ohio and Vero Beach, FL was not a good experience."
bad,"i wouldn't recommend Walmart to anyone unless you are desperate and absolutely need a job right now, i worked there as an unloader for 8 months didn't get a raise even though i practically put 110% into my job. hard to get noticed or move up inn a place that has that many people working there"
bad,management was always changing the policy when ever they wanted to. Gave you too much work to finish in a 8 hour work day and didn't want you to do any overtime. made you get rid of any overtime by taking a longer lunch or come in at a later time then you was schedule.
bad,"The only thing I did like about the job,is my coworkers. they are the best people and they are the reason that I kept coming back to my job. But if you really need a job then it would be ok to work their."
bad,"It's ok for a kid or retiree or a second job for extra cash but not if you want to go somewhere in the company. They do have very good benefits though for full time employees,"
bad,I only worked for them for a short amount of time because of the way that is was ran and the people that worked their were rude and then never really helped me when I needed it.
bad,"Most days at Walmart we are busy and we help our customers in every way possible. "
bad,"A typical day at Walmart , is busy.  What I have learned working at Walmart you will meet all types of people. You will have to continue smiling no ,matter what happens. You will meet some nice people that will say one nice thing that will keep you smiling all day."
bad,I liked my job as a department manager but they didnt get the specific department i was in enough help especially during busy candy seasons. Its challenging to gwt things done with only you and one other person.
bad,This just isn't a right fit for me. I'd rather put my brain to work and to have the opportunity to advance anywhere in the future and they do not have good training and you're always left with many questions.
bad,"its a job I wouldn't recommend to anyone looking for long term employment. the culture has changed dramatically. its no longer enjoyable. favoritism is rampant."
bad,Schedule does not allow you to have a family life. Open all holidays except christmas very good benefits. Poor training it was either sink or swim so you should wear floaties. They will replace you without a second thought even if you have been  there 20 years. Or they will get rid of your position and basically tell you to figure it out.
bad,"There is no such thing as work life balance and you will have a new boss every year.  My evaluation was never covered by the person that had written it.  Every evaluation was the same.. you were reviewed well, but I need you to prove to me that this is accurate.  With a new boss every year it was almost impossible to promote past a certain point, and if you have to call in for even a medical emergency it is highly frowned upon."
bad,"New mandatory Home Office implemented scheduling guidelines makes you feel like a random piece of equipment not a person.  There is no regard for your personal needs as far as hours that are offered to you.  When I first applied to Wal-mart one of the biggest selling points about working for the company was the flexible work schedules available; this is no longer the case.  I worked the same basic schedule for 8 years  ( 8am-5pm  off Sunday & Thursday ) now all of a sudden my hours change to 11am-8pm off Sunday & Wednesday.  I have my whole life built around my previous schedule now I must give up a lot of my outside activities and family events because of this new schedule that I was never asked about."
bad,This place was not a good work environment at all. There was hardly any communication and everyone only cared about themselves instead of what was important .
bad,Wal-Mart is a job the job did not pay well when I was employed there.  Worked in the TLE department enjoyed my coworkers but the pay was awful the customers were great but the pay was not
bad,we get a lot of customers we have to help each day  so you get to show your customer service skills and act on it love helping my customers and bringing a smile on their face  before they leave the store.
bad,working at Walmart was a great place for me to work with where I use to work there a lot of my people there I use to know is was a great place to work at I like to  work and then I leave for school is was great working there.
bad,To Stressful and they do not train people for the job they want you to do. Management dose not care that their people are not held accountable for the job they are working at the time
bad,the company is always happy as long as you are remaining beneficial to them. they are not highly accommodating to anyone circumstances. they will offer a high amount of hours because of lack of employees.
bad,"No advancement, spent 3 years cashiering, management is poor and HR as well. Working conditions poor, no air conditioning, or water. Repetitive tasks, boring."
bad,"Overworked and underpaid, unreliable management and crew. Very unhappy and very unsanitary. Management is overpaid to stand around. I’m unhappy and so is everyone"
bad,I worked at Walmart as a temp position until my permanent job was available. I liked that they gave hour long breaks. Too many training videos. Managers were rude to cashiers. They aren't understanding about being I'll or family emergencies.
bad,Work dere for 4 years n things n rules change everyday  I don’t like dat but i did my job great n perfect it was cool n fun. I would go back but as a Asm because ino im ready
bad,"The main issue with working at Wal-Mart is that they will squeeze you into as many hours of overnight as possible while still technically being part time (even sheering off lunch hours conveniently to make you think you're full time). They NEVER hire purely full time in my experience. They may have raised their pay, but slack off in many other areas. "
bad,Was placed in the Clearance/Garden Center area of walmadt and was written up for being out of my area helping someone find what they needed IN THE NEXT ASILE from where I had to be.
bad,"I spent 11 years with this company doing everything in the store ,I became very unhappy with the company when new CEO took over jobs were cut more work was put on you with less help ."
bad,"You can be a fine employee with excellent customer service, but management plays favorites constantly, leaving undervalued employees feeling even more unappreciated. Under-staffing leads to confrontations with customers. Incompetency leads to confrontations with supervisors. If you're working simply for a paycheck, just be aware that the company will do all it can to pay you as little as possible for your hard work. If you're looking any kind of enjoyment or fulfillment from your work, this is not the right place to work at."
bad,"Wal-Mart is going thru a lot of changes.  It is being micromanaged by corporate headquarters.  They think they know everything about each store.  But, customers are finding empty shelfs and no associates to help them."
bad,"This was a good job for while I was initially in college. I quit when I enlisted. I thought some of the culture was pretty weird, like the pep rally's in the middle of the store."
bad,"I have worked at the Fort Erie location for many years and they are on a steady decline. The current managment team are the worst the store has ever seen. They don't know how to treat the staff and can be very pushy, demanding and unprofessional. They expect you to do the jobs of 2-3 people and still have the shelves full and provide great customer service. If you do manage to complete all the tasks you were given, you just get more jobs added to your plate until you are so overwhelmed you just don't know where to begin."
bad,It's not malicious intent on the part of the managers. Most of them are really good people but many are either ineffective most are Ill equipped with no training or experience.
bad,"This company was fun but the management was poor and the shifts were everywhere, sometimes I didn’t work a full week at least once a month, the paycheck was not consistent."
bad,Nice place to work. Decent pay. Be prepared to work in all types of weather. Pay was great for the amount of work. Place for growth. Walmart is always a good place culturally.
bad,"Wal-mart was my first job and I was a CAP 2 Associate (Unloading/stocking). The pay was decent and work was easy. However, it was management that was lacking. No one ever seemed to know what was going on, no one in management ever seemed to actually communicate to anyone. Like they just expected everyone to be able to read their minds."
bad,it was okay made friends  like working evenings  love cleaning bathrooms  doing lawn and garden  had to push carts and unload the truck short staff people
bad,"Thought this would be a good entry level job.  Schedule for cashier is all over the place.  They would not give me more than 24 hours a week and prefer instead to have lots of employed working 12 - 16 hours per wee."
bad,When I used to work at Walmart it was very fast paced and things had to get done at a certain time. A lot more work needed to be done that weren't in job description. managers not very friendly
bad,horrid on scheduling great benefits suggestions not listened to not enough help pharm staff hours constantly reduced causing less pharm overlap and minimial tech hours
bad,"Not a good company, they give routine raises of a few cents, you are penalized for being sick and constantly coached for one reason or another. Management is a joke and there wasn't anyone there who liked working there, it was just a job that paid the bills."
bad,This is for either gung ho lifers or temporary. The benefits are too expensive for hourly associates and the company does not have the family atmosphere it used to have for its associates.
bad,Nights you couldn't even take break on time . Some people had more free time then others . I didn't really like it because I sometimes would have to do other people jobs
bad,"Productive work place, short time there found out I was pregnant with my second and last baby. Had a good working environment and good coworkers. Fun fast paced working environment with good management."
bad,Management refused to work together in a team environment. They would cut corners to meet one goal and would prevent others from achieving their goal.
bad,Managers are poorly trained and often times on power trips. They are nearly invincible to complaints and violations and therefore better people can’t be promoted to the position. Extra work is often hoisted onto others without extra pay or extra time to complete them.
bad,Over worked make you cut your overtime they asked you to stay for.Management doesn't listen to you at all.Makes you work hour's you said you couldn't work.
bad,"Walmart is okay to start out at, but it really does feel like a toxic environment depending on which location. I don't recommend working at Walmart to anyone."
bad,"Most of my co-workers are wonderful and lovely people. However, the store atmosphere from corporate all the way down to local management is highly negative, and undercutting. So many associates have confided in me that they are disillusioned, frustrated, even angry and distrustful of the management and the new way of day-to-day operating. Unfortunately I understand what they mean. We have an incredible amount of new managers and many of the highest levels of store management continue to be people right out of college. They have never actually worked this field and have no life/people experience to draw from for this job. Also there have been SO MANY changes and restructuring since start of the this fiscal year. This has taken many people's jobs away so that everyone lives in fear of losing their jobs on any given day."
bad,"They're super picky about your time If you go over past 40 hours THEY will nag you about it. They say they have open door policy, but when you go around someone they go behind your back."
bad,Walmart promises promotions and will work you like a dog once you get into management with little to no reward. You will spend 50+ hours a week if you want to get done just the bare minimum to feel like you wont get fired. If you want to promote expect 70+ hours a week.
bad,If you’re looking for a place where good hardworking people suffer and bad lazy people thrive this is the place for you.  Good associates but it’s ruined by the bad managers. During bonus time your hours will be cut so managers can get bigger bonuses because you know they need it more than us. Just stay away from this place unless you’re looking for a temporary job or starter job.
bad,great stepping stone to learn however the company  does not know anything about work/family balance. The employees are over worked and underpaid.  I did  become a pharmacy tech while emplioyed there so that was a great benefit however that went out the window because they dont pay the technicians hardly anything for the work that we have to do.
bad,"hours sucked, little pay and never any room for advancement"
bad,As i worked at Walmart i have learned built a lot of relationship skills with people and good communication with others. The management were very rude at times and not wanting to show interest about my needs and wants.
bad,"I was working as a receiving associate at the Princeton Walmart and it was a very stressful time. We were always short staffed everyday we worked and management would want us to get the job done quickly with half of an average team that comes in everyday, and we were behind they would threaten to fire us even though they knew we were short staffed."
bad,I feel the leadership was terrible. They cut hours if they don't like you. Even if you are a good worker. If management was better I would recommend working there to everyone i know.
bad,The managers are all for they self ... Its a new manager every 4 months and they disrespectful.. They barley no how to run the store... But its regular workers that been there for a while that can run the store betrer than them and cant ger a manager position...
bad,"Job was goof for the first few months, until some higher managers played favoritism, there were no advancement opportunities, you get paid time off for so many hours worked and you could use them for vacation or sick days. that was the only cool thing"
bad,the one in fall river is not that great. definitely will not apply there again. they do not appreciate hard work. they need new managers the had temps doing jobs that managers admittedly say that they did not know how to do.
bad,"Walmart's corporate culture and mission statements sound great.  Visiting Bentonville or Home Office will really promote the culture that corporate wants to have.  However, market directors and store level managers do not represent this culture well to associates.  "
bad,"Kept Messing up schedules, something easy, tried blaming me for it but my schedule should've never changed even though it did. Managers didn't know what they were doing for the longest time there. Hired people that didn't do their job well."
bad,it is agood place to work just need more hours and more benifits partimme is hard because no insurance and nomore pay raises we are stuck at the wage we receive
bad,"Everyday is about the same. I stock the shelves and then I zone. Some management/managers were great but some were bad. Some were lazy and did nothing while some did a lot. I do enjoy working with my fellow associates. Never had a problem with anybody.  Stocking is easy to do but the hard part was the days we had a lot to do and not enough associates working that day. I did enjoy stocking until they started changing everything at Walmart. They screwed up everything and fellow associates didnt like the change also. Things worked fine before they started changing things. All we needed were just a few more associates and we keeped saying we need more to managers but they never hired more people. Once the change things, the managers said it was for the good but it wasn’t. Made things harder for my shift and most people left Walmart after this change. We didn’t have enough people to start with. I don’t like how Walmart screwed up a job I enjoyed and now making me dread coming to work. I went to part-time because I didn’t want to deal with everything. I just sick of the job now."
bad,Never had a set schedule. Management was always rude. Too much drama no one could keep to themselves. Minimum wage and you could never ask off without being made to feel like terrible
bad,"Management has introduced ""One Best Way,"" as being set standards for Walmart employees.  OBW works until it doesn't fit the situation and then it reverts back to ""The Old Way.""  Policy is open to the discretion of almost any individual at any given time.  "
bad,could not handle the intense fast pace work everyday i worked there. only good thing i learned from there is not to work in retail. i do sort of like walmart less....
bad,"Was a stressful place no one was ever happy and ypu had to stay busy nonstop, so if you finiahed all your work and there werent customers then you had to find something to do even if it was another persons work they werent doing for whatever reason. The managers were always in a bad mood and only smiled at customers. Pay increase was rare and a lot of permanent employees didnt get their benifits."
bad,"A temporary job for me, but some people make it a lifetime. The management is good at hiding and avoiding issues, but does little else in my experience. Every year benefits are cut as well as hours. Incompetence is rampant and I can't believe how some of these people got into management."
bad,I do not like how Walmart treats it's associates. They don't meet our needs as a crew. We try and work for them as best we can with little help or working equipment
bad,"Good environment as well as the people, vary fast paced, bad communication with management, get paid low salary, the extent of two weeks you'll remain till you receive a check."
bad,"I help customer find to stuff they want to buy, or show them where something was. i also help customer check out at the register so they get out of the store faster."
bad,A day at work consist of assisting and providing great customer service. Stocking and zoning shelves/light housekeeping. Suggestive selling and price matching to ensure customers save money.
bad,It was a good first job. Gave me a realistic view on what it was to be an employee. They are willing to promote you if you show that you have initiative.
bad,"Took orders and assisted in the preparation of salads, sandwiches, fried food etc. "
bad,"You're expected to finish your assigned duties. That's understandable. But! If you start to get even 5 or 10 minutes of overtime, you have to take a longer lunch break- off the clock. You can't leave early because that means you will get a point. If you are sick and call in you get a point. Too many points, you get terminated. It's understandable they need dependable people. The point system is ridiculous. They use to have a consistent schedule. For some reason it changed. Full time is considered 32 hours. Regular days off don't exist. Very hard to plan around a schedule."
bad,"Wal-Mart is an ok place to work, probably depends on which store you go to and the management team there. In my experience they hardly properly train people. They seem to more prefer trial by fire which then puts stress on the other associates  as they have to do their own work while shlwing the newbs at the same time. WHEN someone is absent or they have a position to fill they would rather pull from other departments for months at a time instead of hiring a new person. Why hire another body when you can get someone else to do 2 jobs for the price of 1? Turnover rate is crazy because they have unrealistic expectations in getting things done, especially when your team is crippled on top of them trying to cover multiple positions with fewer people than required. When they do hire for a position they apparently just throw anyone into it. One of my direct supervisors was a felon so obviously they don't care much about proper background checks. At store 5441 they pick and choose who they want to help advance. If you tell them no on any request then they'll make sure you get stuck where you are or worse. Management is never on the same page. One manager will come by and tell you to do things a certain way then later another will say that it's wrong and needs to be redone. I once was written up for asking a manager to help pull a truck since she was just standing about watching because  the electric pallet jack was down. They call anything over 34 hours full time and if you attempt to work more than your scheduled hours they tend to make you leave early to cancel that additional time."
bad,"workers are relatively nice, management is horrible, they single people out and its more drama then high school, ok pay though, would not recommend job"
bad,"It was an okay job, but I feel it's not the place I want to be working. My manager will push you to work more days and I don't have time to study, and skip my class. He doesn't want me to work less, if I asked for 2-3 days."
bad,"Although I did enjoy working at Walmart, I feel it's headed in the wrong direction. I left for a different job because they rose the minimum wage at Walmart to what I had worked up to after 3 years. Even with what I worked up to, the pay is so low I couldn't afford my own apartment and bills, so I had to find a new job. They were not going to compensate anyone who had already worked there, so new hires made just as much as a vet. Management was very rude to me when I left, even went as far as to lie about me getting fired at a new job that I love and still work at ever since. I never did anything wrong and was loved by everyone at Walmart. I didn't want to leave because of the people alone. Since I've been gone, they've reduced the amount of employees drastically."
bad,"Stocking shelves, inventory, appearance, meeting/greeting customers.  Lifting boxes, cash register and money management, advertising sales and clearance"
bad,Not enough experienced employees and understanding of processing. Was interested in running as a retail service and not a wholesale service. Should listen to middle level more and not just inexperienced upper management
bad,"If you need a job right away to make ends meet …..my GOD do it. Take as a temporary job and move on. Dogged management sometimes, especially at Christmas time. No good bonuses for lower staffed employees. They like to feed you without a doubt. That's always the trick of the trade."
bad,"It was all the bad parts of customer service, stressful and the store manager was impossible to deal with. Take my review with a grain of salt as this was my first job and its possible it all seemed worse than it really was."
bad,I would unload the truck then stack the pallets every day same thing everyday it was ok to work for them when I was just coming out of school and a part time student
bad,"Grateful too work at Walmart"
bad,Its hard to move up to a different position. You get a hour lunch and two 15 minutes break. and you also get 10% discount which i think you should more.
bad,"I expected more when I worked there. I was trying to create a career but I suffering discrimination. So that's why I quite the job , I did my best for them and get nothing back"
bad,"Poor Management, Inconsistency within the workplace. Constantly have to take up other peoples responsibilities and your expected to keep up with your own."
bad,A typical day at Walmart is very stressful and unorganized. Their is a lot of running around and confusion due to the management team lack of guidance and understanding.
bad,"Little opportunity for advancement or lateral moves. Certain types of empoyees (stockmen and cap team) are treated like 2nd class citizens. Working outside is rough during the hottest and coldest days, especially when it snows."
bad,"I worked at two different stores, and both of them had the same problem where management plays favorites. The people they like get all of their absences excused and are the first to be promoted, everyone else just gets stepped on."
bad,I will not work for them again. They are poorly ran and the management staff does not stand up for their employees. Associates were always bickering with each other as well as customers.
bad,"Walmart was my first paid job right out of high school. I had no work experience and through my three year tenure there, I was considered a jack of all trades where I was a cashier, cart pusher, covered multiple departments at once, shoe department associate, online management and my final position was truck unloader/inventory specialist. One thing that I learned from working there was my appreciation for work. I met individuals that I could learn from and that pushed me to be a better individual and a stronger worker."
bad,"These people will work you to death. They do not care about you when you get hurt. They will try anything to blame you for getting hurt, and then single you out when you go get medically checked."
bad,Considero que deberían tener aun más atenciones para los trabajadores.
bad,Definitely not the best place to work. The management is definitely not the greatest. Customers and employees were never really taken care of. Its a really hard to move up if you are a good worker and the stress is through the roof having to deal with the clientele that shops there and their demanding demeanor. They don't do much to show their appreciation to their employees for everything they have go through which makes it that  much more unbearable.
bad,I worked at Walmart for eight years off and I. Do to health issues. The employees are rude and management is even Worse. On one occasion a manager told me my kids weren’t important when I needed to leave to meet my baby sister at the hospital because my child was running a fever of 104.6. I don’t suggest anyone ever working at a wAlmart
bad,"The work environment was slow-paced, on rare occasions it was fast-paced. The number of coworkers were limited and often times there was only one associate working at a time."
bad,I would not go back to this company due to the lack of respect they had for the employees and the way they paid the employees a single mom would struggle just to make it
bad,"it was an ok place to work.  pay wasnt that great and everyone starts part-time and seen alot of people let go when their part-time status was up and were let go so they didnt get full-time and benifits,"
bad,they didn't listen very well when you have something to say they need to inporove in that area they took sides when they should of stayed neutral does need work
bad,Its okay place to work if you are just starting out and maybe going through college and need to make a little money but they don't really pay all that well.
bad,"Walmart is relatively high-paying compared to many of its competitors, but its employees are hyper-vigilant of their at-will status. Advancement and experience count for little in terms of loyalty, especially with changes in management. Additionally, there is very little control over wages and other technical aspects of the job, instead, one must got through the corporate bureaucracy. If you're a sales associate or a cashier, you're not important enough to go through that."
bad,Walmart was a job I wanted to try out. I quickky didn't like it and am looking for a better job. I would recommend anyone to Walmart that could take negative criticism.
bad,Management takes advantage of there power which creates a tough work environment and other associates shifts don’t do the work that should be done which makes everyone else work hard
bad,The day starts with a meeting to tell us sales numbers.the they tell us the size of the truck we have to unload. And they send us to unload the truck. Then after the truck is unloaded we go and stick departments until we go home
bad,"Working as a Floor Associate was a decent job.  I would clock in, find my direct supervisor to find out which department I was in that day, and go to work.  My supervisors and fellow clothing associates were pleasant to work with and I enjoyed the camaraderie we had together.  "
bad,Walmart was my first job and the overnight shift was okay stocking shelves but not worth it coming in and seeing all that goes undone on the dayshift and the fact that falls on you if it doesnt get done; walmart wants you to dedicate your life to them and you cant get off for jack squat!
bad,"The management is very bad. The department managers are very hard working and pushed beyond any reasonable limitations. The upper management are very unprofessional and not at all interested in making the departments a success. The are more interested in how much work they can put on one person, instead of having the staff needed to get the job done correctly and make themselves look good. It is a sad work environment and I would never work there again."
bad,Although I love working with customers Walmart doesn’t seem to care much for its employees unless you’ve been there for a long time and have been put through a lot.
bad,not much positive to say these days- chronically understaffed with too much work most days for so few people to finish that day.  basically go to work there because there's nothing better.
bad,"very constant movement,good environmant as far as customers and some employees. decent break and lunch intervals. good bonus oppurtunities. too much testing"
bad,it is a good place to work. you would have to help custumers. and willing to lean all areas of the store. it is a family culture when you work at Walmart.
bad,"I worked for them for 2 months your climbing a ladder 100x a day easily on cap 1 so if you have knee problems or dont want to develop knee problems I would keep looking."
bad,expect to perform multiple peoples duties.  management does not help in time of need.  they straight up lie to your face.  they all have that fake smile
bad,"As a salary manager, your time is not family oriented. A lot of things are not consistent.  There is favoritism there also. I just felt for the amount of time and dedication I gave, there should have been better pay.  You get abused verbally by Upper management, associates that work for you and the customers and you have to take it all in stride."
bad,Working at wal mart has its perks such as discount cards.  Being at the store already not having to go to the store.  Walmart has friendly staff and employees
bad,Literally everything that has to do with day to day functions of this company is a complete and total disaster from logistics to scheduling. There is zero communication between shifts and management is taught to keep shifts divided and pitted against one another as often as possible to keep blame from rolling back onto them (the actual people responsible). From the top to the very bottom the company imply a things roll down hill policy and micromanage whenever possible to minimize accountability. There is no screening process for potential job candidates and the criteria to be hired is literally answering only 1 question
bad,Good place to work but the place does work on production and there's no type of give in case something happens through out the day. Most managements sit in there office.
bad,"Much more physically demanding job than you would think. The only way to advance is to become dept mgr, then asst mgr and so on. The problem with that is you see how they are treated, and it all flows downhill from there. Big retail is what it is, only rewarding for the people at or near the top of the pyramid. No one other than your immediate co-workers cares about you as a person, the bigger the company the less you are treated fairly."
bad,"Schedules are inflexible."
bad,"Environment is very cut-throat. It seems that if you are talented, then upper management will target you. Seems that upper management does not want talented people to promote up."
bad,Poor Management and Scheduling  Hours are not consistent  The hardest part of the job is that management is not always on the same page as employees  Pay is not high enough for work involved
bad,"The management and staff were always on two different paths. You would get told to do something by one, only to get told to do something different by another. You would never really know what to do and when."
bad,Not really a fan anymore of working here. I like working as a team but at Walmart that doesn’t seem to exist. I love the people i work with they make working fun and exciting.
bad,Work is easy and simple. Not hard to pick up which is fortunate because there isn't a good training regimen. Management communication between each is poor which usually causes you do work outside of your job title
bad,it was very poor management the jib was not a ideal job and it was something that i could not be apart of because of the low hours that were given to me
bad,I was a Pharmacy Tech here and I liked my job. The people I worked with were great but you did not get much help on the register with the long lines. There were always long lines and nobody would come and help me.Its a very stressful place to work.
bad,"I liked the people I worked with,The management team and I didnt always see eye to eye,  very busy I liked that part,  my hours got to the point I would close one night and turn around and open the very next day, I can't stand going to Walmart anymore,"
bad,"Management made the working environment very stressful, started cutting hours. Sometimes they were accommodating with schedule shifts. We were asked to provide schedule availability but management refused to follow availability."
bad,was working with the staff and being a good customer service representative. It was great seeing new faces and learning new things especially when it came to customer relations.
bad,"The people you end up working with day to day will b make the job enjoyable. The management, however, actively make it appear as if they want the company to fail."
bad,"Very easy job and decent pay but horrible company to work for (at least for my location). Managers would never let me move up and advance in the company, extremely unprofessional,  co workers and staff are rude and so are the customers that came through. Only reason why I stayed was for the pay. Decent benefits though, long hours, usually would have to stay longer then I would be scheduled."
bad,Wal mart would not be a company i would not work for. From the Management to the staff ppl are rude and no communication. one of the worst work experiences i have had.
bad,"Graveyard sucks. way too much ""frieght time"" compared to actual time on clock. expected too much out of one person. need better management and better benefits to pay"
bad,Management plays favorites when they decide who they want to promote. Went about 5 years with no cost of living raise. Current managers do not have the backbone to stand up for their subordinates to their higher management.
bad,It's hard to work for a large company like Walmart and be happy all the time. Management isn't the best and drama is a big issue no matter the department.
bad,Walmart as a whole is not a bad place to work if you have a store manager that cares about his employees. Its fast paced and customer service orientated. The pay is good but they tend to cut your hours once you receive a raise. With the new Core system for scheduling going into place you are only guarentees a minimum amount of hours depending on your position and availability making it difficult for employees who have secondary jobs or other circumstances that prohibit them from working with an open availability.
bad,"My experience with CAP2 at Walmart is that I could get a full 40 hours, but I worked with poor management who would promote undeserving people into higher paying roles. I'm not talking about me not being promoted, I only planned on being there for less than a year, but someone could work really hard and do outstanding work, but instead someone else who is less functional at the job will get a promotion."
bad,if they don't get it together amazon is going to take over. Thy don't encourage out the box thinking. they want robots. I thought I could manage in a way that helps strengthen the associates but they want them weak and able to follow simple directions while under paying them
bad,"I would go to work at 10 pm and get off at 7 am with a 1 hour lunch break, I stocked shelfs and mixed paint, made keys, did hunting and fishing lic. inventory in back, cashier and so on. you really only learn to work registers and stuff like that, paint keys, customer service, culture was not open much, the hardest part is the lifting. did not have an enjoyable part in this job."
bad,My time working at Walmart in wiggins was horrible. The staff over my section was not dependable on helping me learn my responsibilities and duties as a stocker. I did not know how to do everything that my position required me do.
bad,"I worked at three different walmarts in two different states.  depending on the managers, some were good and some were bad.  i did well at the first walmart."
bad,"I worked in the produce department. My typical day included stocking the shelves, organizing the back room, and unloading trucks. The management was acceptable, but the higher management was overworked. The workplace culture is one of discontent. Many of the employees were working there because it was their only option. The hardest part of the job was the work environment."
bad,I was very young working here and it got the job done. I would recommned this company to a 16 yr old with no bills but not an adult. walmart makes it hard to survive on the funds the give
bad,The management didn't respond to calls as quickly as they should have which made customers very angry to the point of screaming at me and my associates because as a csm  I wasnt given the needed authority to make calls on my own.
bad,Started working walmart as a college student to get a little cash in my pocket. The hours that were given to me where all over the place. There is little to no life-school-work balance if you are full time.
bad,Very toxic work environment. No one is happy. No room for advancement. Salary is not great.........benefits as part time you don't get....... glad i left when i did.
bad,"Staff wasn't very effective, management wasn't either. people always put their work on you and management doesn't do anything about it. there is so much drama in the store and it is very gross. the job is just boring to begin with."
bad,Walmart was a horrible first job. Front end managers paid no attention to those in need of help. Customers were rude and unpleasant to help and I was scared to ever ask a fellow team member for assistance.
bad,Can be a very stressful job. Understaffed. Job expected to be done with a lot less people then needed. Does offer advancement opportunities but most people don't want to advance
bad,"Typical day includes waiting on customers, zoning department, putting re shops away and pulling top stock from top stock to replenish , some days are very stressful as it can get very busy and leaving the counter to get other responsibilities done is nearly impossible, often also help in other department due to lack of coverage , the job is a very demanding and stressful job with Management putting pressure to make sure each employee does their job regardless of how busy the store is and customer service will always take priority over tasks but that can cause frustration between managers and employees , For me personally i learned to adapt quickly making good use of my time and knowledge and can multi task quite well however it can be stressful ."
bad,"Schedule goes up and down like a roller coaster, It has become a one man team, Others are equally stressed, worst part is getting the job done all by your self."
bad,They lie to you tell you whatever you want hear when you first start then the longer you are there. The more you see how the real company is ran. On your back the harder you work the more you make the CEO and corp richer. The management doesn't care about how your back is hurting from lifting heavy boxes for 8 days straight all they care about is if its done and they didn't have to help.
bad,"It is a decent paying job, but you don't get to work a set shift which is difficult when you have a family. This job gives you the experience of working with a diverse population."
bad,"sometimes you need to work 3 departments by yourself"
bad,It was ok place to work.  Customers  could be frustrating.  It would get boring when it was slow paced.  They would sometimes forget to give you breaks and then when they finally did give you break they would ask you to come back early.
bad,Management needs to go through a whole new training program for understanding there employees life outside of work. The hours a horrible and it takes your whole day away if you work on cap teams.
bad,I had a terrible time working for this Walmart. It was poorly managed they would over work their employees to where they would get sick. Then the other employees would have to make up for the work that they had left. Oh! One more important detail it is not a work safe environment. This store is sinking into the ground!
bad,this place is not a fair place to work sometimes made you work no matter if you werent spose to work they would call you and made it seem that if you didnt come in you would be fired
bad,"While employed at Walmart, I was part time. I worked 35 to 40 hour a week. I was written up my second week there for not taking my break on time, this was after I told my manager I would be on the clock for over 6 hours, and she told me I would have to wait."
bad,"I worked there for over 16 months. I rarely called in , was never late, and worked over my time to help get things done. I was expected to work full time hours without fulltime benefits. They make the schedules 3 weeks in advance and are not willing to work with you. If you request days off (even months in advance) there is only a 50% chance you'll get those days off. And you can't get sick. Ever. I became violently ill and required hospital treatment. I was out of work for 10 days. They had me contact a 3rd party to get the absences cleared. I made all the calls, but the 3rd party never got back to me until 2 days after I was fired. For getting sick!"
bad,it was okay working for was mar they are a good company but some management is not good they are very aggressive and outspoken pay was not to good at all
bad,typical day varies but i remember the bad days the most and when the they are bad they are bad. i improved my customer service working here. the management in general and from my experience is terrible. the managers didnt manage unless bigger managers showed up. hardest part of my job would be dealing with the higher management the thing i most enjoy about my job is seeing the customer faces happy when you help them.
bad,i loved the work i did as a technician and loved the atmosphere with the co-workers i had. The management is what made work unbearable. the random cut in hours and instability made me find new employment
bad,"Naturally, each WalMart is run a little bit differently; where one may have a lot of different events promoted to raise awareness to safety issues, where another location may not have time or other resources in order to devote to these. I'd certainly say things are 'fair', but could be much better in terms of the all-around feel of working for the company."
bad,my typical day at work was long and stressful the managers there are VERY inconsiderate they don't care about nobody but their self their attitude is NASTY also they talk to you any kind of way . they wont let you change your availability even if its a good cause like going to school. I was working at 7400 rivers ave north Charleston sc store 1359
bad,Even if you are good at your job you move no where within the company. Regardless of if you have a college education or not they will not allow you to move up or progress in the company. Friends promote friends even if they are not qualified.
bad,I feel as if Walmart is a good paying job but has very poor management and they don't take care of issue the way they should be taken care of. The other employees I work with are great but management could use some work.
bad,ICS Associate and truck unload-er had to wok long hours getting low pay. I didn't really like the job. That's my preference because Walmart underpays its employees
bad,Not happy anymore.. Not worried about associates. Care only about bottom line. Feel like you are doing the job of 5 people with no help. I truly love my customer base.
bad,"a typical day at work would be for me to go to the meeting to find out where i have to work for the night. management would give ridiculous tasks like finishing 10 hours of freight in practically 4 hours before being moved to another department. The equipment that we use to slot and tag doesnt work half the time, And it doesnt matter if you try to transfer to another department, they will throw you wherever they need you. They do not seem to take in the consideration of their employees thoughts and only want results, and when things don't get done under a certain amount of time, an their butt's are being chewed out by higher management, we get coached. Even if we put out the majority of the freight. Call outs go through the roof. Extremely high turn-over rate."
bad,"I applied for full time and work 40 hours a week on average, yet they have me set as ""part time"" - therefore I receive no benefits nor accrue pto like full time positions do. I work night shift and the management is overall rude, slow, or next to useless; with exceptions of 2 or 3 very good managers."
bad,Every day they change the way routines I learned a lot because I was a manager in2012 some managers were rude the hardest part about the job was to many chief little bit of Indian daily changes.Having a job was the only thing I enjoyed learning
bad,"Working for Walmart is a very good career path but as far as the one in Fort Oglethorpe, GA coming to management as an associate with problems they leave you feeling as if it could be handled a lot better then they lead it be. As well one experience i had as far as an issue was that my then manger told me when i was asking for his help that i was wasting my time and that all the questions i brought up they felt a child in elementary school could figure out. Overall i felt very disrespected after a couple months of employment."
bad,alot of people will say the pay is good but itsnot worth the stress that you have to put up with on the daiy ...for a richcompany the pay rate is ridiculous
bad,"It was a job that got me by for a bit. All I can really say. They did however, if they saw you worked hard, did offer some chances to do other things. However, no real raise in pay."
bad,the fact that indeed makes you fill this stupid column out just to post your resume is ridiculous. If I had anything good to say about working here then I would still be there
bad,"Between being forced to carry the slack of others, and taking fall for it not being completed to simply feeling like a second class civilian, these are all things you'll find for working at Wal-Mart. From the lowest point, a Cart Pusher, expect to be hounded constantly about where you need to be and what you need to do and on hot days forget about going inside for air unless you want a write up. Depending on the area the customers attitude may vary but thats expected, the managers all seem like works of art thinking one is more better of a human being than the other. "
bad,"management was unable to fix any issues in the work place."
bad,Walmart has great benefits and is good for kids in college needing a job. They pay you well and give bonuses as well as paid vacation.  A person can ask for time off without getting deducted a point.
bad,"They schedule you for different hours every week, often in ways that dont make sense. For instance, I was scheduled until 10PM on Friday, and then starting at 6AM on Saturday."
bad,Once they know you can work. They depend on you for a lot of things in your shift. It became too much for me to handle so I quite. Manager’s will try to push you so far.
bad,"I had advanced 4 times in the year I worked there, I had a family issue out of state and needed to relocate. I asked for a transfer and was told I could not transfer until they found my replacement. So I quit the job to take care of family issues."
bad,I was an assistant manager for Walmart. every day I had to deal with uneducated and stubborn customers who always thought the televisions they bought were on sale for 70% off. No thanks only do this if you need to.
bad,"It was a seasonal position, that turned into part time, they have inconsistent hours, which made planning and coaching very difficult. I enjoyed the people though"
bad,"the managers think that they can talk down to you like you are children, the managers are doing drugs usually in their car in the parking lot all of the time beware if you work overnights"
bad,"This was just a job I got to make some money while looking for something else. The management is poor and unenthusiastic. They are open 24 hours so they do offer quite a few shifts, both full and part-time. It is rather fast paced and you are on your feet for your entire shift."
bad,Work unloading throw truck unload truck pull pallets to the floor work freight unload trucks with forklift management wants everything done in an unreasonable time
bad,it was an friendly place to work and loved the people I worked for as well as the mangaers . I moved up in a timley manner and was happy to see hoe they cared.
bad,only care about filing their own pockets than helping their employees. Fire people for simply having health issues but keep the ones that barely worked and was constant hour cuts where we would barely get to work any hours therefore low paycheck
bad,very stressful place to work. management  is very bad and had to work graveyard shift for my last 7 years of employment without any chance of a change.
bad,The management staff needs to be re trained on how to treat the staff and customers. And needs to hire somebody to do there returns in a timely manner. I;m surprised no one has sued them for getting sick off some of the food thats being put back on the shelves. And for inadequate security inside and outside of the store. Some of the employees are so rude to the customers
bad,"If you want to bring your occupational growth to a halt, work here. If you want to waste months or years of your life, work here. If you want to be surrounded by un-interesting people in the break room, this is the place.  "
bad,"The walamrt i worked at was so unorganized, had poor management and they had they own rules. mostly everyone in there was family and they showed favortism."
bad,"The hours are not flexible and it is your responsibility to find someone to cover your shift. When I was ready to quit, I tried 3 or 4 times to put in my two weeks. I went to my Manager, she told me to write it on a sticky note and she would give it to the higher up. Never happened. I ended up not showing up anymore. Horrible environment."
bad,I love working with people but in my opinion very disorganized. I alway's went in and did my job cashiering and leveling when needed to. But I only had this job for the holidays only. I like the fast paced day being busy. The person who did scheduling didn;t do it very well. Which made it hectic sometimes.I personally don't even like to shop Walmart. Just figured I'd give it a shot.
bad,"learning to do multi tasking while answering phones, putting price tags on merchandise. Helping customers at fitting room that are trying on clothes, can be hard at times to multi task for all this,but i do my best.Like to help customers with questions on items ."
bad,There was no communication with management and they were not flexible with hours. They did not treat me as an employee well when I worked there. I did not enjoy this job.
bad,Everything there has a purpose. I'm simply a lawn. I like my job but I don't get paid enough to work the long he's I get. I'm struggling to survive. it makes hard to balance my outside life and work life.
bad,The managers are very unprofessional. That cut hours a lot and dont really give you the hours your were giving when first hired.. the company is very much unorganized
bad,It was temporary job due to construction and I liked it while it last it was relaxing t was Monday through Friday through a temp service the agency was nice ladies in there
bad,Easy place to make money and go home. The pay has gotten a lot better since I've worked there. The good part is you get a raise every time you change positions.
bad,Debe fortalecer el aspecto humano y cuidar calidad de vida de sus colaboradores.
bad,"High stress, team oriented work. Typical day started with unloading the general merchandise truck which would take minimum of 2 hours per truck, up to two trucks on certain nights. Boxes were organized by department and then pulled onto the floor on pallets. Associates would then stock the freight at their designated areas. "
bad,I had a different experience than most as we were without a manager for quite a period of time.  Everyone was able to stay true to their tasks and completed their job requirements without overstepping any boundary of taking blame for something they didnt do such as putting in an R rated movie for tv displays.
bad,"The place sucks. People who work there suck. Bad day at work, unorganized, unprofessional, unsanitary. Bad customer service was given to customers and terrible management"
bad,It started out as a great job but went downhill with new management . They treat people like mules and want you to live your life for them. They dont care about family. Managers show a lot of favoritism. As they have increased the minimum wage employees who have been there awhile got shorted. Ive been with the company 6 years and am amking 50 cents more than a new hire with no experience.
bad,"Not a great place. Not sure what you want me to write. Just writing these so i can get my resume.. Walmart doesn't pay well, treats employees like cr ap. Would not recommend. There."
bad,They still continue to under pay their employees and their stores still look like a disaster. My time at Walmart was grossly underpaid and very stressful. Management does not support you.
bad,"a usual day at any Walmart is you're working by yourself doing a job made or meant to be for at least 3-5 people. customers come from every place asking questions and it gets overwhelming when you're the only there to help all of them. the ""discount"" isn't really much of a discount. all the managers are unbelievably rude or short when you ask a question."
bad,Walmart is a fine place to work but not for a career.The current store model is not designed for upward mobility for long term people. The company is run in a way that rewards stupidity and punishes loyal people
bad,"A typical day in TLE (tire lube express) would compose of doing 40-50 vehicles a day. most efforts were overlooked and if the service writer didn't show up then management would expect the technicians to service write, perform the service on the vehicles, pull them out of the shop and then wring the customer out because there was never anyone hired to run the register inside while still receiving the same pay $11.00 an hour. TLE is supposed to open at 7:00am which means when we come in at 6:30am we have to pull all the tires out for display before then. but sat around most mornings till about 7:30am with angry customers because we were waiting for somebody in management to come and unlock the bay doors. The whole experience was extremely stressful and I would not recommend working for them."
bad,I really didnt like working there not fair unpay backstabbing not enough discount unstable hrs. Not enough hrs. Poor managment unexperianced managers rude managment
bad,"THe work was fine, but the rules on timeliness was a bit to much for me.  If you were even 5 minutes late coming back from break you were written up. Some of the people were good some not as much"
bad,Management staff was extremely biased. Work hours and the ability to have accountable employees and management that held them accountable was unheard of.
bad,A typical day at work I would stock school and office supplies. Sometimes I would work as a cashier in the front of the store. I learned that I didn't want to work there for a long time. The job was very fast paced and stressful. The hardest part of the job was putting returned items back on the shelves quickly. The most enjoyable part of the job was lunch time.
bad,My typical work day would consist of coming to work from 2 in the morning to 11 or 12 in the afternoon. I would clock in grab a scan gun and my own personal cart and would basically bring out the items that were running low on the floor from the back room. And then if i would finish my own sections then I would re-stock other items in other departments and so on and so forth.
bad,"Hours suck, management is horrible. Never get days requested off, no set schedule unless it's something important, hardly any pot but good benefits. Pay ranking is not right."
bad,"Walmart starts its pay at $11 and a supervisor barely makes more than that. The scheduling is inconsistent. One day you'll work evening then morning the next. Work and home CANNOT be balanced while working here. For teens, it is perfect. But adults, I'd pass if I were you."
bad,Although I loved my job at Walmart they would not be consider my health or my kids. The most important thing to Walmart is to keep the customer happy.
bad,everyday I regretted my lifes decisions. great if you can put up with a lot of garbage. micro managing at its finest. for every position in the store there is a fall guy. blame just gets passed around
bad,I was excited to get my job I tried multiple times to get hired so when I did I was ready to prove myself as an asset to the company I was ready to climb the ladder and hopefully one day be a store manager ! I worked really hard got employee of the month and everything but the way the store was ran it was virtually impossible to climb the ladder !
bad,"Working for Walmart was okay. I enjoyed the freedom of being in my own space, not having to work with others too much. I enjoyed speaking, meeting and satisfying the customers. I enjoyed"
bad,Expectations are unrealistic. Not enough assets to perform the job. Upper management only concerned with maximizing their bonuses. Great starting salary for entry but no increase as responsibility increases.
bad,This place does not pay well. The hours are fixed. The work you more than they pay you. I don't even think they have FMLA. This place is dirty and the management is not on point.
bad,I was thankful to get employed there after injuring a tendon in my hand where the store at Auburn allowed me to be a greeter until I healed-up alright.
bad,"The job is easy to do but there's a lot of favoritism with management. Most of the days are stressful, by yourself with up to 4 departments to take care of."
bad,"When i worked here, 2/3 of management played favorites and bent the rules to their own liking to make their own day easier. The most enjoyable part for me, bein maintenance, is when i was left to my own devices to build grills and bikes, or to blow up ball for the ball pit"
bad,I really didn't like working here they didn't treat they employees fair and they worked us way to hard for the pay they was offering not saying all walmarts or the same just the one I was working at I'm speaking about
bad,This job only keep people who have a reason to work. Always watch your back. Their know second chance. most manger will throw you under the bus to cover their own butt.
bad,"El día es muy distribuido desde el trabajo hasta las horas de comida, sin embargo no se valora el trabajo y no se respeta tus horarios ni de trabajo ni de descanso"
bad,Manager we're rude to customers and employees. So off on guidelines. Don't take to customer satisfaction.not very happy with their jobs.people always getting missed treated
bad,"I've heard walmart either being a fantastic place to work for in either the south or the past, however it feels robotic and hostile. The Walmart I worked for in particular ran us rabid and expected us to literally be in two places at once, always focusing on our short comings and down playing our accomplishments."
bad,"This is possibly the most stressful and most emotionally degrading jobs. Management is very disorganized  and have poor communication skills. Management is very unappreciative of its employees ,literally nothing can impress your managers and they will literally find anything to complain about.Manage tends to play favoritism towards shifts , making other shifts work harder, to compensate for lack productivity of other shifts, while at the same time getting paid the same amount"
bad,"The pay and benefits at walmart were fine but the environment is terrible."
bad,"Too much micro-management so Store Manager has little control over local store and community needs."
bad,"Though some mangers are nice, typically you are required to work alot with less pay and sometimes there is'nt enough variety of work to do. Its repetitive"
bad,"just a number, you will kill yourself for little reward or acknowledgment . the only thing that keeps me going is the amazing people and friends i work with."
bad,"Management would yell at you for taking too long getting to a customer, then yell at you for letting things get stolen, yell at you for intervening, and yell at you for not stocking enough shelves. I worked cashier night shift, and half of the guys on the floor would lie about how much product they were shelving and wouldn't do their job making it harder on the rest of us."
bad,headquaters has no idea whats going onand the market team does not have enough time to figure out why dept has problems. the managemwent at storelevel is bad
bad,Wal-Mart is an alright place to work if you like retail. There is a lot of heavy lifting and constant on your feet. The Managers are horrible toward the employees all the time.
bad,"No room for improvement, no room for growth.  Thank God I quit. I did not enjoy working there, co workers were rude, worked so hard for peanuts, its was pain all through."
bad,"walmart expects to much from all its workres, and has a percrption of making workers feel they could not work anywhere but Wal mart so they should just do as they were told."
bad,"Did not particularly care for working in this environment.  We were placed in  a very secure and secluded work space.  Responsible for incredible amounts of cash on an hourly basis.  Hourly deposits - balancing cash, coin and credit receipts.  Although I enjoyed the work I did not care for the atmosphere."
bad,Known for having judgmental managers who are not fair. Refuses to work with someone who has a medical condition and will definitely fire you for having one.
bad,stocking the sales floor and putting up freight and cooking food and slicing lunch meat and cheese for the customers and order food for the deli and made sandwiches and salads and wraps and pinwheels and trays for the customers or for the store
bad,"I try my best while I'm at Walmart, working hard, doing manager-level work without being asked, even stepped in as interim DM for several months and was not thanked once. There was always a complaint about what wasn't done. This company's culture is severely lacking: the stores are short staffed, the staff overworked and/or wearing three hats (two of which they don't get equivalent pay for) and the customers are rude.  There is no overtime. It doesn't seem to matter if you work a 4 hour shift or 76 hours a week (they won't give you a full 40), it's never good enough. The stress of working for this company has hospitalized me 3 times. (And don't expect insurance to cover it, cause it doesn't.)"
bad,"I enjoyed working there, my coworkers were very nice and helpful, the managers on other hand were not. I rarely saw my boss and he barely communicated other than to tell me off. After surgery I went back and they expected me to lift things heavier than what my doctor said I could and one manager actually teased me. I picked up smoking and had an extended recovery time due to them overworking me. I was in and out of the hospital so much that I decided it would best if I just quit."
bad,I wouldn't recommend working for Walmart . Honestly they don't care about their employees no matter how long you have been with them . They also don't pay their staff well
bad,"Trucks Were Hot , not much cool air was provided by the company very fast paced work not much room to move between aisles. Worked long shifts into the night."
bad,"Management showed favoritism rude customers no set shifts did not work with life outside of work, did not get relief on time for breaks and to get off work, poor communication skills."
bad,When I started with Walmart it was a  great company to be with everything was great but the last few years it has went down hill. they raised pay to 15.00 an hour and expected way to much after that and made it impossible to complete task in an 8 hour shift there for wanting to hold associates accountable as to fire them and then hire someone at a cheaper rate. Walmart could become the company it once was if they tried . being there since 2007 I feel I wasted to much time with them
bad,"My typical day at work consisted of doing the jobs of at least 2 other people. I organized, set up and cleaned up all areas of apparel. Was constantly cleaning up/fixing shirt walls in every section because day shift never fixed them; same with the table displays. Never was appreciated by my actual night manager; was told I needed to do more despite actual department managers for each apparel section telling me I always did a great job and helped them immensely. I called off a few times due to sickness and was still let go despite other co workers constantly calling off for no reason. They keep those who get buddy buddy with management. So if you can get close to management, slacking off shouldn't be an issue. Moving up in the company doesn't exist. They tend to hire new people for management or higher positions so they don't have to pay them properly. Also they keep you right under full time by about 2-3 hrs."
bad,"I have body pain and and what I’m pretty sure is insomnia now because of walmart. I worked overnight but I don’t know if the day shift is better, I would not recommend my shift to anyone tho"
bad,Lots of drama. The drama at Wal-Mart is outrageous. The management parties with cashier. It's crazy. There is favoritism in every department. They run off the good help.
bad,"The job can be either enjoyable or constant stress depending on who your assistant manager is. unfortunately even if you have a great assistant manager above you other assistant managers can still make your job a struggle on a daily basis. Avoid to many promotions or friendships, advancement is fast and cut throat. individuals will throw you under the bus for a promotion as well as pin things on you, once you get promoted they will ""test you"" by putting you in near impossible situations constantly to see if you will quit or if they can fire you for someone less experienced and asking for less pay."
bad,"Hours are hard management is less than caring, pay is decent. I wish they had a more flexible way to communicate with employees and had better shifts."
bad,At Walmart you are never guaranteed anything. Your hours go up and down. You do not know which manager you are required to answer to daily. If you get sick and miss 3 days you are fired even with a Drs note.
bad,I learned how to handle angry customers and how to handle myself as a employee at Walmart. I met new people some were fun to talk to and some was okay
bad,They should make it 6 hour works days not 2-11 only and they should also have the managers helping out more and the people their are sometimes lazy and do not wanna do their own work.
bad,"I mean its Walmart, what else do you need to say.  Its budy but they don't pay well or treat their employees well. I made some great friends their though."
bad,Co workers would sleep on the job/call in all the time was expected to pick up the slack constantly. Did get alot of hrs which was both a benefit and curse.
bad,"Hard to get ahead unless you fit in with the right ""click"". Entry level positions don't pay enough. Dead end job. Moral support hasn't really took place until just recently, but I question if its genuine."
bad,"-Fast paced and somewhat tiring"
bad,worked as a temporary seasonal employee. Did chile roasting in the summer for the seasonal department. Work was alright but pay was low. Walmart does discriminate
bad,"Great company, long hours and days. Must work weekends and nights sometimes. Great environment to learn skills for moving on in life. Always busy and short staffed to it's easy to move up."
bad,"this is a place where you can meet a lot people. meaning the public, people can be very mean, rude and disrespectful at times."
bad,Mainly for where I worked (the bakery) it was nothing but putting people down (minus a few workers who were awesome) and being frustrated with everything. I wasn’t taught what to do and then I would get yelled at but would never be taught how to do it. They basically threw me in and hoped I knew how to swim away from the pollution.
bad,I would not recommend Wal-Mart as an employment opportunity. They have a high turn over rate. They do not like giving you time off even for a funeral.
bad,"If you believe in high work place morals and the integrity of the work place no matter the persons job-title, then you may want to rethink emploment. I can honestly say that if corporate would do random pop-ins not letting anyone including the market managers know they are coming, true knowledge of what really goes on with daily operations would be a real eye opener. Thing is when made aware of the pop-in the market managers contact the store managers and the store managers meet with the operation managers to correct any issues before visit so ultimately the visit is a facade. I will admit that the benefits are mostly what keeps the employees besides needing a job. This is one of the easiest places to get a job, any and everyone just about is hired. The employees are referred to as bodies."
bad,ok to work at did let you do other things and to learn other departments. they get realy strict when it comes to innovatory time and are ones who do not want an associate to get help when hurt.
bad,Certain employees got to do whatever they wanted and I always got stuck on self check out which I don't believe was fair. It should have been rotated.
bad,"Company needs to have more respect for employees, offer better benefits and work with personal scheduling needs , difficult to advance to higher positions."
bad,It was a nice place to work until I started learning new things. Once management knew that i had the skills they were quick to make people do things above their pay grade.
bad,Walmart is not a family friendly eviroment anymore. The management there expects you to be at their beckon call when ever they need you and please don't get sick or have a death in your family because they will point you out.
bad,Walmart was a fun first job to have. Unfortunetly you cannot live off the money you make there. And you have to be very fasr paced to work their because of the long line of customers waiting.
bad,"Walmart says they are there for the customer, but are only out for themselves.  On a daily basis I had to fufil my role as well as several sales associates roles.  I was expected to do the work of several people and held accountable for all of the jobs.  I was never able to get my job done."
bad,"There is a lot of confusing in the store I work at one personal department seems in concerned about you,  watch videos and you go out on the floor no assistance, jumping from one area to another, some associates expect you to know how to work certain equipment with out proper training. they flat out expect a lot for the salary they pay. its not a job for any one who has been making over $35  per hour. I understand they stress all about the costumer coming in the door, but little on the associates that work, seems to be a job for the mostly low educated people. nothing to motivate you to come to work."
bad,Expectations for tasks to get done were quite difficult to complete because there were so many for one person to accomplish. I managed to complete all
bad,It’s a job I had to take until I got hired on to another job that had a better opportunity for me as a person that like to work and not working hard but not getting paid
bad,not worth long time not fair in any aspect to life and most manger corrupted by there bonus to care about there workers always understaffed lack of costomer service due to understaff and not caring based on how mangers lead  subject to stores not all are as bad
bad,"Walmart is good, they pay well, they treat you well. they take away your soda machine even though they can obviously afford it. their new scheduling system is lame"
bad,I would stock and zone shelves and had to have it all done before the end of the shift even if there was way more then we could handle. Never stayed in one place for to long they kept moving you to different areas. had to do a lot of online training and courses just to get a pay raise. the were disorganized and not very good at managing their employees.
bad,"It's Walmart. Nothing about this job is particularly great, everything about working there is consistent with the concept of the ""retail trap"", and advancement is essentially only possible for people willing to make Walmart their career."
bad,"Walmart was a fast paced job, especially for my position. I liked the teamwork and helpful co workers. Overall, Walmart was a good well paying job, all you had to do was show your face and do your part."
bad,i hated working at wallmart.it was very stressful and the customers are very rude.they act like we owe them.i also hate we was not aloud to approch a customer stealing
bad,"Not the best place in the world to work. However, I did learn quite a lot from working there. I also met some pretty amazing individuals as well so yea."
bad,never ever felt like I received the proper wage for the years worked and other people that got hired would receive a higher wage which was not treated fairly at all
bad,"If your going and don't really need money to live, Wal-Mart is the place to be. I worked at the Eldersburg location. It was not the best place to work."
bad,"severely under paid"
bad,As a department manager of toys it was exhausting. I was by myself during the day more than 90% of the time. Everything was expected of me to get finished what overnights had not plus my work on top of helping my associates in the back. Delegating work to the associates who came on my mid shift could hardly ever get what i asked of them due to the fact that overnight managers and day managers did not communicate well at all. My associates who worked in my area were always pulled for another area that was more important so upper management said. But i was held responsible for what was not taken care of.
bad,"The people i had seem to work with were just very poor in character and it was hard to get along with any of them, the customer service was pretty good though"
bad,"I worked there for over 23 years, why?  I can't tell you.  I guess being a military wife it was easy to transfer."
bad,We are a badly understaffed store. We are pushed past our limits in attempt to cover all of the jobs needed done. We are left feeling physically and mentally beaten and abused at the end of our day. Some managers try to help but they can only do so much before they are being crushed under the weight of how this store is badly ran.
bad,"Friendly enviorment, good team work and quality of customer service excellent.  Price tags for merchandise excellent. Good pricing and never out of stock. Sales assosciates very friendly."
bad,I didn't dislike my job at walmart. Managment needed help with communication and improvement. The employees were friendly and worked together to get stuff done. I enjoyed my time working there overall.
bad,"•	Scan each item placing items into bags"
bad,Care more about the goods and the money. Do not always treat workers well. Good to the community. It helps a lot of charities. They help the community.
bad,"The Sun Prairie Walmart started out being an okay place to work for. The management has gotten worse in subsequent years. Walmart expects its associates to do more work with less people. This in my opinion is an unreachable goal. A typical day at work is making sure the customer knows that they are important and helping them find whatever they are looking for. Helping the customer with a bright, friendly smile is also a must. The hardest part of the job is dealing with irate customers. I have learned that I can usually diffuse a potentially bad situation by just staying calm, having patience, and giving them a big smile. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to see my regular customers. They will actually wait in my line, even if it is long, just to see me. That is the best part about being a cashier."
bad,A very stressful place you could not count when you would work or schedule anything. You did not get help most of the time. Would not want to work there again if possible. Some of the people there were good but not the high ups.
bad,La necesidad de la empresa impide que dediques tiempo de validad a tu familia
bad,Management is no good work hours were not flexible poor working environment never got a raise in the two years that I was there hours never added up to full-time and no one ever showed up for their shift. Get in trouble if you worked to many hours.
bad,Não estou mais trabalhando na empresa já faz 7 anos mais foi uma das empresas que mais gostei de trabalha em equipe!
bad,"Clean registers, Work the register as well as bagging the groceries for the customer as well. Restock our isles and make sure Candy and items were not out dated."
bad,"Decent minimum wage pay, and the occurrence system is very flawed. It allows for employees to call out for seemingly no reason, leading to poor work ethic and short staff days often."
bad,Walmart is surprising to say the least i went in expecting a thriving workplace culture and was met withe the lowest morale and enthusiasm for its employees that i have ever seen it was eye opening how terrible a company can be ran.
bad,Production oriented job without production pay. No chance of career advancement unless you are close friends with upper management or have someone pulling for you.
bad,The managers at Wal-Mart were very disrespectful to their workers.  Working this job only motivated me more to finish my college degree and have higher aspirations for my self.
bad,"Walmart was a great job , it was unfortunate I was laid off due to circumstances out of my control. Pay was great for my area , i would go back if need be."
bad,I hated working at Walmart. Its very messy and the managers have no control of their workers. I've reported to them numerous times .I hated working there with a passion.
bad,"The environment is draining, stressful, and mind numbing. Either you work there or you will be replaced, you definetly get the sense of your easily replacable. The only way I kept my sanity was to try to keep moving up, but it wears you down and you definetly dont want to make this the rest of your life."
bad,while i enjoyed working with the customers and my co workers there was a lack of communication when it came to employment.  they didn't seem to care about employees.
bad,A typical day working at Walmart was standing behind a cash resigter and checking people out and helping bagging their iteams for them. As I was doing claims which i would put back bad items into a different room. And I use to do pick-ups which i would go shop for people who ordered online. The hardest part about working there was that they wouldnt work with me with my school schedule. And the one thing i enjoy about working there was having talks with customers getting to them well they got to know me. And i also had my regulars which was fun to talk to as well cause some of them we becoming like friends but at work
bad,I didn't mind working for the company but they had poor management and were not good at keeping up with employees and paperwork. I became very ill while working here and went on medical disability that should have kept me from losing my job but even still the manager over my department took me off the schedule and fired me.
bad,"A typical day of work would normally start at 5PM and go to 10PM most weekdays and some weekends.  I worked through one of the coldest winters retrieving carts to the entrance and keeping the walkway free of ice, snow, and debris.  It was a tough job that did not pay well and the hours were brutal especially since i worked during high school. The managers were tough but good at their jobs and divided work fairly evenly between employees.  The hardest part of the job was being able to push through several inches of snow and ice and windchills commonly below freezing/0 during the winters and high heat during the summers.  Overall the experience was not the best but i guess there's not much more i could say other than"
bad,Worked there for a year I think didn't much like it they told me that I hade to be casher be for I could work in any other department and I never got to go anywhere else
bad,The deli was a great working place but the manager was a piece of work. She was overbearing and mean. She didn't have respect for any of the workers in the deli area
bad,You have to accomplish a lot of things and get a lot done. They expect to much out of the amount of staff they have.  There are a lot of fun people to work with.
bad,"Es un lugar donde se necesitan personas constantemente, pues la gente se cansa de la mala gestión del trabajo y se marcha. Trabajo, salario no se corresponden, te contratan full time pero te bajan horas a su antojo y no respetan tu availability."
bad,"Jornada completa, desarrolo y control de procesos , dirección de proyectos , cultura laboral buena,  la parte mas dificil era llegar de madrugada incesperadamente , me gusto la coordinacion general."
bad,"Walmart is a great place to work while you are in school, but it does have it downfalls for instance low pay, not enough hours, and their are no benefits for parttime employees."
bad,"A typical day would be to come and clean up the lawn and garden area. Would move heavy pallets from the back of the store to the front and stock the shelves. Unload trucks with a forklift. Build lawn furniture and gas grills.The best part of the job was you were outside"
bad,While i worked at walmart Management didnt take interest into employees needs or advice on company and they didnt supply you with equipment to perform jobs correctly
bad,It was not a great place at all to work for. I've talked with many that say that it was not run correctly. Have even seen customers complain of the way some management treated the employees.
bad,"I worked as a manager at Walmart. During my stay, I had different bosses that I worked with and each brings a different type of Management style. One of my bosses was pleasant to work with because we both went to school (University) in the same area."
bad,Walmart is a ok place to work they will work u hard but if u like the fast paste u will be ok sometimes it can go slow but for most walmart is a ok place to work its a good place to work if u like working with people
bad,"this company has too many people with managers title and they dont have a clue whats going on in there store.  they work you long hours at time before you get a break. working for this company you dont feel safe because they get some of the rudest  and aggressive customers but the managers act like their desperate for sale so they do nothing about the issues and allow the disrespect to continue, always worrying about calls to corporate. the next worst thing working for this company is the steal from you:  you would be schedule to work 8hr and it got busy and the ask you to help out in stead of paying you over time they add to your time and have the balls to ask the next day to take extended lunch time in order to eliminated the over time you did, this cant be legal..the only part of the job i like is meeting a lot of different people from all over the world"
bad,"Walmart is struggling to meet the challenge from Amazon and discount retailer (Aldi, Dollar stores, etc.) and has so far failed to come up with an effective strategy."
bad,"Company overall probably good - individual stores generally poorly managed, managers generally poor overall, associates not treated with respect and not given any appreciation to what they do."
bad,"Walmart has alot of great people to work with, and their rules are set in stone, they go over everything with you, and they will train you, the only complaint I would have is that the higher ups do listen to most complaints, normally their is no action done"
bad,Walmart supplies you go if that's the last option it's hard to get a pay raise their they look out for themselves and not their employees and Management's all over the place
bad,"working was stressful at times and management was very "
bad,Workplace is always understaffed and an overall stressful enviornment. Customers are disrespectful and the management doesn't  understand family circumstances and schedule accomodations if you have children.
bad,I was not there long because i went the another job but while was there the hours where not good at all and they would give you hour that you said on your app that you could not do
bad,Poor management and employers are inconsistent. Work days are slow. Performed exchange of money for products. Scheduling is inconsistent and booking off days are prior three weeks.
bad,I was a single student in college and a newlywed at one point. It was an ok job when needing to pay tuition but it was understaffed and the shifts conflicted with suandays and worked almost every sunday and could not get my shifts covered. Also expected to work thanksgiving when my time off request had been approved
bad,Needs better pay for the employees also better benefits such as insurance vacation days along with the sick where you could still have the grace of having a job after a sickness.
bad,it was a great leaning experance  i really loved it. i am also still working there . i want to move up to management  it just takes a while .............
bad,"not enough training on cash register,long wait for supervisor to come when error mad,encounting rude customers,nothing enjoyable,favorites were chosen"
bad,At the location I worked at management was awful. Communication was terrible. You were held accountable for things you had no control over. Severely understaffed EVERY SINGLE DAY.
bad,"they are not the best place to work for, I wouldn't recommend it to no one, the management isn't the best and the work hours are not to good, if you can work in a very stressful work place is this the place for you"
bad,"Clocked brought freight to sales down stacked in front of doors threw freight,blocked all doors to make sure freight in doors look full.Took card board and plastic to back to be taken care of by other associates.Made sure floors were clean and no trash was left behind."
bad,Hours were too long. Supervisor and the IMs position was unruly and yelled at workers. Didn't pay adequate wages. Was the only one paid low wages for too many hours.
bad,Amazing people work there however are poorly treated by head office. Share holders are all that matter. As the company has demoted or let go many of their staff to keep profit's up there are very few people available to help customers.
bad,Poor work/life balance
bad,They do not follow there own rules or standards. Management will tell you one thing and the do the complete opposite. The store manager will tell you he will help you out and the pass it onto a assistant manger who doesn't know your situation.
bad,Worked for OSL retail services selling cell phones. Constantly yelled at by Walmart customers due to the fact that I was unable to help with electronics and Walmart employees were never around.
bad,"While I loved all my co-workers and didn't mind the work I was doing, Walmart as a company is not the best place to work. I was paid the minimum wage, while doing easily the hardest and most demanding job physically. I would never recommend this place unless it was a last choice."
bad,"It was a job, but like all things sooner or later its time to evaluate your place in life and realize you are destined for better things. I ended up going to college to pursue my dream of working in the growing IT field."
bad,"Poor management, managers were rude to employees in front of customers. They are not held accountable for their lack of management skills. The company does not take customer complaints seriously which is a big concern. I feel as a large company their customers and employees do not matter and losing customers will not effect them in a financial aspect"
bad,"Ambiente bom de trabalhar, só um pouco pesado, otimos colegas de trabalhos, otimos gestores e etc."
bad,I worked for Walmart about 2 years. They by passed job advancement for me. I worked only two days a week. Didnt have opportunity to get more hours. A lot of the cashiers didnt help when you were mostly the one doing more of the work while they stood around. Stressful. Only think i liked about the job was doing the transactions and handling the money.
bad,Cleaned and stocker merchandise The managers were nice and I learned how to communicate with people Hardest part is figuring out if you place supplies in the right places
bad,I did not enjoy my time working here.  store had poor management.  the pay I received was poor.  raises was poor.  did not enjoy the customers that I came into contact.
bad,"I appreciate Walmart forgiving me a job, and helping me feed my family.  I feel like the culture in the building is not one that suits me.  I dont have any growth potential."
bad,After working with Walmart for a year and a few months I would not suggest my friends to apply at Walmart when they are looking for a job. Management shows favoritism and doesn’t hesitate to punish its employees
bad,They didn't have very much value for their associates that they worked with and much of the management was a problem as they didn't have an actual understanding of what the workers had to do or the respective time it took to do the job.
bad,"Empresa, legal, boa, paga direito, estrutura legal."
bad,Good place to work and very stressful also. You have to have a good attitude at all times. The managers care more anout themselves than the sales associates.
bad,A good job that u can grow and expand in the future bout mangering learn more new things in the computer Walmart is big and expand out Walmart is in every state u think of
bad,"Walmart is very large company that treats you like your a slave and does not care about you or the customers just the money they make, It is a highly stressful job that lacks good benefits and good management , they only give you hours when they want to give you hours/"
bad,"being a cashier you're on the bottom of the corporate ladder, therefore you work more days in a row than there is in a week and calling off sick was never an option."
bad,My Wal-Mart went through several different managers in a short amount of time. The supervisors were unprofessional and immature and it was difficult to get a CSM to come help with a customer when the situation was above me.
bad,"They say they are very accommodating, however, they don't communicate with each other and you are left having to repeat yourself many times and they often ask if it is ""necessary"" for you to take care of your medical needs."
bad,ok .  the job was monotonous. managers were a little hot headed but the pay is decent and helps u get by. i have not much to say. wont work here again but could be suited for others
bad,"As a member of management, you truly see the culture of the company. The way the employees are treated is unfair, the public face they portray is not the accurate picture."
bad,"You get dragged down in the atmosphere at least where I work at. There's very little room to actually advance, I've tried multiple times and continue to just get transferred to other departments to attempt and increase my own salary."
bad,"I don't know what it's like to work in their stores, but they are trying to learn how to run their warehouses, and they are failing miserably. Too many people at the top that have retail experience and very minimal warehouse experience. You end up with a ton of micro-managers that are meddlesome just for the sake of being meddlesome."
bad,retail in any company is nasty high stress and crazy completion times..everything has to be done yesterday and all 5 things at once.. one manager will tell you one thing another will tell you something else.
bad,"You punch time clock for your shift and depending on how many hours you work in the shift determines if you get 1 break or 2 breaks and a lunch."
bad,". I learned  you have to be very flexible to work here not only with customers but management."
bad,High turnover rate physical labor stress with management and other associates in order to move up you have to be friends with a manager there is no equal or Fair promotions
bad,My department made me very uncomfortable with there racial slurs and remarks so i quit my department .But in the beginning it was nice made a few friends.
bad,Increased responsibility without pay. Over hours or shifts. Denied responsibility of store managers. Increased negativity among associates and management.
bad,"constantly on your feet, management extremely unprofessional including borderline abusive. Hours were absurdly inconsistent, with little to no time off in between."
bad,It is fast paced.  You have to meet certain guidelines.  You only get so many sick days to call in. It was labor intensive and you had to keep up with the inventory.
bad,"Most folks dont think of working there 4 ever, just do it for a short time and move on to something better. Hardest part is unloading the trucks.. Managers some are ok some are not.. Some are rude"
bad,"Basic Job Description: Receive and disburse money in establishments other than financial institutions. Usually involves use of electronic scanners, cash registers, or related equipment. Often involved in processing credit or debit card transactions and validating checks"
bad,"They expect you to work your butt off, but are so cut & dry when you need something. Too much training before you even start the job, on the computer, tedious. Also their absence system is fluky, they go by a point system. The managers are rude and think they are everything. They treated me badly  and I couldn't even talk to them about it. All I got back was sarcasm and attitude. The best part of the job was leaving it."
bad,being a cashier at Walmart is a lot of work. you have to know when you are able to take your breaks and lunches because the CSM are busy and might forget or they are working the service desk because there is a long line or they covering a break or lunch because of it being short staffed.
bad,I have enjoyed working at Walmart. I was part time with getting fulltime hours. The management are good but never feel they truly care .  If we got bonus or extra pay then our hours were cut. I am living off 16 hours a week.
bad,"I learned a lot like Apply glazes, icings, or other toppings to baked goods, using spatulas or brushes.Decorate baked goods, such as cakes or pastries.Prepare or maintain inventory or production records.Direct or coordinate bakery deliveries.Order or receive supplies or equipment. The thing that made it bad was management no knowing what to do"
bad,"Flexible hours is the main positive. They pay close to minimum wage. They employ a ""revolving door"" technique with employees meaning they view you as expendable."
bad,"The workplace was like being a number, the management had no care about the employees. If we, the associates told them that we were unable to do something, like pulling freight, lifting a certain amount of weight. They really did not care. "
bad,it works if you hate your life and want to be broke but i dont know anyone who enjoyed working there. they wont give raises very often. nor do so when asked after going a year without one.
bad,Wal-Mart is a great starter or in-between job but not somewhere I would want to make a career out of...there is too much corporate greed rather than on the customer and saving them $ as they adverstise
bad,"Global retailer with over 5000 locations and strong on line presence."
bad,"Management had their down sides but overall the job was a laid back, easy job. The down sides did include they would hire you as pat time and make you work full time hours so they did not have to provide you with benefits."
bad,Never appreciated anything that was done. they don't appreciate their employees you are just a breathing body that has to show up and do what your told
bad,Management if awful to their associates and do not care. They dont like to work with you on schedules or anything at all. Being department manager at walmart 4108 is a very stressful job. Countless times I cried to how unfair and how awful they treated me.
bad,"Expected to provide quality, fast customer service but prevented from doing so because of supervisors lack of response.  Equipment always ""down"".  Lack of effective communication with management. Too many employees at all levels not caring about their performance."
bad,It was okay working I think it really was unfair how the add up your tardys an  absences an fire you . People have lives an they hold that against you
bad,"Walmart, though a successful company, does not value the day to day interests of customers or employees. There is little advancement opportunities due to favouritism, and the environment for employees is unwelcoming and uncomfortable. There is little appreciation for good work, but is often demeaning and hard on employees, despite of good work. This workplace has internal management issues that were not addressed in the year I was there, and was overall an unchallenging, poorly managed store."
bad,They do not treat people with kindness and they made people close the deli by there self and then when you said something about it they would say that it was job to do it .
bad,"Typical day at work requires to first make sure your given department is clean and zoned. Assist to customers needs, and make sure they are satisfied with your service. Cash customers out, and make sure all items in their cart are properly bagged. Help cashiers when an item needs to overrides, refunds etc. Also line manage, which means to help direct customers to which line to go into for a faster more efficient service. Answer sick calls for cashiers, and help make schedules. The workplace culture was to  respect all associates and customers and to always be professional. Always be patient and calm because you will come across some difficult situations. The enjoyable part of the job was to work like a team, it was fun and you learn a lot on how to multitask."
bad,Walmart is a place where you go when you have no where else to go. The management team was very unprofessional and disrespectable on a good day. It had a lot to be desired.
bad,working at walmart is exactly what you would expect. customers are mostly terrible and managers are overstressed and often take it out on everyone else.
bad,"A typical day at store 5673 is having three or five managers not being able to agree as to what they want you to do that day, and a store manager who uses scare tactics instead of actually managing and threatens your job with nearly every meeting you have with her. ""You can be replaced by tomorrow"" being her favorite phrase to try and get  people to do what she wants done. And every day I feel like my soul is being sucked out."
bad,"Your experience will depend on the store you are assigned or your choose.  Pick a store that has ample resources allocated to it, walk the store before you decide to assess cleanliness"
bad,"I would not recommend working at wal-mart. they are very strict and you are expected to do unlimited amount of things in a very short time. it is crazy at times. they want you to do the job of 3 people and still do your job, its just not possible without not getting something done."
bad,was a cashier and it sucked. management was bad. the pay was awful and barely got any hours. got paid bi weekly and it wasn't enough to get by on. bad job.
bad,"Unless you plan on getting into management or this is a temporary job or supplement to your income and are prepared for a culture that is customer first and associate last, do not work here."
bad,Clean all the isle that you are checking people out on . if you find any out of date items pull the items and give them to management. put away unwanted items
bad,I really didn't like this place it was for men lifting grills payio sets an etc .  I hurt my mouth an no one cared at all it was sad I had blood everywhere an they told me don't brake there equipment but over all it was a job
bad,Can be a somewhat stressful environment. 
bad,the management (managers) has a problem they don't know have a care for their hardworker associates and politics is going on especially on their lovelife inside the store.
bad,"I understand how big stores operate and i understand the culture. just not a fan of micromanaging. However, it is a big chain so i can see why profits are so important."
bad,Its a ok place to work. just need to work on some management issues. I have  been there for almost three years and really love my customers. They are what make my job easy.
bad,I enjoyed meeting new people and I had some good customers who really liked me because I would go above and beyond for the ones who couldn't do things for themselves.
bad,I was working overnight and was told it was a part time job. Getting payed 8.45 an hour. I'm a student so after work I was in school and couldn't change to day time because the manager said there was no positions yet they were low on staff.
bad,"It was fast paced, with lots to do. Management was ok. Unfair expectations. Spread the workforce thin and often. Although it wasn't anyone's fault who worked there, but the people who shopped there were difficult to say the least."
bad,this was the most stressful job i ever had in my life. they value team work but do not inforce that. i had to lift heavy microwaves off shelves without any assistance.
bad,"It wasn't that bad but the trainer was in fact a horror. I was treated like I worked there for years, even though I was only there for a week."
bad,Hours were never consistent. Always understaffed breaks were not consistent. Time passed fast because it was always busy. We never had enough staff for the amount of work there was.
bad,"I was a cashier,  I will also stay later and help stock the shelves around the holidays, Customer Service Representative ▪ Communicated politely with customers to ascertain the services needed. ▪ Received cash and check payments and entered the information in the computer ▪ Explained to customers any processes or further instructions related to their financial transaction"
bad,"As far as working at Walmart, there was many spills of a variety in nature, but overall there was many things that had to be handled with  a lot of time consumption."
bad,Its an ok place  to work but its very stressful at times they demand a lot out of you for what seems like very little pay. They make you feel that work is more important than home life and my kids come first. They will deney vacation time when asked for after its been apporved.for the benifits side they offerd good packagesfor health dental and vision along with the stock and 401 k. overall its a stable job if your willing to deal with the stress
bad,Its an okay place to work. management is kinda bad They work with your schedule if youre in school. But other than that youre always short handed and money hungry.
bad,"Learned how to talk to difficult customers for the first time (first job), learned what was customer satisfaction and how to go the extra mile. Management was more leader like in that they helped rather than barked orders."
bad,"Lame outdated processes! If u want to work harder than necessary all day every day, then join the walmart distribution team.  Very old school.  They never change or listen to new ways to make processes easier. Safety is a joke! I never made 40 hours a week ever.  Never any overtime for my shift but plenty for other shifts.  It was a joke!  Good ol boys club! I’m regards to management . They need some new fresh blood at the top if they want to compete with AMAZON. They are soo behind the times. Work harder not smarter.  Walmart motto."
bad,"Walmart is a starting job, a chance to adjust from going to school to being in the work force. there is minimal chance to advance and little incentive to go above and beyond."
bad,"Working at Wal-Mart is a constant battle between us the pharmacy and them the store. And them is in charge, so figure that one out. Often your DM will be a bozo with a business degree from a community college or worse and will have no moral compass."
bad,"I got hired on as a part time worker in lawn and garden. I would water flowers, load mulch, and set up kayaks. If someone started slacking on their work I would have to do their work as well or I would get in trouble."
bad,It's a terribly company that uses skeleton crews and underpays everyone who works for them. Typical American business garbage that destroys people's lives.
bad,"Like any other supermarket, its a starter job. Pay is low, hours are low, can't get benefits until you've worked there over a year. Managers will treat you poorly."
bad,"Walmart could be a great place to work for but with lack of leadership, employees and inconsistency in the work place, it makes Walmart a tough place to work for."
bad,I have worked for Walmart consecutively for almost 10 years. The company is ever evolving but most of the time the evolving isn't in the favor of the associates. All in all its not a horrible company just one that has lost sight of their treatment of employees.
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was being around a variety of different kinds of people.  The hardest part of the job was the it was hard to advance.
bad,Walmart is a good place to learn the basics of retail and manegment. It's big bonus is that it dose promote rom within. However once you have been with the company long enough to qualify for the promotion you've likely learned there is much better out there.
bad,"After being with the company for 7 years I’m walking away with no intentions on going back. The team work is gone, and more unnecessary accountability has been made."
bad,caixa registradora sem muito a acrescentar basicamente.
bad,"Shifts and, hours and pay not as flexible as it should be.  Shifts and pay should be according to how long and how well you have worked there. when minimum wage was raised everyone's pay should have increased accordingly and it did not.  I have worked there over 9 years and because of the minimum wage increase I barely make over that.  Not fair for how long and hard I have worked there.  My shift was changed dramatically from a normal shift to an evening shift. again, not how a hard-working long-lasting employee should be rewarded."
bad,"They had job performance expectations that  were unrealistic, such as lifting  I couldn't lift. Breaks were held off past the time I should have gone  and unfairly treated when it came to time off."
bad,"It was an experience, yet there was no job security. The compensation packet was not what was expected. The expectations of the management was unrealistic."
bad,Too much work for less money.  Dealing with customers was very challenging wide variety of people coming in.  Customers are always right and that was hard to deal with.  Hard to deal with people stealing and lying about it.
bad,"A decent place to work if you are in-between jobs, going to school, or have no where else to go. Otherwise, I don't recommend it because they work you ragged, the hours are getting worse by the day, and they thrive on a culture of ""Your replacement is right behind you. We don't need you anymore.""."
bad,Went from a great company to work for to one that only used you for lining the managers pockets. Absolutely pathetic what this company has come to. Was run out of the company after 27 years to make way for part timers so they didn't have to provide insurance anymore.
bad,"Going to work at 7 am, clock in. Begin of the day. Clean up the Customer service desk . Help Customer with their item or inquire."
bad,"Gerentes mal preparados, falta controle em processos, sistemas, etc. A cultura americana do Walmart é muito forte, mas é necessário adequar a realizada brasileira."
bad,It was a great place to work as long as management was on same page. I learned alot on my own because no one trained me to do my job correctly so i had to work on what i already knew
bad,"I hated working for this store, their personnel wasn’t helpful. The other associates were really great people but if you were to ask them how they felt about the management they would agree with me. Management were disrespectful to their associates."
bad,"Walmart is good because its very easy. Most of the employees are retired or very close to it. You get quarterly bonuses but its a terribly boring job. Just a lot of wandering around, and a good lazy job."
bad,"Although some of the managers were spectacular, most of the management were not understanding and some quite rude. If it was not for the upper management I would probably still love to work for this company."
bad,perhaps it is just the one I work at but the managers play favorites and act like we are in high school. the only thing i like about my job is the hours because it come in early and leave early. I also get to bake and that can be relaxing.
bad,"Not a good place to work, very cut throat management takes their anger out on you.  Very unorganized, would not recommend this place to anyone. Then again some things may have changed"
bad,"Working at Wal mart has been stressful, leaves me no time to spend with family, Managements was slacking, I worked more than what I got paid. I wish the best to whomever works there"
bad,This is a company that will give you the experience you need to help you father your customers service experience but for me this was not a career company That I could see my self staying in
bad,"nothing special"
bad,"My experience with Walmart has been varied. I've gone through several positions but never felt like I actually could move up. Then I realized I don't want to. The management is unorganized and disrespectful, and I personally know several managers that stepped down because of it. They would rather take a pay cut and continue working as a regular associate than move up because of the lack of respect between managers, and the high stress and expectations associated with the new title weren't worth the raise. "
bad,I worked there after getting out of high school. I was a cashier and started during the Christmas season. there were some really good people  I worked with and not a lot of them are still there.
bad,Overall I didn't like Walmart personally. It was a tense environment and had a lot of drama.The hours were not flexible and rude management. I wouldn't work there again.
bad,"Walmart may be a huge company, but upon working there it seems like they just got lucky.  Horrible management, they don't even try to make you feel like you matter.  They hire practically anybody which really isn't a good thing cause you will end up having to work harder to make up for lazy associates.  I literally had someone threaten to slash my tires and beat me up.  Instead of firing them, they just moved me into another department.  I even had a supervisor sexually harass me and they actually punished me for coming forward because I ""must have gotten an unfair advantage from it"".  They did fire him, so that was good.  I quit soon after because when it came time for a raise I only got 20 cents.  And even after everything, I was always one of their hardest workers."
bad,"Started out promising at first when I started. You soon learn that nobody really cares about you and management is completely useless, greedy, and sadistic about how everything runs in the store. Somehow they always have the wrong people as management... but at least there will always be REALLY good, awesome customers that you get along with but there will mostly be HORRIBLE customers who really want to screw you up. If your a sales associate, be prepared to to do every job in the store including cashiering."
bad,It’s a sad place an emotional work place I was depressed at times who disrespect me so many times an confrontation talk to the managers they don’t believe anything what u tell them
bad,very hard to make production. Management is very hard on
bad,"Oftentimes store management is the worst at communicating new or changing processes, procedures, or directives in regards to essential or special routines.  "
bad,"Was hired for seasonal work and kept on after the holidays for being a good asset and a hard worker, so the company does recognize employees' efforts, and provides some room for advancement"
bad,I was there for 10 years.  From when i started as a midnight stocker to a bakery person. To working in the meat dept and the deli. They kept changing the way they did things to the way managers treated there employees.  It was definitely a fast paste place.
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the customers. The hardest part of the job was standing in one place for hours. Work place culture was always very busy. I enjoyed getting to know all the staff members. I really enjoyed helping the elderly customers, and did my best to make sure they had all of their contents in the bags so they would not forget anything left behind."
bad,"Very flexible hours but for minimum wage. Friendly environment but customers can be frustrating and can be kind, it can be very random. Good part-time job if your in school or as a 2nd side job. Depending on the store, management will only do bare minimum for 'their' job requirements. Very few options to move up in position, if you choose to. Depending on the store, can be overwhelmed by customers with little help."
bad,"The company has very clear best practices as part of their required training, which comply with applicable laws, but makes zero effort to enforce their own protocols to the detriment of its stakeholders and the entire community it serves."
bad,"I will not recommend working here"
bad,Management was hard to work with getting days missed accepted due to being in the hospital. The clothing department was under employed by five employees due to managers trying to make their numbers look better.
bad,"Seriously guys, get new management. Somehow it amazes me how a multi-billion dollar company cannot find people who can keep their departments manned with people."
bad,"Company is good letting you take time off due to death, illness they are flexible. A typical day is researching and rebilling pharmacy claims for payment."
bad,"Lack of proper job training for the actual department I'll be working in."
bad,The working environment was very stressful. I was undertrained. Got in trouble for no call no show because I was never told or given the separate number to call for a call in.
bad,"Not at all impressed with the atmosphere at Walmart in Olean, NY.  You were either in or you were not if that makes any sense. I was informed that I had a target on my back because I challenged the personal manager with her inability to provide me answers to questions I asked regarding a promotion I received after being employed for less than 6 weeks."
bad,"Tough place to work. Opinion is not taken into consideration. Management cares about numbers only. Also, you are a number to the company. You have a number ID. Also, minimal advancement opportunities."
bad,Para quem esta começando a trabalhar esta empresa é muito boa.
bad,"I worked there for a seasonal job. They talk about being happy and helpful, but if one person that you work with has a problem with you, then they all have a problem with you."
bad,I liked my job at Walmart would go back to work there if any positions were open.  I have reapplied online for job but have not received call back for a job there
bad,The environment is very highschool-like. My job itself was very enjoyable and generally easy to perform but the management at this store is a terrible group of soul suckers.
bad,"Over the course of time I've been at Wal-Mart I've noticed management consistently makes a fool out of you. They single you out and ignore simple requests made such as booking time well in advanced off, cutting back hours and not keeping equipment up to date. As of late I've been forced to look for a new job and my hours have been decreased to a minimum. It's sad that they have so much money but use it on the wrong things."
bad,Work loads where high and rules and policies continuously changed making it difficult to accomplish goals set by management. Employees were given write ups for every offense even if they where unaware of a violation that was not placed in the rule handbook.
bad,"It  is nice place to work, if you are just starting out, after you have been there awhile you might think the same thing or you might change your mind."
bad,"All around working for walmart was good,Job hours were hard to get use to being an overnight ZSM.Worked well with other employees,Was always on time and available 7 days a week."
bad,"They are cutting hours, cutting job positions, and increasing work loads beyond what individuals can logically do. When I first started I was told to stay in my department unless a customer asked for help in another. Now they are expecting a handful of employees to take care of multiple departments. They also cut back office positions, piling a workload onto claims. I have seen so many employees crying in the back room or break room, men and women, because they are struggling to get anything done. People don't even get a chance to really learn about their areas and customer service suffers as a result."
bad,"I didn't really care for my employment at Walmart. I could never reach a person of management, I was floating for the first 3 weeks of my employment with no training at all whatsoever, the pay was horrible even though I had years of experience prior, and management was extremely rude."
bad,Hours get cut all the time. Management always bothering you. No more profit sharing or bonus money. You are just another body to them. They tell you how important you are then take away all of the things that made it great to work there 20 years ago.
bad,Over all I enjoy working at Walmart.  Love the people.  Love the training was more than prepared me for my responsibilities .Knew exactly what was expected of me and when I had questions they show me not told me  how to do it right.   Just looking for something with not so much inconsistency in the work schedule. Can not make plans for more than 3 weeks in future because work hours change all the time.  One week your will work 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. and the next week you will work 5:30 a.m.  to 2:30 p.m.
bad,"I felt like during my brief stint at Wal-Mart, I was not trained in the tasks I was asked to perform.  Many times a manager would ask me to do an assignment that I was not trained for, and when I asked for help, they would shrug it off saying never mind.  The department manager was a joke not wanting to help me schedule around a full time job, requiring me to work Fri-Monday instead of just evenings like I had asked."
bad,"I stocked shelves and managed inventory, binned product.  Straightened product on shelves (facing).  I worked Saturdays Sundays and during the week.  I worked overnights and a lot of overtime,"
bad,Teamwork is needed to do a big job in a big area. Less tasks will not give you much advancement in industries. And if you have to make a big decision do it quickly.
bad,"Walmart is a billion dollar company with billion dollar problems. Benefits are the only thing that keeps employees clocking in. The pay is not competitive at all. More time and money is put into bringing in seasonal employees with no work experience, but they take minimum wage, so its a win for that current stores payroll. You can compare employee development to that dad who went to the store to get cigarettes and never came back. Its not there."
bad,This place is OK to work at.  You get an hour lunch break which is nice.  The managers were generally nice.  The customers can be a headache which can not be good.
bad,management jumps on small fires to put out now everyday instead of following guidelines of how to run the store. instead of training management the sit in the office and help with very little inside the store
bad,"Its Walmart, everything is cheap right down to how they treat you including Pay. There were Managers and Supers who didnt even know how the backroom process works and still tried to tell you how to do your job. Paid poorly for the amount of work and labor demanded, got Verbal warnings if you work overtime. "
bad,I was really looking forward to working for walmart in the beginning but once I started my position there it was a lack of management experience and professionalism
bad,I loved the job itself and felt the pay was adequate but could no longer work in such a hostile work enviroment that was caused  by management..I think if they treated their employees with more respect it would help.
bad,Ok job for teens looking fir work. Very relaxing job easy to handle fork lift. Not that much of a discount was given to us. They security was too much
bad,"I pretty much ran our online pickup portion of the store and nobody knew what to do. They had to call other stores for help. My new department manager came in from produce and had no idea what he was doing, I ended up doing all Management's work, it just didn't come with the title of manager."
bad,"After 3 years of working for Walmart, no advancement was met. I had compliments from customers left and right, yet no management appraised me. The Walmart I worked at was always understaffed and it was always a cluster because they would mix every department associates together. I would've left years ago if it wasn't for my assistant manager working with my schedule. Now that they have the new system of scheduling, it was time for me to go."
bad,"Work will be fun and exciting at first but it'll eventually start to take a burden on you and become a nightmare. My first few months at Walmart were fun and challenging until a new management and scheduling system messed everything up. There were 6 of us but now only 3 (4 but one covers other departments now). I can work Sun- Thurs any time but only work 4 and half hours, 7 on Sundays and my other coworker only works on Wednesdays! She's been with Walmart for years and has full availability but only works one day? So that leaves me with all the responsibility of keeping my area clean and zoned in under 4 hours , and taking care of customers plus the call for 2028's ( Back up registers). "
bad,"The main part of the job is to load boxes into trailers that are delivered directly to Walmart stores. You will get about one month  of training and then you’re on your own. It’s very fast paced and you can be assigned six lanes to work. To use the restroom, grab a drink of water is almost impossible until break time. Managers will not confront other shift managers about employees not finishing loading their trailers, housekeeping, sending off trailers before their shift ends. What happens is you fall behind from the beginning of the shift and never catch up. A computer tracks your pace and if you don’t move enough freight you get written up. They won’t even call you in the office to sign anything, just write you up. This company doesn’t mess around, a minute late, write up, ask for a bandaid, write up, call in sick, write up."
bad,"Wal-Mart is as bad to work for as it seems.  you will typically be pigeonholed into a job area, conditions are filthy, and unhealthy.  management does not care about your health or well being.  Got written up for attendance after missing a couple days while in the hospital following a heart attack."
bad,"Favoritism, worked with a lot of two-faced people. No big bonuses, cut hours a lot , had good and bad days. I enjoyed the customers. Just another job for some money."
bad,"They wrote me up for absolutely stupid reasons and decided to leave. Horrible management, and was promised 10 dollars an hour but was never given it. Lunch times were extremely random, sometimes 30 minutes allowed and other times 1 hour. Whenever management weren't getting in the way, the job wasn't horrible. I was yelled at for not taking my break without notifying my supervisor, but I was told I could do this and did it for literal months. Wouldn't recommend this particular Walmart."
bad,Their sole goal is to ensure that their executive managers and stock holders are well compensated. They do not embody customer service and do not like competition in their markets. They want to be the ONLY footprint in retail in a particular market.
bad,"hay mucha discriminacion y problemas de racismo en la florida con los empleados emigrantes, solo promueven a las personas que les caen bien a los asisten manager  o comanager. ademas no les gusta trabajar y recargan a la gente que trabaja, quitandoles las horas a las personas y jugando con los horarios. Tambien hay gente que tiene posiciones fijas y horarios acomodados."
bad,"Working in retail is hard enough without having hardly any supervisor or management helping you or backing you up when you need help, a break, or to take care of an angry customer."
bad,I didn't like working at walmart. I had several people that told me what to do and each one was different. I didn't have 1 specific person to answer to. They all had different ways of doing things.
bad,"fun experience. management should have been more educated about there job."
bad,"I was assigned to the service desk. Most, if not all"
bad,I worked as a cashier and than worked in the deli in Walmart.it has its days .there was a lot of cleaning or zone and straighten up the areas near or around you .there was stock to put up and frozen food also that need to be put up.
bad,"While fellow employees are, for the most part, encouraging and a delight to work with, the ""bad apples"" really do spoil the bunch. Because while there are plenty of hard workers, the ones that refuse are somehow babied and protected and management refuses to do anything about the problem"
bad,the job was OK to work for company is fast paced you schedule changes regularly .  management is OK for what they do .  you never know when you have to work
bad,I was in management for 13 yrs and the typical day was more than 12 hours of just babysitting and completing notes. The job isn't hard and as long as you do what you are suppose to you should be fine.
bad,"Not a happy place to work, management didn't seem to care about their employees, they were to worried about the bottom dollar of how much money they made."
bad,"I was lucky to work at a new facility. It was always nice and clean and had a great management staff. They were flexible on hours. They do not pay overtime, but do have Sunday pay."
bad,"I constantly had people taking about me or telling my business. Manger's not doing there job, walking about doing nothing and some of them are in relationships and doing stuff on the clock. ."
bad,"Typical Day- All about operations, merchandising and people development. "
bad,"While Walmart promotes a lot of employee-friendly mindsets and sugarcoats everything, the nitty gritty of the job was that it was menial work and they expect it to get done at robotic speeds. I heard people constantly say around me that it used to be ""like a family"" to work there years prior, and I wish I had seen that, but it was nothing like I experienced. Only reason to apply at all is the company starting wage, but if you don't advance just after your first 6 months it's likely you won't be advanced at all without fighting tooth and nail for a higher level position. An unfortunate truth, but people get lost in the Walmart system being stuck there the rest of their lives."
bad,They do not understand anything you do. They will go and write you up for every little thing you do wrong and not work with you at all on how you can fix any of it.
bad,You start out low but the bar is set higher than anyone would like to uphold. The Managers have a short fuse and really let you know when you've made a mistake.
bad,They do not hire people full time. If you are scheduled for 32 hours in one week and you go over your time by five minutes then you are expected to leave five minutes at the end of the week. Youre given high expectations when you  start but they aren't lived up to at all.
bad,I did not enjoy my time here. It was a fast paced environment. Management did not want me to remove expired or moldy produce. I was told the customers would do that themselves.
bad,"Working at Walmart was sort of like moving with the waves.  Something would happen and we as workers had to just help each other because if you got a job you had to know the skills for that job even though we werent properly trained.  We definetly learned on the job and although it was a tough process I learned to adapt with whatever was thrown my way.  My only hard point to drive across would be that commuication is key, especially between managers and those under the manager and walmart definetly lacked in this area.  With good communication, who knows how long I would have stayed."
bad,"Customer Service, Money Handling,  Phone Answering, Stocking, Cashier Training, Good Memory with Numbers, Fun Work environment, easy days, not a bad schedule"
bad,"A new manager came to our store and over a period of about 6 months, he transferred, demoted or terminated about 60 people.  He did this in order to fill these positions with people from his previous store."
bad,If you know Walmart employees that complain then yeah. Management is very unfair and bad and they don't care for you. Only one manager was good to me and di as I ask him to do.
bad,worked there for 10 years.  despite learning every area possible i couldn't get promoted.  every annual review listed me highest on their ranking yet never given the chance to grow and advance
bad,"The corporate management is out of touch with the customer and far away from the market that the store operates, too many middle managers making life difficult by creating too many changes of work rules and conditions."
bad,"I worked in the front end, I really liked the job i did but the management could definitely use some work and employees need to have better work ethics. There were always good days as well as bad days with everyone who worked there.  Breaks could not always be taken due to being understaffed as always."
bad,"management is never around when you need them, nobody is on the same page, no promotions unless you suck up to the right people in management. people get away with things to much"
bad,"When working for Walmart, you get treated like dirt by the customers, management and other employees. Everyone one there talks down to you. It is a very stressful work environment because instead of working to stock at night, they would have us stock while people would be coming and messing up hat you just did or are working on."
bad,They would have you do a job that should take three or more people but they refuse to hire the amount of people they need because they don't want to pay for their hours
bad,I cover the entire gm side of the store its fast pace. We are constantly moving and changing things. Your almost always learning something new. Some of the management is good but some aren't worth having.
bad,work was good but management was horrible . really didn't want to leave but could not let myself end up in the hospital . They truly did not know how to talk to their assiocates.
bad,"It’s an ok place, just not valued enough and they take advantage of you. It needs to pay better and more ensentives for workers and then maybe people might stay"
bad,I wouldn't recommend you work at Walmart. Its a poor paying job where you get yelled at by entitled jerks for reasons you don't fully understand. If you have an alternative you should take it instead.
bad,"Not a place to build a career, work just under full time hours so they don't have to pay any benefits.  Not understanding when it comes to family emergencies.  It's okay to work here while in college or something, but not for a career."
bad,"While working for this corporation i was semi satisfied with everything about this place but as you begin to work week after week you finally adapt to the work environment. You begin to realize that the assistant managers will try to utilize your position and take you for granted and they will try to convince you that your job could be in jeopardy if you fail to do them an unnecessary favor which they would call a task. Example : its 11:07 7 minutes after your shift ends and you have completed everything you have to do and your about to clock out then your assistant manager comes and abruptly commands you to bring a cart to a specific department for other employees that just started they're shift so they do have to do that. And if you refuse that assistant manager would threaten your job by addressing a 'Write up'. unkempt management. I was on GM receiving and stocked merchandise in grocery,Chemicals and paper"
bad,Department managers were great to work with. There were a few that are great mentors.I wish I could of worked with them more .Advancement was very slow.
bad,"This company values the customer over the employee.  while i agree the customer is always right that doesn't mean that you should slam your employee when you know that they are only doing their job.  As an automotive technician, we were often told that damages to the vehicles were our fault when the vehicles entered our shop in disrepair.  The management had no respect for our experience or skills."
bad,"Typical day consists of 10+ hour days, very few opportunities for advancement or transfer due to restructuring. Hardest part of the job is the lack of commitment from other associates. Mm ost enjoyable  part is working with customers."
bad,"they have you working in to many departments, the salary rate is too low. they want you to do everything while they are not doing enough. its very stressful."
bad,I use to love working for this employer but now I can tell they no longer care about the people that are working for them. They know that there is always someone willing to do the work and they are not loyal to people that have been there for them.
bad,"This Walmart in sanger Ca was unorganized, management was bad, pharmacist doing a technicians work.. intimiadating when you have cooperate trying to fix everything"
bad,"Walmart has very little interest in bettering their employees or the work environment. Customers were mostly nice, however Walmart does service the lowest common denominator so it would have the rudest customers I have ever serviced in any job."
bad,"Non a place to build skills, non a place to learn, non a place to get a permanent full time job, non benefits, irregular schedule and less hours, non respect for employees, non work culture, poor management."
bad,I use to like working there untill managers were just to  disrespectful towards employees and I just couldn't work with such attitude it was starting to feel depressing
bad,"Management was not very cooperative, Customer service needs to be at its best at all time. Need to know where things are at and be able to direct people in the right direction"
bad,Customer service calls and complaint calls with correspondence work. Temp to hire work for the holiday season. No paid holidays. Temp employees were usually let go within six months if they weren't hired full time.
bad,Did not like working at this place. Hours were always cut. Pay wasnt that great . Very stressful place to work.  You have to have a lot of patience working there.
bad,Must be polite to customers. Be able to multi task. Have positive attitude. Must be able to answer questions related to different products. Have good people skills.
bad,I enjoyed working at Walmart because I work by myself. the only down fall is you only had a certain amount of time to get the job done and there would be so much work.
bad,"The sales associate position can be stressful, and the compensation isn't too rewarding. Sometimes full time positions aren't available, and part-time shift, hours, vary."
bad,Walmart employees will always tell you Walmart isn't the job to be at all employees that work at Walmart are stressed and emotionally unstable the managers there are poor and seem as if they don't know what they're doing
bad,they had poor inclusive culture and were quick to throw people under the bus and play the blame game. they didnt follow HR rules and regulations and they used pharmacy time and space for personal time which reflected poorly on pharmacy practices
bad,It was a struggle for fair treatment.  You are beyond overworked and underpaid. No room for advancement like Walmart claims.  It was better run when Sam Walton was alive.
bad,The job itself wasn't bad but I didn't really enjoy the way management handled things as time went on there.  In the end I found it too stressful and decided to leave for a lesser paying job.  It's been several years since I left that job and I still refuse to shop with Walmart because of how irritated I get just stepping into one.
bad,"the beginning of my shift was the most enjoyable part of my job. I liked coming in to see how much work I had to get done and planning out how I was going to get it all done. I learned that no matter how much work there is, there is always a way to get things done. Management had a tendency to only only pick on certain people (never me.) I saw them pick favorites and give special treatment to those they picked as favorites. Even though I was one of the favorites I always expressed how I didn't think it was fair. The hardest part of the job was the end of the night was the end of the night when I was done processing merchandise off of the truck and had to go out to the sales floor to help stock. The worst part of this job was the tension between the different shifts. I though it was a little ridiculous that every shift played the blame game and did not get a long with each other."
bad,Horrible place to work as there is no management or supervision. Employees essential do what they want. No interest in company events. Lots were cancelled due to lack of interest. The job is fairly easy other than being physical but no one is accountable for their mistakes and trying to work with people who don't care is very frustrating. Don't work here unless you have to. The pay is good.
bad,"friendly environment, fast-paced, busy, hectic environment. learned how to work under pressure and work alone. diverse team and nice, new work location"
bad,"I had to report customers for kiddnapping within a few months of being a cashier. If you are easily upset or triggered, I would not recommend this job. I've also been threatened, yelled at, and belittled. All by customers, thankfully. We were also robbed while I worked there."
bad,"The management is unprofessional but the customers are very nice and polite. I felt harrassed and uncomfortable through management. Besides that, overall, it's an average working environment."
bad,There is no longer any room for advancement as a driver.  they taken away all local runs and you are now slip seating 99 0/0 of the fleet.  there is no longer a life to work ratio
bad,"it was fun you get to help people but if you worked dressing rooms then you were pretty much in one place for a long time. you learn how to do things the walmart way. The management was ok, while the workplace was interactive. for me the hardest part was always picking up after the customers. but the most enjoyable part of working there was the people that i worked with were fun and i enjoyed talking to them."
bad,My situation was unique. The store I was relocated to was in pretty rough shape and had been mismanaged. The hours required to work to get it back in order were 10-12 hour shifts. During the holidays there were also no days off for a 2 week stretch.
bad,"The company could have better work enviroment for their employee. The benefits could be a lot better as well. The pay should be raised, the employee can't live on that salary."
bad,either you were working 40+ hours a week or getting almost none. management were never on the same page so you would be told one thing and then get yelled at by another for doing what you were told.
bad,"Its Wal-mart, that's all there is to it. they will change your schedule last minute and not tell you, then write you up. the coworkers were great as was most of the lower management."
bad,Lost for word's manager were unfairly.to much put down .very ugly very ugly very ugly.make do work for 5 people and there one they had there favorite in this store you had watch your back
bad,"Informed the hiring manager of intent to start college in January, five months after starting job. One week into school and I was fired. They knew I was starting school this week and changed my schedule to make it impossible to do both. I chose school and was fired."
bad,"this place is nutz to work for, cut hours when your a loyal worker, to many managers have different ideas on how to do things. point system was good and benefits not bad."
bad,Often had 3 or 4 managers working but could never get one when you needed help for a customer. The culture was very tense and at times hostile.  Employees tried to do their best but many time were disciplined for needing a manager to help.
bad,"stressful work days"
bad,"Poor management, working long hours past scheduled. Amazing opportunity outside of working on the operations side of the business and good benefits. On the operational side of the company is not ideal. You work extremely long hours and the area to advance within the company is almost non existent."
bad,"Not really a place to work unless you work at the Home Office. Home office actually does all the ethical things that are needed to work in the environment as their stores are just looked at as rats, or that's how it seems."
bad,To many young kids in management  alot of tge management dont know how to talk to people the luch breaks are not long enough they need to give more money and if you say you are hiring someone full time make sure you give them full time hours
bad,Walmart was and alright place to work i didnt appreciate having to work every holiday when i worked there even though i had been there for 2 years and never had a holiday off. there was no job advancement which sucked because it takes along time to move up in their company.
bad,I worked at Walmart before I had kids. The hours were sporadic and only paid min wage. I was a cashier and while I enjoyed the interaction with customer overall the job was boring.
bad,"Walmart is a place were people get to a position of power and feel they don't have to help anyone below them again, its unfair to the other employees."
bad,need to work days.  its hard to switch to days. this is a great company to work for very good learning expects and easy work unloading trucks and picking orders
bad,Anytime we had a lot of trucks to unload and we got it done our job performance was good that night but come following the next day manager would say that we have to kick it up a notch like it wasn't good enough for them
bad,I loved my job at first til I realized nobody in that store cares. When I was in the hospital for 3 days over my heart they counted them against me. Lack of support...
bad,unless you're a high-school kid looking for a part-time gig don't waste your time. they pulled my chain for over a year making empty promises about advancing. terrible management terrible people
bad,"Working at walmart, you are subjected to bad management, low pay, unstable hours, you don't get a discount until you've worked for 3 months. For your first 6 months you are only granted 4 sick days, but really you get fired at 3. A friend of mine got fired because they were in the hospital with pnemonia."
bad,"J’ai été engagé au walmart à l’ouverture du supercentre et lorsque tout (présentoires,étagères, départements...) était en place ils ont coupés une vague d’enployés et j’en faisais partis."
bad,If you have good customer service skills it’s a great place to work they are very flexible with your hours and give a bunch of overtime during the holidays
bad,managers over worked no home life. need to offer more for employees. needs to pay more money. need new machines. better hours for the assoiates and mgt teams
bad,"wally world is a good stepping stone, but nothing more. Only cares about numbers and nothing more. No career advancements or future here. Save yourself and don't even start"
bad,Wal-Mart is all the time moving around and coming up with new rules for the associates to follow. It's a good company to work for I just wish it was a little better about letting me off when I need days off for school.
bad,I took the job in high school to have some spending money. It could be very scattered and I was often asked to do work well outside my area of expertise or experience.
bad,Wal mart has high expectations for their employees at times could seem impossible for people. The hardest job is trying to get a lot of stuff done and a short period of time
bad,"I started to work for walmart before minimum wage increased from $9.75 to $10.40. It was great I was working 7 to 8 hours per day, 20-30 hours a week for $9.75. Once I started to get $10.40 an hour I was only working 4 hours a day 12-15 hours per week. I started stressing because I barely had enough to pay for bills, gas and things I needed for my kids. I made more before my hourly wage increased."
bad,"It was very difficult to go to work every weekend. Every time I went working there, it was like being constantly disappointed in what was going on in the store."
bad,"Coming into work for me starts off as usual until one of my co workers call out or they are having some kind of issue that prevents them from doing what they need to do. So, I am the one who has stock, handle customers and/or complaints, handle associates and/or their complains, make sure everyone is where they are supposed to be; open the back door for the vendors; etc. It made an easy work night into a very stressful work night. The bad part about it is that none of the stress and headache is not neccessary."
bad,some of the people were nice and friendly and good to work with and there were others who were not they didn't like to work with you if you got sick or had a family emergy
bad,"The company is a good company, however promotions are not based on performance. There is a great culture and leadership foundation.  Wal-mart is a stable company with a good future."
bad,"I was thankful to have job, but the management was very bad and disrespectful to the associates. The wages should of been more for all of the mess you have to endure."
bad,"From working at Walmart, I can say there is no difference from high school and the managers always played favoritism and treated their workers poorly. They pay well, but not well enough for people to put up with such behavior."
bad,they are not very employee friendly.  They have policies in place for attendence but do not follow those policies equally for all employees.  poorly trained managment staff
bad,"Usually busy, handle many types of people everyday and it definitely builds up on the stress factor because you can get a wonderful person then next thing you know someone will be screaming in your face (though i think that's retail in general). You do learn how to handle all sorts of people, however, which is a good takeaway from the position and can move to different departments fairly easily. Management is constantly changing and you'll have at least 4 or 5 new assistant managers every year, a new store manager every other year, etc. "
bad,"Some nights were fair, and on others not so much"
bad,"Working here is definitely not a favorite. When I first started it was nice and fun, but now after only being here for 5/6 months it is not what I expected. Not terrible, but could be better. It could also very well be the location I work at."
bad,"In my experience, working at Walmart was stressful to say the least. The actual job isn't hard. I've worked all over the store, and nothing is too difficult. It's the people that make this job terrible. Management is unresponsive 90% of the time. If they like you enough, they'll help you here or there, but most of the time you have to ask and ask again. And again. And again before any issue is solved. Even basic duties (like finalizing schedules, etc.) that they are supposed to do without anyone asking don't get done until the last minute, or later. Everyone you work with only does the bare minimum of what's required. The store is extremely disorganized, employees steal other employee's work tools when they lose their own, departments go without required work tools, and of course the customers suck. I cannot stress enough how much the customers suck. The pay sucks. The people suck. Just do yourself a favor and work somewhere else."
bad,"Your experience depends on the type of management at your particular store. The managers I work with are always giving tasks to be done with an unrealistic time frame for it to be done in. They also say one thing and a week or two later change their minds making more work for the associates. Sometimes the changes come from home office, but it's mostly from the assistant managers & up. Training is an issue too. They kind of just throw you out there and you  teach yourself for the most part."
bad,It was okay got an hour lunch but had a total of nine hour shift to get that it was paid for mangers are reall busy you do get overworked need more workers never offer any overtime
bad,This was a very relaxed setting with very cooperative co-workers. I enjoyed the time I spent there and learned a lot about the behind the scenes in retail
bad,"There was almost no support when you as an associate needed help with something. They make you watch videos and then throw you into it. There was very little hands on training and they got mad when you would mess up, but wouldn't teach you the right way to do something."
bad,To anyone wanting to work here I'd tell them to run. I worked here 3 years and it was the worst 3 years. I was hired part time but would be worked full time hours and then asked to take long lunches so I wouldn't go over the required part time hours. Management does not appreciate you and there's no room for advancement.
bad,walmart was a good company to work for that has a tight team that works together to sove problems by proactivly using team thinking. the only thing i didnt like was the low pay and minimal raises.
bad,I am a cashier and was diagnosed with MS when I was losing feeling in hands arms and legs. Instead of letting me work on tills where I would use the arm that worked they forced me to take medical leave. There are no benefits for part time employees that work about 36 hours a week or even disability benefits. Fitness for work sheet that the doctor fills out is a farce and not designed for people with MS. The management has been horrible through this and has never contacted me about my return to work plans.
bad,"fair benefits, health insurance high, with high deductibles and horrible schedule always at the last minute without previous notice. The managers never prepare and go go go all the time."
bad,"Working at Walmart was a less than stellar experience, while the manager I was under was great, many of the other members of upper management were rude and generally looked down upon me and my coworkers. The work itself was high stress and difficult at first but you get used to it."
bad,"working in dept.s that arent mine regularly, and unloading receving trucks at both ends. management was terrible. they had no real experience in management."
bad,Terrible management. The main manager was never in and the bay inspector never did his job so everyone was kinda let loose and care free about the work
bad,"Not recommend. As a cashier, they treated me like dirt and shortened my hours after I called in sick once. Not a friendly work environment. Managers are self serving and rarely get off their phones like g enough to do their jobs."
bad,"Walmart was by far the worst place I have ever worked. The environment was terrible as were the managers and a majority of the staff. Most people wouldn't take a second to help you even if it was obvious you needed it. I was thrown into my position with the least training possible for me to understand it. Because of the massive foot traffic through the store and the extremely quick pace we were expected to maintain, my anxiety skyrocketed and I began to have chronic migraines. I would never recommend working for them, unless you have no mental health issues whatsoever."
bad,"Walmart started out as a decent company to work for-but has sunk over the years. The FT benefits are still 'okay' but that's about it."
bad,I have to say that I learned a lot working at Walmart. I began as an overnight stocker and I advanced to over the counter Pharmacy Department Manager within a 3 year period. It is a very big company but as long as you go to work and do your job you shouldn't have any problems.
bad,"don't be expecting great pay or great hours, they will constantly change and you will be expected to work weekends, nights, and all holidays. Walmart is a good first time job and move on after you found something better."
bad,Never would have thought it was so much to do.its a lot of heavy lifting.Daily cleaning out the old and putting out the new.Scanning and marking down items to help the customers get the best deals.Dated and inventory daily.
bad,"a typical day was mundane and repetitive."
bad,"A typical day of cashiering at Walmart was like any other day greet the customer, process the merchandise, talk to the customer, bag the items. and complete the transaction."
bad,"As with many Walmart locations across the country, the management was lacking in skill, the employees hated their jobs because most of them were there just to make ends meet, advancement is only available to those in the local store's cult of personality."
bad,"The Neighborhood Market expects you to learn pretty much every area of the store. While I quite successfully did that, I did not expect to do 3 to 4 job positions in one working day. I was working in Receiving (back of store), Cash Office (Front of Store), and Frozen/Dairy (all over salesfloor) 3 days a week and working just 2 of those jobs the other 3 days. (6 days a week without going overtime, because the store manager refused to hire a back up cash office person to help me)."
bad,empresa regular pouco reconhecimento aos colaboradores.
bad,"I actually liked working at WalMart for the most part. The people that I worked with were great. My immediate supervisor was awesome, but others above him were not in touch with the business."
bad,"Its a decent job, pays the bills. Management creates unneeded stress out of everything. You dont quite the job you quite management. Dont plan on ever have amount of needed resources to complete your job."
bad,When I first started it was very fast and productive; great team and management. After change of managers job went down hill fast; team members quit constantly (overnight)
bad,"Most associates and supervisors slack at work, resulting in unfair treatments across the board. Upper management is aware of the situations but is not willing to do anything to improve the workplace culture."
bad,My experience working for Walmart was good. The environment was comfortable and relaxed. Hours were great and flexible enough for me. Management was ok.
bad,"A typical day for most receivers consist of picking up merchandise off the conveyer belt scanning it and putting it on another belt so it can be shipped to the customer. It is sent to the packing department. Merchandise that can't be shipped out for varies reason are distributed to other departments to resolve the problem. Problems consist of damage merchandise, missing or wrong UPC numbers."
bad,"The bottom like it sucked working here. Management overworked the employees, the moral was low, and the pay wasn't very competitive. Also, management disciplined for petty things."
bad,I personally didn't like working there because they weren't flexible with my hours when I was in college. I could only work certain days and they didn't take that into consideration at all. I needed time to study and I tried to explain to them that I needed a little less hours because I was working 5 days a week and had no time to study. I do not recommend this job to any student in school.
bad,Management takes advantage of the power they have over hourly paid associates. Retaliations is big at this walmart in donna Tx. Policy information is difficult to come by at this store.
bad,"When I worked at Walmart, I was extremely stressed out. I was constantly harassed by upper management. On several occasions, I wanted to advance in my career and received no help or feedback."
bad,"Was a decent job when I started out switched a to a few different areas and was making decent money at the time. Was always a hard worker the managers would agree. I would say 9 out of 10 managers there were good when I started. But do to rotation and other places paying more for managers we lost most of our good ones. When I left I would say there was probably only 3 good managers. The main problem there that I can pinpoint is the daily change of rules or procedure, and when I say daily I mean daily, maybe weekly on some things."
bad,You will get a schedule. don't expect anything other than to work hard and go home. no advancement. favoritism. I loved the environment more than anything else.
bad,There were no benifits at Wal-Mart. I would have to ask for aditional hours to make a 40 hour work week. The days and hours I worked were not conducive to a home life.
bad,"It wasn't all bad, but it had enough bad for me to quit. The management is not as neat than I thought it was. Very low communication. The most difficult was the more credit card sales you made, the more favoritism you received."
bad,Wal Mart was not inclined to allow for a full time position. The shift and crew were enjoyable. Management left something to be desired in their execution styles.
bad,It's the typical retail outlet experience. Some managers were great while others weren't. Most of the other employees were friendly and I was lucky to not get too many unruly customers. An alright first job experience for a teenager.
bad,"Management needs to be better trained on how to schedule a large amount of staff/employees. Better workmanship needs to be put in place, how to run departments more efficiently. More pay, especially for those who have to work over time. Students do not have the option to receive benefits or part-time. Nor are they eligible for Overtime, despite being frequently asked to do so."
bad,"Not paid enough to live off of, no benefits, very few hours. The job was easy enough to do, but the expectations and stresses of the managers were unnecessary."
bad,"Wal-Mart is always busy. Somtimes I'd forget to take a break, Always on our feet, lifting up very heavy items. I had to balnce my register correctly atend of day. "
bad,"Managers are rude and the company dont care about there employees, was out on leave for about 3 months and never got anything except issues for the company"
bad,"Management as a whole were decent, some better than others. Typically I'd start my day out by cleaning up after the morning shift, claiming out the damaged product, then work the carts. After that I would grab the TC40 and scan the empty or low spots on the sales floor, then go to the back and scan bins looking for the product. I would then pull the necessary items off the shelf and date them and place them back on a cart. After working the cart you would discount anything that was about to expire. Anywhere between 5PM-10PM there would be at least one truck that would show up and I'd have to pull pallets to different coolers and freezers in the store."
bad,"A high percentage of Walmart customers have an entitlement mentality. Very difficult to reason with. Some were borderline violent. In dealing with these customers mgt did not have our backs. On the flip side some customers were very nice, but they the minority. That is all I want say about Walmart. I was very glad to get out of there."
bad,"empresa desgastante, pouco salário com vários descontos para muita mão de obra"
bad,a company that can show improvement but dont take the time out to improve what needs to be improve with the employees as well as the store environment for the employess
bad,i worked overnight in the backroom. it was stressfull and thankless work. everything  everdid was undone by someone on day crew. made it diffucult to remain enthusiastic about my work
bad,I did not like walmart because they do not treat there employees like there human and i would never recomend anyone to work there for them ever i did not enjoy that job at all
bad,"There were a lot of incidents that took place. Shootings nearby happened regularly a lot of theft, people would always call of (managers) and they werent very helpful"
bad,I loved what I did but I would never get considered for any management position. Even if I proved I was capable of doing it. I have always enjoyed retail.
bad,"It's the same things every day, but with the twist that management will find new ideas to try and slow down your productivity. The associates always take the heat from any management errors and the work expected is nowhere near the wage they offer. Overall if you need something bad it's doable, and if you can stand dealing with useless management and ""processes"" then it can get you somewhere if you pursue. However, I wouldn't make it near my top 10 options and would highly recommended it only as a fail safe backup plan."
bad,"a typical day at work"
bad,"different duties daily on the job auto mechanic, oil changes, fixed other issues with autos and did other duties as assigned. Typical work day was never the same."
bad,Wal-Mart's management was terrible. they didn't really care about there employees at all. the pay was decent but not worth it because management did not know how to treat employees.
bad,"Typical work day would take too long to write, just know you will be working 12+ hours a day regularly."
bad,"You work long hours with mostly bad pay, and you don't get overtime or holiday pay. You only get time off on a system of hours. You have to enough hours added up to even get one day of vacation."
bad,"There are definitely some good people. Except the odd snarky coworker. Especially during a afternoon rush, always be on guard for the long lines of people rushing in. Also that one angry coworker who tries to get literally everyone fired also wouldn't work around my college hours. everyone there thought they where better then you or they just wouldn't work at all there was no team atmosphere."
bad,They didn't properly make the schedules there were days where we were extremely busy and he would only have two people working that night. Allowed people to leave right away instead of finishing everything that needed to be done so orders weren't complete and people got angry. I don't think the management team was on top of everything like they should have been.
bad,Training is not long and low quality. Time they put on tasks to be accomplished is not realistic. A lot of people get fired. A lot of drama. Unprofessional environment. They don't care if your sick they just want you to clear your pallets in you assigned area. Work piles up in the backroom because they are not organized. You have a limit of call outs per year. Like a high school locker room. They work the people who work hard to death and let the people who do nothing continue to do nothing and slack off because they need the people. The pay is steady and you have a set schedule that is it.
bad,"I didn't like my experience being there, I was harassed,it got in the way of school, it wasn't the best. I worked as hard as I could with as little work experience I had. Another co worker informed me that some things were okay to do but come to find out they weren't."
bad,Poor management... lack of staff... unethical practices... stressful environment... low morale... favoritism... once was a great place to work with awesome benefits... unfair policies like the attendence policy has increased the turnover rate of employees...
bad,"Benefits and bonuses are difficult to understand and inconsistently paid. Managers are overbearing, over-controlling, and bad at communication. The workers are pushed too hard and given inconsistent orders that are hard to fulfill."
bad,They take hours away if you have to go to the hospital it's not fair to treat your workers poorly everyone should be treated fair while working 10 plus years for the company always make things a negitve never your working well
bad,"A typical day at work when i was working for walmart, the other associates were quite nice at least most of them but management on the other hand was very rude and talked to you more rudly than the customers would."
bad,I really liked my job. I worked hard enjoyed the job i was doing as well as helping customers. I loved it for a long time and then when i started feeling my body to ache and hurt more i needed to do days but they would not let me go to days and was offered another job that paid more then what i was being paid so i went to the better pay and slower paced job that i really got to enjoy.
bad,"all worker and not treated fairly the store itself was good to me but as for the managers and coworkers and not nice and know how to cheat the system , some people have to work so much harder then order just cause they slack off"
bad,"The work is fast pace, however hours and pay can be more than lacking at times. The hours that you work vary from day today. I personally have ended my shift at 12 A.M and had to return at 6 A.M"
bad,Terrible work experience management doesn’t ever seem to know what they are doing... don’t try to make plans because they will change your schedule at the last minute and than expect you to work it even though it was your day off
bad,Part-time is less than 30 hours. There times were they really cut hours because they can only give a certain amount to the entire store so they split it between all departments.
bad,Go in and meet with my salesperson and see what is going on that day and tell them we need this done today and make sure they get it done before they go home.
bad,Upper management at this job is the worst. They had favorites and showed favoritism. They did not communicate well with their employees. The employees in the pharmacy and the pharmacy manager was great.
bad,"Unfortunately due to poor management the Neighborhood Walmart that I worked for, for 1 month, ended up shutting down.  However besides poor management, they worked with my hours and it was easy to pick up shifts."
bad,"A typical day at work would be stressful and busy for me. I was moved to different positions because of lack of employees in other areas. I did more than i was being paid to do without any complications. I learned that even if you work really hard and do everything you are asked, it does not always mean that it is enough for management. Management does not always listen to an associate and does not always include themselves in the work. sometimes they just walk around all day talking to people. The hardest part of my job was having others keep up with me. Also asking for help was looked down upon. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers. I love to see a smile on their face when i can assist them with their needs."
bad,Walmart is basically a starter job. Its definitely not somewhere you want to retire. Walmart has a lot of management issues. Corporate needs to clean house and it would become a much better place to work.
bad,I started off at a new open store so it was very busy and too much at time and they started to move people due to no hours because store wasn't doing well. The other store i was located at was quite i like it because it closed at 12AM so it was easier to get work done
bad,A typical day of work was just me working the register. I learned how to tolerate rude customers and rude coworkers. The management was horrible and the hardest part of my job was having a smile remain on my face through the hard days. I honestly would not suggest this job to anyone.
bad,Working in big box retail is an acquired taste. You either learn to love it or grow to hate it. Several departments and positions would lead you to believe there’s lots of room to grow and move up but that isn’t always the case. Cross training in other departments isn’t utilized enough so when you apply for an open position in other departments you are on the same level as outside applicants because of “no experience” especially when it comes to management.
bad,"A typical day at Walmart is greeting customers, reshelfing items called shop back. I've learned how to check security cameras thanks to management, The hardest part of the having to walk thru the snow to get in"
bad,"Terrible upper management, second shift couldn't get their work done if they got paid for it which had severe negative ramifications on third shift yet nothing was ever done about it.  There was a girl who was rude flipped off the managers got into arguments every time she received directions and only worked there for three-five months, she was given a promotion over people who had been there for years."
bad,The workplace at Walmart is hectic for the most part. Their scheduling system was terrible as well which was the main reason I left. I got no hours and didn't know if I was going to be a cashier one day or push carts the next.
bad,"Not at this time ,was very intense opened the store brand new lost store manager was running new store new employees no manager new shift adjustment and was caotic."
bad,Once it was changed in i want to say 2007 to 2009 they under went a lot of changes that didn't help their employees. They started to be too competitive withe everything but the pay and advancing their long time employees.
bad,"Poor management bad scheduling, no benefits no paid vacation, Not a good place to work The management is trained to berate you. ......................"
bad,"I like most of the people that I worked with at Walmart. The only thing that I didn't like is that there's no permanent schedule, they kept changing it."
bad,"i am working like a manager, i mostly go all around and do everything specially when no supervisor is around but i get paid 11.50, unfair but a bit considerate when i need an urgent off"
bad,"It is Walmart. The only store that has it Spotlight on Youtube! What you see on the internet with all the craziness and the work there (or visa versa). You are glad you dont work that store, But you some are close."
bad,The store is mostly dirty needs better management and better security they also need better customer service if you gonna work at Walmart make sure you pick a good 1 good luck
bad,I enjoyed working there. Most of the people are friendly. You have peak times. They will work with your hours if need be. You have to be able to not miss any days during your probabtion period and if you need to I recommend calling someone and discussion the issue.
bad,"walmart is not a good place to work at, they are unfair, greedy, and do not care for there employees, my pay and other peoples pay was not good, they only cared about themselves and no one else"
bad,The management at Wal-Mart is backwards and unfair. They treat you however they want and there is no supervision over the managers. Not even the regional directors show interest of the lower end employees.
bad,It used to be a great place to work with a family based culture. Over the years it became corporate and no longer cared about it's associates just the profit of the business. All they want now are robots that have no thoughts or ideas of their own
bad,"What was once a great company, has been reduced to a corporate run fiasco. they do not utilize technology. They think in the past and present, but neglect the future. Sam's legacy is waning as the companies future is in question. Berkshire/Hathaway must know something, they sold off their stock options recently. Poor judgement, lack of vision and inadequate/inefficient management are but a few things that make Walmart an undesirable place to work. I only wish I could have worked in a Sam Walton era Wal-Mart. Selling American made products at a reasonable price."
bad,they had favorites that they picked and choose.it was hard to move up.it was hard getting enough hours to support myself.it was a lot of drama.it was hard to talk to management
bad,"My main concern for the Wal-Mart on 4th Street in Longview, TX is the disorganized staff. Supervisor commands to associates often collided with one another and priority was often based on which supervisor was the most assertive or aggressive."
bad,Wal Mart is a beginning  dead end job without the ability to promote unless you are willing to play the politics of the area.  The promotion and Hiring policies of the company are inconsistent company wide.  They will promote management with bad behavior rather than fire if they don't wish to be accused of racism.
bad,quick paced during some moments. very flexible hours and days. training before job placement. very beneficial. provides alot of benefits. great managment
bad,"At Walmart you do the same thing day in and day out. Its great for students who are in school.There is no challenge, you don't need to think while working there. If you are a new employee, you treating like the new kid and a lot of high school drama."
bad,"-Work like a robot"
bad,Ótimo ambiente de trabalho e bom atendimento entre colegas
bad,It needs more support of management when it comes down to helping. They need more employees (turnover rate is high) The ability to work without supplies is at its lowest
bad,Walmart is a company with great potential to advance and treat there employees with better pay. I think over the years they've forgotten what there niche is. They've focused so hard on profit that they've dismissed the team in which makes all the sales. Honesty is something I've never felt within the company over the 2-3 years of working there. Over all i think the company itself is a great stepping stone for other job opportunities.
bad,The management required me to do whatever was needed no matter how much work was needed.   I was completely responsible for what ever was required.   This was unfair.  How can anyone be required to do whatever is required?  No matter how much work is required.
bad,"A typical day for work consisted of having my manager oversee every little task I did. She would quite often request that I redo tasks, not because they were done properly but because she'd changed her mind on how a display should look"
bad,Favorites were played at the time I was there.Dishonest managers also played a roll in my leave. Workplace culture was a joke. The lack of respect given to you by a manger was also unfair.
bad,Great custmers service. Good with communicating with customers. Greeting. Redlining! Making sure you area is clean gift card. WIC vouchers! Ringing up groceries.
bad,"Poor management, policy and employee relations. Lack of thorough quality management and accountability. Start-up company with poor process management."
bad,did not care for employees and other situations good for maybe students to work at but not for working families in my opinion. Hours are just what is just needed for never really set hours
bad,"The store I work at is understaffed. No set schedules. The best and worst parts of the job are the customers. Also, the management seems to play favorites."
bad,A typical day can be stressful and cause people to be unhappy. I learned many different things. I learned how to gain more confidence in myself and not be as shy. I learned a lot about others.The managers there didn't seem to take control of some situations. the hardest part was the management and the easiest was the job.
bad,"If you work well, they'll give you enough to do that you fall behind. Management has the worst communication I've ever seen, no one ever knows what is going on in the store."
bad,constantly have to pick stock up from the floor and a lot of the managers are rude and do not care how they talk to you  the freight is always overstocked
bad,They are  so  short staffed .Not paid enough  .They don't take the time to  listen to their employees. To let them know what they can do to make it  a better  company to work for
bad,"easy at times but when were low on associates it can be a nightmare."
bad,When starting I loved this job but as time goes by you adjust. The meaning to adjust is that managers sometimes have picks and favorites of people that wont get in trouble for coming in late or calling in. They ask you to do things and sometimes you get in trouble for the things that you are doing when another manager tells you that your suppose to be doing something else than this.
bad,"I've worked retail my whole adult life so I understand the challenges and rewards of retail, but Walmart is it's own retail animal. I was given no training, and sent to the floor without even the basic knowledge of their Point of Sale system; but I was expected to check people out, use their technology to try and find prices and locations and expected to help customers. When I asked how to do something and receive more training I was treated like I was stupid. The management team didn't know the basics of locations and treated most employees like they're a nuisance.  I was constantly feeling like I was being set up to fail; They punish you for taking sick days, constantly schedule you for 8+ days in a row even though company policy is that you're not allowed to work more than 6 in a row. This company sucked the life out of me and I would not recommend it to anyone."
bad,Very structured and focused on sales as opposed to customer experience. Staff are treated disrespectfully and are kept part time to avoid paying for benefits.
bad,management sucks!!! they don't care they are all for themselves. you get in trouble for satisfying your customers. they hold things over your head if you tell on them. they are snakes. no cares about you maybe only a few they care but 85% don't. ive worked there 3 almost 3 1/2 years and no management member has said thank you more than 10 times.
bad,"Do not work here. Positions are only categorized as ""part time"" no matter how long you work.It also doesn't matter what department you work in. I worked at the same store for about 11 years...I did an AVERAGE of 37-39 hours every single week and was intentionally categorized as ""part time"" to limit my benefits. The only people who are ""full time"" are department heads and MANAGERS. Everyone I worked with was consistently poor, stressed out, and sick. Almost every person I worked with was on food stamps or some sort of public assistance including low level managers! Expect little to no mercy if you are injured or sick. If you don't come to work they will FIRE YOU. I have covered shifts for people so they could go to funerals, tend to sick children, or take care of themselves. I have worked with people who have had major broken bones (hands, arms), people who were recently hit by cars (think like going back to work in the same week for fear of being out) those with major illnesses. (An older woman I worked with had a heart attack or a stroke and was back at work in about a week) If you work here you will miss your family. To get ""hours"" you need to have an almost unending availability. For about 9 years I was available every night, every weekend and every holiday. The only time of year I got to spend with my family was Christmas Day (they are closed one day a year). "
bad,some tension working there.  Moral is not always what it should be but there is always plenty of work to do.  Management of held accountable for workers work ethic when handed down from the upper management teams
bad,"Management picks favorites and continually discriminates against gender identity or anyone that differs from the norm. There is no way to move up with company and they do not work around college schedules. If you are not able to live and breathe Walmart, you will not go anywhere there"
bad,"Other than the usual expectations of employees, you are also expected to go above and beyond for little more than minimal wage.  As a Pharmacy Tech you not only have to abide by federal guidelines but also work within WalMart expectations.  Most of management bends the rules to help themselves look good.  the integrity amongst employees and management is nearly non-existant"
bad,Always got in trouble for going to the bathroom. Always had my lines low and learned quickly. fast paced but my manager hated me so always made my shifts bad
bad,"Cashed out customer purchases, stocked shelves, cut meat and cleaned deli. Enjoyed customers and associates. Management was good people just WM was really hard on them."
bad,"I did have  lots of help in learning and training all  new employee."
bad,"By far one of the most despicable places i have worked in my life."
bad,You get paid well and receive good benefits but I honestly don't know if it's worth it. During a 12 hour shift I only get two breaks; a 20 and 25 minute. 5 minutes of the time is spent walking to the break room. Management is unorganized. They expect you to get 100 percent with no work and they don't allow you to move to find work. Trainers refuse to train employees on anything new.
bad,Most of the staff was friendly but most of the managers and supervisors only seemed friendly on the surface I would not recommend it because of the policy on days taken off count against you even if you call in.
bad,"Kept busy doing odd jobs here and there"
bad,I was so miserable and uncomfortable here they didn't wannaa give breaks or help you when needed I was made fu of and just felt so down and upset when I worked there
bad,It was ok working there I loved the customers and I loved my co-workers but I didnt really like my manager so I hated going to work some days so I would just sometimes call in
bad,Walmart was a really good starter job when I was in high school but after I graduated they would not move me to full time hours. When I left I was cross trained in pretty much every department and they wouldn't give me a pay raise or more hours.
bad,Doesn't follow most of their company rules. Unfair to the workers they are timed on how fast they work on the night shift but everything is not set up to meet the required time. Not enough employees for every department.
bad,"Not the best place to work but good for a temporary job in a pinch. Days are long and hours are limited to 38 weekly, usually. Not a difficult job but not enjoyable."
bad,i didnt like my job at walmart the whole store needs to shut down everybody is rude.. managers supervisor lead peope everybody.. they had no consideration for nobody kids they didnt care at all
bad,Helping customer on cash register and helping customers  on sales floor. Greet customer and helping them finding what the need in store. Doing store inventory and remodeling floor set. Keep the cashier register area cleanand neat. Putting back merchandise and other items.
bad,"Not family or disability friendly.( I can only speak of the store I worked in) Time off including vacation depended on how many hours you worked each week. If hours are cut you lose the ability to gain vacation hours. Accumulated sick time from long term employees could only be used tp take care of family, but doctor's notes where not accepted."
bad,"Stocking product in assigned department, between 2-5 tons a day in 10-50 lb. packages. This is a job that will keep you physically fit as long as it's done correctly."
bad,"I believe that cahiers are the heart of the company. They are treated as if they are at the bottom of the can. Cashires go through a massive amount of stress throughout the day. They get some disrespectful customers, try and maintain their lane while being rushed by a line of customers that have full baskets of items."
bad,"I totally enjoy interacting with customers and my co workers. This is a fast pace job especially during Holidays. Hardest part is the more you do the more is expected. I don't mind working hard just want to focus on the important aspects first, the customer. We are rushed to the point that sometimes we fail our customers."
bad,"A typical day at walmart was check the products in the morning, put away product that was delivered that day, restock the shelves, date the meats. help with the customers, hardest part of the job was getting all the work done in the allotted timeframe."
bad,The work was enough to keep everyone buys although the majority of the time the managers were no where to be found and no one was quite sure what they should be doing. If it was managed more precisely and people were rewarded for their hard work it would be a fantastic job.
bad,"Low pay, minimum chance of growth. Breaks were short. The lawn and garden department was required to do too much for one person such as water hundreds of plants inside and out along with stocking all of the shelves."
bad,"poor management style, did learn how to interact well with people, I learned that you must stick up yourself as far as work life balance, the associates kind of ban together and show unity"
bad,"again management is poor there was no communication , I once got into trouble because one manager didn't tell another manager what was going on and that I was to leave early because of my time , well I tried to leave and me and the manager got into to"
bad,Walmart is a very stressful place to work and management is poor and you don't get enough help. The store I worked was not run prioperly and they always had to many different managers.
bad,"my previous work here in this company was not good(as i can say)."
bad,The hours wernt consistant and they don't take care of or care about their employees. they will change your hours the night before and not tell you and if you miss you get a point taken away the manager was a stalker and they put unmeet able expectations on you
bad,"Retail job that you have to work every weekend and holiday. Closing shifts require staying hours after closing. Customer service, stocking shelves, and running a cash register"
bad,Fun place to work. Met a lot of people. Working with customers was always great. Terrible pay for the work load. Management wasn't always freindly or helpful
bad,"It was a stressful job with coworkers that tried to hide when they were in the smokeshop so they could talk and other cashiers would be swarmed by customers. I had been fired over being stressed out over finals and trying to cut out caffeine, causing my hands to shake badly and customers to complain about my hands shaking."
bad,work day unloading trucks and stocking and down stacking the trucks what i learned was to unload trucks and to use a electric pallet jack and a walkie stacker managent sucked and was rude calture was good hardest parts of the job was dealing with the rude management and the best part was working with friends who make things better and cheer you up
bad,not a fun place to work for most people.  the morale is extremely low for most associates which in turn makes mostly everyone miserable working there.   i feel that if they did something to build the morale of the assoicates they would have a much happier work place.  the bad feelings and complaints seem to bring down the whole store where as if people were happier and didnt complain and hate and complain so much about each other people would be happier.
bad,It was an experience because I noticed so much working there at Walmart they treat there customers portly and there employees even worse and the managers are only worried about there selves and there bonus instead of the needs of there coworkers
bad,Walmart very cut throat and extremely task driven. If tasks arent completed consequences are made. Management does not care about associates and that is why i left
bad,"Wal-Mart 1814 is a very busy store, the second busiest in it's market. Doing almost 80m a year in sales, the store moves a lot of merchandise and needs a lot of people. The store, in the three years I worked there, has never been fully staffed on any shift, and the turnover rates for new employees are massive. Upper management seems only to motivated by their bonuses, and their lack of ability or desire to hire is indicative of this. The hardest part of the job is consistently having to do the work of not only what is expected of you, but of all the other people that are not there, skipped work, or won't work. The best part of the job is interaction with customers, they're a load off from the barking of management, unrealistic expectations, and poor pay. Wal-Mart no long offers merit-based pay raises. Only 18 cents every quarter."
bad,"Would not recommend working for Walmart, they don't pay well and they ask for way more than any normal person could give. It's ok if you're single and don't have any bills."
bad,"Work schedule is 4AM - 2PM or 12PM - 10PM, weekends included,"
bad,"Probably the easiest job in the world. The hardest part is dealing with incompetent co-workers and management. Some members of management are super helpful while others sit in the office playing candy crush and only pay attention to the employees that suck up to them. But the pay is better than most places and if you get made full-time you are able to receive benefits. If you do become full-time though be prepared for management to act like they did you the biggest favor ever. When in all honesty you'll probably be working the same amount of hours you always did because the turnover rate is ridiculous. And be super wary of being ""cross-trained"" to do anything above your pay grade. If they really want you in the position they'll pay you for it."
bad,"Lack of communication between the managers. Stocking products isnt that bad, But as long as its in the correct spot. The hardest part was trying to get one thing done while another person said to do something else. told i would get a raise after completing training and that was not true"
bad,I loved Wal-Mart's pay as an assistant but as a new comer to the company I could not learn the equipment within the 30 days they expected one to have learned them in.
bad,You get 40 hours a week and decent benefits but if you want to get promoted or move departments they mess you around and basically you have to be a suck up to get anywhere. You get held to time constraints that aren't achievable and are punished for not meeting them. Management will throw you under the bus like no one's business to make themselves look good.
bad,Not a good place to work if you want long term employment. No more vacation/sick leave.  You can't make a living wage if they only allow you to work 8-12 hours per week...No one gets more than 20 or so hours per week.
bad,"If you go into any Walmart, the staff never give you eye contact, speak to you, look happy, or have good attitudes. When I was working there, I had some fun co workers. I always made sure that I wasn't ""that"" employee that had a bad attitude. I loved helping people and made sure I smiled to the customers all the time. It is a very stressful atmosphere, where the management were concerned with silly things instead of looking at the big picture."
bad,It was a customer service job and I was given employee of the month in the first few months I was there...............................................
bad,Poor engagement lack of care and concerns of associates needs. As Management if you don't care about your associates situations how do you expect them to work happily.
bad,"Hardest part of the job is dealing with management and their egos in micromanaging people. However, there's a lot of flexibility and plenty of opportunity to get things done if you have a plan and aren't interrupted."
bad,the company is great and the pay and vacation hours and are  benefits are awesome. but head management was horrible she would be little everyone. now she is gone moral is higher and the company is doing better. would love to go back
bad,"Work hours changed every week, employees all unhappy with the way things were run. Was told to come in at 4:00 a.m. and reclassified as day shift so they could cut my pay."
bad,"work hard for nothing, pay every 2 weeks. management sucks. would not tell any one to work @ Walmart. if you work there sorry that you waste your time"
bad,Great place to meet people and build relationship. really enjoyed my fellow cashier and floor staff. I received lots of compliments from customers for my smile and pleasant personality.
bad,"2-3 call outs"
bad,"The work itself isn't bad the main issues were the schedule, managers , and there being no benefits. Starting with the schedule the managers wanted you to have it opened at all times which sucked if you went to school or just couldn't work on specific days. Onto the managers now , at the Walmart I worked at about half of the managers didn't know what they were doing or just didn't even care. They were lazy and usually talked down to or behind the regular employees back. For the benefits there are none but some small discount which I guess is decent."
bad,"I did not enjoy my experience working at the supercenter ,  I would rather not bash or down play with any negativity,  however the main reasons was the disorganization of certain hr and management that would not take responsibility of such actions and it would fall on other employees."
bad,"Although Walmart is an equal opportunity employer, the pay and management take away from the positive experience in working. There is very minimal direction at the beginning of each work shift. Work from prior shifts is never completed."
bad,"precisa muito de melhorias.falta diálogo,falta profissionalismo de quem tem que dar exemplo."
bad,"It was a challenge working for Walmart! I found management to lack direction, time management and fair work loads to employees. It was rough when you were sweating bullets, while other employees stood around talking. Not to mention getting cross trained on the floor and register was a disaster to proper time management."
bad,"Great teamwork in the Deli.  The workers and customers were friendly.  Management would help out when we were desperate for an extra pair of hands, however it seemed we were always shorthanded at our busiest times.  The hardest part of the job was trying to do the job without the help and equipment necessary to do the work."
bad,"a very quick paced job, a lot of employees but not enough people working on the floor, could use some improvements, both as employer and as a company, being an employee there wasn't much help, you were only important if you were good, the minute you couldn't be or weren't its almost as if you are shunned. As a customer there needs to be more available employees for both the floor and the rebgisters."
bad,"The work was simple and straightforward with a reasonable learning curve. I enjoyed the job, however it seemed that management is not as on point with harassment issues as they could be, which resulted in my quitting the job."
bad,"Walmart was one of the worst jobs that I have been employed with. I started right outside of high school as a cashier, and the amount of pressure management puts on you is astonishing. Many of the customers were regulars, however, management still made everyone ask customers to open credit cards even though they didn't want them."
bad,The management does not care about the employees at all. you are just a number to everyone there. I did my job and i did it well and one day i wasn't feeling great and i did not work as hard and they chewed me a new one. i tried to move up and the ended up giving it to someone that had quit for six months and came back.
bad,"Too cooperate based.  Fairly easy job, Felt as though the company cared more about profits than people.  Training could be improved upon.  Horrible at Christmas"
bad,poor management too many people telling you what to do All work order never get done because you are constantly being told by more than one person to do something while you are doing a job.
bad,I like that the employees of Wal-Mart franchise are able to get one hour breaks. They have a few benches outside if you want to go out and enjoy the beautiful weather
bad,poca comprension y faltas de respeto por la gerencia
bad,There was no means for advancement.  The managers didn't care for their employees.  I was sexually assaulted by a member of the management team and they did nothing about it.
bad,not a great working experience but depends on the management. a lot of great people there and a lot of people I would never give my time to. way too much favoritism and buddies looking after each other.
bad,"I didn't work salesfloor much, but when I did, I was talked down to by customers like you wouldn't believe. And make sure you aren't seen doing nothing for 1 second, or you will be dragged to another department that you haven't been trained in, wasn't hired to work, and would be completely useless in. With that said, it seemed like no employee wanted to be there, so everyone got along pretty nicely (except for a few, but not everyone can be perfect). This job is good if you just need to get some retail experience, but that's it."
bad,"When I first started the management and overall work environment was good, however after awhile the management really went downhill. I quit and moved jobs to vivint Smart Home and after doing so they gave me bad reviews and references where my manager who I had worked closely with most of the time I was working there, until he left in march of 2017 would only have positive things to say."
bad,"the customers basically run the show. policies are put into place but if a customer throws a fit then management will give them their way. pretty easy work, only bad thing is dealing with attitudes."
bad,Walmart was a okay place to work. Working at this place were ok. And i would recommended this place to people to work. My managers were not so great but the place was a good place to work.
bad,They did not care if you had enough hours to pay bills. Kept changing policy per managers any given day. Did not have enough tools or up to date tools and parts. The best part of the was going home!
bad,Management expected floors to be done without adequate help from other employees.  They utilized employees who were employed for a specific job to do other things unrelated to what they were hired to do.
bad,"Working for Wal-Mart, there is no hiding the fact that you are replaceable.  You're treated poorly and the benefits suck.  You get a discount card for 10% off purchases, but you don't make enough to really buy anything in any non-management position.  The people aren't bad, but it's hard to motivate the employees, because they aren't making enough money.  Most aren't that worried about being fired."
bad,"the management there was very bad, they put all the work on the csms in the front of the store. they wrote you up for other associates jobs because you were the front end super. the pay was good, they made sure you got some kind of raise."
bad,The supervisors were not always in place when you needed them to  be. My schedule was constantly inconsistent. The distance for me to travel was at least an hour away. Sometimes if I was being reprimanded my supervisors would do so in the open. That was unprofessional.
bad,"I am single & 15-16 hours a week does not pay my bills. There are to many managers & each one wants you to do something, to confusing & very frustrating."
bad,"Walmart really doesn't care that people have lives and families, they expect you to have no unexpected event and to get time off for some things you have to jump through hoops. Everyone is constantly depressed and the culture seems to focus on complaining about the company."
bad,"You cant expect top of the line career from walmart, the employees were always trying to find ways to get you in trouble and management would never talk to them about it. the hours were okay but the pay and benefits were not,"
bad,"In order to have a good working environment. You need good management team, everyone needs to be on the same page. We as a people need to change ourselfs before we can change the world."
bad,"Each day at work I had to ring up the customers and provide quick and friendly service to them. I also had to work in the Pick-Up desk for customers who ordered merchandise online or did Layaway. I also had to put away returns at the customer service desk, as well as putting them back on the shelves personally. My managers used to always make me put away the Impulse items (returns) because it's the most difficult to put away on shelves since the items are mostly on clip strips and can be hung anywhere throughout the department store."
bad,Could have loved the job but to many test i spent more timing taking test than actually learning my job. Also i did not like some of the customer interaction i saw from managment and other employees.
bad,"If Target didn't have the slogan ""expect more pay less"" Walmart would fit that perfect with how they treat their employees."
bad,"My first day, people were complaining terribly about this place. Disrespectful to customers and each other. Managers were mean and demanding! Expected to do things beyond your body capacity."
bad,unload trucks. Stage the merchandise and take it to its rightful department. Stock the shelves. Whatever wasn't finish we'll take back to the warehouse. management was nice and caring. the workplace culture was warm and inviting. the job wasn't hard and the people were  enjoyable.
bad,Stocking shelves and maintaining inventory. Working inconsistent shifts and always on the weekends. Multiple managers that never seemed to be on the same page as their employees or each other.
bad,"This is by far the worst job I have ever had. They don't accept doctor's notes. Management was rude more often than not, and they didn't seem to care."
bad,busy and short staff sometime . good place to work other than that . staff are nice to work with. need more staff and a better plan for training new hires. Need more advancement and other opportunities for pharmacy technicians.
bad,When I first started it was fun and very fast paced but after awhile it became draining. It became me having to force myself to get out of bed and dressed for work.
bad,"Never a consistent work order, always working in different areas than where you were scheduled, low pay, employees were REQUIRED to zone shelves at a certain time every day"
bad,Ok place to work but the management and pay needs help bad.i love my hours there  and the co workers are good.a lot of work to be do and I dont mind becouse I love to work but we need to get paid for the work we do there.
bad,"The work enviroment was so stressful it was toxic. The number of times I or a co-worker would get in trouble for something we did not do was sickening. There are a couple of associates in particular I had made friends with, they costantly applied for open management positions and were more than qualified having worked in the store for years. Yet even though they were best suited, the one even has several degrees, the promotions were always given to people who either didn't know the area or had been trained by them. I find it ridiculous how many people have told me if they did not need a job they would leave and I can not blame them. Afterall I would be furious if people I trained we constantly being put over me while certain managers just seem to get a sick kick out of writing myself and other good employees up for faulty reasoning. I had to go to overnights just to have semi decent hours."
bad,Walmart was a good place to work however I live in a faraway town from it. I enjoyed learning the new things that are always coming to the floor. In the summer I enjoyed working in the parking.
bad,I feel like they stay underataffed and your underpaid for the work you do. Pay increases are terrible. Your just there to make someone else richer and not get any credit for it.
bad,It was very unfair as far as the managers and who they liked and didnt like. I liked my dept manager but not the overall manager. The customers and other associates was a blast to work with and help.
bad,il ne mette pas leffort sur les anciens il aiment mieux engager de nouveau au lieu de combler les gens
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of giving 110% and having my co-workers stand around being cheerleaders and telling how great a job I was doing while they stood around and waited for me to pick of their slack. I learned that while it's good to do your best, your work ethic and initiative can easily be exploited. The management in my opinion was less than mediocre. The work place culture was essentially people barely skating by on their tasks until someone else decided to take care of it. The hardest part of the job was even after completing all desired tasks to the best of my ability, the feedback I received expressed the notion my work wasn't good enough. The most enjoyable part of was knowing that at the end of the day, i knew I had put in a hard day's work for an honest dollar."
bad,"I used to love my job, but now management doesn't care about the associates. They will find any reason to fire you if they don't like you. The open door policy is a joke. No one higher up cares and you just get a run around if you try to get something fixed."
bad,"poor management, poor benefits, no holidays paid, scheduled to work 90% Saturday and Sunday. lack of equipment to perform assigned tasks.best part of day is leaving Walmart."
bad,the CSM bullied me to the point I would shake with anxiety. she's a grown woman who started a rumor that I lied to her DO NOT RECOMMEND stay far away!
bad,"Working for this company is not family friendly or student friendly, plays favorites, no job security, not enough manpower to keep a team going in departments with expectations that are unrealistic, stressful, high turning rating, and poor management that is very disrespectful to the associates that are not favored."
bad,"if you dont mind slaving and killing your back ringing out customers and groceries then its ok, but not the job for me. rude customers, no night staff"
bad,"The best part of working at walmart, is most of the other employees. Most of the customers are nice and don't go out of their way to give you a hard time but of course there are the few. Advancing is difficult if you do not fit into the tiny mold that is required of you to move forward, and you are asked to jeopardize personal time that is important to you, if you do not, you can not advance. They do not value personal family values. Only that of the ""walmart family"" Great place to work if you want to bleed blue and gold"
bad,I liked the work itself but did not like the fact that I handled hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash everyday and they did not compensate for that.  I got paid the same amount as someone working in the deli.  Just wasn't worth it.
bad,Although my job is to interact and help customers I rarely get the chance to because Walmart is short staffed and I tend to find myself doing another Job.
bad,"Was an ok place to work. I did not like that I couldn't have a consistent schedule. Had to work days, nights, and weekends no matter what. And holiday hours all the time also."
bad,I believe they need a better management team. The upper manager really doesn't solve problems like they're suppose too. You can go to management about an associate and if the associate you went to them about they have a friendship they doesn't take the correct route on handling the situation.
bad,I have been with Walmart for 9 years and recieving 26 cent raise a year is wrong when I go above and beyond my expectation every day. I have seen and experience poor management role and no respect for individual.
bad,"Walmart was a decent job. It is a great job to build your customer service, But it was not the Job for me. I had great co-workers not a dramatic place it was good job."
bad,"Walmart used to be a good company when I started 1994."
bad,I Think alot of the mangement need more training because some management comes to work all stress out and take it out on the employee.That is the reason i left because i would not admit to something that i did not do
bad,"Don't work at walmart, they will mess you over any chance they get and won't feel bad about it................It's a bad company with bad benefits. lsdjflkdsjg"
bad,"helped customers that needed help finding things they needed."
bad,I was responsible for unloaded the truck and stocking the shelf with the merchandise an the alose proving customer service  an then u also hav to be a flixable worker so you can help out in other area
bad,"Would not recommend Walmart for employment. Employees are disrespected and talked down to. To be treated fairly depends on whether management likes you or not, plus,.they do not treat all their employees equally, nor treat all employees with respect. Training is minimum with expected adaptation quickly in undesirable conditions. Management disrespects and mistreat their employees, such as, changing job duties at the last moment in which employees are unprepared to excel in inappropriate and horrible conditions and environment, example: at a last moment notice, demand to work in the freezer department while only wearing a short sleeve shirt and pants. I would never recommend working for Walmart; it would definitely be one of the last places on earth to work for."
bad,I worked seasonal it would have been better to of had other co workers to work with rather than to be just thrown out to work by yourself before you where able to complete everything.
bad,"Hires everyone and people's go there because of it but, you don't get paid enough. Raises are a joke and you better not make any manager upset or you will not get anywhere."
bad,"Advancement opportunities, great at developing skills, great place to learn a skill and grow your resume, or grow with the company."
bad,"I think it is a great place to get experience for a management job however it is very cut throat. They expect too many hours for managers and force you to do ""volunteer work"" and if you are unable to help it is looked at on your eval. There are many things that need to be changed with the company or GM"
bad,"The pay is great but for a company that preaches family in all their advertising, they'll penalize you for just about everything except being at work."
bad,"my typical day at work started off at 6 pm-7:30 am and it wasn't to bad cause most of the people are nice there just depends on what manager you had that night. but i would clock in go to the back grab my daily tools looked at the department i was working in tonight grab the supplies and go to the floor doing my own thing putting product on the shelf. When i switched to day shift it was basically the same thing just with a lot more people around you so, you have to be cautious around the shoppers in the market, and i always gave the customers help take them to the item that they need and got back right to work after that."
bad,"Walmart isn't the best company to work for, but they aren't the worst either. They offer basic jobs that have basic pay, but career advancement is easy to achieve. I only wish management would have the same work ethic they expect their employees to have."
bad,"I enjoyed how fast pace it was but the manager was not as understanding as he made himself out to be. I was and still am a college student so certain days i needed to come in at other times but he was constantly scheduling me at the wrong time on those days, and if i called in i would lose my job so i had to quit school. I learned find something around my schedule with school and communicate with management more often."
bad,If you have shopped her you know this company absolutely sucks. Working here is no different. Managers don't back you up &are all about bottom dollar.
bad,This was an interesting job because you get to meet a lot of different kinds of people. Some days the kind words you share with them that day was the only one they get. Plus the work was very easy.
bad,Some of the managers there can be very rude and disrespectful needs allot of work in that aspect but other than that the job isn't all that bad they do have allot of good benefits.
bad,"Unsatisfied with pay, long periods without a break or no break except lunch, and lack of recognition. Before we were released for lunch, often times we were pulled to go to another department to finish work there too. If our efforts were unsatisfactory, disciplinary action followed to each employee. Action, regardless of if one worker slacked off while the others tried to pick up the pace. Unfair conditions."
bad,"I worked for the company three different times at different locations I managed jewelry Dept. , did cashiering, worked in the housewares Dept., and auto Dept.. the last time working for them management was poor, they lied to me about family leave options when I had a family medical emergency."
bad,"My days at Walmart were long but short at the same time. The days for 4 hour shifts that felt like 10 hour shifts. We were constantly dead and they had me folding clothes the whole time. They didn't want to train me in any other position besides apparel. The management wasn't so good. Only showed up when they wanted to, didn't help with scheduling when we needed help."
bad,I cannot speak for other locations but the management here is pretty bad. I just do not see myself making this job a career i need something better...
bad,when i started at walmart it was a nice place to work but as longer as i stayed it got worst worst worst n so i had to hurry up leave and i would never go back to being a cashier over there
bad,"They really don't like to make employees full-time. The hours were terrible. I may have worked 4-6 hour days the majority of the time, and very rarely worked a full 8 hour day. They are awful at making sure you get your breaks and would rather let you leave early instead of paying overtime."
bad,handling products away taking care of care of customers needs. Dealing with heavy products. Working with some crazy people with customers and workers...dealing with products every day
bad,"In a typical day you may have to be responsible for doing your job along with several other jobs. I have learned how to make orders, do recalls, how to run several departments, and  Organize  My priorities from what needs to be done as well as what can what. Management was not the best and  Really encouraged or help create leads."
bad,"decent place depending on who you are, aside from that there's much better. Lack of working with associate's with there life schedule. They constantly promise that they'll move you up but chances are you'll be waiting a long time."
bad,Didn't get to work a full time shifts. They schedule u all different hours. And it is alot of standing with this company. It's a ok job but doesn't pay as much
bad,"Very fast paced job. Make sure you do not slack off or you will indeed fall behind. Overall its not too difficult, but if you can't handle the overnight pressure it can be very draining."
bad,This is a okay place to work if you get friendly with the right people and kiss butt. I have been here 3 years and it has been okay up until now. I am 14 weeks pregnant and they are treating me horrible
bad,working at wal mart can be great if you're a night person. The hardest part of the job was getting through the night from 10-7. Must be motivated and have a drive to work.
bad,"Go in 15 minutes before to get everything ready for my shift, clock in go out to the floor and get on a register, insure that i talk to every customer within 5 feet. I would also greet doors and do returns."
bad,"Woring at Walmart is only for people in the age range of 15 to 23. I don't feel that working at Walmart and being over the age of 25, or being fresh out of college is the best decision."
bad,"it was  a good learning opportunity, the only issue that I had was the management had poor communication skill and he thought it was ok for him to chat with u any way he wanted too"
bad,"Walmart does not respect their employees thus the employees don't respect their position.  Management is hired on a ""I Like You"" basis and not their talents and skills.  I worked for Walmart for 10 months and did not enjoy a minute as far as being respected from my supervisors. I enjoyed the customer relationship immensely."
bad,"Loved my job, but Walmart does not treat its employees very well. It isn't about the well being of their employees. Although I would have stayed had it not been for relocation, I wouldn't go back."
bad,"I learned how to process money transfers."
bad,"Walmart sucks. They advertise that they care about employees and  give wage increases. That's fine if you can live on $9 an hour. "
bad,"Walmart is so confused with its overnight team. they steady put you in different departments each night when you haven""t gotten to know the first department you were in. And you hear they mouth if you don'T FINISH. BLAH BLAH........................................................................................................................................"
bad,"It will pay the bills but I hated working there. And towards the end, they didn't want to work with my school hours, and school has always come first for me."
bad,"Company claims to be family first, but is not always true.  I learned stress management as management is too inconsistent in how things are done.  Your department managers change every 30-60 days and so the way you perform your job also changes.  I enjoyed working with the other sales associates they are hard working and dedicated to providing for their families no matter what it takes."
bad,Very fast enviroment managment is hard core you do not get very many paid time off days and maternity leave is a joke you do not get the days that you need to be out
bad,"For full time you have at least one week end long hours of operation eg open from 7am and close at 11pm."
bad,It was/is what it was/is.  A typical retail environment with their own way of doing things.  It's not a high end customer service retail environment.  But most employees try to be helpful if you can find one.
bad,Fast paced and busy. I enjoyed talking to customers while ringing up their products. Learned to take things in stride. Only hard part of the job was communicating with difficult customers and be able to listen and make them as happy as I could.
bad,"If you are a hard working employee, do not apply. The management does not appreciate hard and honest workers. You are just a number. The more you give the more they want and no compensation is given. As an example if you can only work part time in the evening, which they will give you at first, then they will force you to open your availability to 24 hrs/7 days a week. If you cannot accommodate them, they will give you hardly any hours. They want a revolving work force so they don't have to offer benefits of any kind. It's all about the bottom line. It wasn't always like this, but with in the last 9-10 months things have gotten horrible. I'm not sure if Walmart corp knows what 's going here, but if they do, I'm angry that they are letting this happen to this store, which was once a great place to work."
bad,I didnt not agree with the preferential treatment of members of the cashiering team who were more friendly with the management member. I was never scheduled for more the 4 hours in day.
bad,"Working at Walmart is definitely exhausting, customers are often rude and expect you to be at their feet when called. The hours you get depends on how many new employees are hired because the new employees get more hours in the beginning. It's a total nightmare and i thought Dd's Discounts was a hassle. P.S you have to take an hour lunch break which i think is strange when its usually thirty minutes but its required."
bad,It's very stressful. Management make it very difficult to work there. Pay is low and the raises are low. They just treat you terribly.its very cut throat.
bad,"The Walmart I worked at was hectic, the managers and head people were not on the same page. It was very unorganized and needs alot of attention to get back to good business."
bad,"For an entry level position, Walmart is great. Throughout my year there I was able to go from a cashier to a sales floor associate, all while being trained throughout the store. I had a few problems with scheduling and with some male associates. At the end of my time there they were making many changes throughout the store, and the management was not good throughout these times. All in all though, Walmart is a great place to have your ""first job""."
bad,"Very pleasant and enjoyable place to work, would recommend this company to newly graduates from different background. Sociable work place management could use some assistance."
bad,The Walmart I worked at was a training facility for management The amount of problems you run into because of it was insane. I must say working with the public is always fun
bad,"unload trucks "
bad,Walmart is a good place for a first job. Management is poor. Coworkers aren't the best. There were no real benefits. Pay was very bad. They only care about Walmart and not about their employees.
bad,"My time working there was very enjoyable. It was a fast pace   environment, you also had a chance to interact with different people on so many levels."
bad,I have only ever worked on the over night receiver shift on the grocery end and it was not a great experience. The people i worked with were very helpful and nice but the management is something else.  Inventory is a complete mess. Shelves in the back that are used for slotting items that cannot be placed on the sales floor was a disaster. Too much product was forced on the floors to be stocked but with no where to place it. The importance of rotating  the grocery items for health safety was intentionally avoided even by some floor managers.
bad,To know I played a part in helping students realize their dream of graduating from college is a feeling that can not be explained. It gives one a sense of purpose.
bad,"Would have to unload and deliver 4 departments products, cull old produce and clean displays, breakdown pallets, stock produce department, and make sure correct prices were displayed for all items in department"
bad,"I started the job because frankly, it paid well enough and it was a good stepping stone. I would keep my job there but I think It's time to move on. I would like to move on to better things in a bigger city where there is actually a life to enjoy. "
bad,"Working with Walmart is  a benefit for any body as you work in environment that requires continuous attention and care."
bad,"La empresa es buena, el ambiente de trabajo dentro de la empresa es mala"
bad,Everyone in the store is miserable everyone walks around sayin how much they hate their job. There is an insane amount of favoritism especially within the AP department.
bad,The management team did not do their jobs and leaves it to the associates to handle management problems. The management was always busy to answer simple questions throughout the day or could never be found.
bad,"Wal-Mart is not the place you want to start a career, or any job for that matter. The wages are laughable, the management has no interest in you, and the customers genuinely disregard you. I only held the job of Backroom Associate for a summer, and that was more than enough to know that it is a terrible company. I was barely trained to do my job, and had little help when I asked to be filled in on my duties."
bad,"It;s cool, management could be better in every store. It's extremely messy, and even the mangers are like that. Managers treating employees differently."
bad,Here the management will treat you unfarely as well as pay you at the bare minimum for as long as they can. Do not trust them if you end up working here.
bad,Management is not great at Walmart. It's very much of a because I said so type of environment. You are not allowed to collect overtime which I feel is unfair. however the pay is alright.
bad,I worked there for over 3 years not one write up and just because some one left some thing behind a display I was fired on the spot not really sure why no write no nothing just treated like garbage I heard some one else wanted thr job but had to make a place for that person and they did they have their pick and their hates
bad,"a typical day at work will be; I'm assisting a customer at the service desk, my line is getting longer, customers are complaining and the customer I'm assisting is giving me a hard time with a pricing issue, I'm calling for a manager for assistance or an override, remind you that there are 6 managers on the floor scheduled to work that boring and know one will come and assist me until the third or forth time calling"
bad,"Most people I work with are part time or temporary and we have been advised we would never become full time.  Also, since we weren't full time, we have no benefits."
bad,"Depending on the job site,  Walmart can be great, or terrible.  If you fit what Walmart considers to be a ""Quality Employee"" you can go far.  By that I mean you need to ""buy into the culture"" and adopt the world view of upper management (head office types)."
bad,not one of my best experiences. very unorganized and at times unprofessional. lack of communication was at an all time high. competitive pay. a good beginners job
bad,Use too many techniques for tax write offs to save money. Conditions poor for customers and more so to employees. Management of employees is low especially at registers. Punishment for poor work is mentioned every so often in very long gaps allowing the poor work to be done for long periods of time. Cleaning and maintainance is left to workers with shorter hours most of the time unless the direct manager is there for the area you work in which is not often. Product is usually brought in poorly or has a very short life span out on the floor.
bad,"Wal Mart there is not real on floor training. I was assigned in the hardware section, I know nothing about hardware. I was told when a customer asks just read the back."
bad,Had lots of busy days putting up stock and helping customers find what they were looking for. Steamed shrimp and lobsters. Very hard work. Loved the people I worked with.
bad,"Worst environment I ever worked in.  They were very cruel to their rank and file employees and provided very few with benefits.  They also kept staffing levels extremely low, even expecting the Pharmacy to ring up groceries so they didn't have to open registers in the Food area of the Supercenter."
bad,"there was always something different happening at the service desk. You never knew what would come your way. with money orders and returns or exchanges along with moneygrams and check cashing ,you were always doing something different."
bad,When i started working at walmart the pay and benefits were competative but after some time and a new management came they did not want employees to work full time because they did not want to pay benefits
bad,"You are expected to do a certain amount of work that takes a crew of 4-6 within your 8 hour shift. Management often paces around the store to make sure ""things get done"", when they could put in a little work themselves. The only time you ever see upper management do anything is when the store manager walks into the building. There is a reason Walmart has a high turnover rate."
bad,"Hard to leave decent pay. A lot of salaried managers have poor morale and no family-work life balance but will not leave due to pay. This creates stores with associates with poor morale and productivity."
bad,Was a great place a while a go but I wouldn't go back needing a break from hours always changing little hrs to lots days to nights one managers says one thing another says something else
bad,"Walmart was okay if you got juice and you cant advance in career if unless you kiss butt there but overall easy job "
bad,You hardly make more than minimum wage for a ten dollar an hour starting job. Discount sucks and once you're pass the two week orientation at the start you start losing work hours.
bad,"You can work with some really interesting folks at WalMart and meet some really interesting customers but company management can come down with things that will really have you scratching your head like store managers really don't have any say in inventory.  Everything is managed from Bentonville, AR, including even the way shelves are stocked."
bad,"To much management. Do not have the same agenda. "
bad,"I honestly did not enjoy my job at walmart. The pay is low, you are not getting hours and if your part time you are not entitled to benefits. Walmart does not work with you on scheduling."
bad,"Cash checks, send money, receive money, and pay bills. Answer phone, process returns. Fast paced environment. The most enjoyable part is working with the employees."
bad,"Despite working fulltime for walmart, they do not offer benefits or enough pay to keep their employees from needing government assistance such as food stamps and medicaid. Often there is more work to be done than there are employees to do the work."
bad,It had a lot of issues from favoritism of other employees to having you train new people just so managers could make them in charge of you even though you have the skills be said leader. Poor management. No balance in work flow and always negative
bad,we pushed 10 to 15 carts at a time by hand mostly because the keys to the automatic cart pusher where lost and they did not attempt to get us a replacement. the only reason i was hired was because there previous cart pushers all quit.
bad,Walmart is  a place you can work at and still have fun. It shows character and strength of everyone in the place. I would recommend Walmart for a place of employment
bad,"Wasn't a bad job, just never cashiers. No overtime allowed or full time status I would work up to 38 hrs. a week but never 40. I was pushed to scan items faster continuously"
bad,They had some amazing managers that help to greatly support there workers. But the work and upper management where not as supportive. Took forever to actually get any decent benefits. And the anti-union propaganda they give in the beginning is ridiculous.
bad,"walmart was so horrible to work for the management was so horrible their own was what they tended to , they worked everyone to death and when i say that its horrible"
bad,Day day it was you come in you get your tasked form a manger and then you moved on from there. The rest of day is there was a issue  you where are weren't able to find a the manger on the time our not .When you make pages for the take hem for ever for them to respond .
bad,"Being the fact at the time I worked for them I disliked my position."
bad,"I was an assistant manager.  My biggest gripe wat this - the company cuts labor cost aggressively and the only goal in mind seems to be the dollar amount - even if there literally aren't enough people around to do the jobs.  But then as an assistant manager I was expected to enforce the completion of jobs and disciplinary action agianst associates for failing to get the work done.  I was also subject to disciplinary action for work left incomplete.  The motto among other assistant mangers was ""coach or be coached"" (coaching was a what Walmart called a getting written up).  So in other words, assistant mangers understood that they can either blame hourly associates for work not getting done and write them up, or they can expect for themselves to be written up for the work not getting done.  I wasn't willing to play that game.  So I left."
bad,"My experience at Walmart was that I made the best of a job that had a culture of unmotivated workers and management driven by numbers. The atmosphere of Walmart is one that employee's love getting off work and dread coming in. This atmosphere is driven by management that seemed not to have any empathy except for themselves and a environment driven by numbers. The manager at Walmart were pushed from their superiors at the corporate office , so a domino effect occurred, Those who were in fear of their job and/or position being taken would lash out at employee's  and micro  managing to the point that the work environment became undesirable."
bad,"I was excited to start at Walmart.  The training was great on the computers, as far as training on the floor, a totally different story.  If I asked a question, I was made to feel that I was bothering the person.  I did send a letter to Management, and never received a response."
bad,Walmart in flowood Mississippi is terrible the managers don't care about their workers and doesn't understand how to run a store. If you not on good terms with some of the managers they going to try and get u out of there
bad,"Walmart was a place that you will do the same routine over and over again, while you didn't see management giving you recognition for your job. You can fill the environment that your just one more in there."
bad,"I was employed at Walmart Stores Inc for a period of 17 years.  I have worked in some good stores and some bad stores, but overall the workers are ok."
bad,Overall its not a bad place to work. Since they have increased hourly wages it kinda makes up for having to deal with management.  If you are well liked you can climb the ladder quickly
bad,Nice people who are there to work with you great benefits 401k plan 10% discount as a worker very close knit management is friendly and helpful I highly recommend employment at Walmart
bad,A typical day at work was non stop moving. I learned that sometimes you cant even trust managers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers!
bad,"When I started working in this store, the management was much better: more professional and fair.  Over time the quality of managers hired and promoted from lower level jobs has spiraled downward in massive proportions."
bad,Its a good place to work just to get a pay check to maintain and keep your bills paid. I liked the discount it really came in handy especially when money was tight.
bad,"3rd shift : Meeting then more than likely stocking instead of mods. Management needs a good amount of work under high pressure tend to move people to much and areas don't get done in the time they want and they get mad with associates. High turnover rate due to management and not enough people. You have more work to due in a shorter amount of time.I have learned how to set mods, properly stock and proper customer service.The people I work with are the reason I stay there, that and my store is close to home."
bad,"I had plenty experience in this field, but this store was never very busy when I was working. Therefore I didn't get very many hours. They would also leave me to work by myself for 6 hrs at a time."
bad,Can't live comfortably unless you are in a manager or higher position there. You'll be living from paycheck to paycheck.  It would be a great part time job for someone trying to make a little extra money for pocket change or savings but not to be reliable on paying all of your bills unless you have assistance.
bad,"I was at Walmart for a year, and for a while it was fine. Not good, not bad, just fine."
bad,"Low morale among employees. Management doesn't want to hear about problems with other employees not following procedures on main floor. We spend a lot of time fixing mistakes that other shifts do, and if brought to management we are told that we created the problem to cover our own mistakes. WHAT?? No help there. You are on your own.  The good thing is the company raised wages, the bad thing is that it cost so much for health, dental, 401k, etc. After all that, you still can't live on that wage."
bad,A place like Wal-Mart in my opinion is good for college or High school students. Alot of times the management treated team member like children instead of adults.
bad,"It's an ok job if you're not a single mother trying to provide a comfortable life for you and your child without government assistance. I worked there for 7 years I made a few friends and had a lot of fun, but I got tired of the struggle."
bad,"The shipping and receiving clerk position verifies and keeps records on incoming and outgoing shipments and prepares items for shipment by performing the following duties to quality and productivity standards. Operates lift trucks or hand trucks to convey, move or hoist materials to proper departments or areas."
bad,"You will never work fast or hard enough. Negative motivation is the only motivation used, at least where I am."
bad,Usually understaffed so you would work alone most days. Had to do multiple shifts on cash while having other work to do.The managers never scheduled enough people but the same amount of work was expected.
bad,"The store I was in may not be typical for the rest of the Walmarts in other areas. The store is poorly staffed (likely due to a smaller then necessary pool of candidates), the management team has little or no respect for its employees resulting in a higher than average turnover rate of qualified and experienced staff. There seems to be no communication or mutual focus between the assistant managers, and the department managers are given a high workload, no staffing, and no authority to manage. In short, there is little incentive to work for this place."
bad,"Management is every where, lack of leadership and lack of communication. They over work yet underpay everyone and treat employees like they are nothing"
bad,It was a lot of hard work and a lot of bad hours i would go to work at 2pm and leave at 11pm everyday with a bad taste in my mouth the managers at walmart could of done a lot better
bad,Overall a good place to work if you really need a job. The pay was pretty good  and you usually get enough hours. The management is professional but maybe too much at times. At times they can be all in your business and watching you every minute to make sure you take short breaks. Most of the people that you work with have been there 5-10 years and hate their job. I don't recommend this place as a long term job.
bad,"It's a fast paced environment with great people to work around. It is also very stressful and is one of the busiest stores. It comes with benefits, but just wasn't for me. It was too stressful after two years and I wanted a change."
bad,"A company that doesn't care about it's workers. Your job security is out of the question, and they try to only hire part time associates to save money so that they get paid more (management)."
bad,Just not a great place to work ... not very good with there employees. Only wanted part time hours and expected 8 hours from me . Couldn't do it ! I had a full time day job .
bad,They were always understaffed and expected three workers to do six people's worth of work without getting any overtime. If you work over you have to take extra lunch time to give them their hours back and if you don't get things finished they write you up. It's very stressful in the lose-lose situation.
bad,"good place to work if you're working over night, management is terrible at night, its more of a slaves job than a team effort. Managers just kind of stand by and watch you lift heavy objects on your own and tell you to work faster cause their butts are on the line if you don't."
bad,It was  basically in experience for me to work with customers because I am a peoples person I love helping people I was a sales associate making sure everything was neatly fixed so when the customers come in the store it was convenience for them to be able to shop. I always loved my co-workers there to.
bad,Not a good place to work. Too much favoritism. Manager tend to act like slave masters rather than team players. While people were severely discriminated against by black associates.
bad,For young adults I wouldn't recommend it unless you really have the time. The pay is just fair depending on the position and work could be too much if in 🏫
bad,"this company was very rude and didn't treat anyone equal. they didn't care what anyone had to say. they would get mad if i needed their help with a customer, i was very unsatisfied with my work experience here"
bad,the hardest part of the job is working overnight. there is little to no customer interaction. Wish that there were more jobs available in the town. No job security
bad,No one really cares about anything at Walmart unless something has been stolen. There is almost no workplace culture and I really did not learn anything there.
bad,Management was very disrespectful. Constantly asking you to go against company policy. Favoritism was extremely high. Management does not work with you when it comes to family emergencies.
bad,"retail is quick pace labor you have numbers you have to follow. I was able to keep up with the numbers but, its exhausting for the amount you get paid for."
bad,"I was frequently taken advantage of because I was a young fast passed worker. I was injured several times working for this company because of that fact, which was ignored, and therefore I was completely screwed over. I still suffer from the damage. Then I was wrongfully terminated because I refused to take the abuse, which was all the managers. The company is corrupt!"
bad,"If you are needing a job, I do suggest Walmart; however, if you are more marketable then do not waste your time at this place of employment. Management is out to get you at all times."
bad,Was in college when I worked for walmart. I felt as if I was under paid for all the work that was given for me to do but I was a good experience in the grocery field.
bad,I worked for Walmart to support myself as I was in college. It was only for a short time but I felt as if I was under paid for the hard work that I put in. The hardest part of the job was managing the hours I was given with my school schedule. The enjoyable part was customer service.
bad,"since I was part time I couldn't get any benefits.  if I work over 34 hour a week for three weeks the corporation would be obligated to put me on fun time.  non-stop movement.  store manager would change display;ays with no thought as to where to put items that were originally there.  displays could be changed within hours, ignoring customers.  store manager would yell at his staff in front of customers, using derogatory terms."
bad,If you are looking to just have a job to take care of your family needs then it's a ok job. I don't see myself making a career out of this job. Not very organized depend on what store you are at.
bad,"Walmart is not that bad to work for, but the management skills of some of the managers are horrible. If walmart would just hire people who want to work instead of just bodies to fill spots then it would be alot better."
bad,This job works you very hard for little pay. Teaches you to get an education. It helps you to value yourself and a person and press toward your future.
bad,"They promise you everything when they hire you, then gradually show you the truth and take it all away. Everyone is out to get the other here. If you have any values stay away"
bad,this job is good for someone to start out at if they need money asap. if you would like to work fro some of the benefits it is great but not so much if you are looking for a career.
bad,If they would learn to listen. A constant stream of me telling them what was going to happen and it usually did. Also I had a hernia operation poorly handled either by corporate or the insurance company. Wal Mart does not subscribe to Workmen's Comp. so be careful.
bad,Walmart over all is a very good company to work for with lots of room for growing . It does not pay very well and does not have very good benefits. No paid vocation either
bad,I worked out in the lawn and garden department and hated every second of it. I did cashier. I handled order for customers. I helped stock and helped with inventory.
bad,"Walmarts management is absolutely intolerable. They don't give you pay for what you are worth. You work so much and receive so little. No room for advancement. I was cut down twice for going up because they said i was ""too valuable"" in the position i had and gave the jobs to people who didn't even know the department or job. No room for gain. No room for a raise. They threatened to cut my hours and take away my health benefits all because I hit 34 hours for two weeks straight. I just couldn't stand it anymore and found a much better job."
bad,"As a cashier you make sure that you have enough money in the drawer, make sure that you have plenty of bags up and that your register and neat and clean. You learn/ have to know how to rub the register, always great the customers with a smile and talk to them. The workplace is hectic at times when it is busy and it can be pretty stressful. The hardest part about the job is having to put up with rude customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you have some of the nicest customers, when you go to break and when you leave to go home."
bad,The company doesn't care about its employees and only about productivity. The benefits have high co-pays and the work conditions are terrible. I would not recommend this employer.
bad,The managers are ok some need a attitude check  they ask way to much from one person and if they don't get what they want they will take it out on you and they have their little group to hang out with
bad,Not the greatest place to work. Will hire as part time and give full time hours to avoid benefits. Hours will randomly drop as well to satisfy Work Safe with not giving you benefits. Very good place to get a lot of hours and work though.
bad,"Not the best place to work, people get rewarded for lack of work while the people that are truly doing the work are kept at that position with no room for advancement."
bad,Very cut throat attitude among employees. Lots of layoffs. Stock is decreasing. Very poor management leadership.   Strict travel rules and budgets.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
bad,"Management team is horrible, they never have enough employees scheduled so. It stays busy up front at the cash registers. Never have enough lanes open. I'm a Customer Supervisor but I always end up having to run a cash register and never able to get my required duties done."
bad,Would be better if they treat their employees better than what they do an show some respect to the ones who really work hard an show up to work when their supost to.
bad,"when i start work, I clock in then i begin my day. I have learn patients leadership. management was poor, the workplace was clean and safe to work. hard part was staying away from negative people."
bad,The management issues write ups to employees for any reason they see fit. They threaten the whole shift with write ups if no one comes forward with information. Therefore every person is held accountable individually or as a group. This is what happens when there's no Union and the company is communist. You are basically guilty till proven innocent very un American.
bad,"Walmart is great if you are young in high school trying to make some money. It is not the company it used to be. If I were ever going to work for Walmart again, it would be at one of their smaller stores. I would not work for a supercenter."
bad,"Walmart is a good place to get your foot in the door, but other than that I would never want to go back to Walmart and work there. The management is not the best."
bad,Conflicting management views on how to run a store. Most managers don't communicate between one another. Assosscaites are easy to get along with and generally its an easy place to work at as long as you can stand differing views on how to run a store.
bad,"It could do a lot better in treating their associates that works extremely hard. Also, they can do better in hiring people when the work place is extremely under staffed or they can pay their associates more or provide more overtime for extra work that can not be done in an 8/hr shift."
bad,"Not a bad place to work , meet many people throughout your work day which is nice. Worked at the time around my schedule and worked part time hour which was nice of them."
bad,"This is no job for a career minded person! pay and benefits suck! If you want to make money then dont apply for a job at walmart period point blank, it is clearly a job for high school kids with no responsibilities."
bad,Poor management and refuse to offer time help needed to finish job assignments. The management is rude and says negative comments to the workers. Also try to overwork workers without overtime pay.
bad,this job was fun at the beginning and then as the year went by it got stressful and you did not want to go to work anymore. when you get demoted for nothing that is a problem.
bad,"Walmart has changed over the years. Walmart has lost thousands of employees over the years because of the lack of management. It is not so easy to move up unless you are a favorite to the management. They will promote you if they really like you.. Walmart has taken away Vacations, Holiday Pay. You are eligible to put in for it to get paid but have to use what is called PTO (paid time off) hours in which you will gain from the time you start working. Not worth it at all"
bad,"Overall job was good, but management would contradict other management. Was difficult to do job sometimes due to miscommunication of one manager saying one thing and another saying different. I learned that I needed to speak up more to every manager to refer to my immediate supervisor so that there would not be any miscommunication at least on my part. I enjoyed working with my coworkers and we worked well together to get things done. All experiences with customers were mostly 5 star reviews."
bad,"enjoyed working with my coworkers. I liked helping with customers and learning all the ins and outs of the store. I did all kinds of different jobs there so I wasn't stuck in one department, It helps you learn all the different things."
bad,"When I first started I really enjoyed the job despite it draining me to the point I had no social life. "
bad,Its Walmart you get what you expect nothing to fancy pay should be a little more for the back house workers nice laid back environment management is willing to listen
bad,"Would not recommend it to anyone who is trying to raise a family on the salary, it is student job no hours management are not very nice there employees"
bad,"When I first joined  Walmart, it was my first job in a different country.  As soon as I started, the assistant I had to report to, just handed all the work (piles and piles of tasks that hadn't been done ... hardly any training .. it was a sink or swim situation.  After I got the hand on things, everything improved"
bad,"Was a good starting job to pay the bills"
bad,"Management does not necessarily have the skills to manage the teams they are in charge of.  Once a person's skills are known, easily can be taken advantage of by being asked to ""help out"" others and made to feel guilty if leaving work on time. "
bad,"I was constantly mental, verbally, and sometimes physically abused with this company. I would tell management EVERY time and they wouldn't do a single thing about it. Not to mention not being paid fully or ever on time."
bad,"my typical day was ok, if you just want a to meet people. Walmart was just a place to work to just get the extra money if you want some casual work. It's not a place I would recommend to anyone to work."
bad,"i worked there for only a few months, but the work is constant. got  hired in the seasonal department but worked other dept as well and only then it was just parttime"
bad,It was busy on a daily basis.  It made the day go by fast.  We were very productive.  We worked as a team to get the job.  We had a job to do and we did was we can to finish it.
bad,Great for someone just coming out of college to gain management experience and such. They have a great management training program and can really get you on track.
bad,This job dictates your life. Walmart does not care about the things happening in your life. They are quick to fire people and are constantly changing your job duties. Breaks and lunches tend to always be late. Hours will be cut without notice and obtaining full time is hard if not impossible.
bad,"I want to be clear from the beginning, I liked my job at Walmart, I liked the people I worked with, I liked my customers, and I liked the management all the way up to the store manager whom I knew personally."
bad,"Walmart is a great company for people in need or a job or looking for a summer job for those who are new to the work force, it is easy to get into and easy to pick and learn how to become a real team member."
bad,Wasn't able to climb the ladder of employment. Many managers were not open to new ideas and ways to improve facility. Poor management and unprofessional environment.
bad,"I was an overnight stocker right from the start I got put in the hardest and heaviest section, Pets it was nothing to move 400 bags of dog food ranging from 6lbs to 55-60 lb bags. when you got in the truck to un load it. all the time the pallets looked like they had been stacked by a 10 year old, it was the warehouse had no care for us when we got them you have unstack and restack whole pallets just to get them off the trailer. they did care about there employees, it did matter if you were sick or hurt your back you still had to get the job done by your self."
bad,Managers are awful there. They have no idea what they are doing and will honestly just run through you. I had one in particular who actually gave me a bad review just so that i could not go to another walmart that was closer to me.
bad,I do not like working here. They do not work with you nor take doctors notes and i wont work there again. At least where i live and they like to talk bad about other people and not help you when you are haassed
bad,A revolving door of associates in and out of this place due to lack of care and training. After being there for nearly 2 years I was very surprised that Walmart is considered the world's largest retailer considering the way they treat their employees. No loyalty at all!!
bad,Work in Toy department it's fine it is just the department manager has let the position go to her head. The  management team does not work together and they will have you run all over the store doing thing other than the job you was hired for.
bad,I have never worked at a company so selfish in life and I would never work there again. they do not care about their employees and its sad...but its fine now
bad,I was a CSM for 2 years. There was only one CSM at all times. Whenever it got busy or I was caught up in something and was falling behind I had zero help from management. The only time I ever had any help was when the store manager was there. She would make someone help me.
bad,"While I am grateful to have had a job at a young age Walmart just isn't a realistic adulthood job. The management teams always try to break corporate rules while failing to communicate with one another. The flexibility of the schedule was nice at first but then they will cut your hours because your "" not available "" and its known that the store definitely can accommodate with your available time they just choose not to."
bad,"While your work is straightforward and you usually know what is expected of you, there are several things that make this an unpleasant place to work, compared to other places you could work."
bad,"Overnight cashier that handled returns, check cashing of customers checks. Put out freight for front candy displays. Assisted others if there was down town on the front counter"
bad,I have enjoyed working at WalMart but the management has changed so that it is not very productive. I like the people and really like helping the customers find what they are looking for.
bad,"walmart dosnt care about family or your own personal issues, management only cares about the job getting done. your hard work is rarely recognized in walmart"
bad,"management lacked organization. sometimes failed to assign task evenly and properly. For example, assigning a 2 man task that could take 2 hours 45 minutes before an employee is scheduled to clock out."
bad,"However average the job was, there was one problem, management seemed to have poor communication and leadership skills save for a few of the group. Still wouldn't be a bad job so long as the set of managers present at your Walmart are better overall in their ability work with scheduling and training."
bad,Being a cashier and interacting with Customers was the best part of my job. Working there I did not like at all I never finish my training because of scheduling.
bad,What can you say about corporate america that we already don't know? Giant fortune 500 company with little care for anything but the almighty dollar. Never again.
bad,"I learned that I need lots of rest before I come into work at Walmart because the energy will be drained quickly. The management was usually concerned with many other things to give one-on-one attention. In all, it is a job for someone who has a high tolerance for stress."
bad,Working for Wal-Mart. Is   not my favorite  but the jobs are easy   management  friendly and take charge  . Employers are easy to work with and the company as it's self is well known.
bad,"Quick paced environment, but slow moving change.  Customer service takes a toll on one anymore.  One can get promoted, but it means more hours and responsibility without a just compensation.  Employee morale is always low."
bad,.great people n good place alawys helping r the people wjen they need it if someone needs help where alwys therw to help the if ur a sticker n someone needs help on the casher where allawys there to help
bad,"Management is biased. They only advance people they are friends with or family memebers. CSMs think that they free to do what they want. They spread rumors, and call you bad names. No one else there wants to be there, so it's a really boring and uneventful job, outside of CSMs making you clean urine  of the floor. 1/10 would not recommend."
bad,"expected whole section of the store to be done by one person when the store was still open and expected us, at the same time, to help customers that ask us for help(which was consistent)."
bad,"My days working here was stressful but I always made the best out of it, I've learned always do your best no matter what. It was okay working there, A"
bad,Muchas horas de trabajo con un salario muy pequeño.
bad,One week you may get 30 hours next week you may get 15. If you are schedule is not flexible Walmart is not the place for you. Pay needs to be a little more and give more hours
bad,I was hired by the agency named Baron HR .The manager was really rude and disrespectful to all. The only way he would of treated you well would be by taking him food. The enviorment was good and niceall the leaders were nice and respectful as well.The hardest part would be under going with your scanning and your picking if you would stop and brake your numbers would drop. But the enjoyable would be having to compete with others.
bad,"easy work,not enough hours or pay.training is too extensive,all the compter training is uselss,no need to have that extensive of training to unload a truck and stock it. job is a hands on job. job is too simple for all that computer testing."
bad,I got this job right as I graduated high school to help get me on my feet. job hours sucked the pay was alright for what walmart offered. and they over worked you.
bad,Most everything you hear about Walmart is accurate. Pay isn't great. managers are hit and miss. Hours tend to fluctuate a lot unless you are one of the few that have put in a lot of years.
bad,"When you barely start working with Walmart, you are treated good and the pay seems good. Once you have been trained for the department you will be working for, they expect you to do a lot more for what you get paid. If they are short handed you are expected to go help in other departments as well as finish your duties in your assigned department."
bad,I worked overnight cashier. Love working with most of the staff on overnight. Needed to find something with better with little ones at home who needed me.
bad,The company does not treat employees or customers fairly. Also getting paid bi weekly is not a plus. All associates are mandated to work holidays . Fluctuation in schedule is also a problem
bad,"•	Handled the front end, maintain flow of cashiers"
bad,"This is a good job for someone just getting started in the work place and learning customer service. However, it is not somewhere I would want to build a career."
bad,"Perform customer service to the customers of Walmart in the Sporting Goods and Hardware departments. My duties consist of stocking and preparing merchandise items for the departments, providing the selling of paints as well as create specific colorants for customers, selling of ammunition, and created fishing and hunting licenses."
bad,Very busy working as a cashier. Work on the holidays and weekends . Learned a lot and got two pay increases while working at Walmart . Very stressful some days when customers had to wait in line .....standing on feet all day .
bad,"Job is ok, store manager and assistant mgrs will walk right past you and not speak to you.  Employees are great to work with and most work as a team. CSM's were good with the exception of 2  one that refuse to look when action codes are sent for change, etc. the One CSM will work but is constantly on her phone CONSTANTLY and the other CSM is beyond lazy no idea why she would of been promoted to CSM when she was a lousy cashier. Not a good example to employees when we're told phone use is not permitted. The turn over in this store is due to rude management and lack of respect for employees under them.  The pay is awful and most employees are on government assistance (food stamps and Medicaid) for this large of a company that shouldn't happen."
bad,when working with Walmart everyone was part time except the managers. They got paid every two weeks. no insurance until you became full time. no room for growth that would amount to much.
bad,"My managers and higher ups would have me do their work most nights because they were lazy. But other than that it was a fairly easy job and not too stressful most nights. They will give you a penalty if you leave for to visit a family member in the hospital, they only excuse it if that person dies."
bad,Walmart is a job just to get you by for the time being. It is hard to advance with the company despite the fact that management says it's easy. Management is horrible! They have an open door policy but they do not abide by it.
bad,I personally don't like Walmart not only is it boring but the pay is not what I expected it to be honestly . That's the issue I'm having with Walmart.
bad,I'm starting to hate Walmart cause of their poor management skills  unorganization in a lot of favoritism if you're not in there click then you're nobody
bad,"management lacks people skills and leadership. Benefits have changed in favor of the company, bad safety & training is @ a minimum. Open door policies are not held to privacy."
bad,I dont like the way they treat their employees they allow us to be disrespected and they never stand up for us. This is the worse job ever and the bonus we get are horrible and they are always cutting hours.
bad,Company always seemed to be under inspection and the location for our store was extremely dangerous. Boss always put the customer first and blamed the cashiers for making mistakes and wouldnt allow a chance to defend ourselves. Biggest problem was the Human Relations manager didn't like the position she was in and seemed to take it out on the employees.
bad,Worked here as a teenager and it was not fun at all but the worst part is how the employees are treated. Most people that I worked with only stayed there because of the benefits besides that they didn't enjoy.
bad,"This company does not value you as an employee and the culture is not good at all. I did work here a few years ago, so I am not positive of any changes."
bad,"no pagan lo que prometen , faltan a la verdad, no se comprometen y no son buenos profesionales, esto funciona solo muchachos,.. no es necesario de ningun guru para hacer funcionar un negocion bajo el concepto de explotar gente y ser la empresa de retail mas importante del mundo, en donde los millones sobran y solo se los reparten entre un pequeño Clan,"
bad,Walmart is a good place to work for a student.  You meet new people everyday and you help them to make decisions and take their purchases.  It is a good training experience of how customer services works.
bad,Wal-Mart is not a great company to work for.. they are for lining the pockets of sun who run our country and care so little for the common people. Don't work there
bad,"My experience is from an overnight cashiers point of view. First few months in weren't so bad, I was a happily hopeful employee of one of the counties biggest corporations. I enjoyed people and could connect with others easily. Unfortunately Walmart does not care about their associates. Having ongoing injury collected me a few days off, plus being worked to the bone (9-14 days in a row sometimes) brought serious stress and lack of sleep to the table mixed with preexisting mental illness gave me anxiety attacks and even fainting in one instance. That place is H**L! Anyone who works there hates their life! Well what life Walmart gives you time for that is...."
bad,"you will be pushed everyday to meet up with sales target, no motivation and no job security. its best to check your pay to make sure its correct, most of the time there might be errors or missing pay."
bad,"I have worked there for over six years, and I have not been taken seriously by management at all in my willingness for job advancement. I have seen favoritism in job advancement where a worker who was 21, and had worked there for only 2 years, who didn't have any experience get a management position over me. I have completely lost faith in this company."
bad,typical day at work starts out with different managers telling you what they need you to know while knowing you have a specific job you need to get done. The Management team only puts you down if you are not in the management positions. There is nothing enjoyable about working for walmart.
bad,"A typical day working at Walmart is stressful. Between the managers and the angry customers. The managers don't schedule enough people so the lines are usually very long and the customers get very upset. We don't get a set vacation, we have to accumulate hours after 1 year of employment you can start accumulating them."
bad,Clocking in and starting work. I learned about teamwork and it was great. Management was crazy they had no plan at all at times.Fast paced at times but kept u going. Management messing with scheduling. I made a lot of friends working there.
bad,"A typical day at work is very fast paced, you are dealing with a lot of impatient customers so if you are a employer at Walmart you have to learn how to not take anything personal and have a hard shell but always keep a smile on your face. It is a very easy job but it is constant and thats what i liked about it. Time went by fast."
bad,"The only problem I had with that neighborhood market was with one of the CSM by the name of Marquetta . She intentionally took her anger out on anyone due to her miscarriage of twins. So when she returned from Maternity leave she came back with nasty remarks, snappy attitudes, and would always get my job in jeopardy. Therefore I then eliminated myself from everything took, left and found another job."
bad,stock shelves overnight preparing the store for opening at 6am. I learned how to stock according to upc and number of faces. our culture friendly fast and clean was something I strived to do daily. hardest part working short staffed the most enjoyable meeting life long friends
bad,"E muito bom te trabalhado pra els sim e meos colegas de trabalho e eram muito legais "
bad,"company will not make you grow.. depending which store its all based on favoritism. a large work load with limit time to finish all tasks, disrespect managers, they will not approve days off even though you never call out always been on time to work"
bad,"I love working for Walmart, I love the people and employees. Only downfall is you have to have a complete open schedule to be able to get hours. And once you are in a department and you're very good at that department, don't expect to transfer to a different position."
bad,"the worst job I ever had the store was not in great shape"
bad,"Being with this company made me realize why I keep striving for more. you can definitely grow with in the company, but you have to be determined and patient. Pay can be raised but they will cut your hours. Great benefits also along with stocks."
bad,"Walmart is an okay place to work because it pays the bills. Since working there I have learned that nobody really cares about you. I'm not saying that they have to but considering that we're suppose to be a team, it would be nice for your fellow co workers and management to be considerate. The hardest part of the job is staying sane due to the gossiping and drama within the work place, especially when you may not be receiving the hours you deserve. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers. I like helping customers because I like helping people, and I love to see the smile on their faces because of my assistance. As far as the workplace culture goes, all I see is everybody for themselves or favoritism between management and associates. I do not mean to taint the image of Walmart's work place but it is what it is. I'm just giving my opinion while being honest."
bad,"Working at Walmart is a job, and not much more than that. It's a minimum wage job with not much room for advancement. What makes working at walmart enjoyable are your coworkers. Too much is expected out of workers while only giving minimum wage and due to this a camaraderie is built between the bottom associates."
bad,Hard work and no time off if needed. The will work you all day everyday even on the holidays if they can. You will not have a personal life when working for this company. The best part of it was that few cents discount for being an employee.
bad,clocking in you have plenty to get done if your on the main floor away from your department you'll draw customer attention. management will grab you to work a project along with your assigned duties.
bad,"I have had my ups and downs with this company but it was my starting point they can improve on a whole lot more in the future. Had some good boss and conworkers but, only would say it's about a four in my books"
bad,You are on your feet all day and dealing with customers.  This is an ok job but can be difficult at times.  Not only are you dealing with multiple types of people from different cultures but you are also dealing with several different managers during the course of shift.
bad,Manejo de paqueteria a gran escala asi como envios de la misma a las diferentes sucursales.
bad,"Wal-Mart is one of the worlds most prolific retailers, which means your likeliness to receive a job is high, however your satisfaction thereof will be low. Typically you will be thrust in to a position with little to no training and there will consistently not be enough staff in the store. Scheduling is often highly flexible, though, so if you need a second job or are currently in school then they can make it work."
bad,"working at nights only, stocking shelved, straighten, returning clothes to the racks, pricing, selling answering customer questions,cleaning and cashiering"
bad,Be prepared to receive a ton of criticism and to be judged. This place sucks the life out of you and will expect a smile on your face every step of the miserable way.
bad,"Walmart is a fairly decent place to work, but the hours are not set nor do they meet many people's life balance or financial goals. The advancement for the workers at Walmart isn't exactly great, many workers have yet to advance within 2-5 years."
bad,I find this job a stressful place to work at. A typical day at work is very few coworkers and a lot of tasks that needs to be done. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with things with so few people working.
bad,They did not have good management. They never seemed to know what they where doing. Managers would talk bad about each other. One manger would come give a task and a few seconds later another manager would turn around and tell u that task is not important and make u do another.
bad,"Manager was always on breaks, never ordered what we needed as far as supplies and we were constantly running out of food for the hot bar. The attendance policy is very outdated. I was out for a virus and they let me go. They would not accept my doctors note. I had worked the day before while running a fever and throwing up behind the counter and they refused to move me out of the fresh food area so I could continue my shift."
bad,my typical day working at Wal-Mart was very stressful. I had to do everybody else job but my own the breaks was very short we didn't have enough staff to help out each other.
bad,"I didn't mind working at Wal-Mart but it was not a job that I could make a decent living to support my son and I.  It depended on who the front supervisors were that would set the tone for that day. For the most part I enjoyed my job, I loved talking with the customers as they checked out in my line."
bad,This is okay as a stocker you get nice hours and you get to meet a lot of nice friendly people that come into the store. Its a nice job to have and somewhere you can possibly move up.
bad,"walmart was an interesting place to work. Has its ups and downs depending on your work ethic, personality and ability to deal with sometimes irate customers"
bad,When I started working there it was fun. Then things changed we got a new store manager and the store went down hill. They set you up to fail. They wouldn't help you if you had a problem with a coworker if they like that coworker. I will never go back to work there.
bad,I chiode not to speak on this position.  I will state there is nothing about working there that i would recommend anyone else that is a responsible adult NOT living at home to take this position.  I found it is strictly for teens and elders.  There are no full time positions available so not worth time
bad,"Fair career opportunity with poor employee services, and the outside-looking-in opinion from customers makes people shy away from working there. There's a reason why there's a People of Wal-Mart website."
bad,As a general i liked walmart. My coworkers rocked and the work wasnt too bad. I would not recommend unless you have a thick skin as dealing with management requires that.
bad,I liked that I learned how to do the photos and how to run the customer service desk. I started off doing the photo lad then within 6 months of me being hired I became the Customer Service Manager
bad,"As an hourly associate, Walmart is great to work for. There are opportunities to advance. Many areas of specialty to explore. Paid breaks. Hour lunches. PTO accrual and good pay! "
bad,"I stocked dairy aisle, cleaned the dairy line, and received milk from truck. I worked for walmart for just over 3 month and all i saw was a general state of apathy from management and staff.. an example is going to management with solution and the management would give you more problems... i do not think i will work for walmart again."
bad,I love helping people being at work on time getting to know customers work hard everyday I am consistent and dedicated I said a lot because I mean it.
bad,Walmart was a job for me while I was in high school. they hired me knowing I was a high school student and still expected me to come in at 2:30 while I was still in school. THey did not work me a lot and did not give me a lot of hours as well
bad,Walmart is a great place to work. I love the Customers and learning Customer service skills as well as cash handling skills and learning to work the cash register.
bad,Working in a quick paced environment can be challenging. Management had more to handle than they could manage. Hard to get a good schedule. Safety is always first here.
bad,"Management seems as though they do not care about your well being. They will work you to the point of quitting, and expect you to do the impossible and will even threaten to fire you if you do not complete all tasks right away. Lets not forget overtime that they promise, they tell you overtime is approved but then turn around and take it away from you by sending you home."
bad,"Paid out change and cash back orders. Used debit/credit card machines. Accepted and processed checks. Validated checks. Assisted other cashiers with difficult customers. Handled cash and made correct change. Refunded customers for returned items. Counted money in cash drawer at the beginning of each shift. Maintained clean work area. Figured bills using cash registers and price scanners. Resolved customer complaints. Cashed checks. Knowledge sets include: 10-key calculators, Bar code reader equipment, Calculators or accessories, Cash registers, Credit, Laser printers, Scanners."
bad,"I dont really have anything to say about walmart except I worked there for less than a month and I thought they paid well starting out, The management wasn't the greatest but its all on how you let your surroundings effect you."
bad,WalMart has a tendency to accommodate the ones they like. I liked working there they just need to be more fair with all of their employees. And train more and give others a chance to grow.
bad,"CAP Team two member: Arrive at work at 2p.m. help setup general merchandise warehouse for unloading of trucks. Required moving of pallets and carts into set places. A short meeting to inform everyone of what was happening, how many trucks we had to unload and who would be sent where, meeting also involved stretches. Half the team would be sent to sales floor to stock aisles while the other half remained in the back to unload trucks. CAP Team 2 only does dry grocery, pets and HBA. (shampoo, deodorant, toothpaste, etc) For the first hour to two hours your task while on the sales floor is to straighten the risers, meaning you get a ladder cart and straighten top stock. This involved moving what items could fit to the appropriate place on the shelves and ""left justifying"" everything you couldn't. After this is complete or your time is up you go back to the grocery warehouse and take stock back to the floor to stock shelves. Floor is full of customers so this can be a bit hectic. Goals for this are unrealistic as they plan out how long it should take you, 1 minute per box. In that time you are expected to find item slot, stock item while pulling all older items forward and removing damaged/expired product. All the while helping and greeting customers and of course waiting for them to shop the area you are working. Your time does not stop when going back to retrieve more stock or throwing away trash. After stocking what you can you must place ""topstock"" items on risers and take whatever you cannot fit up there to the back and ""bin"" it. Once you complete your task you task out and"
bad,"Typical Work Day Cashing patients out on their medication, collecting insurance and placed that information into the computer. Showing customer different things on the floor that can help them."
bad,a typical workplace fast paced with growth potential if available to take advantage of it. Customers are my greatest most valuable thing about the job I love my customers
bad,associates are not treated fairly. they do not care about them whatsoever. more benefits should be implicated. no associate security. managers are also not helpful at all
bad,"I worked at store 0194, there was a lot of favoritism and discrimination. If they decide that they do not like you, management will go out of their way to make it very hard for you. They would give vacation to those they wanted instead of giving it to the first person to ask for it. Management would make you stay past your clock out time and then make you clock in late the following day, so no one could receive overtime. They would task you over eight hours of freight, when you only have 5.5 hours to actually work it. They would fire associates and not replace them in a timely manner so that when you asked for a day or two off you were denied because of no coverage. The final straw was when I was told that I could not transfer to another store. Walmart is a very bad employer."
bad,Horrible work conditions for stocking and inventory associates. There were so many hazards in the stocking department. I kept hurting myself but I could only be offered medical benefits and compensation after 3 months. I feel as if there should be more safety precautions.
bad,First the managers are very rude and have no respect for the other workers. They walk around like they have nothing to do. theres no understanding. i cant work with people like that
bad,"Wal mart is a very hard company to work for. They do not stand behind the employees. They cut hours to make a better bottom line for gross profit. Management is trained to cut hours, send people home."
bad,I did not enjoy working for Walmart. They don't care about their employees at all and the hours are horrible. I feel bad for my co-workers that are still there.
bad,"It's an ok job. Pretty busy place, no down time ever unless you're not in grocery. Fats pace environment with a lot of traffic. A lot of stopping and restarting"
bad,The computer system was very use friendly and I did enjoy using it. I liked that 2 pharmacist were on duty most all the time. It was a good working environment.
bad,"Typical day is dealing with different customers. I have learned to better interact with different people. The hardest part of the job was the management, they were not very friendly to deal with."
bad,"I worked here for just over a year. When I started they hired me as a cashier. I did amazing at it and got praised by managers. Managers were helpful when needed."
bad,"I enjoy working with my co workers, and most management is very respectable and classy. However some management is lacking when it comes to caring for associates, and recognizing work."
bad,"Walmart retail stores are a decent place to work if you are trying to work part-time. However, I do no suggest anyone seek full employment unless they are seeking a position in the logistics area or in the corporate office."
bad,"The particular store I worked for had and total lack of management, organization, and communication across the board. The customer first scheduling program ruined the flow, productivity, and general amount of working hours each employee was accustomed to receiving. There was no fluidity between the night shift and day shift, thus creating an extra work load for the day shift."
bad,Best thing about this job is the people you work with and become friends with. The management is biased and unfair. Not much opportunity to advance in the company. Very flexible with my school schedule and days that I need to request off.
bad,"Depending on the department that you are hired into Walmart can be a good entry level position for those with no experience, but know that the compensation is terrible and the work especially for loaders is miserable. I was hired on the first day i applied and was called immediately. If you are in need of a job quickly this may be an attractive but understand that the quick hiring is because there is a high turnover rate because of the issues listed above.."
bad,Managing the front end can get very hectic. You either do or do not get help from the managers. Plus there's always going to be an unsatisfied customer.
bad,The Wal-Mart I worked for was very unprofessional. the management didn't care about anything and barley did anything. also many people were getting fired and mistreated by people in authority.
bad,Great job to keep and keep working to make a better you and provide for your family and great pay great job to be in and keep wanting more position and the best work I waver had
bad,Better to be full time so you can get benefits. They increase hours during holidays and cut your hours for months after it. management helps when they want to
bad,"A typical day Wal-Mart consist of being the register and checking out customers and bagging there items in timely fashion. Also, I had to clean up the shelves and put items back in their place."
bad,"Long hours are easy to achieve, but it is almost impossible to get a full-time position. Pay is good, but really is not worth the workload. Management is only there to ""delegate"", they rarely work with you even when understaffed. You basically will work for yourself and if the job does not get done, Walmart will remind you that you are expendable."
bad,"it was ok, they need to do better I believe. Too much responsibility for little pay, stingy with raises and other opportunities to grow, I think that they could do better honestly."
bad,My day at Walmart consisted of  me collecting carts the environment was  very stressful. The managers were disrespectful and would  cuss you and yell at you in front of you.  We were all young kids and the managers took advantage of it.
bad,"The work was fairly easy. The only problem came to be where to management would never let anyone off even if they approved the off days. Also, they did not care about my college experience or classes because they would frequently schedule me to work when I had classes. Even though I gave them my availability and it was approved 3 months before classes started back."
bad,i would work for a distribution center but as for the store no i will never work in a store as sales associate ever again. the raises are a slap in the face
bad,farmingdale Walmart is full of unqualified managers. they would try to step on you to make them self look good then to train or groom you into success. pay is terrible But Walmart was never intended to pay a salary to live off on.BUT if you have no ambition and no desire to move up in life your farmingdale walmart would be more then happy to help you.
bad,Pues en realidad hay un buen control en cuanto a areas y personal de cada una de ellas en definir actividades
bad,"Great way to become more social. You meet lots of people on a daily basis and theres hardly ever a dull moment, theres always something to do to keep busy."
bad,•	The primary purpose of this position is to unload trucks and zone departments to make items organized and easily accessible for customers and the manager's.
bad,"Walmart is a work place that rarely gives raises, over works their employees and is all about getting the most money for their buck.  The employees are generally great people."
bad,"The co-workers by large are excellent individuals and the company's greatest asset. However the Management's growing demands upon the lower management and sales associates is becoming, if not already bordering on the absurd. The company seems to have lost it's original view and goals of respecting the individual and that hard work and skills and knowledge of the job move someone up in the store or company. However I rarely saw any kind of respect for the individual and the only associates I saw moved up were those who had little to no work ethic but were ""favorites"" to one or more of the managers."
bad,they never seemed interested when there were issues that needed to be addressed they always seemed to busy when issues were brought up and then they would treat there employees unfairly
bad,"Basic Call Center atmosphere. You are micro-managed and tied to a phone. Your breaks are scheduled, you have to be able to use various programs simultaneously."
bad,"Although I was promised the ability to work in the IT department, I was hired as an inventory specialist. The job was ok and I didn't have any problem with it, but my sights were set on a job involving information technology."
bad,when i was injured all they did was try to push em away and force me to quit my job so they would have to pay out for insurance they are not family orientated either.
bad,"Es una empresa que pide mucho y da muy poco, en general solo es un trabajo temporal para todos"
bad,I worked for pearisburg Wal-Mart for a few months and loved it until I lost my place to stay and had to move back to Princeton and quit my job at Wal-Mart
bad,"working there is ok but the managers are the worst. They make you feel belittled and cant state your opinion without feeling stupid. If you have an issue with one manager you cannot go to talk to your store manager about it because she""ll tell you to talk to the same assistant manager than the issue is about. Everyone is scared to talk about them so they continue to get away with everything ."
bad,already did a review. i dont think i need to do another one. pls fix this. really didnt like working for this company at least not at the front end. managment was poor
bad,"Management is very unprofessional, they do not care about the store nor the employees. The benefits are great, they pay decent. But they expect you dedicate your life without helping you advance your position or anything. Worst experience ever."
bad,"They say the customer comes first, but they really don't.  Management is never on the same page.  One manager tells you to do something.  Then another manager comes along and tells you to do something else. They never schedule enough people.  Then the one person has to cover 4 departments and gets into trouble when their department doesn't look good."
bad,Walmart was okay it was not the best job at all... management was not a good help at some point I mean if the person new you that's when you had a better chance at making work ethic better
bad,"Working with customers is fine, but with management, it was pretty harsh. They get mad at you when business isn't busy, so you gotta make yourself look busy. They do not work with your schedule unless you have to go to the store manager to get his/her signature, but make sure you make a copy cause human resource will say ""they never received it"". Didn't stay too long because I didn't like the workplace environment because I feel that everyone was always in a bad mood."
bad,"a typical day at Walmart is a lot of drama."
bad,Overall it lacks important team building and personal development points. promises are never really met and department managers are the only ones really held accountable for anything.
bad,"Most of the time I worked by myself so i kept some of my sanity. All around it was terrible. Unprofessional relationships between management and staff. Assistant Managers lying to the Store Manager. Turnover rate is so high, don't bother learning people's names.  Worst customers ever being provided with even worse customer service."
bad,it was a long day at walmart  and tryied very borning. i lerned  setting up  sleves. management was very bad he be little people . it was ok. the hardes part of the job was standing up on your feet all in the same place . ther isnt much to enjoyed their.
bad,work place culture is excessive. Management really doesnt care about their workers. The pay isnt good enough for the work they expect you to do on an everyday basis
bad,Busy place to work depending on the department the pay was low but if you your serious about advancement that is readily available just let management know.
bad,"The Assistant Manager position had so many responsibilities that it seemed we were being set up for failure on a daily basis.  Whether it was being short staffed, under merchanidised, or having staff and customers that were just never happy, it made the days very difficult to be successful.  I was always positive however and connected with my associates and became more of a leader rather than a manager.  People would work hard for me because I would work hard for them.  I did take away some great leadership skills and organization skills due to the daily demands of the position."
bad,"in my experience, very rarely do you come across people who respect you and know what they are doing in this walmart. co workers make the job bearable"
bad,They are trying to do better with the pay. The cut hours here and there. Some days hours are available. Other times they will cut your hours. They want you to know all departments so you can fill in when need to.
bad,manager treat people likenothing they like to cut hours  they don't care if you are sick or have a doc note they want you to do so much during the time you clock in and out I wouldn't recommend no working at walmart
bad,The store I worked at was great. Management didn't give me a chance. Seemed to me management stop pointing fingers and stop being mad at one another long enough to acknowledge employees they would have a great store.
bad,they really do't take good care of their workers and pay them so little. they ask you to do so much with no help. and never really want to hiring anyone full time.
bad,"unloading the truck loads, stacking merchandise, and loading the freight to the sales floor is a very important task and keeps Walmart functioning. Also working the grocery side is an important task as well."
bad,Never again they didn't understand family problems they didn't schedule breaks properly. they would often times not have anyone to cover breaks so we would be short and lines super long.
bad,"Walmart was my first real scheduled job.  I learned tremendously there.  We were all like friends and family.  Fresh outa high school, they gave me the opportunity while I was in college furthering my education.  It got to me a  little overwhelming with both jobs and school.  The hours started to overlap and started problems."
bad,"You have to unload the trucks as quickly as possible and will be yelled at continuously if your not close to done unloading the truck in their expected time. They tell you what rate you need to hit to be acceptable, but even when you meet that rate they will yell at you and tell you your going too slow. Work with some very...interesting people, and management is back and forth with no idea what they are yelling about. Job itself is tiring and unrewarding, but the pay is decent for a retail job and being in the back you don't have to deal with customers very often. You don't go home until all trucks are unloaded regardless of whether it takes you 3 hours or 12 hours. Holiday season is especially hectic."
bad,wasnt the worst place if you stick with it you can go places but only if youre dedicated with the company and are willing to work your way up the ladder
bad,This job may be for individuals that are in college and need money for rent. The job requires a lot of physical work. If you are a hard worker at nature you will be fine.
bad,"First off, horrible management. I feel like they rather beliitle than praise you. very unorganized managers and CSM's. Rude. overall good hours and good environment."
bad,Average pay with great benefits. Usually understaffed and underpaid. Management is not so great. Inconsistent from one manager to the next. Computer makes your schedule and is less flexible than it used to be. Not family friendly. Always have to work Thanksgiving and holidays.
bad,not so great place to work.if you have kids and a life you may be asked to work on days you weren't scheduled .and if you refuse ...well good luck with management being friendly.
bad,"Not a very good place to work.  Employees treated unfairly, wage is very low for the work you are required to do.  Management changes within the store 2-3 times a years."
bad,"Poor management leads to employees who don't care. People turn on each other for a promotion that is never coming their way. This place makes people angry and mean spirited because you feel attacked from every direction. A lot of pressure is placed on associates to get their job done while managers stand around watching videos on Youtube. I will never understand how you can work 10 times harder than someone who is making twice as much as you. No appreciation at all. I think I've been told ""good job"" once in the 2 years I've worked there. I'm covered in dirt, sweat, bruises, and sometimes blood by the time I am leaving."
bad,I open boxes and stock them in their proper locations. Afterwards I take items that don't belong in a aisle to a designated location to be sorted and sent to their locations.
bad,My day would start putting my stuff in the locker and then clocking in. Going to fitting room and checking where I work and getting freight if we have any in the back if not working on returns and organizing my area. What I learn is to mulitask. Management would only work with us if the head boss was in the store. The hardest part of the job was returns. The most enjoyable part of the job was fitting room.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend to a friend, good site management team but corporate management is not. Not a good 3PL to work at. Staffing in that area is challenging the HR support is the worst that I have seen in 30 years."
bad,aveces el ambiente de trabajo llega a ser hostil por el trato de algunos superiores
bad,You are there for the customers. But sometimes that gets lost in the other task. You do learn to work as a team.  Teaching and training could use work.
bad,"Good job for a young man or woman right out of or still in high school or college."
bad,"I adequately enjoyed my time at the company. There were obstacles and issues, as expected in any form of employment, but nothing of ill to speak about. Co-workers were respectful and helpful. Some managers were always available to provide assistance while others were not."
bad,This particular Walmart seemed to hire alot of pregnant women and let them go after their due date. Most were offered a job placement after they went on maternity leave but had to fill out a new application and start the process over again.
bad,You will be busy throughout your time at work. If the pay change it will be a nice place to work. The most enjoyable part of the job is having a close relationship with your associates.
bad,"the managers dont give breaks, dont care if you have to use the restroom. customers are disrespectful and the managers allow them to speak to you and act out any kind of way. DONT WORK FOR WALMART :)"
bad,It's a good place to start your career but keep in mind if you are looking for a place to build a career long term; Wal-Mart Home Office may not be the direction you want to pursue.
bad,"Fast Paced during peak hours and holidays"
bad,"Not a really good place to work, very stressful due to all of the drama that goes on amongst coworkers. The other cashiers were also very rude as well."
bad,The people i worked with most of them made the job enjoyable but Management was awful not all of management was bad but they had one guy they promoted to a support manger and he ran off 1/2 the store with in 6 months we constantly had new people he didn't have people skills and he had a problem with everyone.
bad,I spent 5 years of my life at walmart and the only thing I was able to walk away with was the knowledge that management will stress you as thin as paper and not even appreciate you for it. Their benefits are only good for full time workers but they make sure to give you just under 40 hours so you aren't considered full time. Just an awful awful awful company and I am so thankful I was able to get away.
bad,All in all Walmarts other bad place to work the people can be nice it depends on what store I deal with customers every single day up close and personal whatever ask for help by other management or staff it's very hard to get somebody to come over and help because everyone's too busy and they always take from my department instead of give Walmart's very understaffed they may be paying people more an hour but they don't have as many people working for them and that's where the the problems have come in management says they listen however you don't see any changes being made.however if you are young and don't mind not moving up in the company it's a good place to work. Working at Walmart hasn't been all that bad I enjoy everyone I work with I just think that the management team has double standards and for seven years I've been told that I'm ready to move up to be an assistant manager but then we get a new store managers in each time I'm ready and I get knocked back down because I have to prove myself to that new person coming in
bad,"There is no support from management nor is there anything fulfilling about the day to day duties. I am unhappy here. There is quite a bit of stress to do everything right, but we are not given the necessary things to get our job done correctly."
bad,"Handle large amounts of cash and checks, scanned groceries, and greeted all customers in a respectful manner. I learned how to scan groceries, cash checks, compare prices on items and greet customers with a smile. The management was not very fair unless you was part of the click. The work culture was ok. The hardest part of the job was not being treated fair. The most enjoyable part of the job was greeting the friendly customer and them saying something nice to you when you greet them."
bad,"bad place to work unless its just part time, work is very repetitive and boring, employees arent the friendliest, management is hit and miss some are decent others horrible"
bad,"the pay is good but the stress and stuff you go through isnt. you are expected to more then your job description requires you to,,and when promised to move up or to a different positon they tend to frown on this"
bad,"management doesn't accommodate with your life scheduled "
bad,Too little pay for the amount of work had to to multiple jobs that wasn't in my job description horrible management this is a good start up job but no future
bad,"I've worked at two different Walmart stores and have found that the management does not care about the actual employee, only that the employee is present for work. They are all about departmental sales and the bottom-line... that's it! There is no team. There is no emotional fulfillment through a supportive HR department. There is no support from your direct management. There is no effort made to make it a pleasant place for employees so that they have an incentive to go to work. The benefits are a joke! The attendance policy is so strict that you WILL be fired if you ever beome sick, even in the hospital.There is no ""good vibe"" to be had whatsoever!"
bad,a typical day at work consist of me handling packages and binning the in the right location for customers to pick up. The best part of my job is putting a smile on the customers face an knowing that i made  a difference because its very challenging at Walmart and to see a smile is reward enough
bad,They are always understaffed. The pay is unfair. I had to work in other departments that I was never trained in. Customers are ridiculous. The managers just bark orders and never help out.
bad,The company was good but the management staff is not good at this location. During my time there I had no support from anyone within the store. Associates had a hard time doing what needed to be done.
bad,"Assist customers, balance work schedules for subordinates, review intake of orders and dissemination of orders from outside vendors."
bad,"In asset protection you can lose your job for any minor mistake and the policies are written by people who never worked security a day in their life. Management will usually never have your back and you're dealing with the consequences of the heroin epidemic, people will still items everyday."
bad,Loved working with customers and being able to interact with different people. Friendly environment everyone was so nice and easygoing. My position was seasonal but I would definitely go back.
bad,Its something if you really need a job they are willign to pay 10$ an bour but its not wirth the bad managing and what type of customers you deal with on a day to day basis
bad,"The company is very difficult to work for. They will try to stunt any type of creative and innovative thought if it does not align with corporate rules to a ""T"""
bad,"Well, to begin, I can say that having worked in a similar place before, I'd have to say the management was much better. At the previous similar business, there were people in management who let their titles go to their heads. That wasn't a problem here. However, by contrast, if the other place was short-handed, the person in charge would look over the schedule, see who wasn't in danger of exceeding 40 hours for the week, and call someone in (or try to). At Wal-Mart, they would just take someone from another department, which only leaves the original department short-handed. Seems like poor planning."
bad,"if you get hurt on the job expect to get fired like me, and if you get fired they will not ever hire you back. and dont take sick days if you want to keep your job they have a point system and when you reach your max points your fired no matter the reason."
bad,Cushing Walmart was not a place I would recommend a friend to work. The management never had anything in order and never communicated. They would not work with hours or even major events when they would occur in an employees life.
bad,This works worst  part is dealing with customers in a daily bases who have issues with how things are run at Wal Mart. Working in retail seems to appeal to only a very select group of people and from what I've learned most people who work it have no where else to go.
bad,it was ok . could change quite a few things but for the most part it was a decent job. it paid the bills I guess . they have some management issues as a lot of the management think they are kids and don't want to do their job
bad,working at walmart is very stressful you have to have a good backbone the customers can get real mean and nasty. some of the tasks are hard to do but you get through it. it does a lot of wear and tear on your feet you.
bad,"A typical day at work for me would be at first running the front end. Assigning the cashiers their register for the day, making sure they had the beginning amount of money in their drawer to start their day. Handling customers at the service desk with returns, money grams, money advance and bill pays. "
bad,"Wal-Mart is a great place to work if you are embarking upon a career with nothing to begin with. I learned that retail is a hard thankless job, I would not wish it on my worst enemy."
bad,"I worked at Walmart for the summer. I had a lot of fun there. But sometimes the work is very overwhelming and got a little stressful. Overall, the job was average."
bad,For the first few years I was at Walmart it was ok. Then they hired way to many unqualified people to run their stores. Their growth outpaced the talent.
bad,walmart was not what I liked. only did this because I was out of work and this is all I could find at the time. maybe ok for young people. they make the people that work try to do others
bad,Horrible Company! They treat their employees like trash. Wouldn't advise anyone to work there unless they really needed  job.. Their pay is terrible..
bad,I would not recommend working at Walmart because it is stressful and they will find a way to get rid of hard working people. The people there will find some kind of excuse to get rid of you.
bad,I really don't have a review about Walmart. I needed a Part Time Evening job and they were available at the time. It was difficult to get consecutive days off from work and it was usually difficult to get the days off requested
bad,"I'd say it's a good place for High School graduates to work at as their second job-- things are a bit stricter than other places, but as long as you stick to the rules and listen to management you would do fine."
bad,"I learned how to work with many different types of people and personalities. A typical day is pretty fast-pasted, hectic on holidays as any store would be."
bad,"The computer base training (CBL), they offer is frustrating to many. It is good for informational training, but not practical training. There is little follow up training to insure associates are set up for success. There are only more CBL. Limited or no staff in many departments cause associates to work in multiple departments and yet get paid for only 1 rate. Many departments have different pay rates. If you move to a different department to get more experience, you may go down in pay. Many tasks require equipment that is difficult to acquire do to shortages."
bad,It was hard working for this company due to the disrespectful employees everyone was really rude bad at give directions a very bad experience for a first time job
bad,The Walmart I worked at sucked they dont take care of employs my managers aint no what was team work also disrespectful . Managers come work mad and take it out on employs so I just got me a better job at a nursing home.
bad,Attendance policy is kinda unreasonable. They never excuse emergencies like they're supposed to and the store manager is really mean to certain employees.
bad,"not a bad company"
bad,It's ok to work just want to try something different and I wanna be in a good environment and try other things  short breaks not long enough and have no bathroom breaks or long enough lunch time
bad,"I have worked their fur many years,and things have changed sooo much lately has had many associates leave. I planned on retiring from walmart....,but can no longer see this happening."
bad,not the best place to work finally got in to walmart after about 5 years of trying to get a job there and my experience ruined it for me so I will never work for walmart in the future.
bad,easy job just alot of lifting products in produce. store isnt as good as it use to be but prices are in unbeatable ranges. management are friendly but the rules should be fixxed
bad,"Walmart is Walmart. In the store that I worked at, at the time that I started I had just gotten out of my first college and needed money. Money I got, albeit very little. the most hours I got there without working as a floor walker was limited to 34 hours as a full time worker. the management in the store, in my opinion, was very lack luster. It has been a very long time since I worked there and I've heard there have been a lot of management changes since. Perhaps it has improved but I'm not willing to find out."
bad,"Summary's at its finest; generally in the store, one person does a majority of the load of the work, for any given department, usually with very little room given for advancement. Or, if there is room, managers will dangle that in front of the face of the most ambitious employee to keep them doing their job and that of five other employees"
bad,Very good benefits very well professional managers and the employees I work with were outstanding very respectful and if you needed help they were there right next to you to teach you how to do it the right way the first time.
bad,"I honestly feel like having to do this ""review"" as you would call it on my past work experiences is very difficult as I only worked there for 6 months."
bad,"Walmart is a company that enjoys putting pressure on its workers. They constantly push you to work harder and managment will lie to your face, with promises of advancement in my opinion unless you can work your way up to manager. The job is not worth it"
bad,Sam would NOT approve of the way his people were treated these days!!  Has gotten TOO corporate and lost sight of people coming first...VERY poor work environment.
bad,they underpay their staff. they never have enough cashiers. They also don't pay time and a half for holidays the only day the store is closed is Christmas day. They don't appreciate their staff
bad,"I wouldnt concert a career, do to the are not take proud in there employees, your just a number to them.the training that I recieved in my are was I and one other person in two hours, we trained our other crew members. The team leader had other things to watch. They was to worried over one area and not the whole area, that the team lead was supervising."
bad,"There is a sense of community here, of family. However, true to family, there can be dysfunction. Set your mind, be proactive instead of reactive. Plan ahead. Arrive to work 15 minutes early."
bad,I've worked with walmart for several years starting it was very enjoyable however they were bought out by some people who has changed the company completely. Its so not the same but does pay your bills.
bad,"Overall, Walmart isn't a terrible place to work. It pays the bills and is fairly professional where it counts. Each Walmart is different, and I'm sure there are both far better and far worse ones than the one I worked at. Personally, I loved the team I had to work with, and the job itself wasn't that bad. I just can't handle overnights. I'm unable to balance my work and personal life with the sleep I need to continue functioning. Overall, not bad, just not for me."
bad,"I found it frustrating that even though i was working in adverse conditions the technology was old and unreliable. Their training was based on, you making a mistake then them correcting with an inordinate bout of brow beating. I can only remember one or two employees that I felt were friendly. The manager was not often there."
bad,Would not recommend this place to work for anyone that has a family that they care more about than the job. The management does not care about the associates that are working their tales off to be able to provide the store with great customer service.
bad,does not pay enough for the amount of stuff you have to do. needs to be managed better. could use a face lift for the service department. would be a better place to work if managed correctly and paid better
bad,"I learned to  please customers, do fast check outs. Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting people and working with some very nice people. Management used to stand by their employees, they don't seem to be doing that now."
bad,I didn't work at Walmart. I worked in Walmart for Advantage Sales and Marketing. We were one of their approved vendors. We set up and built displays throughout the store.
bad,Walmart has flexible hours which makes it a great place to work for people who are in school. They also have many opportunities to work in different departments of the store.
bad,"Working at walmart is stressful or boring, there is no in between. Either the customer flow is low and all you have to worry about is cleaning or everyone shops and you have no staff. The problem comes from regional and home office constantly changing policies and procedures to ensure a better experience for the customer while completely throwing out any care for the associates well being."
bad,The company expects more than you can complete on your shift. And there are times you get written up for it. I feel they need to communicate better and have tasks that you can complete on your shift.
bad,Too often people that worked at Walmart come to work with home issues going on. The lack of pay makes them irritable and causes a hostile environment for the customer.
bad,My schedule was nights and at the time that worked with my watching my kids during the day but there is not slot of room for advancement. Even if promoted your pay is not raised
bad,"Prioritizing most important "
bad,I wouldn't recommend working here unless your really desperate for a job. The management is harsh and they'll give you an 8 hours work load in a 4 hour shift.
bad,"Management does not always respect their employees. Doctors notes are never taken seriously, they have no compassion. Never have enough staff on hand throughout most of the day. Lacking in customer service. Difficult to schedule time off."
bad,"Helping customers check out at registers. "
bad,Productive alwaysbontop of ther work ethic needs work on the employees its self need more attention to then and aldo hearing them out  work stations are ok
bad,"honestly the money was what had me stay I had just moved on my own and this was what I had. the management had crazy favorites, they never kept their word.."
bad,"the work they is great, but the atmosphere is not. There is no job security there, they will fire and re-hire the same people to keep from paying benefits. I was very disappointed in how they treat their employees"
bad,Terrible Management that doesn't Follow there own policies with regards to Attendance. Bad work environment and little to no help fro management. Decent Pay and Break Schedule.
bad,"Not too much I can say about this company. The one I worked for had bad management. Regular employees think their apart of management team and it's very difficult. Can't reallly trust anyone that works there including managers. Conversations are suppose to be confidential but once your out the office,some of your co workers know everything that went on."
bad,It was such a great place to work at.  To be around and interact with the different cultures.  I really enjoyed my short time here. I liked how well organized the store was and the easy access to get there
bad,"I worked overnight and that was great, there isn't many customers in the store during that time of the night. The more you keep busy the time goes fast. Friendly coworkers"
bad,"When I first got the job, I really liked it but Wal-Mart is not, I repeat not, supportive of working mothers and gives no leeway for responsibilties like picking up my kids from school or time off for sick children. Save yourself the misery."
bad,"Clock in, meeting, get department for the day and start stocking."
bad,They are very uncaring towards their employees. They always push employees to worker at a faster rate even if they are ahead of their tasked time that was assigned to them.
bad,"Too many chiefs, not enough indians. Your experience will be entirely based on the management you land with. If you're doing something they don't like, but you can't get fired for, there will be some silly things they will find to fire you over."
bad,Its a good place to start your customer service training. Their is so much to learn there. Meet all kinds of people. Always try your best there or they won't keep you.
bad,The managers didn't schedule you to be off when making the schedule even if you did it a month in advance. They had favorites as to who did what and who was allowed to get away with what. Also it was very stressful for a job paying minimum wage or a carrot above it.
bad,A lot has changed on the job. every time you turn around it's always something new or they are taking things away from us to need have anymore. I use to love going to work everyday there but now my heart is not their anymore with the company. It's time for me to move on to something bigger and better in life without having to worry about if I'm going to have hours or a life outside of Walmart. i just want to move forward to something different and better. I pray that God bless me with a great a job with better pay.
bad,The work was easy and great. However management along with almost anyone who worked there was hard to find if I needed assistance with anything. They didn't really train long and pretty much just threw me out on the floor.
bad,"I had to leave because i was attending college and i worked a overnight shift and when i would go home i go straight to class then work , there was much sleep for me which isn't a problem it just took a toll on my school work so i choice to leave."
bad,Don't like working here because of management. They treat there associates bad. The way they talk to the associates. They don't have any respect for their associates.
bad,Always busy god hours always work to get not organized need more organization skills e.  Would like to get things done and organized then re work us double and do it a different way
bad,Enjoyed the customers and co-workers. You had to get use to a member of management pulling you at a moments notice to do something else. Hardest part was working 4 hours a week.
bad,Walmart has become one of the major stressors in my life. I get paid well to change oil but the pay isn't even worth it anymore. Managers change their minds abd go back on their word regularly and we are understaffed on the regular. I stayed as long as i have for the experience.
bad,"Management just barks orders and walk around the store with their friends that never have to do their job. I had a supervisor write me up over leaving work too early when in fact i stayed later than my scheduled time, I went all of the way to the store manager and nothing was done to correct it."
bad,"At first it was a job to pay the bills, but soon it turned into what could only be described as a cow farm and all the cows have gone mad. Either mad customers during the holidays or management never being on the same page. The manager wants one thing, and then two other mangers want another, so you end up doing 5 things, only to turn around and do what the first manager wanted to begin with."
bad,"La unidad en la que me desempeñe era una de las que tenían mayor venta, mayor cantidad de clientes lo cual originaba una operación complicada la cual se solventaba de manera unilateral por parte de todos los asociados"
bad,At the sulphur springs location most of the management works within their own personal agenda and not for the betterment of the company. Only allowing their friends to go up in the company and is just a bad environment for an employee.
bad,"working at this company wasn't the best. "
bad,Wal-Mart typically is busy the moment the doors are open. It is a great place to be when you are first entering the workforce. Management is ok and the only hard part about being there is explaining the correct way to price match.
bad,"Easy job but unrealistic time frame to get merchandise out when there aren't many people working. I would say meeting deadlines was the hardest part. I got ripped off on my pay because they make you complete pathways before you get your ""hired-in/permanent raise""which management is supposed to make a time for you to do but no one allowed me to. The environment was somewhat unprofessional and most of the workers (especially cashiers) are not very friendly. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to interact with customers when I was out on the floor stocking."
bad,"You know what you're getting yourself into. It's Walmart. But, it's not a terrible job if you can stick it out and work to upper management. Then, it's worth the stress of retail."
bad,It was a job that you was easy going and always doing something until it was time for break.Overall Walmart help me greet people and you was always helping customers. Its a okay place to work.
bad,"The best thing about working here was the pay and of course the discounts and benefits that come along with it. Besides that , they treat their employees like trash and they don't care about your well being or anything that you have going on outside of work. The management was very rude . I would not recommend this to anyone i know unless you really need the money."
bad,É uma empresa agradável de se trabalhar mas não tinha benefício nenhum.
bad,advancement is somewhat difficult as tenured employees get picked for positions first regardless of your ambition to move into upper management quickly.
bad,"They expect too much from you. Management always thinks it's easy to make production but they've never done it. You can miss making production by .2 percent And still be accountable for it. Job isn't for everyone. Got to be constantly moving like you drink coffee the whole time you are there. Its physically demanding and Really exhausting. They give you 2 days of training then you are on your own from that point on. You have to teach yourself how to do the job because 2 days is not long enough! The production rate is unreasonable and the size of the store order matters!! They'll try and tell you it doesn't, but it really does."
bad,Not enough pay for the work you do their scheduling was a complicated shift to make 4am to 1pm kind of hard to maintain being single parent and had no car at the time
bad,"Not as family oriented as one is lead to believe. Management terrible as if they have there head on a swivel. When you are a new associate, they expect you to learn everything on you own without any necessary help."
bad,You are just a number to these people. They do not care about anything but the bottom dollar.  Managers scream at employees in front of customers.  Then ask you to lie about it.
bad,It was a seasonal postion it was easy to replenish the store accoding to planogram.I enjoyed this job it was always something to do occupy your time..
bad,Computer fired me had doc notes were kids were sick they couldn't or wouldn't do anything about it. And would only allow me 32 or under hours. Other than that it was good
bad,Everyone that worked there was rude and unhelpful to new employees and they always scheduled me to work when I was at school regardless of talking to them multiple times about when I could work
bad,"Worked part-time in various areas of the store.  Mostly cashier, service desk and layaway.  It has been a while since working in this field, so hard to say what it is like to work there now."
bad,Management only cares for their selves. You can get in trouble trying to do your job. They will sit there and say your going to slow. They will write up for stupid stuff. They aren't supposed to be able to tell you that you have to stay but they always use ways to force you to stay whether termination or write up for disobeying a manager.
bad,"Fellow employees great to work with. "
bad,"Regular day was clocking into work, and going straight to the back room to unload an entire truck or even stack a truck alone without any real help. More time just unloading trucks and having people get in the way, While un-stocking most of all having to be able to keep a clean work space in the back room. Most of the time you spent in the back then had to help customers find items when sent out on the floor."
bad,Company does not respect their employees.  Disrespectful and rude customers/staff.  Low pay. Benefits are not very good.  Always worked longer than I was scheduled.
bad,"This work environment was not the most enjoyable work establishment. Some downfalls about the job would be lack of care for the employees, and slow work days. I did enjoy meeting new customers."
bad,"Wal Mart is an evolving company that is slowly losing its core  basic beliefs that is was founded on. I have worked for them for the last 29 years and at one point it was a wonderful company to work for. "
bad,"my social security number was messed up in their system even tho i have my cards with me, they let me go on the first day after spending so much of my resources to make sure i can get the job."
bad,A typical work day was being on a register and cashing out customers and providing good customer service. I learned how to cash people out in a timely manner. The workplace isn't very positive. The hardest part of the job is feeling like you are just another number. The enjoyable part was meeting new people.
bad,"I was the asset protection associate, but was not allow to perform my job, always being TAKEN OFF TASK to do other work. and my catching loss prevention is what justified my position. thus, shrink was at high levels"
bad,"Unfortunately, the management at Walmart W11th location is not very good.  Everything is a popularity contest and it is the only way to get promoted.  You're upset with a fellow employee.  You can tell the managers a good false story and they will not research it, they will take it as fact.  But of course if your one of their pets, you'll be okay.  They have an open door policy but they never open it for anyone.  I requested three times for an open door meeting and never received one."
bad,able to learn quickly with the right teachers. you can move up fast within this company. management is not too great. expect to get blamed for other people's mistakes.
bad,Walmart does not offer competitive wages for their employees. The health benefits are too expensive for the average employee to afford. There is little chance for advancement.
bad,This is a job for someone that can deal with the different attitudes if you can not deal then this is not the show. However I love being the last person they see in the store
bad,"stocking shelves"
bad,Hardworking friendly Good Service Clean Place Heathy    Benefit learn more about the job Everyday New Experiences HELPFUL IN LIFE.
bad,Learned about customer service. Treat customers fairly & with dignity. Teamwork and lot of pressure. Employees are from different cultures.
bad,"Working for Walmart in my particular store was no treat. I department manager was very rude and in considerate, almost never granted time off even for medical reasons. My store manager was spectacular though if you had a problem going to her was the best bet. Fellow employees were great. Work conditions were under par ."
bad,It's not a good place to work at. The community I was working with were childish. I did gain work experience but I never understood the double standards stuff I dealt with.
bad,"Clean my own department. "
bad,Management Micromanages everything you do they come in and complain you're not getting done fast enough or doing the job correctly but they just stand complain leave back to there office and sit talking to each other.
bad,"Not enough help overly stressful with the lack of employees. They expected the work of three to be done by one. If work was not completed in time, you would have to stay until t was finished and force to cut any overtime to the end of the week."
bad,Management is cold and distant management is petty and do not engage in customer service very well unreal expectations many times good for some people I guess not for me
bad,I broke my front tooth on a bailer and my Assistant manager let me go because of it but on paper said it was misconduct with coaching's.
bad,Work your rear end off and it goes unnoticed.  Hard to get Full time. You don't get more than 24-32hrs of work a week.  Takes longer to get paid time off if your not full time. They don't schedule coverage for breaks appropriately.
bad,The management is horrible I never get my brake on time and managers played favorites so the work load was highly unfair. Coworkers would be grouped up around certain managers talking not doing anything productive while others are stressing out trying to knock down lines.
bad,"I did not care for the attitude that all employees are expendable. I was even told by a manager once, ""Once you clock in, until you clock out, Wal-Mart owns you."" Hmmmmmm"
bad,Je ne recommande a personne d'y travailler environnement malsain
bad,Walmart was sometimes fun to work for depending which store worked for. You did have to work until night and on Sundays. They do have a high turn over
bad,I had fun and met alot of people through this establishnent. I learned communication skills and the work experience was satisfying. I would jump at the oppurtunity to work again.
bad,"Is a nice job where you can contact with a lot persons, costumers. the work condition is good but the pay is low and the management do not care about the workers."
bad,Just worked and tried to stay busy. They usually lost people in the hustle and bustle often forgetting to give breaks. I did not enjoy working for them.
bad,I love my co workers but the management team and the way is store is run is very messy and unorganized. It's a good first job and better than working in fast food but not somewhere you would want to stay very long. A typical day at work is basically doing anything anyone wants me to do there is no real structure here
bad,foi uma boa empresa de se trabalhar tive oportunidades de desenvolver meu trabalho de forma que eu  aprendesse mais na prática tudo que eu havia aprendido no curso de panificação e confeitaria que eu havia feito.
bad,Not alot of room for advancement unless you have been with the company for a long time although every store is diff. Some management is better then others they have a high turn over rate it's when I feel like approving ur aval. Is when it will actually get done I wouldn't go back to this empoloyer again.
bad,"love the people, not so much the management. great company to work for. I love working with the public and you definitely have to have patience"
bad,"WalMart is a huge company that only cares about themselves. They do not care what happens in their employee life. They pay is ok, benefits are ok. "
bad,This company runs a very weird way. It almost feels like joining cult and if a mistake is made watch out. The managers tend to be the type that success in their eyes involves how much butt kissing they receive.
bad,It was an all right place to work for just couldn't handle the overnight shift. They wernt willing to train the workers trained you not management. There was no benefits
bad,I enjoy the job i do but as a whole the company does not recognize the work we do in a positive manner. I like the interaction with the customers and the praise from them.
bad,"Very competitive workplace , management wasn't fare , an refused my transfer while I was in school an I had asked to move closer to home . I put my two weeks in after they denied my transfer ."
bad,Working at Walmart for technically 2 times now has shown me how Walmart is really not a good place to work. I was exposed to copious amounts of bereavement and slander
bad,"Low pay, long hours, poor training, lack of tools to do the job. Often sends new employees into jobs that require experience and training not provided. Constantly shorting employees on the etm system. Often change schedules at the last moment which causes employees to frequently no show."
bad,I was not impressed with Walmart. I thought the management was horrible. They set unattainable goals and then act like you are under performing when the job doesn't get done.
bad,This company cares nothing for their employees. No overtime pay no holiday pay they cut everyone who isnt upper management to no hours at all. The management Openly have no regard for their people and will tell you so to your face.
bad,That job has no respect or concern for employee safety and needs. Management is lazy and irresponsible! Not a good work environment worked to death with small pay. Company does not have the employees needed for the jobs to be completed and work the qualified til they quite
bad,If you want to advance in the company. There is always opportunity. If you are willing to put in the hard work. Anything is possible.
bad,Walmart has good pay. There is little chances of moving up. I am leaving due to lack of hours scheduled. I have learned better customer service by working at this job. The hardest part of this job was dealing with the work environment. The most enjoyable was being round good people.
bad,"the work that i do is easy and some what challenging, but the management make a lot of the work redundant. the lower associates are easy to work with and get along with"
bad,"abrir el sistema , contar cuanta gente esta ausente y el por que, salir a recorrer el piso para ver que toda la linea esta en su lugar ."
bad,"The Walmart contact center is a great place to get your start. However, you will more than likely want to branch out to other areas of the company. It's a bit difficult to manage a work life balance."
bad,The experience with the store employees is great. Very easy to get a long and bond with co workers. Many times the walmart I worked at at the time was understaffed so they put all the extra work on the next shift on top of there own job expecting you to get it done on time. Some managers were not truthful and honest with subjects as well as not giving rational instructions or prioritizing.
bad,Nice place to work. I learned a lot of things that help me with my position. The most enjoyable part of the job was a happy customer and the end of the work day
bad,"Walmart has a very high employee turn over, a revolving door, because of management personnel policies creating a wall between managers and associates, this is not the company of Mr. Sam.  Managers are ordered not to associate with employee ""Associates"" creating an environment of negativity.  The Associates and Department managers run the store while the Store Managers create negative issues making the work environment very difficult.  If Walmart wanted to improve, most of the store managers should be eliminated allowing the Department Managers and Associates to operate the facilities creating a positive environment which would eliminate the high turn over rate ""revolving door"" in turn providing a better retail operation."
bad,Favoritism and a casual indifference to employees personal life made this an unpleasant working environment. Corporate changes happened nearly every day and management had a 'take it or leave' attitude
bad,They don't promise you hours and didn't learn anything. very hectic and out of order . The workplace has some favoritism
bad,"I met a lot of great people while working at Walmart. The hours were a bit odd, but the people really did leave a lasting impression. I really don't have anything negative to say about my experience here."
bad,A day working at Walmart was hard I was put on a morning schedule after I ask for afternoon. I learned Walmart need more hard workers that will do the job right.
bad,"Work environment---stressful to keep up with the quota, constant reminders to speed up."
bad,"A majority of the supervisors and managers have little or no managerial experience employees hired or assigned specific jobs are rarely allowed to do the job assigned as they regularly get ""pulled"" from their department."
bad,"The first time I worked for Wal-Mart I felt that it was a great company that I could advance myself with. I did that. Ending as a manager. My second experience was a negative one, filled with lack of leadership and disrespect. A great team makes a great work place."
bad,"It's more than simply getting from here to there. The Georgia Department ​of Transportation is dedicated to helping you travel smart through our careful planning, hard work and innovative ideas.​​​"
bad,"stressful all the time"
bad,"Lot of bitter feelings to be honest with working there. The managers are the happiest people you could ever see then the more you go down the ladder the more the smile turns, you'll notice. My biggest concern is as the summary title lists is an issue of nepotism vs. ability. And that is that it doesn't matter how hard you work or your past background, it is a matter of who you know for advancement."
bad,"They treat their employees like children, no respect whatsoever. The benefits are only available to people who are considered ""full-time"" and they don't just give it to anyone. The only way to benefit from the company is to work there for several years and just maybe you'll get your raise. And the customers are awful to deal with. Company policies are not given/explained to every employee and not everyone is properly trained, in turn giving managers the honor of explaining to the customer why this associate got your hopes up."
bad,Wal-Mart had inconsistency with scheduling but they were flexible with days off for important personal life activities. The pay didn't go hand in hand with the work.
bad,Walmart is a awesome place to work it's just getting hard to handle standing all day and managers not working with my schedule and I just need more pay I'm trying to move out.
bad,"The job is pretty easy, however, the management is not quite as supportive as they lead you to believe. No back up from any of the management when any customers got violent towards me for doing my job."
bad,"It is a great start for many, just to get their feet wet. But Walmart lacks in the area which I love. It has no discipline nor any real leadership. It lacks in any sense of the word management. I need an environment where it's not only what I've committed my life to, but have a sense that I'm doing something for the community and to the people."
bad,Asset protection is an important position in any store as you stop theft on a daily basis. It can be fairly boring walking around the store watching customers all day but its a great feeling when you finally do get to stop someone and catch them.
bad,"Walmart not a great company, although they pay well sometimes the pay is not worth the stress. Their management teams need a lot of work with knowing to treat and deal with associates."
bad,"- lots of work to keep busy"
bad,manegment is never happy with the work that you do. you always have to pick up the slack of other employies. store is always a mess and its hard to keep up with the demands
bad,"A typical workday in the deli department is fast pace, high customer service, and good practice of food handling. This position has sharpened my costumer service skills in person and on the phone."
bad,Unless you really need a job desperately i wouldnt work at walmart. The pay starts at minimum wage and doesnt get better for a while. They dont rrally work around your schedule or care about you.
bad,"I was transferred from Texas to North Carolina into a position that was not available. So after leaving my entire family in Texas to move into the position I was transferred to, I placed into a different position at Wal-Mart with a schedule that was different every day."
bad,"clock in, start with whatever department I was designated, pull pallets to the floor and stock shelves. take overstock and bin it in the backroom. recieve trucks, mostly dairy and freezer, use powerjack to put them in back freezer and back coolers."
bad,"It's very slow, and boring. I really don't like this position. It's not fun at all, I greet customers, stand in one spot almost all day. I keep looking at the clock"
bad,overall the company has gone downhill from when I was first hired. now that they are the only big retailer in Canada it has not got any better. all they concern is the bottom line and do not value their employees as an asset to the company but more like inventory.
bad,Though they hire the disabled they make the disabled feel unwanted and under appreciated. The managers were prejudice towards any disabled employees.If we do one small mistake we get fired for the act.
bad,I didn't work for here very long. I don't think I'm qualify to give a review. I was upset with them because they wouldn't work with me for scheduling even though I worked for another company. I wanted to keep both jobs.
bad,"Poor team management, lack of opportunity for advancement, truck unloading process was a joke, but the worst thing was the fact that every person that works there thinks they are in charge of you as a person."
bad,"An okay place to work, but the managers dont wany to do their job. Haven't had any hours to work in 2 months. Never get a call back when I am told they will call me back."
bad,flexible schedule if your high school or college but so many different personailities creates alot of conflict. a lot of people that think they are superior to other try to command.
bad,"The staff takes advantage of you, and even for people who have been working there for years, they will fire you in a heartbeats, no loyalty at all. Other workers are nice though. At the time I worked here though, they were very short staffed and had no security officers to prevent thieves."
bad,Buen  ambiente se hace una experiencia mas en el ámbito laboral y buen ambiente de trabajo
bad,the most enjoyable was seeing the customers smiling and happy with my service. the hardest part of the job was how management was so unorganized
bad,"If you know and are in with mgt, you're set. Otherwise, be ready to do a whole lotta work for a wage that isn't equal to the effort you'll have to put in."
bad,"Overall, the quality at the store level is pretty bad. You may not have the supplies you need to complete your job, there are multiple managers giving different directions on the same task, and your hard work is rewarded by gifting a larger workload."
bad,"At the Wal-Mart I worked at, there were multiple managers on my shift that would give you multiple tasks and did not communicate well with each other. One would tell you to do one thing that would be completely different for what another manager wanted. They did not follow their company policy. One thing I was told during orientation was that management could not force you to cut your time to prevent overtime; but that is what my managers did. Even if it was one minute overtime, they would make you cut your time or write you up for not doing so...even if they asked you stay extra to help out. They also put too much expectations on single individuals...something that ultimately led to my own termination...was not being able to meet their rather high and ridiculous expectations in working multiple departments alone in a timely manner while getting called off to assist in other departments multiple times throughout my shift."
bad,"In the beginning of my career I enjoyed the company and what it stood for.  Over the years the staffing became thinner and the expectations higher to the point now where they are Unachievable. I have been in retail for 30 years,  over 25 as a supervisor or manager. I know Unachievable when I see it."
bad,"Well the Walmart that i worked at was ok the managers was NOT on top of there game! slow with the money bags, just slow period! i remember they took literally 10 minutes to get there attention and i was standing there looking at them."
bad,"Basically, it's an entry-level minimum wage job. The only acceptable parts of working here were decent management and a fair level of willingness to accommodate a school schedule."
bad,my hours varied from day and night but the hardest part was the customers some could come in cranky and you had to bite your tongue and others could come in happy as a button.The rest of the day was stocking shelves tidying and zoning making sure everything is in the right place assisting customers.
bad,Unless you know a high up manager or plan on becoming a high up manager and know the right people eventually they'll find a reason to fire you or make one
bad,"Hated the job hated the atmosphere low pay no balance between work life, some of the employees attitudes sucked, as with upper management no where to go up in company and did I mention the pay"
bad,doing this as a work studies program for high school I learned a lot got to experience the work life and figure out what I liked and didn't like. Walmart was great for the most part.
bad,"When you hear Walmart the first thing you think of is long lines and rude customers! You haven't seen anything until you have to work behind the cash register. I had to deal with disrespectful people on a daily and ended up in a back brace after the first couple weeks due to the strain of heavy lifting, and hard work put on my body! You are slaved and management is very lazy. The pay is not worth everything they put you through..."
bad,"Stocking and unload"
bad,Busy environment high paced lots of customer service  I dont want to fill this it out I see no point to it I worked there over 2 years ago and find filling this out as a waste ot time
bad,"I always thought that I was a good worker, and every else i worked every one told me I am one of the best workers they have ever had. At Walmart that wasn't true they were under staff in my apartment because they didn't want to pay more employees, so there was never a way to complete my job because I didn't have enough help. Instead of seeing that we needed more help the management kept telling us t work harder and take shorter breaks. They also critic everything you did making it harder to do your job."
bad,"A typical day at work required me to work not only in my department, but also in areas that I was not trained in. However, I learned how to properly serve customers to their needs, how to operate all of the different departments to moderate standards, as well as cashiering. The management was difficult to find when anyone needed assistance, yet between coworkers we managed to effectively work out problems that might occur. The hardest part of the job was training myself how to work in areas that I was not familiar with."
bad,Not a place I want to work again. Poor structure within the workplace. Favoritism is a huge problem. A lot of issues are not addressed how they should be.
bad,Worse company I ever worked for in my life!!!!! The right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing!!! To many chiefs and not enough iindians. The only half way descent thing about Wal-Mart is it's benefits! They don't train you before they throw you to the wolves!!!
bad,"I liked working with people and the costumers. Times would get when it was busy or if a customer was angry for a small issue. I did enjoy the location, and I did enjoy working with money cause it helped me learn math a little better."
bad,"Don't get any hour. Not benefits just discount card after you three or six month are up."
bad,"I work in electronics , me personally think it's a great job. The staff is very helpful and easy to work with. I enjoy working there. They give flexible hours ."
bad,I was a maintenance associate that couldn't move up or laterally despite all my efforts. I wouldn't consider working that position again. I didn't learn anything from Walmart. The pay to start was pretty horrendous considering what I had to do. They would constantly ask me to help in other sections. If i was allowed in another position i may potentially feel different.
bad,I was worked on 14 different Walmart stores across several counties. I was in charge of getting contractors and vendors to come in and go warranty jobs and things that I was not allowed by company policy to work on.
bad,"I personally didn't like the job. They didn't accept Drs notes as excuses for missing work. They ignored my availability at the time. My son was in the hospital for a week with pneumonia I missed that week of work, and when I tried to transfer because  I moved they wouldn't allow it due to missing too much work so I had to quit there for my own safety i was too tired to drive home, due to living to far away."
bad,management does not know how to run they workers or how to treat them. they don't teach the new hire just throw them anywhere and tell them them have a certain amount of time to complete task.pay sucks .
bad,"Walmart is an impersonal company to work for, the expectation is clear that you work regardless of condition that could be dangerous to the employee's life or any type of illness whether it be the employee or a family member. Generally management is also trained to treat you impersonally. The positive thing that I can say about Walmart is that they are never late with a paycheck and if you are fortunate to find grace among your coworkers and possible supervisors, it can make it a bearable experience. Holidays will also be something that you will be expected to work. The bottom line is that you work when you are scheduled, you will be given the work of more than one person to handle because that helps keeps the costs of running their company down. I have worked for this company a total of 9 years twice. It is not a job that I would recommend to most people unless they are okay with the generalized set up of the company."
bad,I feel like this compny as a whole doesnt have respect for others.sometimes they make me feel like im less than them and talk to me as if im not even a person
bad,"I changed tires and oil for 9 hours a day, 4 days a week. Management was pretty rough. Managers did not know how to talk to customers."
bad,"So bad I want to quit. Im always over worked or getting lied on by people who don't do they're work. Management is horrible, have their favorites. Co workers are lazy. Hardest part of the job is pulling heavy pallets with bad pallet jacks. The most enjoyable moment at work are my breaks."
bad,"This Walmart has some serious management issues. While the workload and general day-to-day was acceptable, and did not offer too many problems, the management is appalling Managers frequently would clash over what they wanted done, and would make it very known when they were displeased. Many assistant managers, and indeed the store manager himself would give contradictory tasks, and then berate associates who would be doing a task assigned to them by another manager."
bad,A empresa Wal-Mart aprendi a ser do setor segurança e monitoramento.
bad,"Pros--benefits for full-time associates are good"
bad,La evaluación para esta empresa es un aproximado de 7 ya que en ella encuentras muchas preferencias y poco humanismo
bad,They have very poor work ethics not good team work....some of the mangers are show a lot of favoritism to some of the workers
bad,I worked as a cashier. Very busy. Gained insight into working conditions. Not a friendly environment to work in. Not accommodating to personal needs. No work community. I did not feel welcome.
bad,They suck. That is why I want to leave.they suck. I hate them very very very very much. Do not work for Walmart. They are the worst company to work for.
bad,A great company to advance in a lot to learn.  Great way to work around different people learn areas in the store that you may have not done before. Around the holidays is the worst and busiest days to work but fun and goes by quick
bad,"nice staff, a good place to work room for promotion good training "
bad,"A day a Neighborhood Market was a fun and busy place to work."
bad,"Having Worked there almost a year, I still felt like I didn't know my managers at all, problems I brought up with them about management and staff were ignored. I tried changing positions to have a more busy hands on job, however, the positions I was promised were taken away from me time and time over."
bad,i learned how to manage to work in multiple areas which helped me multitask a lot more. The management was a bit difficult because the boss was never really around to know what has been happening around so everyone would get in trouble for someones doing. Most of the co-workers were really nosy and wouldn't do there job as told so it was a bit hard to work with and communicate with. One of the hardest part of the job was the heavy work which was lifting boxes and pallets for 12 hours i really didn't mind but i wasn't getting paid the right amount for the job. I tried to see if we can get a raise because 9.00 an hour wasn't enough to maintain a proper life style. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to learn new things everyday and being able to adapt to them easily.
bad,Good company to get started if it's your first job. Has really changed over the years. Management is different that most companies. As long as you do your assigned job you will be fine.
bad,"The managers have no respect for the assoc. well some do. Most of the time they over work you and look over you if you need them. I just wanted to work my shift and leave. Really didn't care for the job , but I didn't mine the work."
bad,"My typical day at work was very busy seeing as most of the time I was only one working in electronics department; or they would have people for a different department in my department to just only be there to cover my lunch break. I learned how to organize product on the shelves according to the proper layout that was needed."
bad,"I learned the hard way working there. I work there for a long time, they didn't owe me nothing at all. I was the best claim supervisor."
bad,"Over work for small pay"
bad,I've learned that providing great customer service is very beneficial to you and others. When working with the public you must treat each customer the way you would want to be treated.
bad,hetic work schedule and they underpay people very unprofessional and have a hard work schedule. I dont reccomend this job to anyone not even as a manager they do not value there empotees
bad,poor co-workers downtrodden and abused by management my opinion. management plays games and don't get along with each other no accountability. do not recommend.
bad,"It A Job hope the value changes Because family not first and some home have one parent so walmart is about walmart .and no paid "
bad,"My experience in Walmart association, a typical day at Walmart you go straight to punch in, after that you return to the department you are assigned for the day complete a safety sweep. Throughout the day you will be rearranging things back in place,folding clothes you will also be getting returns and new racks of clothes to put on shelves and last greeting and helping customers is part of the job as well."
bad,"I liked working at walmart. They are easy to work for and work around your personal life when something comes up. They are almost always busy , always has something to do."
bad,I learned that management is poorly. They don't work with your school hours like they say they do. Majority of the employees are perverted and don't keep their hands to their self and when you report the situation it never get solved.
bad,"It was a seasonal job, the management was all over the place, some night you couldn't find management. It was a fun experience working overnights though."
bad,They overwork associates because nobody has heard bad things about them.When you work with certain associates they play favorites so the brown nosers kkep the supervisors their jobs.
bad,"Productivity and safety were at the forefront. Personalized management style not encouraged. Low employee morale."
bad,I would not use this as a long term job. It is good for the multi tasking skills that you learn while working there. However the manager team does the least.
bad,temp job to transform a regular Wal Mart to a super Wal Mart. Co workers were nice.Management was so so.Cleaned and built shelving units and set up end caps
bad,Wal-Mart managers are trained to not care about their employees and their needs. A nasty environment from the ground up. As a previous manger save yourself the time from applying with Wal-Mart.
bad,"Wal-mart is not a terrible corporation, but if one does need an income, it does suffice. I have worked in both the front end during the daytime and as a part of maintain at night. The dynamics of both of those positions are very different. For instance, during the day on the front end, one has to checkout customers and has to deal with the liveliness of the store. In constrast, at night, the store tends to be customer-free for the most part. So, the majority of the job in that situation is getting the store ready for customers that arrive the next day."
bad,It's alive work place just constantly moving taking orders make sure ur customers love the sever and food out in time so they don't have to wait..as long as u have a great team sere I'll b just find
bad,I am a honest and good worker I work hard and fast. I show that I want to work and have no problem working long hours or overtime
bad,"Worked seasonal job, nice employees. Low hours and get paid every two weeks. Lunch is hr long depending on how long shift is."
bad,"Je n'ai pas aimé mon expérience, ce n'était pas pour moi. L'ambiance de travail était mauvaise."
bad,The job is all over the place some of the managers are rude and they don't care they get fired more then the regular employees it's crazy I don't mess working for this company
bad,"get the cash drawers ready for the cashiers, needs more managers,alot of hard working people to make a living. people person and helper for the customer."
bad,You would not be rewarded for your hard work. Nothing was good enough for this company. You would get 25 cents maybe 30 cents for raises. There were no incentives. I could continue . It only gets worse
bad,"Poor management, the harder you work the more they expect from you.  Do not have enough employees for the amount of work that needs to be done.  Does not hire high quality employees."
bad,"This employer was a bad experience. Once again I have to focus on the attendance policy. They would hold certain weather conditions against there employees. For example, We had a very bad snow storm and the freeways has closed down so people couldn't get to or from locations. The management was always taking there stress out on the employees."
bad,"A night at work starts with a meeting "
bad,"Personnel was very nice. However, management was horrible. As a new hire, and having previous retail experience, I expected to shadow someone in order to learn my job duties but that never happened. During orientation you are assigned a sponsor & trainer. I never met either of these people. 99% of the time, I was left alone on the floor to put away returns & straighten up. If I told my manager I was still waiting to learn something, she would not even bother to show me or have someone show me."
bad,"Pretty Basic Stuff To Do Far As Changing Shelves, Racks, Signs, Updating The Store To A New Look As The Years Go On! Seasonal Work Too But That Job Right There Only Come Around Every 5, 6 Years Cuz That's When Its Time To Do The Same Thing Again."
bad,Productive at work with no team work. Hardest part of the job is No team work. Management did not care unless they could take advantage to employees doing something wrong. Most of the time you had to work on your break in order to get the work load done.
bad,"My experience with WalMart was interesting to say the least. There isn't enough staff to adequately preform at 100%, Some Management members are not people oriented, or understand how certain departments need to operate due to their lack of experience. Most all of the associates I worked with were great people with a fun side. One downfall, was their rate of pay to associates. It seemed a bit unfair that new hires are paid the same amount to start, as associates that have been there a considerable amount of time. For the most part, it is a tolerable place to work. If a person can deal with the stress and unhappy environment. At least in the store I was employed."
bad,"Working at Walmart was a eye opener, very stressful. I stocked in the fruit section. It's very busy in Walmart, it was too much for me to handle at the time. Would I do it again, maybe I just have to have better patience."
bad,Left for a better paing job in my field. Not the same company as when I started working there. Left feeling better about myself.
bad,"the pay wasn't good at all , and there weren't  many hours available for yo to work , over work employees , and benefits aren't good at all and always have to work on holidays"
bad,"I loved working here because I was always bizzy. I loved most of the people I worked with, it was a very upbeat fast paced job. I enjoyed helping customers find things they needed."
bad,I wouldn't ever work at this place again to save my life. The management here is awful. They want you to go above and beyond your job but don't want to give you a rise or move you to a different department. The staff here are very lazy and can care less about anyone's problems from their employees to the customers.
bad,management wasn't that friendly and if you missed work days due to illness and had doctors notes for them Walmart would not except them. they have a point system meaning if you missed days or you came in late you get a point and for the first 6 months you only get 4 or you will be terminated.
bad,"On a typical day, pallets of product were rolled out and stocked on the shelf properly. Overall, I learned the value of teamwork and hard work. Management wasn't too great. A manager should be more of a leader than a boss. Co-workers were friendly and welcoming. The harder parts of this job were the nights I was stationed in Frozen/Dairy, due to the time constraints of 15-30 minutes per cart. The more enjoyable parts of this job were the nights that no trucks were set to deliver, so that made the night much easier and relaxed, so I could focus more and work harder."
bad,Ela ajudava muito os funcuomarios era muito puxado e cansativo
bad,"I wouldnt recomend working at Walmart, if you have other options, take them. im lucky that my department has a great manager,  just cant stand working there any more"
bad,Lots of micro managing. It's take an employee to know how it feels to work there. Be prepared to wait a year to see your family when want to. Discount isn't much unless you spend hundreds. Great for a store manager not so great upon second week of work. Benefits don't count unless you're full time.
bad,"walmart is a very short term company i would say to work for "
bad,An easy job of course. the work environment is ok. Co-workers are easy to get along with but are separated in cliches or groups. Management is disorganized and not customer friendly.
bad,I didn't mind working for Walmart but we had all managers that rotated around to different stores. We didn't have many mangers that were there for very long. The money was good.
bad,Don't get proper breaks and management don't listen they refuse to move u to different departments they always say things but don't follow up on them things change then go bk to way they where before
bad,"The managers expect so much, they almost want you to work like a robot. Pay was good but other than that a terrible job. Management was awful. A nice three breaks though but that and the pay was good."
bad,The managers were not doing their job correctly and resulted in more work then the scheduled people could handle. The results of that being having to stay late and muscle pains from rushing to meet their expectations
bad,You don't get paid for calling out sick even when you have sick time available. We got in trouble for calling out during the state of emergency in the winter of 2014/2015. Policies are aweful.
bad,"Walmart has a close nit family working environment between employees but management needs to somehow come together and be on one page, there is no communication between management"
bad,work was fun... I learned that they con people into getting master cards that run up their debt and leave them asking a bunch of questions. The employees are the best part along side the customers. the hardest part of the job is lying to customers about the master card. oh and the breaks are never on time at the downs view Walmart at 3757 keele street
bad,"Walmart pays poorly and works you & expects a lot. "
bad,okay job tall pallets expected in short times not very personal more work based no time for the chit chat personally i didn't find it to be a friendly environment
bad,"Management team needs to be on the same page when it comes to disciplining workers. They need to make it a decision across the board for all employees and not just certain employees. There should never be any favorite employees at any level. The management needs to make sure that every person is held responsible. Management not always willing to work with employees for personal reasons or accommodate schedules to fit schedules for employees who are needing certain times/days off. "
bad,"Management is terrible. The hours are bad because there is never a set schedule, so having plans outside of work is never an option. They also say they will work with students, but in my experience they will work with you as long as you can continue to work night shift."
bad,"this used to be a great place to work, when it was a family run company.  It was sold off to an overseas company, all they care about is the dollar, not associates."
bad,"If you're a hard worker, you will not appreciate working at Walmart. There are plenty of people who slack off their job, and if you so much as breathe a negative word about the management you will lose your job."
bad,"Trained cashier"
bad,Learned lots about customer service and time management. Fun place to work. Would recommend to people learning and growing in the customer service pursuit.
bad,it's an ok place to work managment in some stores are horrible at what they do pay is alright if you're not planning on staying there long graveyard shift isn't too bad
bad,Worked second shift.  Was pretty busy  Enjoyed the customers and the fast paced environment  Customer Services Managers were very good but upper Management wasn't
bad,The managers on staff are a dream helpful and polite always looking out for the best interest of the employees. the hardest part of my job is listening to how much money my teams makes for the company and wrestling to live on the paycheck.
bad,"Did not enjoy this job because of the pay. Dealing with customers was very interesting at times sometimes they would be very nice other times just entitled, rude and impatient."
bad,"Carga horaria muito pesada e cansativa, exigem muito do funcionario, a direcao trabalha de maneira muito lenta e razoavel e muitas vezes existe desrespeito ao cliente (mudanca repentina na regra do cartao alimentacao)!"
bad,Walmart is great for gaining experience in a customer service environment. Perfect first job for a high school student. A job like this helps build character.
bad,"The people at walmart as far as co-workers are great...Benefits are good..Not family oriented as they use to be,,work was almost always stressed..Most of our management is transfering or leaving completely...We have lost 2 co;s a store manager and 3 assistants r transfering..Most enjoyable part of the job was the people and the team work...I have learned alot at walmart,,ordering, price changes ..Modulars and setting features and taking care of the customers..And respect for the people you work with and care for them and customers,,"
bad,"faced paced, customer oriented, rude co-workers and managers, being able to put up with rude co-workers and managers, being able to put smiles on customers faces when they receive outstanding customer service."
bad,Good for starter job and if wanting to learn management. Get a decent amount of hours to work rather part time or full time. Great sales on electronic items at times.
bad,"Walmart has a lot of favoritism which isn't fair in the work field "
bad,Never got to advance. Was gonna be a manager and never got the opportunity to do so. Pay was not good for what the company makes per year. Management was not very helpful with associates.
bad,i was part of the grand opening crew and i worked my way up to shift leader. i was a shift leader for three years and handled almost everything. after three years though i thought it was about time to find my career job.
bad,"I've been working at Wal-Mart for close to 3 years now as a part-time Associate and it has felt like a dead-end since day one. Despite working with the company for 3 solid years I still struggle to make it from paycheck to paycheck due to the fact that my scheduled hours will fluctuate almost weekly. The hours will vary based on the time of the year and general sales, so if you're in a high-traffic store, then you should be okay."
bad,"Not a bad job, just not anuff money, I need more for my family and the hours just don't work with my family's schedule and my family comes first."
bad,"This is a great starting job for a kid fresh out of high school or in high school. I definitely would not make a career out of this. It is usually a lot of physical labor for not a whole lot of pay. Although this was about 3 years ago when I worked there, and i've heard pay has increased a little bit."
bad,Wal mart was a nice place for me when i was able to work and left alone by the management. Management gets involved in things and tells associates to do things knowing that most associates have not been trained right. Every time there is a visiting manager disappointed with something management will throw those same associates under the bus and coach them. It was very discouraging for me as one the hardest workers in the store to witness that and even be a victim of it myself. Wal mart as a company talks a good game but does not have enough oversight to enforce things at a store level.
bad,"I worked hard no matter the mood I was in, I enjoyed helping each customer as they were a close friend. No matter the question I seemed to always have an answer. I worked hard and was rewarded with a higher position and I always challenged myself no matter what."
bad,"A day at work was long and usually pieced together with Managers from other departments taking you from your work and putting you somewhere else, only to have you reprimanded for leaving your workstations."
bad,"Pros"
bad,"2-11"
bad,"typical day started with zoning dept. and replenishing stock, checking for price changes. Had minimal experience in retail but learned very quickly the ins and outs of retail. There was a change in management from friendly to cold and distant. For the most part co-workers were very enjoyable to work with. The hardest part was the lack of merchandise available in store. The most enjoyable part was in helping customers who had questions on products or were unfamiliar with what they needed."
bad,"Self paced on the most part of the job except for the unloading part of the job, that has to be done in 4 hours This is the job i learned to stack pallets co workers where great. managers not so great dont have good people skills, and they dont know how to talk to people in a professional way"
bad,"Typical day at work is busy which is great, I learned management skills, very physically demanding. The enjoyable part of the job is the customers."
bad,"Walmart was my first job. I just graduated high school, and was determined to work. The enjoyable part was the convenient discount. I did not enjoy standing for long periods of time. The coworkers were a pretty good staff to work with. I only met with management one time, which was when I first got hired. This job taught me to have great customer service, how to handle money, and train others."
bad,"Typical day of work is taking care of the customers and cashiers.  Making sure everything is running smoothly for all the tills and customer service desk."
bad,"messed up hours, low pay, when they open a new store they say they are putting so many people to work but when the store opens and starts to operate they let people go and only keep just enough people to run the store."
bad,"Wal-mart is one of those companies that think they have their system in check when really they do not. I was working on the floor and was suppose to be the mid-day/night ""closer's"", but I can recall many of times where when I came they wanted me to finish the morning shifts job, be on the phone, and run a register, while I also got my department zoned be they end of my shift. To be honest they can have some of the most rude managers and can also have some of the nicest managers. I feel like they never really had enough people in each department. On the other note they had really good benefits."
bad,"The pay and hours were unacceptable, since the pay was low it seem the workers didn't too much care about their job and we had a lot of lazy workers."
bad,"coming to work was esciting because of the people i worked with. management was bad, they were never on the same page and the treat their employees bad."
bad,I worked long hours and late nights. I learned more about the cashier. The management was terrible and helpful. I rarely interact with the co workers. The hardest part was standing on my feet for long hours. I enjoyed my checks.
bad,"Everything about walmart was terrible, would get referrals from other employees and managers and still get denied a promotion unless you kissed up to the highers up who stand around talking on their cellphones acting like they work when really you see them talking to their family about what they'll be eating for dinner or how the day is going so slow during their work hours they do all this. Most of the other eomplyees arent too shabby, nice people who try to help when possible, extremely low pay when i worked lowest allowed by federal law."
bad,I enjoy the customer service portion of my job. Be nice to the customers and they will repay with compliments to management.
bad,"I loved my co-workers.. Great set of people to work with. Management fell short in their responsibilities taking care of the associates, making them feel valued. Taking care of customers and seeing how satisfied you made them, was very rewarding in it's self."
bad,Wasnt So Great Working At Walmart I Really Dint Fit In At Walmart The People Whom I worked With And The Bosses They Where All Jerks And I Have Had Bad Exsperiences With Some Of The Bosses At Walmart Just Because I Took My Job Seriously.
bad,Overall its a good job until you are able to secure something else. I like the hours per week and the friendly people I worked with. However I grew increasingly frustrated with the lack of competent management.
bad,"this is not right to ask these questions now or in the future"
bad,Management was terrible about playing favorites. The company doesn't care about their employees. Too many chiefs not enough Indians kind of thing
bad,"I learned to value customers, also I learned to be very efficient with my occupation. The management team do not necessarily follow one's availability. the co-workers are amazing, the most enjoyable part of working at Walmart would be the discount given."
bad,"It's okay. Just stay on your toes, do your work, ask questions if needed and you will be just fine. Nothing much more to say."
bad,"I would NOT recommend working here. Wal-mart itself is a great company, but this particular facility is TERRIBLE. They will draw you in with it being a foot in the door at Home Office, then refuse to promote you after hitting your year. Management is not to be trusted and they do not care about their jobs. They will micromanage you fire you just because they don't like you and give you no notice. The compliance and ethics are ridiculous and so detailed that they are impossible to follow. This is the most corrupted place I've ever worked for. DO NOT WORK HERE."
bad,"they got ride of all the people who do work so then the others quit now only bad workers now work there, don't work with you at all and now they do bad jobs on cars every day."
bad,"I would say this was one of the least enjoyable positions I had. only because I felt unnoticed everyday that I came in to work. I felt as if I clocked in and was just another machine in the building. THIS IS NOT ALWAYS A BAD THING, especially if you prefer to just do your job and go home. The hardest part of this job is getting hours and the most enjoyable part was the customers."
bad,"Management was not very friendly while I worked there. My job did allow me to work at my own pace and get things done in a timely manner, however, the pay was not very good."
bad,"poor hours, treated workers really bad, low pay, mean customers, it wasn't my cup of tea, I really don't what else to say about this at all. or why I have to do this"
bad,"Day to day we get worked and dogged really hard, unloading the truck. Expected to do our share and some of overnight's, which was insane. I worked three different positions and learned quite a bit on how a functioning company is intended to work, and picked up some good tricks for customer service. Management at my Walmart was 50/50, the good half of managers would work much harder than a standard associate, which was great, they were the leaders. The other half were very iffy, they wouldn't communicate what they were doing if it effected someone elses work, and always treated what they wanted to get done as priority #1 and demanded other busy associates to come help them instead. The co-workers there were more like 80/20. 80% being slow, ignorant people who would stop working to talk if the opportunity showed itself (which it did very often). 20% were reliable and hard workers, even if they're personality was bad. The job was never really hard, mostly just frustrating. If I had to say what the hardest thing about working there was, It would be when they terminated my original position of day stocker and moved me to be a truck unloader."
bad,"We would bring inventory from storage rooms, replenish and organize shelves in the store."
bad,"They are a good company to work for but they don't train the staff well. There are a lot of different issues that walmart has. I just hope they will start treating there staff better,"
bad,Just out for themselves not the workers. You're just a number to them and not a person. If you have a medical condition they don't care therefore if you're sick you better come in anyway or else your attendance will suffer and out the door you go.
bad,"The managment has not seemed to care for the associates, and treats others better then everyone else.  They don't give you time off when you request it even if it is months in advanced. ."
bad,"I am a customer service manager at Walmart. My typical day starts by taking care of the front end schedule and following up the cashiers, store greeters, and store standard associates about their meal breaks, Walmart MasterCard application sales, and maintaining the cash flows of the cash registers."
bad,this job was okay they had horrible customer service they gave the customers attitudes and always made a mistake on the orders they gave out
bad,"Wal-Mart is a great company with great benefits. To the point. You must be physically and mentally strong. in order to make it a career. the managers are all on different pages, each one wants something different. there is so much to be done that it is impossible to get done. management has no respect for the individual. They do not respect family time its all about walmart to the walmart management team."
bad,Hardest part of the job is dealing with the miscommunication of the management team they can have you running around like a chicken without a head because of misdirection and doing the same task multiple  times until it's done right way it should've been done the first time. You do run into some good people in the company who truly believes in Sam Walton's dream unfortunately the company is getting  further and further from him vision at least for the associates. Great from the customer aspect. Save money live better.
bad,"i did love working there as the people become a great big family, unfortunately at least at my store, the managment was poor and there was no opportunity for growth. they would get mad at you for overtime, and cut your hours to ""make up for it"" and it really just was about the money for them."
bad,"- Stocking and cleaning up"
bad,"Unless you find yourself lucky you will not get any support from management. Also you will always be held accountable even if you aren't at fault. If you can find your way into a clique you can climb the higher in management, but you have to kill yourself nto get there and you have to do a lot of sucking up, and deal with tons of stress and pressure."
bad,Managers treated employees like gum on the bottom of their shoe.  The harder people worked the more they would take advantage of.  When someone asked for a day off they would work hard to make sure they worked.
bad,"The job itself was a pretty interesting job, a lot of different aspects to it. However nothing was ever effectively explained or taught so the extremely long 12 week training you go through doesn't even prepare you for actually doing your job. They stress being able to adapt to change but it's not change, it's inconsistency and unorganization. The managers are ok I guess, you deal with a lot of different people never really knowing who to report to. Their culture is BS. All they care about is what you do for the company, not you or your needs as a person or employee. Not understanding at all. Feel like you definitely have to fend for yourself most of the time but then it's times where they are micromanaging you. You don't always have work but you are expected to look like you have work. Co-workers are cool if you started with them but others act like they are better than you because they've been there longer and know more. It is easy to get in touch with higher ups and I guess that's good but wouldn't matter. I learned a lot of different processes and systems."
bad,Management was never ontop of there employees. The are constantly yelled at instead of talked to. They pick and choose there favorite employees.Walmart doesn't care about the health of someone. They treat everyone like they are nothing. It really breaks my heart.
bad,Working conditions hinder production. I would advise working during winter. Summer the heat is unbearable
bad,you come in and go about your duty's the only issues I've had were nosy co-workers and managements cry's for help. pay was nice but such a stressful place
bad,it was an okay place to work had to many bosses not enough workers. they dnt d there people right. they are rude t there custmers most f the time
bad,Works great for me at times but the work hours  was not good because when you take the bus and I miss it no way home but love the job
bad,"Hectic, busy work day. Time goes by way too fast. However, lucky to get 15-30 minute lunch every day, no breaks. I loved the job there but had too many immature young girls who would rather fight than work which made the entire staff look unprofessional. Never got off at scheduled times.  Certain people got off early every day while the rest of us put in some serious overtime.  Manager has favorite picks. Their checkpoint setup which helps keep errors minimal is fantastic.  Prescriptions are checked numerous times before going to patient. The lady pharmacist is very helpful in teaching you and guiding you.  Very strict environment, no food, drinks, phones etc allowed. Lockers are located in back of store for your personal items"
bad,"Loved work at first, loved the pay, but they had the cap team 2 members working almost every where. Our job was to unload trucks in 2 hours no matter the size, separate the freight and stock it, but most of the time I worked there we was short staffed.Then they would send us to push carts and still expect us to get the trucks done in 2 hours,sometimes 2 big trucks,then wrote us up if we couldn't meet that expectation.Plus management was horrible.My Supervisor broke all kinds of rule,flirting with every girl in the store,played favoritism a lot, told other management I was the worst worker, he targeted me most of my time there.He made me make bales almost everyday instead of unload the truck,and whenever another department needed somebody, I was always sent away,then when Hurt my ankle n developed a limp, i was treated like junk.They told me they knew i was faking n threatened to fire me.I wouldn't recommend"
bad,"My time working for Wal-Mart was not enjoyable. The hours were in stable and management was hard to work with. It was impossible to get time off, I had to work the day of my father's wedding or risk being fired, I requested the day off five weeks in advance."
bad,"The workplace was very racial, and did not enjoy working there. The workers there were very lazy, and did not care about the customers, or other associates."
bad,"most days uneventful"
bad,Work is of similar nature everyday. Not much advancement opportunity. One can have frequent breaks. it is good place for the people who wants to spent a day without much effort and not much skills required. No advancement opportunity as far as possible we can see same people in same position for long period of time.
bad,la admistracion a nivel nacional es mala porque la compañia en si es muy buena .
bad,Sandusky Wal-Mart is always changing their store manager as the store performed very poorly.  The benefits when I was there were very weak and would hire no call no shows back after being terminated just 6 months prior.  Management was worked hard which made conversations feel rushed and they quickly became annoyed at everyone.
bad,Pay sucks. Benefits suck. Employees are always in a hurry. Management only comes around to complain usually. The only good experiences I had were a one hour lunch and leaving. I brought in a good work ethic and good attitude and left bothered.
bad,I really enjoyed working at walmart but i didn't have breaks like that . And my boss use too get very upset with me when i didn't want to come in on my off days.
bad,"i liked my co-workers, it was just the part-time hrs and low pay and always odd shifts. the cons could be the hrs work, they change your shift and not tell you."
bad,I did not have as much fun as I had at Domino's however some of the staff had actually cheered me up when I was down but I felt mistreated at times and uncomfortable.
bad,I really didn't like Walmart. The Walmart I worked at was great at first. It wasn't until they went under new management it turned unpleasant.
bad,"Employee morale is low. You are assigned to a task, called away to do something else. Neither task will be able to be completed. This is how the day goes. Hrs are constantly being reduced. Work week can be as low as 29 hrs."
bad,"One assistant manager I like, I enjoy my day so much better whenever he is working. I got to work with him today, and I enjoy what little time I have working with him."
bad,"falta de humanidad por parte de altos mandos, trabajo repetitivo, sueldo bajo"
bad,"Some CSM's (customer service managers) and regular managers abuse their power. The CSM never remember where they came from and it is always good to keep in mind that you were once a regular employee. They act as if they are superior and don't have to work. They also do anything by any means necessary to keep their jobs, like lie on another employee."
bad,"I would not recommend anyone to work here, they don't care about their employees just how much money they make. They treat you like your nothing and pay you poorly."
bad,Enjoyed working with public. Co-workers were alright to deal with. I just did not enjoy working late night shifts and having to travel late at night by myself.
bad,"Great people to work with. Immediate management typically OK. However, the higher up the management, the more insignificant you are made to feel."
bad,"If you have young kids and like to go to their activities, it is a rough place to work. Closed only for Christmas."
bad,I didnt care to work at walmart. I was rushed around to make sure that I wouldnt get over the hours that I was scheduled (even if they had me stay to help in the first place). I didnt enjoy the customer interaction because the majority of them were rude.
bad,"They offer a good pay, but don't care about you at all. I would wake up and think, ""I hate everything about this place."" Managers don't care what everyone thinks about the individual person."
bad,"A typical day in the life of a Wal-Mart associate can be stressful.  Wal-Mart is the largest retailer in the world.  Depending on the location you work in, some management teams actually do teach and train their associates.  Others do not.  I learned a lot of things from a lot of good people, but for the most part, I learned majority on my own.  The hardest part of the job is the work-life balance is not good."
bad,schedule was very ok management was rarely around to guide never had any training and had us working in metal boxes in extreme heat with no water or any breaks counting thousands of merchandise
bad,"Desborde de llamadas todos los días, en ocasiones no tenias tiempo ni para salir a comer, la comunicación con los jefes directos pesima"
bad,This would be good for a first time job but as far as something long term i would keep looking the company does not give benefits and it is really hard to move up its alot of favorites in the company
bad,good company to work for!!!!!!! many many many opportunities to advance your career with Walmart. the management is overall good to work with.
bad,"I have work for walmart for 2.5 years now as a cashier, the management at my store is iffy depending on who you talked to."
bad,The management want you to be superhuman. It mundane and tedious. there was basically no training. The hardest part is making the unreal times they have set for you. the most enjoyable part of the job will probably be your coworkers who all understand you and feel the struggle.
bad,"My experiences here taught me what I do not want to do - work for Walmart. Its better than fast food, that is pretty much all that can be said for it."
bad,Learn the registar in one day easy job not enough hours to make a decent paying job not enough hours not enough hours a week not enough hours a week would be a good job but no hours
bad,"Sorting receiving boxes, stocking in dairy department, customer service and inventory. Assisting managers with their seasonal projects."
bad,"They have taken our sick time away, are making us work a lot of over time, and they cant seem to keep any one working for them anymore. I used to love coming to work but now a days its dreadful. If the company's leadership team would become more ""for the associate"" like they used to be then I think they would have a much easier time keeping their associates working for them. Walmart has become very greedy."
bad,They underpay and over work their workers. Their is no room for growth. It is a revolving door. There is nothing positive that I  can say about Walmart
bad,They really do not care about employees of any color or if you work hard. They really have their values backwards. It is sad  that it only gets worse every year.
bad,its an ok job for now. definitely not for the long run. ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
bad,very awful place to work for and very unsafe as well ! the employes wouldnt help train or work as a whole ! very unsafe with no structure !
bad,The difference between the store I worked at in Cincinnati and the one in Florida was huge! I had a $4 an hours pay cut. I was also not able to go into the Management Position I had before.
bad,Walmart is the physical embodiment of a company you see in the movies that is overtly greedy and cares about one thing... Profit. Regardless what they do or say they do not care about their employees. They should have a livable wage but instead they let their workers rely on government programs and assistance to feed their families. I would not recommend to work for this company.
bad,"Assisting customers with purchasing and any questions they may have. Making conversation with them as your are checking them out. Cleaning station area when you are not busy with customers. Sometimes helping to put merchandise back in there departments."
bad,Walmart was a great job for me also. I was a cashier and worked on the floor at times. The Walmart i worked at was the location in panorama city witch is known for many customers coming in with attitudes and such so everyday i went in to work i made sure i tried to make every customer i encountered in smile.
bad,"I was simply a cashier. No room for advancement.. The customers were usually pretty nice and friendly. I enjoyed most of my co-workers, and still have contact with them.; The hardest part of the job was standing for so long, no raise."
bad,The immediate management were great.  Upper management okay.   They need to pay their employees better wages.  i left because not much room for wage increases.  I did make a few friends there.
bad,"i learned how to stock , and run a store , make friends , talk to people.the hardest part of the job was working 3rd shift , the most enjoyable part of the job was the people i worked with ."
bad,Everyday is a new battle. Supervisors are very unknowledgeable and customers are usually rude. Supervisors and managers are always breathing down your neck and constantly nag
bad,if you are working here you can not get a second job because they want to schedule you in the middle of the day say 10:30-7 or 11:30-8 also you do not get paid for holidays anymore no over pay can not earn any overtime and also some of the management does not care to help you with the problems you have you have to deal with it yourself and are almost always on vacation.
bad,Typical day was most of the coworkers were tired because we were always short staffed. Lunches were put in hold most of the time. management was understandable for the most part. Hardest part was satisfying every customer because I handled returns. The enjoyable part was lunch they always had snacks in the back.
bad,"A typical day at work would only consist of one thing, pushing buggies in the corals, and cleaning up the parking lot. The hardest part of the job was being out in the heat pushing in buggies."
bad,"stocking and unloading trucks."
bad,It was a good place to work for a starter job. I wouldn't consider it for a career place. It was so long ago I can not recall specific details about co-workers and management
bad,"Come in, then line up the shopping carts then rearrange items to go in their designated area. Then start ringing up customers."
bad,"I worked my hindquarters off every night for my night managers, and I took on a heavier workload than the majority of others there at times. All we ever heard was ""you aren't working fast enough"" or ""you aren't getting enough done"". I worked there for nearly six months and not much changed. I wouldn't work there again."
bad,Worked here for a few years. Management treated most employees terribly. I will never work for this company again. The pay for my job was not very good for what my job entailed.
bad,I really liked to work there but too much politics! If you didn't quite fit in then you were the outcast. I believe that it was only that way at the store I worked at. I can't believe all Wal-marts are like that.
bad,"Not enough people to cover all store areas due to lack of organizational skills by managers.  Assistant managers take it out on customer service managers, and they take it out on store associates. Easy fix, no solution."
bad,"I had to do mod  stocker and run a register. I learn how to do lot of thing like shipping and receiving items. I love my co works they made you day easy"
bad,"The job itself wasn't bad, but you would be a ""part time"" employee but would receive full time hours. was that way so they didn't have to offer you health benefits."
bad,"You don't mater to them, and they let you know it. You sometimes are scheduled to work a weekend by yourself and you are expected to keep the parking lot clean. The scorching Texas heat be damned you need to do it all, you only get 1 lunch and 2 15 minute breaks, if you find yourself dizzy, tired or short of breath, and you try to sit down for a bit too bad you will get written up. it was a struggle to have them allow me to wear a hat to protect me from the sun and it was even harder at first to try and get them to provide sunblock to protect my skin from the sun i was being exposed to for 8 hours at a time."
bad,"Management has no idea what it's doing "
bad,"I would not go back to working at Walmart. Although not everyone was bad, I did not get along with a few of the cashiers and the management was a mess. I did not have a great time here. My customers were the highlights of my day and I worked in health and beauty as the makeup cashier."
bad,"Working there is good as a first time job, but you cant support yourself on the salary they offer you. You work long hours deal with mostly bad customers and the pay overall is not worth the time and effort."
bad,"A typical day at work was mostly boring, but when there was work to be done it went by fast and the work was not difficult. I learned a couple of things about cars that I used to help myself and others which was probably the best thing about working there."
bad,was a good company to work for I liked the people I liked the people I like the money the money was the best ill go back for the money all.
bad,"The Walmart I worked at in Short Pump, VA has terrible management, and very strict rules for no reason. glad this was just a summer job"
bad,",the management needs some help they don't talk to you they talk at you. the co workers I worked with were very nice the hardest part of the job was tryin to get somebody from management to answermy questions. themost enjoyable part of the job was havin some were to go each day."
bad,This location was wonderful to work at but management skills needed more help. i would rather work under Walmart old terms than the ones they have now.
bad,"It's a pretty good job to work. There is no balance in life and work, you get random days off and your hours are always different, just trying to find something better with set days off and set hours and a job that pays more. The job itself is pretty good, co workers are good but management treats you like your nothing to them and just walk all over you, typical day at work is alright when you go there and they give you no sense of direction and they don't give you any tasks to do and they ask why aren't you doing anything, you then tell management they never give me tasks to do and they then get bent all out of shape and throw you in another department that you have no knowledge and say learn, when you know that managers don't know the department either or they'll throw you up to cashier and then leave no one in the department to help customers or answer phones, happens I can 24/7, Walmart may be nice to shop at but behind curtains it's a whole another world, only most enjoyable part of the job is learning your department and meeting new people, that's it. Other than that Walmart is a good beginners job, not a career."
bad,"This company really doesn't care much for its ""associates"" only about the money you're making for them. If you're sick or not feeling well they will basically threaten your job if you ask to leave your shift early. They have a very unfair and unrealistic point system for attendance and the management doesn't take the time to get to know their employees at all."
bad,une expérience d'un travail d'entrepôt dans une ambiance instable avec constamment des nouveaux à former qui quittent pour trouver mieux.
bad,"Walmart is Walmart what more can i say, they don't care about the co-workers. Expect you to bend over backwards for $9.00. I'm a hard worker i love what i do and whatever I'm doing as long as I'm providing shelter and food for my son. I don't mine cleaning bathrooms even if its not in my job description, But having management who don't know anything or care pretty much sucks. No good health coverage and they don't work around your schedule even if you have children."
bad,"Didn't really like working there, management sucked. I enjoyed the customers but that's all. Hardest part was staying in one spot all day while working."
bad,"most nights start in a meeting of working on thing that were not done the night before. in all my years patience is probably what ive learned the most. the management is probably the worst quality of Walmart, most of the time your being yelled at or berated for something you have been told by another manager to accomplish. lack of communication. the hardest part of the job is definitely deciding between which boss has the higher pay grade and follow the chain of command to a tee. the most enjoyable aspect was definitely the associates. every night could be fun when working around the right people."
bad,I feel as if its a day to day worry of job security all staff is not treated equal and you do not have a lot of team players that are always there to help you.
bad,"To be quick, and blunt for anyone looking for an honest review.  Walmart is just a job, not a career, how some people can work there for as long as they have, I'll never understand.  I've been an associate for the past two years now and everyday gets more and more difficult. There is: never enough staff, very few people are properly trained, no associates want to help anyone, and no one smiles.  On top of that, the benefits aren't great. The ""supposed highest retail pay"" still isn't high enough to be a living wage. And as an associate, you are treated like a cog in a machine. You get a number, very little effort on the part of management goes into understanding who you are and what you need as a human being with different needs and aspirations.  You get an hour for lunch, it hurts more than it helps. it's a ploy to keep you at work for longer than you should be. Honestly, there is very little that is good to say about Walmart.  The only ever upside I've ever experienced is getting a moment to yourself, being able to breathe for a moment without a frustrated customer, co worker, or manager in constant need of assistance."
bad,this is a job and thats all it is. they want to promote mc and that is it. it is a low wage job with basically no hope of anything better. the only way up is out
bad,"es linda la empresa,pero los directivos y gerentes no saben separar la amistad del tabajo  (valoran a sus amistades) antes que al empleado q cumple"
bad,"Managers hound you when you're already in the middle of trying to do something on the floor, your availability hours aren't respected; cashiers get called in the middle of their high school classes, people get scheduled outside of their listed availability, such as during school."
bad,"Un dia alli era atender al cliente y buen trato tanto de compañeros como de superiores, aprendi cosas que no sabia como manejo de maquinas y lo que te deja la amabilidad con la gente."
bad,"The job was easy, the people were kind, but they never had enough hands on deck and it caused an uncomfortable, stressful atmosphere. Things were chaotic and unorganized."
bad,A day at Walmart is very challenging. I learned patience. Management  needs improvement. The hardest part of working there is dealing with uncompromising and difficult customers. The most enjoyable part was the bonuses every 3 months
bad,A typical day is a bit of a rush with all of the customers. The managers are easy to talk to if you have an issue at hand. The locations are 24 hours more convenient for the customers.
bad,"I feel that Walmart could be a great place to work with the proper management."
bad,"Nothing is organized, and the manager's barely knew how to help. You have a 50/50 chance if your coworkers were awesome or not."
bad,"La relación que tengas dentro de la empresa tiene mucho que ver con las personas a las que les llegues a hablar y como se desarrollen las circunstancias, así como el área donde te toque laborar o la paga."
bad,"Extremely hard for a first retail job. Over the top expectations, low wages. Lots of back injuries. Not to mention the abusive customers."
bad,"i liked that my family could come visit me and enjoy lunch in the break room with me"
bad,I perform a variety of tasks at work that vary from day to day.  I manage employees duties & assignments for the day.  I fill in where needed to allow employees their breaks and lunches.  I count cash drawers at the end of employee shifts & prepare for next manager to take over.
bad,"Walmart is ok to work for the new corporate office have no idea how to run a store but they are happy to sit in their offices and go over there projections with out having the knowledge of what is needed at the store front, When Walmart first came to people it was a great store now all the good things about working for then having gotten los/. keeping your employees happy means more productiv8ty more money to be made but companies now only care about the bottom line and not their employees. only that their is a warm body to fil a position and not care how the work is being done."
bad,"The Walmart I worked at had management that was unavailable, and unhelpful most of the time. The equipment was also broken, dated, and malfunctioned, which greatly reduced work productivity, and customer service."
bad,"Its very hard labor for very little pay. You will be guaranteed the hours you are scheduled so thats a solid positive. The management only comes down hard on its associates because someone is coming down hard on them. Dont take it personal, its a job like any other. Remember its a job not a career. So get in and take from it what you can."
bad,"I worked the overnight shift"
bad,"unloading goods,stocking the shelves checking outdated food, helping customers find what they need,cashier,customer service,working as a team to get the job done,part-time job"
bad,"Have no life/work balance should  you decide to work here. You have to have great mind stability in order to work here. There is a lot of information to gather and make sure that you are familiar with. It will be fast paced,but you must remember that it is a learning process and will take practice to become better at your job."
bad,"I did not enjoy my time at Wal-Mart my very first job. I was overworked for a part timer, I worked more than forty hours a week. I would reccommend this as a summer job but not as a job while going to school. I was told they would not work with my school schedule at all and thus had to terminate my employment."
bad,I was excited at first to be working for Walmart at first but when I started it turned sour. first my supervisors over me was showed no respect for their workers. they never respected day off request would just deny them. There was a lot of drama from supervisors also. They talk about sam Walton being about family and respect but they don't enforce it with their workers.
bad,A typical day at work: Working hard and having all you've done to show for it.  What you learned:  Stocking shelves/Bar code identification/Department areas/Customer Service.  Management:  Being a leader to the team leaders guiding them to the right track of learning to do their jobs the correct way.  The hardest part of the job was finishing-up and putting everything away.  The most enjoyable part of the job: Having that good feeling of accomplishment after a hard days work.
bad,"This was my first job that I have ever had and I only worked there unloading the trucks, stocking the shelves in the toy department, and cleaning up the floors before having to move away and leave the job. I had to learn how to talk to customers and help them with whatever they needed. I used a pilot jack everyday to unload trucks."
bad,"every night was repetitive as the last, I learned to multi task how to get my work done in a respectable manner time. Management was okay. Hardest part working outside in bad weather."
bad,"They typical day at Walmart would be to provide customer service, merchandise, and pinpoint areas for profit losses and adjust accordingly. I learned a lot about the inner workings of retail, and got a better understanding of company financials and trends. As a salaried member of management, the expectation is that you are at work everyday including off days with no real compensation. On the off chance of an illness, upper management shows no concern for the health or wellbeing of the associate and strongly suggests that if one is not on their deathbed, they should be at work (this is to include scheduled off days). The hardest part about my job at Walmart is working between 10 and 20 hours a day, spending a few hours resting at home only to do it again the next day. I really enjoy the bond created when working towards a common goal with others while teaching and training."
bad,"While working at walmart, i felt like i wasn't important because I wasn't a salaried employee. The hours were great but overall the company should put more effort into their employees."
bad,"no one knows which way is in or out or up and down. What a mess and a shame abut this company.I wouldnt advise working here, I did enjoy the doctor I worked with there, One of my best memories"
bad,"Not a very pleasant place to work, 8 times out off 10 the customers were nice, Managers always took the customers side I was full time I didn't get enough hours always got 36 or 38 hours."
bad,"A typical day at work was cleaning and maintaining store neatness, while taking products to their designated area. Management was poorly managing their employees, I learned how to operate certain machines such as a buffer, scrubber, and a fork lift."
bad,Wal-mart is not a great place to work at. Now the co-workers I was working were great. It's the managers at my old store were a joke. They would never support you on anything.
bad,"Working at Wal-mart felt like a battle every day. The store was constantly understaffed so each associate's workload was far greater than it was supposed to be. There were zero third shift IMS associates at the time I had left because they moved their only one to another position, shoving the duties of third shift onto first. Of the fifty or so Telxon scanners in the store only about ten were available at any one time because associates would hide them around the store and in locked lockers or lose them completely, most pallet jacks were broken and there were often times we did not have enough to properly do our jobs and many carts had missing handles or damaged wheels. Many associates were thrown around to pick up slack and schedules were incredibly unpredictable, giving you almost no time to plan for necessary things like doctors appointments. Many customers were rude and disrespectful and associates were threatened with loss of job for not staying late to finish other peoples' work while simultaneously being told if they went over-time they would be fired. Most co-workers were friendly, though many were lazy and one even hid in the corner of the store to avoid doing work on several occasions. The Manager and Assistant Managers ranged from pleasant to extremely disgruntled and many refused to actually send help to finish urgent projects, like unloading a truck in 45 minutes because two drivers decided to dock at the same time and a third was on the way, despite telling the workers it was urgent. The entire store disliked the head Manager because when he was around almost no"
bad,"The particular Walmart  I worked at was the best Walmart in that district. The managers are horrible and rude.  The store manager was best friend with the shift leader and when the shift leader disrespected anyone even putting his hand on someone, the store manager would turn a blind eye. I really didn't like working there, everyday was a horrible day but got to pay the bills."
bad,"Horrible company"
bad,processing claims and assisting members with aspect if medicare and their plans. the company is horrible and the staff doesnt fall short .
bad,Walmart was an okay experience they treated us like we didn't mean anything to them but working in the jewelry department was great bc of my managers
bad,Walmart was a great company to work for for a student and recent high school grads. i just wouldn't make it a lifetime career
bad,Employees friendly and helpful mostly.   Older employees especially the long term cashiers not so friendly.  Some managers fantastic but some not so as when I needed emergency family time off it was ok with some but not with my immediate manager. Had to get someone to cover hours myself and really I needed to just go.   This sale of walmart credit cards is stressing out the employees. But most of all our customers.  Too aggressive. Must b a lot of kick back in it for someone???
bad,The managerial staff was very unorganized. Co-workers often refrained from completing assigned tasks. The hardest part of the day was trying to acquire direction from the manager-they were often disengaged.
bad,Ok not a fan of retail no set time to work low hours most all have to stay late with no type of notice. People can be a pain to deal with put up with a lot of disrespect.
bad,Walmart doesn't pay well unless you have been there a few years and move up in the company.The scheduling is made three weeks in advance so if you have appointments that occur on short notice it will not work.
bad,Managers always wanted me to do a job that was not mine like go to HBA and work in HBA but I was an electronic associate and knew nothing about HBA and couldn't really help customers. It was like I rarely was ever in electronics but always somewhere else in the store because they put me in just about every department
bad,"This is a very good place to work, but if you don;t kiss but and smile at the right people you will not make it All the company wants to do is make money, they do not care about anyone unless you are in management. Have the time they don;t even know your name"
bad,"There are no surprises when signing up to work here. They don't treat people well, and the don't pay particularly well. Those who have tenure with the company share the opinion that it used to be better, but those that came later and newer hires agree that it leaves a lot to be desired."
bad,Typical day is sitting in front of a computer looking at blue walls and blue cubicles. I did not enjoy the lack of fenestration and character of the many sad faced employees currently working there.
bad,The company allowed people to make their own hours and I also enjoyed the weekly pay. Unfortunately this wasn't a company that rewarded people for hard work. Often people still new to the company and its procedures would be promoted to manager positions within months which felt unfulfilling for other hardworking employees.
bad,Honestly in a tough spot Walmart isn't a bad choice they do promote internal growth however their quality in which they treat their employees is to be desired. My personal experience wasn't the worst however i wouldn't suggest viewing it as a career choice.
bad,"typical work day was alright"
bad,low class employees and managers. not very clean environment. supervision is minimal.  there was no real incentives and managers didn't seem to care.
bad,good for starting out retail.not a bad first job. benefits and pay could be better. Opportunities to move up in company.
bad,Simply put after a long time with the company I still make less than what many other companies consider a starting wage.  Our insurance covers less and less and has become nothing more than major medical.
bad,work was not bad but if you were a good worker you would be given more work in many cases completing or assisting the workers that were bad with little or no consequence for the poor work and no gain for good work by management
bad,"loved working as a loss prevention specialist, felts like I was making a difference in the peoples live that were caught and definitely made a huge impact on the stores profit and loss."
bad,besides doing a simple cashier job the management and lies that where spread and screaming at other employees behind closed doors was a very hostile environment.
bad,"Would recommend as a seasonal or part time job but would not recommend to lie on as a good source of income."
bad,"I was a cashier at Walmart and the only things that was good about it was my coworkers, which made the overall experience well. Also I had regular customers that would actively seek me out that made cashiering enjoyable."
bad,Walmart Neighborhood market wasn't my favorite place to work but I met some great people and had great experiences as well. I did enjoy working overnight because I'm one of those people who tend to stay up till the morning.
bad,work expectations are too high for the money paid. slave labor. company lines the pockets of high income employees and forgets about the people who actually meet the customers
bad,"I Didn't Really Enjoy This Environment, The Fact That They Were Under Staffed And The Management Was Horrible. The First Week I Was There I Practically Had To Learn How To Do The Work On My Own. There Was Not Really Any Kind Of Training. It Was A Bad Experience."
bad,"The only good thing about this job is the co-workers and when it's time to go home.The management is terrible,your just a # and your opinion doesn't mean nothing,even after being with the company for a long period.And no matter what you do,they give you the feeling that it's not good enough.And the hardest part of the job is just making it through the day."
bad,"Walmart Logistics is known for being full time only and to start you off at a good pay however, they work you to death there and have ridiculous production requirements. The management acts and looks professional however they have an agenda and they only care about meeting numbers. You feel like a number at walmart and not a valued employee, its no issue for them to fire everyone then hire all new people as long as they work. Managers are shady and go behind your back, its a very clique like environment."
bad,"The management in Walmart is very unprofessional, people take things into the matters of their own. which is not good for business. but over all  its okay until you find better"
bad,it was ok I learn a lot about kids in the way they act around each other it taught me how to take my time and listen to the children
bad,"Wal-mart was a very difficult place to work. I originally applied there because I enjoy working with customers, but the pressure was soon on to me. The pressure related to the Walmart Rewards master Card was a bit too much to handle. They push the whole ""selling"" factor too hard, even on those who aren't very assertive sellers. That, combined with the difficult to work with managers, the overly fluctuating hours and the difficult trek across the city, I chose to leave after only 4 months."
bad,I have learned alot how about types of oil and learning about new cars. Some coworkers i get along with. The hardest part of the job is people not want to work as a team. I love help customers out and providing good customer services.
bad,unm dia típico darle la mejor atención al cliente dejarlo satisfecho lo Q ma me gusto pues fue la atención al cliente mis colegas buenos colegas de trabajo eficaces
bad,Somos capaces de realizar las tareas programadas pero no es necesario sobre-valorar nuestro rendimiento fisico
bad,"Em resumo era uma empresa com uma cultura muito boa e admirável na teoria, pois na pratica nada funcionava e a gerencia não agradava a equipe."
bad,I  really enjoyed working for Walmart. Wish the jobs lasted longer I learned a lot and enjoyed my time there management was nice.
bad,A Typical day here was learning to ignore little problems and always focus on what's important. And that was always the customers who looked up to you for the help and guidance you can provide.
bad,the only good thing about working at Walmart is the free wifi. that pretty much is it. made some really good friends as well
bad,It's hard to enjoy working someplace where you have five different supervisors and each one is yelling at you because bread isn't proofing fast enough. To legitimately feel that your job is in jeopardy over something that is beyond your control is an awful thing to deal with on a daily basis.
bad,"management was awful, the job its self was very easy and my cow workers was great to work with just seemed that management would do anything its there power to make you have a awful night."
bad,Walmart Distribution has so many bugs to iron out.  Continuous system failure with too much non-productivity.  This made it difficulty to reach nightly percentages.  Still somewhat disorganized
bad,"The pay is poor but you have a lot of opportunity to advance. Most people don't make it that far though because they are run off due to under staffing, being treated poorly, and being ignored by management. If you do report them to corporate they retaliate and usually end up firing you. I've been there for years and I see it all the time."
bad,As long as you are agreeing with whatever manager you work for then you will do great. When you start to question things being done then you have problems.
bad,"A typical day in the Deli, cut meat and cheese and serve customers hot lunch plate. cook food and clean as dishes  as needed. making sure customers are happy"
bad,"Although most people who work at walmart are good people, they are just not given the right tools to do their jobs effectively. And the management has little to no power unless you are one of the higher ups."
bad,management has favourites only those get advantages hours are short go in there everyday and only get 20 hours a week not nice.
bad,"not the best place to work if you plan on furthering yourself. management isn't good, and the work of 4 works is put on one."
bad,making sure all freight worked from the night before and binned mods and prices changes shelves are full and order and changes counts and let manger know about statis about of area
bad,"In a typical work day you were given notes on your department to complete in the least amount of time possible. While in their employment I learned to merchandise, keep track of stock ( outages, overstock, etc), set mods, and make mark down and price changes. Most direct managers where helpful and supportive, but I found that upper management couldn't care less for the entry level employees no matter how long they have been with the company. I also found that the older more reliable employees where often stuck in their original positions and passed over for advancement. The hardest part of the job was handling the miscommunication between manager, they often wouldn't talk to each other before giving new instructions. The most enjoyable part of the job was the ""regular customers"" that came in and shop."
bad,"É uma luta diária..."
bad,"A typical work day was swept the floors, cleaned up spills, emptied out the trash, and cleaned up the bathrooms."
bad,"Walmart is a great company to work for,lots of people from different races and cultural backgrounds.It's absolutely fantastic to meet new people and become a team member and friend.It's always something to do there.The customers are nice and it's just an all around awesome environment to enjoy.But where Walmart fail at is by the management,nobody wants to be responsible for anything.No manager wants to help and they sit in the office all day doing nothing and they talk down on their staff.You have to do your job but that's fine but you also have to do everybody else's job and including micro-managing.It's a lot and they pay you nothing for it."
bad,It was so bad that i really have nothing to say about it. They never helped customers and they always acted like the customers was bothering them.
bad,work fast loading and unloading trucks all day and picking and packing and tagging  goods to ship out to company all over usa
bad,"Typically you will get along exceedingly well with your coworkers who share your position leading to a good teamwork feeling when there is a heavy load. "
bad,"Management has no clue, favoritism is commonplace, works certain employees harder than others,no concern for safety or health, must be hired on as temp, greed in the higher ups,underemployed, lack of quality employees, outdated equipment, no overtime, lack of hours,fewer benefits as time goes by, employee harassment, horrible food quality,"
bad,"Poor place to work, employees don't get the respect they deserve. Lots of favoritism going on there. Concerns don't get addressed or taken care of."
bad,"Never a consistent schedule to work with. Days requested off for college courses were never approved and was always scheduled. Requesting days off was pointless, because they never get approved no matter how far in advance they are put in."
bad,"A typical day at work could go by fast or slow depending on the day for instance, on the weekends the Toy Department could get hectic while opposed to a weekday it could be slower. It's pretty simple, a lot of customer interaction."
bad,"o	Apparel and Fitting room"
bad,My typical night was to come in an lead people to where their work was needed. Made sure things was done right or if my help was needed I would jump in an help ours out. I learned a lot from this store and the other store with strong customer service was all about an good communication between my co-workers as well as customers.
bad,"I dealt with cash and customer service issues, I stock at registers, familiar with WIC vouchers, food stamps, directing customers in the proper area"
bad,A typical day consist of repeat activities. I learned how to interact with all different people from all walks of life. The Management however was poor and very unprofessional. The co-workers never seemed to stay very long so I didnt really get a chance to get to know them. The hardest part of my job was not having the communication thats needed between managers and also managers and associates to complete task. I most enjoyed interacting with the customers.
bad,Worked at Walmart via staffing firm on a 3rd shift and team was great.  Due to personal reasons needed a 2nd shift and the request was accommodated.  Good management.
bad,"The pay scale is laughable, the benefits package is a joke, and it's just not worth it for a full time, sole income job. They tend to all but manipulate you into working extra hours, and then force you to cut the extra hours that you earned to prevent having to pay out overtime. Advancement relies heavily on who you know in the upper echelon of the particular store you work at, or within the company itself."
bad,"performance management required for any infraction, even if it was ethically correct,"
bad,"I wasn't a big fan of the management team, many of them bend rules and work around clearly stated guidelines. This is especially true when it comes to ""punishment"" (when you make one of the managers angry so they make you scrub toilets, stay unnecessarily late, and just all around act passive-aggressive) even though Walmart prohibits employee punishment beyond warnings, write ups, and things of that nature."
bad,"there was a lot of variety in what i did each day, ranging from the front-end needs to the warehouse needs which gave me personal growth and business development skills."
bad,"É uma empresa que você não tem horário certo,"
bad,"The people I worked with up front were great, but management was very unorganized and showed lack of compassion. The pay was ok but they provided no work/life balance with the schedule."
bad,The wages did not match the job and completely understaffed. i was not satisfied with the other employees either. I learned to not to work here ever again unless there wages go up.
bad,"Co-workers are great, for the most part. However, management is pretty awful. One could be the best employee they have and still treat them as something that is just expendable."
bad,"nothing was ever the same way as the day before, the would do it one way one day and the other different, such as the way you ran the front of the store"
bad,"Not much here, really.  No challenges, just come in, do your job and go home.  There was hardly any opportunities to move up in the company, especially at mine since the one in Pleasant Grove had closed"
bad,"Would be a  better job with a guaranteed set schedule."
bad,"Difficult to feel secure in my job, there were many people around me who were attempting to take my place. I continued to seek employment outside of retail, yet was reliable and dependable to be at work on time every day, and to work the full shifts required to the best of my abilities."
bad,"well it was pretty separated work environment, the people were nice to work with on occasion, the customers were always awesome you get to know your regulars pretty fast, s the interaction with them was by far the best part of the job, management was influx during my time working there so cant really give a fair assessment of their performance."
bad,"The job itself is not difficult, however, the culture of this store is to micro-manage. Store and company politics can sometimes hinder your progress if you can not or do not understand how to work through them. Despite all the things going on around you when you complete a planned task to your satisfaction it is a good day."
bad,"I was a 3 rd shift stockier managing first in first out to make sure every customer receives"
bad,it was fun joining all those marathons. especially for all the special causes. how good  i feel afterwards is beyond words.
bad,You will be able to work here and attend college with no problems. Its a great place to work if you like dealing with the public.
bad,"Story of this company is, its too big for its briches!  Too much overhead and mid level waste of spending. Also is really bullish in the retail arena, especially with vendors, which someday could end up in an unhealthy mutiny of vendors."
bad,"Worked 3rd shift. Pulled all registers at end of the day. Conducted audits as needed. Handled any customer complains."
bad,"I got hired on as a Sporting Goods Associate. My responsibilities were assisting customers, ringing up customers, making keys, making fishing and hunting license, stocking and selling firearms. About 6 months I was asked by the store manager if I would apply for one of the department manager positions so I did and was promoted. My responsibilities entailed price changes, boosting product sales by competitive shopping and representing weak selling products, inventory management, communicating with my vendors, managing and training associates, delegating tasks, resolving customer issues, communicating with assistant/store/district managers, planning and maintaining everything to do with my assigned departments. I was also the safety team leader and with the ASM we lowered accidents by 80% in 2014."
bad,"Use to be a good company to work for. Used threats, lies to skirt the truth. Loss prevention were thugs and liars. There are almost no employees left there since I left."
bad,"Not much room for advancement, lowest paid supermarket in England. Not many benefits that actually help. Don't look forward to going to work at this supermarket"
bad,If you expect to survive and make a good living look elsewhere. Management is a joke and the room for advancing is all based on how much you kiss.
bad,seems as if nobody cared about the job. would always leave one person to do everything. they would advance you just so you would take the load off them and then nobody would even care to thank you or awknowledge the facts that you may have saved them. they also were not very understanding of school schedules.
bad,management was not that great the work was a little to easy at times the fellow co workers are great and the benefits are good after 3 months
bad,I got hurt on the job and was not compensated for seeing their doctor and was told that I could not schedule any doctor appointment during my regular schedule.I wasn't properly trained in my position. I was left to figure it out. They have good benefits but working here is what you make it.
bad,"sin ambiente para laborar, ya que las jefas son muy déspotas y groseras"
bad,no leadership at all. no clear direction to employees. need a better structure for management. equipment in poor condition
bad,"The main issue was staying busy for nine hours doing the same six tasks every night. Routine is good for me, but I felt really unproductive after the tasks."
bad,Walmart is a horrible place to work.  pay is low as well as too much work. To much work for so little pay and very high expectations for work to be done in so little time.
bad,"Wal-Mart was the worst job I had. I didn't know who my boss or the store manager was until about 2 months after working there. A typical day at Wal-Mart its very boring and draining. Managers expect so much from you but dont teach you how to do it and they are very rude if you ask for help. I learned how to do the cash registers very well and became an customer service manager so i could run the whole front end, but i still even then didnt feel comfortable being there."
bad,I liked taking care of the customers and greeting them and smiling at them. I always enjoyed meeting new people and interesting people and seeing what they had to say to me. Trying to make there day get better.
bad,"A typical day as a Walmart cashier entails being quick and efficient when bagging, counting change properly, handling customer relations, and dealing with the occasional technical difficulty. "
bad,"The manager is very nice and will talk to you like a real person, the co-managers are not very nice and seem to be prejudice. Co-workers are friendly, Personnel not nice at all. bad attitudes."
bad,"I have no time for my family. My hours are never the same. I work days, nights, and weekends. I don't mind working with the public. I like the work and what I do, but my family time is important to me. The management isn't horrible but they don't take the best care of their employees if they are sick or have family sick or something comes up. The hardest part are the hours. I enjoy the customers. I love to meet new people and talk to them about their day and how their experience was at the store."
bad,"I worked in the pharmacy for the last 7 years.  Unfortunately, Walmart did not care enough in the welfare of our customers and their only concern was their profit margin"
bad,"pay was ok management didn't care hard to get full time, hardly any raises . higher ups plays favorites. Hard to get fired will hire anyone most people I worked with did drugs."
bad,"People are pushed to their limits. You do more work for the same pay. Management does not always support you."
bad,i enjoyed working in customer service and jewelry. Also having a 10% discount was nice too. It was also great hours and they worked with you on what times you were available.
bad,"Working for Walmart was probably the worst decision I had ever made. The management is unorganized, the attendance policy is horrible, and they don't value their employees. The worst part was they never had help from my department so I was alone or one other person was with me."
bad,I applied for a pharm-tech position that had been filled. To wait for the next opening I took a cashier position to hone the skills I knew would be handy. As I was passed over three times by other cashiers I gave up.
bad,"This company has a tendency to lack clear and decisive focus.  Their journey from silo-ed management to a collaborative environment is counter-cultural.  As a result, role clarity is muddy and confusion is king.  Many of the corporate areas lack direction, there is no justification for their roles, and layoffs occur as a result.  I am not confident that Walmart can ever overcome this problem.  It's too large and ingrained in the mindset of the associates.  The leadership lacks the managerial courage to follow through on it's promises and reign in its managerial workforce."
bad,"It is ok overall, however recent changes are making it harder to work and do more with less.  This leads to an improper work/life balance."
bad,"It is ok overall.  Recent changes are leading to the company trying to do more with less in order to hit profit goals, in order to make shareholders happy.  This leads to an improper work/life balance."
bad,"Multi Channel travel. Drive Customer Service."
bad,"Would often have conflicting manager orders ."
bad,This company will get by on bare minimum not providing employees with help needed to properly care for stores to save on costs. There's not much management can do to help employees under them. Employees are treated as if they're disposable.
bad,"(Based on the specific store I worked at, not the company.)"
bad,A typical day of work begins with clocking in and communicating with your coworkers. The most enjoyable part of the job is the degree of autonomy.
bad,"Not a very fun place to work, although I realize that work is not supposed to be fun. Management was helpful and fair. Clean work environment for the most part. No leniency on the scheduling."
bad,The only thing I liked about this job were the people I worked with and sometimes the customers but other than that it was a low paying job which was repetitive and non-challenging.
bad,"The only part of working at Wal Mart I really enjoyed was my co-workers. I also enjoyed the fast paced part of the job but when it is slow all you can really do is just stand there and maybe clean your work area and straighten up the items on your aisle. But other than that, when you are not busy all you can do is stand there at the front of the aisle and wait for customers. Most of upper management were very nice. One of the main things I did not like was the pay, you only got a raise one time a year and you were always considered ""Part time"" unless you got a management position."
bad,"A typical day at work was taking freight to the sales floor so that the shelves could be stocked. locating items in the back room for associates and customers. The managers were fun to work with. Co-workers were fun to work with, we got a lot of work done on 3rd shift due to every ones knowledge and commitment to task at hand. the hardest part about the job was the constant short staffing and being expected to do four job titles at a time and still finish my primary job which was Inventory management services. the most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers and associates in the store."
bad,Worked for many years with accounting and collections.  Extensive experience with customer service. Handled management decisions. Worked with a variety of computer systems.
bad,"Everyone is one food stamps, they treat their employees bad, they promise you advancement and either don't give it to you or pay you very little but want you to take on more responsibilities. They are not family friendly, and will fire you via automated service. No sick days allowed for single parents with sick kids....no holidays off."
bad,"A typical day at work, (in the position I worked) included"
bad,"assistanting the teacher on daily activates with the children. providing care and learning experiences for the children , helping with any other job duties they need to be attended to."
bad,"Dure 13 años trabajando. No hay oportunidad de crecimiento SOLO Q LE HAGAS LA BARBA A LA GERENCIA, como subjefe te presionan mucho para lograr resultados como si fueras el jefe y al final los aplausos se los llevan los jefes. Hay gerentes, subgerentes y distritales que humillan a la gente. En fin no terminaria, pero algo es cierto; LA EMPRESA NO ES MALA, LOS LIDERES QUE PONEN PARA DIRIJIR LAS TIENDAS SON LOS MALOS."
bad,The work was interesting and I enjoyed giving technical support to customers.  My co-workers were probably as nice as any to work with.
bad,I had a chance to work the backroom and as well as the front of the store and I really enjoyed the grateful thank you received from many customers I had the pleasure to provide directions as well as providing guidance as to where an item was located inside the store
bad,management was horrible. co-workers was worse. a typical day at work was mediocre. I absolutely hated coming to work for this company.
bad,"I don't believe that I was treated fairly while working there.  They weren't willing to work with my schedule for school, and school is very important to me.  A typical day at work was usually hectic and unorganized.  I learned how to deal with all different types of people.  I do believe the management was very well, the store manager on the other hand was not.  My co-workers were okay to work with, but they weren't the happiest people.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with all different kinds of people.  The most enjoyable part was meeting some truly amazing people."
bad,"great work place with understanding co-workers . encouraging management . taken care of customers. friendly environment , always taking out the time to take care of the customers ."
bad,"From what I've heard from my fellow coworkers that worked at walmart for 20+ years, the benefits of the job are great. Personally, it was not for me. Very boring, extremely long shifts and little to no interaction with your coworkers. They pay above minimum wage which is good."
bad,"I think it's kind of ridiculous that people think that people who work minimum wage jobs don't deserve any more money. If you've ever worked a minimum-wage job you'd probably say it's one of the hardest jobs you'd ever had either because of the monotony or physical labor.  However, at Wal-Mart it gets worse as you climb the ladder.  As a customer service manager, I made only $.90/hour more than I did as a cashier.  "
bad,I wish I could say something  positive about my experience at Walmart but unfortunately I can't. Modern day slave labor.
bad,to each is own. i feel i have more to offer to the world. i would love to work in a career in something i went to school for and not work for someone i can grow with
bad,Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you learn and grow. Tons of learning experiences and great staff to help out.
bad,working as a cashier can get very busy and stressful but i love the people i work with and the customers.coworkers are great and having fun at my job.
bad,I've Met Nice customers from all over the country. Frequent bonuses boost employees moral. fantastic company BBQ'S. I have learn management skills from Walmart that I can take anywhere and utilize for future employers.
bad,"Workign at the distribution center was the funnest job I ever had. the work was tough, but after you pushed through and pulled big numbers and fought through the back pain for a hard earned overall percentage that earned you respect among yoru co-workers, there was no better feeling. your co-workers are your rock in this hard place, everyone is like family. Management, however, will tell you to your face you are just a number and they couldn't care any less about you or saving the company money(for that nice % of savinsg bonus check they get)."
bad,Good place to work due to many positions available. Employer hires hundreds of people for it's very busy operation which can make for a good place to find employment.
bad,"Mostly had schedules that varied.      Always on my feet, always moving.   Got along well with my immediate supervisors.  I loved my coworkers."
bad,Butterball Turkey put a great deal of time into making sure that their employees were taken care of. The health benefits were superb.
bad,I enjoyed working with customers and coworkers. The atmosphere was very pleasant. The commute was too far and annoying.
bad,On a typical day it would be fine until one would get told to do something from one member of management then are told another from a different member of management. Co-workers was great and friendly
bad,"this job made realize that i needed to go to school and do better than this and i did, now i'm working and the newest hospital in Toronto."
bad,this was a good learning experience especially when i was there when the store was getting built so i learned a lot and it was overall a good job
bad,"Great company to work for. So many types of different fields to chose from. For being with the company for 18 years I have had the privilege to work as the front end manager ,backroom manager, consumables manager, grocery manager,Operations manager."
bad,"Ive been with walmart for six years and making minimum wage, and do all sorts a jobs for them that is not my job title. Its not a bad work environment just the managers could be nicer and more supportive"
bad,Management helps no one in actually learning what needs to be done. No team work and dairy department never wanted to rotate items.
bad,"•a typical day at work"
bad,Co workers were fun and supportive. Same orientation day saw an attendee with less well lets say no experience on government right to work program get offered 2 dollars more per hour than myself with experience. Too many managers unsure of who was in charge. Did have employee purchase stock program great for building your portfolio good benefits for full time some limited benefits for part time. Good meal and break periods. Decent employee discount program. Diverse work population that strengthened the company
bad,Gave me more experience with customer service. I enjoyed working with customers. Does not have supportive management.
bad,"Very high expectations regarding work with minimal pay.  Associates all get along well except when it comes to making themselves appear like a better resource to management.   Very hard to keep Customers happy because items continually out of stock or discontinued.  Management does not communicate with each other very well so associates will continually receive conflicting directives.  Raises are very minimal."
bad,"You had a quota that could be met hourly if conditions are always perfect. But if things go wrong beyond the control of the individual, they don't give down time for the problem you can't control."
bad,I enjoyed working for Walmart and the chance to work on customer service skills and inventory control. My typical day would be to make sure the attendants were aligned to make sure our parking lot was clean and the carts were placed properly back into the store for the use by customers. I would also help customers who needed assistance to their car or with the merchandise they purchased.
bad,"Walmart, a place who keeps alot of people working when they lose another job. Your hours are set, don't go over them, else management gets annoyed with you. Benefits were good and all, but took a while to kick in, especially when your were inbetween jobs, and needing the healthcare sooner than later. Assigned produce, I worked every other area more than I did my own. Insufficient coverage placement wise, leads to working in an unfamiliar area. Some parts of the store do things differently, keep this in stock here, while not there. Management would not take into account situation, and disagrees when needed to step away for a moment (emergency)."
bad,"Its hard to be promoted in position, competition is very high with seniors employees. Though you have knowledge and experiences, they priority the employees who have work there for 20 years, as seniority, thought they are not capable in doing the job. There was a lot of bosses who giving you task, thats also leads to confusion, so streesfull to work."
bad,no fixed schedule.pay rate is low and you don't get 40 hours.lack of employees.they schedule people almost every week for interview but still some section still lack.
bad,walmart works their empployees for very little pay they have no sympathy for their associates it is a ball and chain type of job slavery non the less
bad,"A typical day as a closer was busy serving customers in and out of my department. The job consisted of lots of walking; from having to  park far out in the parking lot; then having to walk to the time clock(all the way to the back of building) and during work hours in my department retrieving go backs,stocking shelves etc.I got along well with my department manager. My co-workers weren't team players and tend to disappear on the floor overloading me with more responsibilities while trying to tend to customers etc. The hardest part of my job was negative co-workers. The most enjoyable part of my job working in the fabric department was meeting and having a strong rappor with interesting  friendly people such as nurses (who purchased fabrics to make scubs) and church groups who too asked for me by name to help them select fabrics for costumes for their church plays during the holidays. I enjoy crafts and  being creative therefore my department manager let me paint all the crafts for displays that helped  generated sales in my department."
bad,"its a ok to work for mainly for the relationships built with co workers, no sense of consistency with management, can have 4 managers giving 4 different task and all need to be completed at the same time its a very unrealistic approach to the workload a employee can take. despite company pay increase which only made the workload given even more excessive. no job security I've seen an employee of 20+ years be fired for not bagging a customers items and the customer became irate. overall its an OK! place but nothing more would never work for a Wal-Mart/sams again"
bad,In all honestly this was just a  random job I had one summer while in college the first time trying to make al little money. It was night shifts and I'm glad I only did it for a short period of time.
bad,working at glenwood well it was my first job and it made me realize its more to life then just how you feel about everything other live matter to my resident showed me how to care for a lot they really helped me grow up
bad,They have lost the people care part. They are more focused on making the almighty dollar than taking care of the people. I watched us go from really caring and thinking about how we took care of our employees to how fast and accurate they completed their task
bad,There is a lot of work load given no matter what. If you are willing to learn and work hard they will teach you everything they know. Upper management was sometimes difficult to work with. I love the people I work with; they are like family to me. They do cut hours a lot. If you are full time you may not get 40 hours or even 32 hours. Not a great job if you are paying your own bills alone.
bad,"Walmart was an ""okay"" place to work at in general; however, my experience working at my local store was admittedly pretty awful. I worked in Overnight Maintenance at my local Walmart, and I would say that I enjoyed in for the most part. The daily routine for tasks would be to sweep and mop the floor, clean the restrooms, bring in the carts from outside, use the scrubber to shine the floor, and basically any other task management could toss on us at random. Helping the customers was the best part of the job, it broke up the daily routine, as well as also giving me a sense of pride to continue helping others. "
bad,"Even thou management was very poor, the employees were very fun to be around. Employees were very hard working and appreciative of any and all help. Shifts were very good and manageable."
bad,"Walmart is ever growing but from an employee's standpoint the company is in constant decline.  It is not nearly as terrible of a place to work as the public perceives it to be, but the pay does not even begin to justify the hard work you must put into your job.  I have had a lot of positive experiences working for Walmart and have learned a great deal, but management is often condescending and antagonizing.  Intimidating low-wage employees into performance has never and will never worked, yet the company persists.  I do not recommend."
bad,company constantly changing. unable to perform job duties due to understaffing with no urgency to recover. Every thank you from management is followed by a but......(thank you for covering and performing anothers job due to understaffing but you didn't do yours at the same time)
bad,This company is a steady company but in need of more structure that is consistent. Pay scale in on the low for the things you have to do but it is a steady job that is working towards trying to fix things with the new CEO
bad,"worst place i worked "
bad,"A typical day at the walmart pharmacy consisted of customer coming in to pick up their medications. I learned a lot about different medications and their uses as well as different insurances and who covers what and why. "
bad,"On a typical day in the garden center is always unproductive, but I have to find something to do MOST of the time.  I can honestly say the biggest thing I've learned is to not let anyone walk over you. Management was terrible. He seemed like he didn't care for his employee's. There were no friends, just come to work, do your job and go home. Everyone that I associated with were nice people in bad environment. I'd say the hardest part is keeping up with the Telezon, getting a forklift license (not that I couldn't do it, they just had no ""time"" for me). I enjoyed my customers the most, and driving the forklift when I could."
bad,"I worked for 5 years at Walmart. I started in dairy and ended up in electronics. I set up displays, hosted tournaments, sold credit cards, and set up cell phone plans."
bad,"All day as a cart pusher, I would have to push huge numbers of carts in a huge lot by myself, with broken cart pushing machines.  The management didn't care whenever I told them a scooter or pusher machine was broken until there were no scooters left for customers.  They would then say it was my responsibility to tell someone before everything broke, which I did constantly.  They didn't have any water for us either, like Kroger did.  They also gave everyone average scores on performance reviews because they have no idea what's going on."
bad,I didn't like alot of things that walmart did. I loved giving the customers excellent service but the management was horrible.
bad,"its a ot of hard work and very demanding,fast pace and unorganized. it can be a very stressful work environment due to customers, management and some co workers. the work load can be very overwhelming at times and not much help from those around you."
bad,"The typical day at work is getting your boss to yell at as soon as you walk in the door, drama with co-workers that create stress in the work place .Also sometimes the managers will even forget to let you go on break or even lunch the hardest part is when you are a cashier and you get asked rude an insulting questions by customers, and get called harass names just for doing your job."
bad,"A typical day for me consists of doing what I know to be necessary for the good of the customers. Management lacks the necessary leadership skills and integrity to help their workers strive for their best. They instead rely on threats or bullying associates into doing whatever they want. Also, I have been lied to on several occasions. I learned how to learn and manage situations on my own. My co-workers were the only unblemished part of my Walmart experience. The hardest part of this job is getting my job done in the correct manner while being instructed to do it incorrectly."
bad,"Loved working there, management was off while I was there and Walmart does not give benefits of any kind, you get some percentage off sales but it's not even worth it. I was actually working but still not making enough to support my family."
bad,The job was OK as far as meeting really good people. The only downside was poor management and on-going favoritism. If you weren't in good with management it was extremely difficult for you to advance. They also didn't take your continuing of you education seriously. A college once came to have a brief discussion about continuing education during our store meeting. Our assistant manager rushed them along and stated that we had a job to do. They  seem as if they rather you work minimum wage for the rest of your life than live a happy successful life.
bad,changing oil and tires is a typical day on this job. i learned how to work with customers. my opinion of management is to many managers in one work place. co workers was a good group of guys. the hardest part of the job was when more than one manager would tell you what to do and how to do it.most enjoyable was working with the customers making sure they got what they come to get.
bad,i really did not like walmart they dont care to much for there employees. I also fell like the time given to us about stocking merchandise is very unrealistic
bad,"It was a great fun place to work. the staff were nice and friendly."
bad,This job is okay if you just started out working. The management was not that great there was points in time where the management would yell at employees. During your interview your told you would be paid one thing and then when hired on you were paid a totally different amount.
bad,"unfair employer, bad pay, rude management, rude associates, horrible benefits, hard to gain full time status. Would never wish to work for walmart again."
bad,"it is a production based job.  You had a production goal to meet everyday or you will receive a write up.  In some areas, your production would often rely on how much product you receive. So in most cases, your work ethic will not determine whether you make production or not but the caseload you receive for that day as a determining factor which you have no control over."
bad,Was treated like I knew the position when I never had that position and asked if I could work on my CBL's was always denied.
bad,"Stocked shelves, moved to different departments, also worked in groceries, and Unloading, helped costumers, worked in a fast paced environment, hours were hard to get used to, overnight: hours were 10pm-7am third shift"
bad,go in and stock furniture department.management always changing . co workers the few i talked to were nice. hardest part about my job. lifting 2 person furniture when they didn't give any help anywhere.best part about walmart it was close to the house.
bad,I havent been there in so long so it is hard to say or grade this place anymore. Im sure a lot has changed since I have been there. Pay was low and they were quick to turn you away.
bad,A difficult  environment for people with a strong work ethic. The primary concern of most store management is completing task in the most convenient way possible at the moment and hope someone else deals with the fallout.
bad,"Managment was horrible, scheldule was unorganized. co-workers were easy to get along with and very helpful when i had questions starting out."
bad,The work was ok and coworkers were great the only issues I had was that management did not care to acknowledge hard work for those who deserved it.
bad,Did not really enjoy working here as much as other places.  It tended to have a lot of drama and unnecessary issues. Just an overall horrible place to work.
bad,"The Standards of customer service needs to be held to a higher level. The hiring process needs to be held at a much higher level for the expectations that are put on the current employees, and the future employees to come."
bad,Basic day here mainly running a cash registers trying to keep lines down and answering customer questions. Making shore bags were on the register basically showing customer appreciation.
bad,"A typical day working at Walmart includes, working behind the cash register to help assist customers during their check out and some light cleaning. What i learned from this job is how to communicate better with the public and how to work in a team with out the help of management."
bad,"They do not give you benefits until you work there for one year.  The people that i worked with are awesome people.  The job isn't as bad as most people would think, its just a lot of constant movement and speed."
bad,Its a fun working place lots of flow of traffic ... new faces everyday.. new challenges 10 percent discount on everything except food and liquor 20 percent on vision and Pharmacy ... also membership for Sams Club <--- That was a Good Benefit :D ...
bad,The management training program is not supervised. Managers are overworked and not enough guidance is given by upper management.
bad,Actually most of the people I worked with at Walmart were great people.  And for most of the time I was there I had a reasonably good time and mostly enjoyed my job.  I just wish our original manager had not had to transfer to be closer to an elderly relative because he was the lead from the front sort that I could really appreciate.
bad,The company requires open scheduling for part time Employment. Most employees are hired on part time with the worst schedules. Chances of advancement are very low. Chances on pay increase is determined by supervisory individual opinion not baised on work productivity or quality. Discounts are at a low 10% and excludes special pricing on products.   Training programs are all out dated. 90% of co-workers quit before their 5th year due to employee treatment.   Guaranteed scheduled on Sundays.
bad,It really depends on where you are in the store and who is over you and what store you're at. Oak Ridge store is very oriented on who you know and where as opposed to who works better than others
bad,well the hardest part of my job for me is when you have co-worker who do nothing stand around and do nothing and get away with it i always been a good worker but what they do reflex on me because we suppose to be a team
bad,"Unfortunately Wal-Mart fails from the start. The first thing they show you is a video on how Bad Unions are. Poor training, Employees after watching some videos are turned out to the floor to fend and learn for themselves. Management frequently makes mistakes in scheduling that would have been easily fixed had they actually reviewed the schedule."
bad,Pregnant women do not have no benefits working with this company. Only allowed 6 weeks of pregnancy leave before coming back to work. But overall I love my coworkers and Management was okay at times.
bad,I enjoyed working as a cashier but i have encountered difficult people and discrimination. Over all i wouldnt want to go back to work for that company simply because they dont value the employees as much as they need too.
bad,"Management shows favoritism toward certain associates. Management is not dependable for day to day needs. Most of management does not use people skills, nor is polite toward most associates. My co workers are a fun group of intelligent, kindhearted people. A typical day at work would be assisting customers as needed. Checking in boxes/merchandise before putting on the sales floor. Every now and again, working in the receiving area. The hardest part of the job is trying to do your job while having to deal with management. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to work with nice people and learning new things."
bad,"Don't have a lot to say about Wal-Mart I worked there when I was going to collage. They did not work with me well there. "
bad,"At the Walmart I work at now, I feel like the management and personnel could careless about there employees. Everyone puts in an extreme amount of work but they only give people 18 hours. thats gas money for others and these employees have kids, a mortgage and other responsibilities. They don't give them insurance, the only thing we have is a discount card.    "
bad,Walmart does not care about their workers in any form or fasion and only care about the end result.They promote the people they like and not the ones that have earned the position.
bad,I do not care for Wal-Mart at all I wish I never had to shop there and really do not want to work there. I will if I have to but I do not want to.
bad,"A typical day at Wal-Mart I feel is not a lot of teamwork. There are some associates that can tell you to do things and will not lift a finger to help nor do it themselves. I like working with some of my co-workers, others are very disrespectful. The hardest part of my job is trying to handle certain situations. I love the job that I do, I'm just ready to expand my skills and knowledge."
bad,"Typical day:"
bad,"I mean really, we all here the horror stories about the evil conglomerate taking over the world and ruining food (not unlike Costco) and selling GMO's to our families; and yet we still find ourselves working there. It's mediocre, bleh pay and you never have time for a real life (no not partying, that's not living) outside of work because of the ridiculously varying shifts."
bad,Daily duties included unloading trucks and sorting products to specific departments. Delivery of pallets to departments and use of electric and hand pallet jacks. I learned that working under multiple different management styles can be a trying learning experience and makes for an interesting work environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was walking away with the ability to use Wal-Mart as a learning experience.
bad,"Great environment for people who enjoy sports. Very energetic atmosphere, never a dull moment. love being around people"
bad,"I found this job to be very stressful. Some co-workers were pleasant, though others were downright malicious. During my training one of my bosses constantly insulted me for making mistakes. I feel that the corporate model of Wal-Mart is set up to treat employees well, having learned all about it during training, but this particular store just did not treat me well."
bad,"don't apply for cart pusher"
bad,Unorganized not a good place to work i worked 10-7am overnight and they only wanted to pay 8.05 per hour the supervisors are all males lazy flirts and show favortism.
bad,"El laborar ahí tuvo sus pros y contras, pero sinceramente más contras, debido a que en linea de cajas si tienes faltantes te los cobran, sin ningún motivo o razón, la empresa no cuida a sus trabajadores en ese sentido y el ambiente de trabajo puede llegar a ser muy estresante, debido a la presión excesiva y una remuneración pobre con relación a dicha presión."
bad,"The pros and cons speak for themselves.  At the beginning I enjoyed my job, but unfortunately the climate of the store has drastically changed and so has the management team.  One of the five pillars of Wal-Mart is having ""respect for the individual,"" which has been lost over the years.  Associates are taken for granted and treated poorly.  I appreciate having a job because it has allowed me to take care of my family and the wages helped me put myself through school.  On the other hand, environment plays a large part in job satisfaction."
bad,you're definitely will be kept busy throughout the entire night. some days are light and some days are heavy. even light days can be tough at times.
bad,"I only kept this job for ten years because it was a mile down the street from my house, and paid my bills. After so long I had to move on."
bad,expected you to know and do most of the stuff. working the till at the peak times even when your hired for different departments.
bad,"Assisting in loading and unloading shipments, organizing backroom spaces, constructing displays, and stocking"
bad,Walmart is a good place to work while attending school. Flexible shifts and 24/7 operation makes it ideal for students or people who work two jobs.
bad,"Being helpful to customers. Checking out customers, Follow rules, I learned how to make people feel good out my service while doing my job."
bad,tem seus pontos positivos mas também seus negativos que não são poucos  mais o pior problema são suas liderança que não sabe  ser justo com seus funcionário e favorece seus queridinhos .
bad,"A typical day at work you would get your task, and the time limit you may have on your task. Once you sign in your time starts, lets say you have 9 palettes the may give you 5 hours to finish. I learned how to quickly put out merchandise. The hardest part was to put out all of your merchandise in a timely manner."
bad,worst company ever managment works you just under having to give benefits but make major bonuses showing their lack of commitment to employees and knowing they affect the surrounding economy
bad,"Management is constantly changing and they do not communicate wel. Just another body, not a valued employee. No consideration for work -life balance. Fluctuating hours make it impossible to have any kind of normal home life balance. If you cut your availability, you get no hours. You were not valued, just easily replaceable even if you were a great worker."
bad,"How you treat someone is how valuable they are to you. There is a reason Walmarts sales are falling is because the associates have learned they aren't valued. Walmart (CEO's and leaders) value the dollar more than anyone. I have watched and worked through the many changes Walmart has made. All I can say is this ""The hourly associates never wins, never."""
bad,"not much to say you've been there. My last day was my happiest."
bad,"I was told early on that retail work is not for everyone. That was a golden nugget of truth. I was fortunate to work with plenty of great people, but the work environment was not as pleasant. Most customers were rude, and would try anything to get a discount. It was a real educational journey, but I would never do it again!"
bad,nights were hard but the money was needed to support the family. other employees were nice and supportive. Managers were not very understanding of family events happening but not everyone can be.
bad,"A typical was usually not being able to locate the keys and other equipment items necessary to open the fitting room on time, no one knew where they were , if I wasn't the person who closed the night before. "
bad,Stocking and keeping store presentable. I've learned to work very well with and assist customers. Management could use more communication with employees. Co-workers are hard working and easy to get along with. Hardest part is taking on 2 or 3 departments because of being under staffed. I enjoy helping customers.
bad,We were very busy due to the season of giving.  Assisting customers during this time of year is a wonderful experience.  They wanted me to come back for future employment.
bad,"I wish it was a little more customer oriented.its all about the associate just not the management,its ok place to work just not easy to move up more pay would be helpful with at least one weekend off."
bad,This position i would unload trucks that came to the store. I would then bring the product to the floor and stock the shelves.
bad,"The co-workers are pleasant, some are unwilling to provide the teamwork participation but what company doesn't have that employee. Walmart is difficult to work for, not willing to work with college students. Disrespectful in the consideration of personal and free time. No desire to care about family."
bad,Walmart provided positions fulltime with excellent benefits.  Provided customers product information.  Resolved customer conflict provided quality customer service.
bad,Loved my job till we got a new store manager. She ran so many people out of the store. I got hurt at work and was treated so bad I was forced to leave.
bad,the schedules were crazy and sometimes interfered with my classs. I didn't have much time to study or work on class work. I would work as late and midnight some nights.
bad,supervisors are being worked to hard and do not pay attention to things going on there are things going on that need to be addressed and the supervisor are too busy to notice
bad,I leaned to do all kind of thing like working several different department while I work up front as a cashier which is the on thing I enjoyed while working the front registers
bad,"a typical day in the Walmart pharmacy consisted of pulling and filing new and expired prescriptions. Quickly assisting sick and frustrated customers with the proper medications. Answering calls from MD's. Locating particular items, on the sales floor for inquiring customers."
bad,"At first it was great working here, but after every single supervisor got a promotion and our manager as well, after that it was not the same work enviornment."
bad,"Working at Walmart I stocked shelves, worked the paint counter and assisted customers. When needed I helped make the grocery department look neat and organized. My co-workers were helpful for the most part, but there were times when they were quite rude and brought me down."
bad,"Daily routine was to keep accurate counts of backroom inventory while ensure full shelf capacity on sales floor."
bad,"Same routine everyday. The best part is meeting new people, but sometimes in bad moods. I cheered them up. I learned new computer skills on there cash register system. I could work anywhere. Management never really notice you, but co-workers made the day go by fast. Not many hours sometimes as little as 17 hours a week. The pay was minimum wage, can't survive on that little. I worked at another job but since the days and hours were flexible they always seem to overlap, so I had to choose one or the other."
bad,"A typical night at work for me is clocking in, sorting out reshop which is items that the customers changed their mind on. After finishing reshopping, I either go on register or go on the floor to stock the merchandise. When all the stocking is finished, we have to make sure that the store looks clean and neat. By time everything is done, its time to go home."
bad,At this particular store apparently you can only get full time if you know everyone there even if you leave and come back you are more likely to get a good spot within the company than someone who works is new in town. You may get a raise but they'll cut your hours back to compensate for it. No one seems interested in helping you with anything. You must do the work of 4 jobs in one days shift.
bad,Wonderful people work to make the company billions so the can feed there families.  The pay is low and benefits are lousy.  The higher you climb the management tree the more you see the profit hungry mentality come through.
bad,I didn't like this position at all. It was a means to an end. Management was poor to say the least on all levels. I was elated when a position at another job became available and I was able to move on.
bad,"too much gossip, childish,  no communication between shift leads and cahiers, favoritism. Walmart Needs more PAy for all the help they want us to assist cumsomers with."
bad,"sorted clothing by colors and sizes. I liked that a lot. "
bad,"My review of working at Wal-Mart is the employes were pretty nice but the management team was slacking.My experience with this company was a bad one, they treated you unfair."
bad,Stocked shelves and assisted customers.  Hard to accept the poor people skills of management. Co-workers miserable at work.
bad,"Hectic workday everyday.  It's a retail position.  Management always demanded respect but only gave respect to those who were compatible with management's personalities.  Co workers were sometimes fun to be around.  The hardest part of the whole job was putting up with managements disrespect for the individual.  The best part of the job, outside of the customer assistance was the occasional company part or barbeque.  This is only for the store I worked in.  I can not review other WalMart Stores."
bad,Helping customers to return items bought answering phones directing calls keeping the desk area neat and clean helping customers to find items on the floor
bad,"Walmart sucks. Worked there for 3 years overnights and was only making 10.80 an hour. And this is a multi-billion dollar company. What a joke. Not paid enough to deal with the moronic, micro managing managers. Always understaffed so you have to pick up the slack. And then get yelled at and written up when the ridiculous expectations aren't met. Isn't worth your time and effort. You don't take care of your employees, they won't take care of you."
bad,Not enough help to get shelves stocked let alone take care of customers. Upper management treats store teams as if they are expendable and asks them to constantly do more with less. It is a house of cards waiting to fall.
bad,"Working at as a In-stock clerk with Walmart was different and experimental for me. I had never worked in the retail environment  was different than working in an office atmosphere. Retail involves more physical work than i had participated. "
bad,"I did enjoy my job, but what drove me to quit and vow never to return is the abysmal work enthusiasm of coworkers and the inadequate management of my superiors. Personal conflict thrived in this unhealthy environment where a manager would tell you to hurry up while she would turn around and start a long personal conversation on the clock with a fellow coworker who was supposed to be doing the exact same thing you were. There was also blatant harassment by one of the male section managers. There were only a few coworkers/managers I had any faith in, and could trust to be professional and dedicated. I do not believe all Wal-Marts work in such chaos, but the one I was located at was a completely unprofessional and disrespectful business, which is no way at all to operate."
bad,Before Sam Walton died walmart seemed to care about there employees treated them with respect... Well at least more respect then they do now. When I first started I wanted to learn everything I could and move up in the company. At first it was great loved the people I worked with. Then about 3 months into it I noticed it changing and I realized that to become higher up was not what I wanted. No one was on the same page. You where constantly told to do one thing by one manager then get in trouble for doing it by the next. When it was brought up that the other one said something the other manager would act like they didnt know what I was talking about. I worked in a lot of different areas in that place and it was all the same. I did meet some great people while I was there. I do have to say not all the management was bad. If walmart would care about their people more I think that it would be a better place. The contently change the rules and dont explain them very well.
bad,"I cannot say how bad this company takes advantage of people it is slave labor in all but name, to be blunt and honest if you take all of the work they make you do in one day and then look at how much you got paid for that same day, you would quickly take back your application. Dont waste your time guys."
bad,The only thing I liked working at Walmart is the fact I get to interact with various types of individuals. I like to talk a lot so it was good in that aspect. Like everywhere else you start seeing people for who they are. There was no team-work present as everyone just thinks about themselves and not the mission. Managers and Assistant Managers are too good at not being found when needed. They want you to work for them but they are not willing to work with you on your schedule.
bad,"felt so unappreciated at this place. worked so hard and was always lending a hand if needed still people who were lazy had it easy at work."
bad,"Typical cashier job.  Rude customers.  Unappreciative managers.  Would not recommend working here again.  You would get yelled at if you punched out late, but are expected to take everyone in your line even when customers line up and your light is off."
bad,"I have nothing nice to say here. The work itself is not hard, however, being required to do 3 people jobs and pulled off your job to do something else, then berated for not getting the first job done and being talked down to by management is not the kind of work environment anyone wants to be in. This is not an individual case or an individual grudge. I have personally talked to several employees and consoled and counseled several who have had to deal with these things and worse. This is a horrible company."
bad,i really have enjoyed working at walmnart but it is very very strees full and mangers just dont appreciate you.  In there eyes u are just another number in there book.  Lots of work not enough pay
bad,I enjoyed working at McDonalds for the first few months I worked their . I wouldn't say that's a job I want to do for the rest of my life
bad,"Decorate all types of cakes to be sold and decorate for customers that have specific orders. Give excellent customer service to customers. Enjoy having the freedom to be able to create my own designs for cakes. Since being a cake decorator I have learned great technics to make a better product for the customer. While working at Wal-Mart I have been able to utilize my organizational and leadership skills in organizing the products we sell, how orders are produced and how they are handled to provide better quality products being sold."
bad,Steady job and great pay. I can't say much else for it though. I enjoyed the co-workers more than anything. They need to re-do management all together.
bad,when i worked at walmart i didnt enjoy it much. the bosses would not be telling me the same job and it became tough to work there
bad,"Lots of talk about innovation and change; however, it's more like the shouts of food from a starving man and water from a thirsty man.  Work for the majority has become ritualized with the 20% doing the work.  Little accountability which is supported by the musical chair of job rotation every 18 months.  Middle Management is weak although enough talent to bubble to the top.  The culture is calcified and can be a challenge for integration - learn the language which is a interesting mix of ITIL, Project Management and sprinkles of theology.  Nice people but many of the lifers will keep you at an arms length and subtly remind you that you are an outsider.  Over time their ISD group will be increasingly outsourced and migrate to the cloud."
bad,A typical day at work was good but as the night goes on it was harder and we basically did all the work that nobody finished during the day time. The hardest part was catching back up to our work after helping everyone else and still managing to finish on time. My co-workers were hard working but as time went on everyone was getting drained by the long nights and rare off days.
bad,"My longevity with this company has been a bittersweet learning experience in terms of personal development and professional development. Learning how to play by someone else's rules under questionable management practices, while trying to maintain your self dignity and job security can be overwhelming and a disappointment in trying to progress as a person professionally. Over time as I obtained multiple degrees advancing my education and personal insight, I finally accepted that this company has been misaligned from its original mission, scope and core beliefs. "
bad,There is not nearly enough staffing to complete all the assigned tasks on any given day. Corporate has been trimming employee benefits for years even with increasing profit numbers. Management acts like an anchor by preventing good ideas from happening and forcing implementation of unwise business decisions handed down by corporate office that does not have a very good idea how each individual store can run best.
bad,"Working for walmart was very exhausting for me, and wasn't very fun either , first you have to deal with all the rude costumers , then with the people that you work for , nobody cares about you they don't treat their employees with respect , zero consideration ."
bad,"I believe that Walmart can be a good company just that the managers are VERY greedy. They'd cut us down to just enough hours so we couldn't draw unemployment. Send you to work in departments you were never trained for. They will leave you by yourself and expect everything to be done. If you have worked more hours than you are scheduled for or had to stay over waiting on a replacement they made you take that time off. They took our Christmas Bonus to ""Pay the light bill"", said they'd see what they could do the next quarter - never saw it,"
bad,"My typical day at work would be standing at my register scanning customers items as they come though my line. When I was not behind the register, I was cleaning/ organizing my work area. The management was not very organized, when I would come back from break they wouldn't know which register needed relief. My co-workers were probably the best part of the job."
bad,"I loved that at the beginning of each shift the Management team would give us goals for our shift and duties. I learned that this is a job that you can balance between home and work if you are up front in the beginning on the shifts you are willing to take. The Management Team I think at times wasn't always on the same page which makes it difficult for employees who are just starting , not knowing the flow of floor staging, duties as a stocker and or customer service employee on the floor. More shadowing needs to be done from Senior employees or Management team before just releasing an employee on the floor to stock."
bad,"I worked here part time and only got paid a little bit of money. I think wal mart should pay better then they do, and fire those on the war path."
bad,"Worked 4 to 6 hours shifts."
bad,"I do my best everyday to do exactly what I am supposed to do. I am one out of 6 customer service managers that is able to multitask and fix just about any problem that comes to surface whether its equipment issues or customer concerns anyone you ask will tell you that I am the one they ask for. Our store's morale is rapidly declining. our store manager never has a kind word to say nor does he ever tell you that you are appreciated. When he does speak to you he makes you feel very unappreciated and you can't talk to him like you are supposed to be able to do. All together I've been with this company 9 years and every year it gets worse. I have learned that just when you think you've seen/heard it all someone proves you wrong. I love the majority of my co-workers. They come in do their job and don't complain. The hardest part of my job would have to be dealing with co-workers that are on my level that just don't have the ability to multi-task, which is a must in my position. I love what I do but management makes it a lot more stressful than it has to be."
bad,"its a great part time job but be prepared to work almost every weekend. and getting off you would have to request in three to four months in advance to get it. the politics at walmart are overwhelming you get paid a little bit to do so much"
bad,Hard to work here because there were so many managers but never any available to train you. I unloaded the merchandise and stocked it on the floor for the customers.
bad,They do not pay well and their benefits are to much and they have you do more then what you were hired for. They reduce hours anytime and do not give a better pay rate and only go off performance.
bad,"Customers Rude, Management Rude. Coworkers Rude. dont make you feel welcomed. Treat more as a worker and only a worker."
bad,i had a lot of good experiences here until i moved stores and the management wasn't as good. i worked in many departments and made a lot of friends here.
bad,"come on, its walmart.... the customers are shotty therefore the customer service becomes shotty which makes the customers even shottier and round and round it goes. my coworkers were great, management sucks depending on the location, never a csm when you need one.  and everyones favorite. Well have 2 lanes open with lines throughout the store. doesnt only frustrate the customer, it frustrates the cashier too people."
bad,"no work life balance, salary position requiring many hours over schedule. Great co-workers, bad store manager, Do not care about their people."
bad,Never worked anywhere where management goes in the office and gossips about coworkers. Never a day without drama. The coworkers were not the problem it was the management team.
bad,"The hardest part of this job is dealing with other workers that don't want to be there and the lower class who want you to bow down to them.  They try to find anything to complain about because they know walmart will do anything to keep it's good name.  ""The customer is always right,"" was overused in my opinion.  "
bad,"just ok but you are used til worn out then forced out . little growth for many years."
bad,Very demanding and non-flexable. Wont work much with your schedule and low pay. Good about break and safety. over all not enjoyable.
bad,Ran the cash register. I basically stayed to myself. Co-workers are not something that I would discuss. There really was not anything hard about my job.
bad,"Communication isn't a strong point.I learned a few skills and enjoyed working there, the co workers were mostly nice to work with.I feel the hardest part was a numerous amount of picks being created at a certain time. The most enjoyable part of the job was completing the tasks for the day on time."
bad,a typical day would cause me to work 7 hours until i receive a break and maybe 7 hours until i receive a 30 minute lunch. the day would call for 6 employees but management would only schedule 4 for the entire day.
bad,"Not the company that Sam Walton Created"
bad,"At work someone was having a bad experience at the job and they needed help even the supervisor did not want to help that person and so when I was not busy I go help out as much as I can and do my part in the jobs."
bad,"I didn't like it all I felt like it took so much of my time and paid me so little and worked me so hard, I did like that half of the time they had to find work for us to keep busy some days we just walk around for hours in ""cleaning"" when there was nothing to clean we had to lock our phones up we had to walk thru mettle detector for no reason cause everything at the ware house  was house hold items not cell phones"
bad,Reason for leaving was they were going to fire me for needing surgery and that I would need 6 weeks off. No breaks and bathroom breaks were frowned upon. I didn't like being the only one there.
bad,If you need a job its a place to start. Management is not that great unless you enjoy being talked down to. I learned a lot about inventory and stocking shelves.
bad,Basically you can tell that management doesn't care that much about there employees no matter how much they say they do. The produce there is so rushed so uncared for nothing like the quality that was at united.
bad,"Every day start of shift I had to grab a radio, scanner, printer, and keys for my area. Then I would have to keep inventory count on the jewelry in my area, then I would start a planogram. With that I learned how to read planograms and I also learned till work, scanners and printers. Management was really poor do to the fact that it was someone in management was harassing me and other co-workers. I didn't have the chance to meet much of me co-workers but the ones I meet were great. hardest part working there was actually talking to management about the problems I was having but the most enjoyable part was giving customer serves."
bad,"did the same thing every night, management was never happy, no matter what you accomplished it wasn't not good enough, if your direct supervisor was yelled at by their supervisor then you were going to get yelled at."
bad,i hated working here i will never apply to wal-mart again management was bad coworkers were ok enjoyable part of day was a night
bad,"management was rarely seen when on the job, workers were often left alone to start job or even find work to do, if worker got over 40 hours a week he had to burn the overtime he could not get paid or earn comp time he has to sit there and burn the time coworkers were nice and friendly,"
bad,day to day would be cleaning my register keeping the money till clean and correct and delivering great customer service.
bad,The bottom line at Wal-Mart is that management expects you to get the job done no matter what. The goals are clear for each day and the the work had better get done.
bad,"i worked over night so it was very hard for me. "
bad,El trabajo comenzaba con la lista del personal eventual para la operacion del dia.
bad,Very Unethical company and I did not enjoy my time here. I was harassed every day by my supervisor regularly and nothing was done about it. My store leader was more worried about her bonus than the work life balance of her salaried employees forcing us to work longer hours so that she could meet her salary budget and still get the work done. Compensation package and 401k for salaried manager is great but I was not willing to miserable to get it. My family deserves better.
bad,It's a fun place to work and meet new people. It was a good experience to be able to meet needs for others in such a small way.
bad,I worked as an overnight stocker here. I liked knowing exactly what I had to do when I went in to work as the pallets of the items were already in my department and ready to go.
bad,"I really do not have much to say about Walmart. The things I have to say are not good, so I would rather say nothing at all. Walmart has no respect for their Associates, or their families."
bad,"A typical day at wal-mart when I worked there is as follows:"
bad,"Management insists that customer service is of prime importance, but they do everything possible to keep from living up to the verbal commitment. There are not enough associates on the floor to provide a good level of service. It is not clear to customers how to go about obtaining the services needed and any limitations there might be on the availablity of such services. The low pay and constant harassment of the first-level supervisors mean that anyone able to escape will do so. The quality of the first-level supervision negatively affects the motivation and satisfaction of associates., In spite of it all the associates on the floor are usually helpful to each other. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the frantic atmosphere generated by unreasonable expressed expectations, which may not jibe with actual realistic expectations. The most enjoyable part of the job are the occasions when one is able to make a reasonable customer happy, especially when appreciation is received."
bad,"walmart in saviers oxnard sometimes they don't care about their associates, but it's fun doing retail. co-workers are friendly,"
bad,"If you are looking for advancement and ways to move up in a company without a college degree, this would be the right job. If you need time off, vacation days, weekends, cannot do physical labor and not a fan of customer service; this would not be the best job."
bad,"Walmart is based on money!! They lost sight of what Sam wanted"
bad,"Wal-Mart is a wonderful organization, but Store #1300 is a horrible place to work. The management team is known to give preferential treatment to some employees and extremely aggressive and negative treatment to others. The environment is one of fear (for the employee) and disdain to anyone not in management. The production goals are often times unrealistic and when pointed out to management the answer is to get what you can done, but then you are ""reprimanded"" for incomplete work. There is no balance given for people who work in service areas and the realities of trying to balance customers and tasks assigned. While many of the fellow employees are wonderful to work with and extremely hard workers, the ""slackers"" seem to always need help at their expense."
bad,"my co-workers are easy to get along with and fun to work with. Management is gotten to be to pushy wanting more than you can do."
bad,"Bad pay  and bad hours, poor benefits if working under 32 hours week, which is typical. On the plus side, it is a job and does pay for some of the bills."
bad,"You will run all day long like a chicken with its head off. Management totally confused."
bad,"They dont care about their associates. Its all about the customers."
bad,at this job i didn't fit it was in a ghetto community and if you wasn't ghetto you didn't belong the managers played favoritism the people there was always stealing from the store or cheating their hours and it was always a fight in the store
bad,"Fast paste"
bad,It was a seasonal job. No benefits or good pay. Was not a professional or fun atmosphere. There was no respect given. Too many supervisors giving conflicting orders.
bad,"The only thing I liked about working here was the people that I worked with. I hated the way the employees were treated, I hated the pay and I hated how I was expected to take on more and more responsibilities without so much as a raise for it."
bad,"Typically, my day started with the baking the bread and donuts, soon followed by trying to get stocking done and prepare for next days baking."
bad,"Always busy ,except some weekday mornings. Always short staffed and occasionally managers do forget lunch and break times . They need to work more on organization.You have to deal with rude , angry customers all the time as well as coworkers. They need to work on morale and cleanliness of the store."
bad,"off load trucks using  forklifts and electric pallet jacks ,make sure all merchandise was sent to the sales floor in a timely manner while keeping a safe and clear work environment."
bad,"This was a very interesting place to work and it showed that it takes all kinds to make the world go round.  While the day to day work was fine, it was those wonderful little moments that made this job over the top.  Such as customers with very interesting quirks coming through a line or asking where the make up aisle could possibly be as they wander through chips and dips!"
bad,"In a well functioning store, being a Walmart ASM is a good job. The pay is decent in metro areas like Denver, but lacking in non-Metro areas. Local Corporate management is typically inept to solving problems. They will continue to throw untrained salaried managers at problems, and burn through literal millions of dollars in payroll and training, without ever attempting to solve a problem."
bad,"Wal-Mart, although a great company, did not have a great work environment. I felt the management team slacked in most of it's duties and that there was some unfair treatment towards coworkers of lesser paying positions."
bad,I guess it was ok. To me walmart is a big company that overworks and underpays it's employees. The managers want you to be trained on 50 things but only pay you for one.
bad,"You have many bosses that tell you what to do. Including other employees that have only worked there a few more months than you,and they feel they can yell at you in front of customers to try to tell you how to do your job,like its rocket science...You have to ask to go to the bathroom,and then wait for someone to come stand in for you,and they never send anyone. You wait past time for your breaks and lunch if you get one for someone to come and stand in for you. Feel like I am in elementary school again,this is not a respectable position at all,and you don't get treated like a grown adult. Normal jobs you can just go to the restroom when needed,and not ask for permission and not get told you have to wait till we find someone to stand there in your place. Then wait another 25 to 40 minutes and they have forgotten or never find anyone that wants to stand there. You get sworn at by customers. Because they are irritated to have to show their receipt after they just went through the check out line. Which I don't blame them,I thought my job was just to say hi and welcome them to store then again when they leave tell them to come back soon. It's mostly about making sure the cashiers didn't miss ringing up any items customers bought,but customers think that the greeter is checking to see if they stole something. It's an awful job. I don't reccomend it to anyone. There is nothing enjoyable about it. I have asked to be put in different position in another department but no one wants the greeter job so I get told I have to wait till they can replace me,and its been over 3 weeks since"
bad,"Nothing good to say. Be prepared to get an evaluation from some guy that's never even seen you work. Overall though, the quality of work is not that bad."
bad,"job very unsatifactory, management not supportive, lack of communication between departments, not enough employees to help with the customers needs"
bad,Wal Mart is not open to working with your schedule and management is sometimes not helpful.
bad,"Instead of getting to the root of a problem (staffing, policy changes, innovations) management is blindly blamed - especially middle management.  You are kept down, berated, and blamed for things outside of your control. There is no chance for advancement unless you agree to play dirty at the expense of the rest of your team.  Threats of losing your job were a daily occurrence.  I can't explain what an awful experience it was."
bad,"For the time the work environment was fulfilling and met the financial need of my lifestyle."
bad,"Answer all customer inquiries including questions, complaints, and product services."
bad,I'm a hard worker and enjoy to be noticed. With that said management was terrible. Falsified reports and loss of paper work resulted in unfair write ups and treatment. Truly a workplace of favoritism and overall just a bad company to work for.
bad,"Management is outrageous, and so is the operation of the company. Pay is too low, hours are not enough; this company barely pays enough to live. The only things that are good about this company are the benefits is provides, after a year or more. My current co-workers are the best, and make the work place more enjoyable. The hardest part of my job is dealing with uncooperative customers. The most enjoyable part is the people I work with. I've learned how a retail environment works, and how to use a cash register. I'm glad I have this job because it pays my bills, and I love the people I work with. But otherwise I do not enjoy working for this company."
bad,"A typical day at Walmart was just UGH! You clock into work, and stand at a register. The cashiers rotate registers, so you aren't stuck to just one register. When someone would clock in, you would go to a different one. Everything you do at Walmart, you need your badge, and you only get one free replacement for that. At Walmart, they don't schedule anybody under 4 hours a day at work. If you worked for 8 hours or more, you got two 15 minute breaks, and one, one hour break. If it was less than 8 hours, you only got one 15 minute break, or two 15 minute breaks. Everything there was just confusing. "
bad,"I am currently working here and I have to say that it is all that the reviews said that it would be. The management has no structure and the overall direction that the store is headed is down. A typical day in this store would consist of clocking in, headed to the meeting which depending on the manager on the shift for the night could be anywhere from 10-30-minutes. The meetings usually consist of everything the upper management had to say about their morning walk. It usually is bad news because as 3rd shift you are the clean up crew and you never do anything right. So after we get essentially ""critiqued"" we are assigned out aisles. This is where you get to find out where you are going for the night.  Sometimes the unloaders have all the freight on the floor and sometimes they don't. This is just a  peek into the world of Wal mart world. Want to find out more, feel free to apply because we are always hiring because we are also firing!! We are told to cut our overtime and they change your schedules at the drop of a hat and don't tell you. You can get a no call no show for a day if you were scheduled to be off for when suddenly you're scheduled to work.   Your welcome!!"
bad,"It is typical of management to encourage employees to engage in practices which are unsafe and against policy in order to get things done quicker. They will then instruct employees to ""fake it"" if a district manager is known to be in the area. Employees are not respected as people and face retaliation if they complain to higher management in the form of cut hours."
bad,Too much work jammed into too little time.  Very little appreciation for hard work.
bad,"I do enjoy the people I work with, however this is a dead end job with little opportunity for advancement."
bad,"Work was easy to do and learn, flexible schedule was a plus, and my fellow cashier's are easy to get along with. The job was not hard. Management lacked clear communication with cashiers when it came to implementing new store policies which tended to cause confusion not only for us, but for customers as well when we have to relay said changes."
bad,Pay not enough for the work u put out.It was a good team of people.
bad,This was just another job i did in my teens. Helped pay the bills and provided the necessities i needed for everyday life.
bad,The work is good as far as being dependable but managers treat you like slave. Its difficult to get ahead.
bad,"Since I have a B.A. I was destined for management from the start and treated as a manager figure by both upper level management and fellow associates alike but have yet to be given the management title in 18 months with company!  I have learned the Customer Service Management position and Fresh Area Dept. Manager positions however, Walmart has not acknowledged my accomplishments.  I have been sexually harassed and threatened and those people have continued to keep their jobs whereas mine has repeatedly been threatened!"
bad,I work hard. The job was very physical but it was sometimes rewarding because i was kept in good pysical shape.
bad,"There are days when this company can be good to work for, its hard to say now since there is so many changes going on with the company that I would say you should work for it, but the people you work with are great, the management team is a differently story, I am not going to talk bad about it nut just know that there is going to be difficult times in this company."
bad,"The job was ok, but management wasnt so great. They pay the bare minimum and are always cutting hours. They expect you to work multiple departments."
bad,"Only half of the managers know how to do everything.. everybody tries to run the company... most of the time you're not even doing what your job title is, your doing the total opposite!"
bad,"To be blunt, condescending management and little team morale made this place unbearable to work at."
bad,A typical the associate can expect to deal or handle any customer complaints or issues.  Also can expect to be micro manage from many Supervisors.  The hardest part of the job is unloading the truck and the rest of the job is not as challenging.
bad,They didn't work with my hours. i asked for as many morning shifts because i couldn't work nights due to the fact that i had just came from maternity leave and my son was still newborn at the time yet they gave me all night shifts. most of managers had bad attitudes and acted as though they were better than employees. They treat you like you have 8 arms continuously asking you to do like 3 things at one time.
bad,"Wal-Mart is a good job for young adults, especially ones in school. In my opinion it's definitely not a place to work long term. After three years I have not been approved for full time hours or complete  benefits. It also doesn't help when you're not appreciated by your management team. I'm not saying this is all Wal-Mart's, but definitely the one I work at."
bad,"typical day is to be yelled at by management"
bad,"The managers would hire people for cashier but only a few of them would show up so we would be very busy during most of the days, and this became very frustrating."
bad,"Walmart was just as bad as they're reviews. i loved the customers and my fellow employees even the work of stocking shelves was cool but, The Management is disappointing, if i could sum them up in a few words i would say cowardly, Demeaning, and unorganized. They would literally tell you to start something then the next manager would be mad you started that. They also completely ignored your availability sheet or cared that i was in school."
bad,"Es una empresa que entre mas preparacion tengas mas oportunidades de puesto y sueldo tienes,pero si no como es mi caso no vez el aumento de nada."
bad,Don't even think about it unless you desperately need a job!  Painful experience! Greed rules all!
bad,stocking heavy merchandise at high pace environment. High intensity and fast paced environment. Duties ranged from stocking to organizing to preparing store in all aspects as to present to upper management as well as visitors.
bad,"the best part of this job was my co workers and the customers"
bad,The work ethics of the company was not what they put out to the general public.
bad,no place for advancement; people okay. pay was okay to work.
bad,"Although, the work flow is steady and I was able to make a direct connection with customers. The hours weren't good and management at times treated associates very poorly. The pay rate should be raised for those with adequate experience in each dept."
bad,"Hard Work"
bad,my days consised of hard work dedaction there really wasnt much job advancment
bad,"I worked in Customer Service. Handled Customer complaints, refunds, check cashing, invoice payouts, currency transfers, checking customers out, sales. Management was very unorganized, always working never knowing what you were going to be doing the next moment........ Not respectful. The most enjoyable part about the day was meeting new customers everyday  and knowing when I let I did my very best."
bad,i was a customer service associate.. Management will make you enforce policies but wont have your back when customers challenge polcies
bad,"Fast paced job with dead end wages and minimal benefits."
bad,"Walmart doesn't care about the associates. It's what, and who can make the the most money.  They turn their backs on you in a split second. I would never recommend working for walmart."
bad,"Every day was different, could go in and have lots to do or could have nothing to do and end up standing around. Managers were never there when you needed them, never answered their phones or the overheard pages. Co-workers were fun but you really only meet the people in your own department, it would be nice to get to know everyone so that problems can get addressed more quickly."
bad,I worked here and love the type of work I did. However the company and our office did not have an open line of communication. Do to the lack of communication our residents and employees suffered the outcome.
bad,Used handgun to scan merchandise in and out the system. Scanned recalls and hazardous materials also.
bad,"A typical day at work is very fast paced and we have to get things done on a time limit.  The floor has to be stocked by 8AM, out of dates checked by 7AM, pizza wall filled by 7AM, rotisserie chickens have to be done by 9AM and all while we have very little help and still maintaining customer service."
bad,The workers take out items from the back and customer service.  Many workers work overtime during the holidays. Walmart is always hiring people.
bad,"Overall experience at this store is mixed. While the people and the benefits are good, the bad management can be hard to ignore."
bad,At this time i didn't do anything besides retail and i hated it. I love the fast pace about the job. I can work in a fast manor company and love doing it. I liked my management and co workers also
bad,walmart will help you all they can then through it back in your face blacking ouyt days not working with a school schedule cahnging thery schedule at any times notice and never contacting you then you get in trouble . they down grade your pay send you to a new department for no reason then put u on these weird hours like 2-5am then 8-12 am  then 6-9 pm all in ones day
bad,"Most customers were great there, but you had your few that would get under your skin, same with coworkers. Kept busy throughout the whole shift. I learned how to do a lot for never working in the deli. Management got under my skin quite often, but I made the best of it and did as I was told. There were some coworkers that were awesome to work for/with and then there were the slackers who got paid to do whatever they wanted. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with everything that management wanted done in a short amount of time and/or with limited amount of people. The most enjoyable part of the job, was learning new things, meeting new people, customers and coworkers that I could connect with."
bad,There were many occasions where employees that worked and went to school were told they had the choice of either the job or their schooling.
bad,"* I really liked the associates I worked with"
bad,"A typical day at Wal-Mart you clock in do your responsibilities and pay no attention towards others, besides your customers. I learned how to stay to myself and nothing can get in the way. My co-workers were fun to be around and hard-workers. The hardest part of the job was people not minding there our business and responsibilities. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to do my job."
bad,Walmart was always busy. Front lines always backed up. Never no one in the departments to help the customers or anywhere else in the store. The management is not good at all. You have to work all the major holidays except Christmas day (which they are trying to start staying open on Christmas day).
bad,"I worked for Wal-Mart, all of seven to eight months. And, the management is awful. Rude. Rude to customers, and employee's. They didnt train me. Stuck me out on the floor, and then coached me on not knowing what to do. Unprofessional."
bad,The place had a homing feel to it like I had been there all my life very nice company. I like the company but I want to do more with my life be able to provide for my family I was looking for a company I could see myself with for five years from now. The company is great for a temporary job I like the co workers and sometimes management.
bad,I would not recommend working for Walmart.  It is not a friendly place to work for.
bad,"A typical day at work was waiting on customers every need. I can say I learned a some more things about the register like, how to process checks and pay bills on the register. The management was ok I guess they really didn't understand sometimes things in your life happens that you have no control over and you have to deal with, and sometimes you might cant come in to work or you have to leave early. It just seem that wal - mart didn't allow you to have a life. It really wasn't anything hard about wal - mart I was use to it. I enjoy my customers as usual."
bad,"Assist with returns or refunds, money transfers, cash control, check cashing, money orders, inventory control, fast friendly and excellent customer service great communication skills. Supervise and unsupervised team work. I've learned in order to keep a company going employees have to make the biggest scarifies. I've also learned to better customer service skills and how to deal with irate people.  Management are the hardest people to get along with and are not at all understanding. co-workers are the second hardest people to get along with because they are over worked and under paid causing major tension in the work place. the hardest part is dealing with the many contradictions that go on. the most enjoyable part of the job is working with customers who appreciate our services."
bad,"i get in at 700am i pull my bread out of cooler i go the floor pull all out of date bread, then i begain to prep my bread . i bake all my bread then fill the floor with bread that is needed. i go into frezer put away my freight then breakout the bread for next day. take out the trash clean my area"
bad,"i did not enjoy my time at walmart, i always did my best to help the company and didn't feel appreciated for the work i did each day."
bad,"Just a very boring monotonous job, scanning items for 8 hours. Didn't enjoy it but it was a job. Poor pay/hours....."
bad,"I worked in both grocery and pet departments. The associates here are given too big of a workload to accomplish in one day and are even told to ignore customers and not help them. They allowed the fish to suffer and die rather than treat them with their needed medication. The hardest part of my job was to see these animals suffer needlessly due to lack of caring and personal responsibility from management. The best part of the job was the people, I have always enjoyed helping customers and seeing the happiness on their faces when I find just what they need."
bad,"Talking to management, getting the permission to complete the reset and or job at hand for the day."
bad,"Typical day; extreme physical labor, delayed breaks, conflicting managerial direction and feast/famine approach to staffing, blind-eye approach to safety hazards when conflicting with production goals and workload response."
bad,I hate this place! They haven't trained not one associate yet! The upper management don't even know what their doing. This company is sad
bad,"I've worked at wal-mart for just over two years, and have made my way into management.  It's not the worst place I have ever worked (Kmart) but it's not somewhere I'd hang out, if there was a choice.  I worked to management for FT and raised pay, but the stress of the absurd expectation, and having to deal with the dunghead teenagers every day isn't worth it.  "
bad,"Stressful work environment, management is doing stocker work"
bad,"I have worked for Walmart for 4 years and overall I have been very disatisfied with them. I have major issues with my wage, management capability and positions, and health insurance benefits deductibles are rediculous."
bad,that was an horrible experience for me loved the people overall dislike the task due for the job
bad,"I don't need to tell you about this corporation. What is has become is nothing like the original vision of the man behind the name... and today it cares nothing about its employees nor the local economies it devours. If the company can save a few pennies by sacrificing its employees, you better believe that it will do just that. Job application should include an application for government assistance."
bad,"Baked bread (pre formed bread/ frozen) so proofed cut and baked, some cake decorating (really enjoyed that , being able to be creative) good coworkers , management was very poor expected a crew of two on the weekends to get more then the crew of 6 we had during the week got done , was very understaffed and when we asked for help no one came."
bad,"Walmart on paper seems like a good company but there is a huge morale problem at every store I've been in. This goes back to management who is either under qualified, ignorant, or just overwhelmed with store expectations that they cant treat associates right. They aren't too bad concerning pay considering other places only offer minimum wage and no incentives but still don't offer decent wages. If you want a promotion you have to make a pain of yourself over years of working for them to recognize you and even then they only promote you one grade at a time even if you are overqualified. Even with a college degree they would not let me be an assistant manager, but instead gave me an overnight position as hourly supervisor. Talk about hitting below the belt"
bad,"Stock the shelf with item product"
bad,This place was not a great place. Sucked the life right out of you.
bad,"It all depends on the management at the store you are working at. i have worked with some of the best management and some of the worst,"
bad,big company but dont be ran like one. Assistant managers never on the same page. you cant be a big time company paying workers that work their butt off 7.25
bad,"This job is ideal for entry level work. You learn basic customer service skills. However, if you are an experienced worker, the politics, micromanagement and low pay are less than desirable."
bad,"I would say the most enjoyable part of the day for me would of been when id interact with the costumers. I'd meet so many new people in so little time, Id even have  consumers wait especially in line just to talk to me."
bad,The work was demanding. The management was poor. the co-workers was easy to get along with.
bad,"the work is hard. "
bad,"This is very hard work for very little pay, job gives you no recognitions, no promotions have been made in months."
bad,"A typical day at work would be an over load of work to be done and far too few team members.  I learned a great deal about being a leader, management stayed away from our department, and our supervisor had never been in a leadership position before.  I took the initiative upon my self to pull the team together, and get into a comfortable pattern for all my co-works to get everything done on time. The only time management would come back is to tell the team we needed to move faster.  My co-workers became like my family and closest friends, we worked hard to achieve our goal each night but it didn't stop us from sneaking in plenty of laughs to keep our minds from going numb. The hardest part of the job mainly was keeping calm and focusing on everything when more work was piled on as we were wrapping up for the night The most enjoyable would be all the people I met, and the great friends I made."
bad,"Employess got paid maybe a week later, due to their bankruptcy, I stayed cause i was pregnant at the time, decided not to go back"
bad,"After 6 years of working for Walmart, I am there only out of necessity. Within the last 6 years I have been stopped from moving up within the company on multiple occasions. The pay is terrible for the work that I do (I can work as many as 9 different departments as well as back room processing). "
bad,"at frist it was a good place to work but over the almost 7 years i was with them the additude towards the employees changed they no longer seemed to care about us and only seemed to give promotion to the associates that were ""yes men"" or friends with the right manager"
bad,worked 10-7 at night learned not to work there again management was very disorganized even the upper bosses disliked that store co-workers were good to get along with and good workers hardest part was staying awake through out the night most enjoyable was able to have fun conversations while working to stay active and awake
bad,"You clock in and boom! You already head deep into work. Trying to multitask here is crazy. When you got insurance to clarify and people trying to drop off prescriptions and prescriptions need to input then how you suppose to help anyone!? We are over worked! Multitasking can be up to 4 things being done at once, not simultaneously but at the most! Wal mart wants us to do more. Sometimes I have to stop myself so I can use the bathroom. I do not enjoy the job anymore. People are complaining about the wait time. Pharmacists are really being held responsible for too much. Health & Wellness will fall flat on its face within the year with all these new changes. Technicians are underpaid and so are the cashiers. When someone calls out sick, then we have to do their job as well. I am not saying the work is bad, but too much work in this type of field can literally kill someone! The corporate bosses don't realize that and probably have never worked in a base line pharmacy! It's time to get out and find a better and MORE rewarding career!"
bad,"Come in at 6:00 am some times the new load would be in or not! You don't know what you have until you see what's on the truck so what you need right now might be on there! Management wats the sales floor cleared by 7:00 am, but the load just got there, you have to have the room in the cooler to do that! That's why it's critical to stock as much as possible on the sales floor so you don't have to take it to the cooler in the back! Cooler was very small fighting for every inch of space! Management no one was trained in the produce department or co -workers either that was the hardest part! When I have everything I need to fill the department so it looks full at the end of the day when I'm leaving that's when I fell good about my department , well done!"
bad,"My review is based on my opinion only."
bad,"Keep you on your feet ,and busy thats a good thing ,because that make time go by fast."
bad,"Right off the bat I was told this would be a temporary job, even though the Maintenance workers were severely under-staffed. Deli workers stole our gloves, and trash bags because those working Inventory never seemed to order enough, same for the mop heads. I couldn't tell you how many filthy mop heads I had to keep using for more than a few days. And without gloves? Don't even think about it."
bad,"I did a lot at this job from customer service, cashier, cashing checks, making money orders, money gram as well as custodial. I was a team player but the job was very stressful"
bad,"never had enough employees"
bad,"Working at Walmart was something that I would probably never consider doing again. While some of the management and associate staff are quite helpful, others are not. You are consistently worked with little opportunities for advancement."
bad,Fun and I love the management we get 3 breaks and it can be stressful but Im doen for a challenge
bad,"Walmart stores is a good place for ones first job. I learned how to be productive. The management has alot to be desired. People I worked with were great with a few exceptions. The hardest part of the job was keeping busy. The most enjoyable part of the job, 1 hour lunches."
bad,I spent most of my time ring up customers items and the rest of the time cleaning up the store.
bad,I have been there six years. It's an easy job. Only get a raise once a year.
bad,I learned a lot at walmart.... but they treat their employees like a number on a piece of paper
bad,"it wasn't fun company doesn't appreciate workers, require you to do so much but really don't pay you anything."
bad,a typical day at work. learn the essential to perfom basic duties
bad,"Learn a lot, but no real direction or management of teams. Very little employee support. You definitely burn out. Overworked, underpaid."
bad,"Meeting different people, customer service, cash register working on holidays"
bad,"As a Apparel Sales Associate you learn to work as a team."
bad,"I come in (when I worked there) and go to my cash register I was Assigned to and begin to start my night."
bad,Working in retail is hard work its a good company to work for but bad management
bad,i pushed carts and stocked shelves worked well with the other employees
bad,"es una buena empresa al principio ya que te hacen mejorar de tu persona subiendote de puestos,pero al vez mala ya que te explotan exigiendote tiempo extras sin tu consentimiento haciendote que ya no tengas vida social y si no aceptas por el agotamiento te regañan por lo mismo tus vacaciones no te las dan almenos ellos lo acepten,aveces no tienes entre semana tus descansos y te pagan muy poco por ello.no te poyan mucho en los permisos cuando se te es necesario y suelen dar ostigamiento laboral del modo que aveces o te obligan a renunciar o te orillan con presion a que lo hagas."
bad,"A typical day at the Walmart garden center would consist of me going to the cash register three days a week, but then they assigned other tasks for me to finish throughout the day.  Not many cashiers liked to be on the register, so I would always be the one to volunteer to do it.  When trying to finish a task for the day away from the register, management would get mad at me for not being at right there even though they assigned me the tasks away from the register.  I learned how to balance tasks and register and how to force myself to like some people I worked with because otherwise I would not enjoy my day.  For the most part, my coworkers were great, and so were the customers.  There were a few people I worked with, on the other hand, who thought that they were the boss and would yell at me when I didn't finish a task and would get angry when I wasn't at the register trying to finish said tasks.  Management was a mess.  I never knew whom to listen to!  I was told by several different managers to do many different things and I would not know who to pay attention to.  I finished the tasks I had started before leaving, but there would still be a lot more to do.  The manager of the entire store told me I could not rearrange my schedule because ""this was my first job and I had rearranged my schedule too much in the past.""  I feel the most enjoyable part of my job was working on the register or watering the plants."
bad,"Good co-workers"
bad,its ok to work at if your a high school student you cant afford to pay your bills and work there ... vi gave good customer service and checked ids and stocked the tobacco products.. the people who were supposed to let me go on brake was always late
bad,"Horrible place to work. Management does not treat there employees with respect. Very odd hours, and horrible pay."
bad,Each day we would help customers and make sure the store and our departments were accounted for and presentable.
bad,"this job is for students and elderly people, as a single mother with a low income job it makes it hard to get by"
bad,"Nasty environment. the employees are filthy."
bad,"It's a decent enough first job. Some of the shift managers were pleasant to work for - hard working, considerate of availability and balance"
bad,Management does not know how to treat employees. Everyday was hectic and irritating. No one wanted to show you the ropes.  Everybody s selfish. Im not speaking about all Wal-marts. Only the one that I was employed by.
bad,The workplace had a bad vibe and the managers were not really respectful.
bad,"good entry level place to start, mostly just filled prescriptions and worked as a cashier"
bad,"Besides not being paid the way i shouldve, they are constantly cutting hours and corners just to save a buck. They do not care about their employees."
bad,"My team in the pharmacy, store management, & my personal directors were always upfront & honest"
bad,Walmart did not offer any growth in the company. They taxed more than they had to.
bad,I really didn't like working for this company the managers didn't care and it was a lot of worki to do
bad,thay whwere not helpful when i wqas going thoro a hard timee ini my life
bad,This is the most stressful job there. The fact that the coworkers are lazy and management is basically non existent speaking volumes. Their disregard for employee satisfaction is horrid and they only add stress onto others.
bad,"as semi-retired I decided to join Walmart,which is close to my home, was impressed with the extensive hiring process and the H/R dept."
bad,"Since I started in this company I have not received any formal training. There is no teamwork in this company, it seems that most people that work for this company are unprofessional and the management does not care. If you are a team player this company is not for you. The culture of this company is so full of complaints and poor attitudes. Its a culture shock for me!"
bad,late hours were too much and with weekends as well I never seen my kids
bad,"I learned a lot with this job.I stocked shelves helped customers. I would have stayed with this job but I was going to school and was in a bad car wreck so I couldn't come to work every weekend, so I was told I had to find a while back every weekend or I had to quit"
bad,Ok place to work if you just want a check and don't care about climbing the ladder.
bad,"Asked management many times about advancement opportunities and was given excuses until finally told I would not be able to advance until years later. Have a degree in business and worked in the most meaningless position. Co-workers and atmosphere were good and enjoyed going to work everyday. Great for people looking for long term work, but not much room for growth."
bad,"Over worked and underpaid. Management ignores the issues and expects employees to do the job of 6 people while they stand around watching you work. Its hard to have a life after working full time hours even with a consistent schedule, because by time you get home, you've been worked so hard you don't want to do anything."
bad,Walmart doesnt care about employees they just care about money
bad,It was interesting to work there.  Not much else to say about it.
bad,You will work freight everyday and wait on customers when they need help finding something in the store.  I learned to make sure you have everything done that you are told to do.  Management is alright. The co-workers are awesome to work with.  The hardest part is getting everything done that management asks you to do in your eight hour shift.  I can not think of one enjoyable part of the job.
bad,my manager was not professional an turned my time at work from joyful to dreadful .
bad,"A typical day starts at work that I usually end up working on a individual basis.  I have learned to manage people up to 150 individuals at one time.  Additionally, the management team working there can be good or bad depending on the individual.  My co-workers are usually great to work with.  The hardest part of the job is making sure things are done before the customer enters the store.  I would say the most enjoyable part of my job is working with the public."
bad,"working freight, helping customers, register operation, binning overstock, receiving shipments, for multiple areas"
bad,It all depends on your management.  I had a awesome manager but a slack supervisor in the department that I worked for. It can be either be really good with low pay or just bad all around.
bad,"Poor place to work for with poor management, no time and a half bonuses when working holidays, make you work full time hours while employed as a part time employee. recommended not a choice for a career."
bad,managed a crew of 15 while maintaining a great work ethic and fast paced environment.
bad,walmart was a great job I was a cashier a team player and a leader it waws a fun workplace with a upbeat pace
bad,"A typical day included getting supplies to begin the day with, communicating with my supervisor about tasks for the night, stocking of merchandise and completing tasks that were added to the nightly work expectations. "
bad,not the best job but it was a job. needed to be available 24/7 or wouldn't really receive any hours for the weeks maybe 8-15 per week.
bad,Understaffed and over worked. expectations are unreasonable. work is frustrating and people quit often. Management seems to be confused
bad,"A typical work day for me would include the following tasks; To assist customers by delivering high quality customer service; stock consumable goods; keep grocery aisles clean and free of debris; check out customers at point of sale terminals as needed. What I have learned in these three years of working at this company; I learned that a simple smile and maintaining a positive attitude and spirit will go along way. Also, sometimes it was reciprocated by the customer and they would say ""Keep Smiling, It really made my day.""That made me feel Great; because I know that I am delivering high customer service. I love my co-workers; I am a team player. One thing about my co-workers that is beneficial is that we support one another in our endeavors. I feel that the hardest part of my job is knowing that the managers do not appreciate their workers but overall what motivates me is the supportive environment and taking the time to strive for excellence each day."
bad,The work environment is decent but I work all the time for terrible pay.
bad,"The company as a whole may be a great place.  However,  the store I worked at was poorly run and unorganized.  We were asked to work off the clock and forced to work off the clock.  I did enjoy the work and the associates that I worked closely."
bad,The Autozone corporation is very political and is not supportive of their employees.
bad,"Poor pay, and horrible management. Stock so much product in your 8 hour shift and see no raises."
bad,"Managers don't care"
bad,This job was just for a passing phase. The job was ok for the task performed. It just wasn't the place I saw my self within the next five years. I worked only 30 hours a week there.
bad,I didn't like working at Walmart that much. Only reason I stayed was because it was across the street from my school and my best friend was working there and of course it was a check to help pay for my tuition.
bad,"This employer has only one major flaw and that flaw is that no one cares much about anything, one must lower their standards just to maintain sanity and happiness and thus loos work ethics and the ability to be proud of what you do"
bad,The long hours standing weren't fun. And working 38 hours per week did not help me as they did this to withhold benefits.
bad,Management isn't very good. Not a lot of communication between management and employees.
bad,put frozen meat out and help people with what they need .... i really love my job and the people i work with.
bad,a typical day at work i was a cashier i had learned alot like customer service. the hardest part of the job was when it was too busy in i didnt have the right change to give to the cusotmer the most enjoyable part is when i have a full line in i get the customer right by scanning the items in getting them to there next deisation
bad,management over the store manager sucked and would do anything to save their behind
bad,Bad experience working here. Great coworkers. Poor management.
bad,"Most of the people at the two Walmarts I worked at were great. They made working there enjoyable. Management there just seems to want to skate by on doing the minimum. It just seems like the less you do there, the more you make as well as the higher position you obtain.Tasks are always given with impossible deadlines and if you get someone higher than you that only caters to their inner circle(s), good luck getting ahead. Love Walmart, love the vast majority of the people there, don't like the methods they use for promoting and they're lack of discipline demonstrated."
bad,I would not go back to this company for employment they do not respect their associate.
bad,"It was just a normal cashier job, nothing special. I learned stocking, and register. My co-workers were nice and friendly. The job was fairly easy. My managers and I had some disagreements. The fun part of the job was meeting new people."
bad,"poor management"
bad,"Challenging place to work with it being retail and having to deal with public and not so nice customers on a daily basis.  Management staff in all departments do not tend to communicate well with each other, which then leads to the associates on the floor receiving conflicting information and job tasks."
bad,"Depends on the store, mine is not the best. Can be boring and can be exciting but mostly stressful."
bad,"There were many times where a lot of associates would go way beyond their limits when asked to do for the company and in return we got cut hours and was cheated out of our pay, i think the benefits were completely unfair to those who were only part-time. I didnt like the fact that because people had the higher position that they can say and do anything that they wanted and we had to listen to them or other wise we would get written up for being insubordinate."
bad,"This job tough me to move extremely fast and how to handle large crowds of people. It got extremely busy at the beginning of the month and during holidays, you never knew what kind of day it was going to be but you had to stay positive and calm no matter what happened."
bad,"Finding equipment to start scanning"
bad,Good place to work. Does not pay well. I would not suggest working there long term.
bad,it was a horrible job the customers at my store were the worse and the restrooms were always in need of cleaning because we were understaffed over half the time i was working there
bad,"Walmart, despite its position as a successful retail giant, has many issues behind the scenes that cause issues for its employees on a daily basis. Long work weeks are designed to fall just barely short of full-time, causing employees to be held off on longer waits for benefits. Shifts are often placed on nights and weekends for flow teams and receiving, meaning that having a social life and working the backroom just don't mix. Turnover is high, thanks in part to a mediocre workplace environment, often poor management, and poorly screened hires. I will preface this next statement by saying that some managers in Walmart stores are excellent; however, many of their managers do not have their jobs thanks to previous experience, but rather thanks to management courses provided by Walmart which do not always provide the experience to be a truly effective store manager. As a receiving associate, I watched managers directly contradict each others' instructions, and even re-order products twice over because they couldn't communicate that product orders had been filled already. Some minor safety guidelines were bypassed for convenience, and many a corner was cut by employees and managers alike for little to no gain for the store, sheer laziness at its finest. However, this debacle is saved by many of the employees, good people who band together and ride out the storm that is working at Walmart."
bad,Employees work so hard just to barely survive and store doesn't pay enough hourly.
bad,During  the day i would unload trucks one box at a time place them on skids then if there was a second truck unload that one and then after we wrap the skids and pull them to the floor to there specific places. The managers were not very helpful and the co-workers were rude.
bad,"A typical day was cooking, cleaning, and customer service. I learned nothing, management wasn't there most times, and my co-workers didn't like the job either. The hardest part of the job was the emotional impact of dissatisfaction. The most enjoyable part of the job was going home."
bad,"For me this was a job to fill in the blanks, i needed a job and i couldn't find anything else. I am use to working with my hands, fabricating so this really wasnt for me."
bad,I did not like this place i do not have much to say about this work place.
bad,"I worked at Walmart for less than a year. I was laid off, with almost 30 other employees, on the day before I was eligible for benefits. The work was easy and this was meant to be a temporary job while I was in school, but I did not appreciate the constant degrading comments of the head manager on my shift. The hardest part of my job was how I was treated. Her attitude caused a high turnover rate and was the reason the other managers at night took a pay decrease and stepped down from their positions so that they did not have to deal with her."
bad,"What I have learned working in this place to become a better team player. This job I have learned a lot from interacting with my co-workers what is acceptable and not acceptable in a work place. I have a lot of respect for my co-workers and I feel sorry for everyone that management doesn't seem to care about any one of us. We all try our best to live up to their rules and expectations that seems to change every day. We have had people quit because the work load is too much and this intimidates new people why they usually never end up lasting. I work hard in my department to help ease the tension off my other co-workers but sadly this place is not my calling. As much as I like my co-workers I cannot stay here for them, I have to think of myself and my goals. I want to get my art career off the ground and explore the limitless opportunities that is just waiting around the corner. I know it is not easy to find a job in my field of computer animation but I am optimistic that I will find something eventually."
bad,Overall my experience at Wal-Mart has been a pleasant one. Although there were some good days there were also a few bad as with any job you learn to take those days with a grain of salt. I personally am ready for a career where I can grow with the company and I am just not sure that Wal-Mart is the right company for me anymore.
bad,"Not the best place to work, but its a start. Picky about letting you off when you need off, managment won't always provide the help you need, CSM's like to give you coachings in front of everyone instead of pulling you to the side. My most enjoyabe moments are when customers come through and have interesting conversations with you. Especially the older customers, they're the best."
bad,it pays the bills with the pay given. The work is not too bad if you get little to no direction from management as they really do not know what they are doing some of the times.
bad,Get to work in the morning and unbox a lot of product putting them on shelves. Got assigned various tasks through out the day so every day was different. The management was not done very well at all. My co-workers were amazing and I am still friends with a few of them even after leaving. The hardest part of the job was lifting mowers and grills off the shelves for the customers each weighted between 25lb-200lb. Most enjoyable part of it was getting to work outside during the summer time.
bad,I love my customer but rare I will get a rude customer. My co-worker is fun be around and I love please my cu
bad,it was seasonal positions so there is no much to say about it I did not work there long enough to give a proper rating
bad,I had a very difficult time working for Walmart that included being randomly cut down to 12 hours a week and being switched positions for evening to early morning. I was lied to about returning to my previous hours and railroaded out the door.
bad,"A position as assistant manager at Wal-Mart is exactly what you think it is going in. "
bad,"Typical retail store,"
bad,this wwas my second job and i really enjoyed it but i feel like i could do better.
bad,"As a cart pusher, the job was just awful. You can never work hard enough, theres always more work to do, and you need to consistently work hard. "
bad,poor management. very low pay. try not to find a career in this company.
bad,"Poor pay and pay increases, treated terribly by management and customers alike.  Established a strong connection with many of my coworkers, both by virtue of similar interests and being under the same degree of suffering at the hands of managers and customers, and that is most of what has kept me here.  Worked hard, was scolded for not working even harder and in the exact manner that my managers wanted.  Frequently pulled to other departments that I had no experience in."
bad,"When I first started working at Wal-Mart, I felt like I was apart of the team. As if my inputs mattered. After awhile, all of the previous managers changed. At this point, I felt as if I didn't have a voice. Every time I asked the manager something, I would get a smart answer that didn't even answer the question. I just felt useless to the company because the things that I could do, I wasn't doing. I knew the job of being a picker/puller, and when I asked for that job opening, I was passed up. The job was given to someone who didn't even want the job. One day, I had went to the new GM of our store and asked if I could apply for the cashier job that was opened. He told me, ""NO."" and left it at the without explanation. The one thing that I didn't enjoy too much was working under four managers at the same time, and all of them telling me four different things to do. And every time I told them what the other manager told me to do, I would get in trouble. I was able to work with all my co-workers. Sometimes, instead of going to the managers for help, which by the way were the hardest people to find when you needed them, they would often find me and I would help or guide them."
bad,"Working at Wal-mart in Sumter was, in all honesty, horrible. Management was rude, refused doctor notes. It was an easy job all around but the atmosphere was just awful."
bad,"I enjoyed the work I was required to do, especially dealing with the customers however, they have very low wages and provide you with very few hours. if you have a family this is not a great place to work."
bad,"Hired in at $8.20 an hour.  Three months later my hourly rate dropped to $7.90 then 12 months later I got a .40 cent raise, I thanked them for the dime raise..."
bad,"Haines city is the worse store in the state of florida. Ghetto Friendly! "
bad,Pushing carts during the day and assisting the customers when needed.
bad,"Folded clothing"
bad,"A typical day for me would be walking my area seeing the changes that need to be done. Checking to make sure my Department Managers are scanning and doing their daily functions. Checking for new merchandise in the backroom to take to the floor that customers may want to buy. Morning meeting to receive notes to add to my notes to delegate or do myself while still providing excellent customer  service. I've learned how to work with others and how to listen to their needs instead of acting like i care actually going above and beyond to show them by, helping with their assignments or helping them solve problems so that they can get through their day. As a manager I have to listen, be a role model, show integrity, responsibleness, strength and willingness to get the job done with a smile. The hardest part is going to my upper management team with a problem and instead of them being a willing and listening party they  always have to display the negative and push back as if my concerns are not important to them, that's why when my associates come to me I make sure i figure out a way to be helpful or at least take time to see  what the problem is before i show I don't care. The most enjoyable part is when I go above and beyond to help a customer and they see it and and really appreciate my help but being able to satisfy drives me and put a smile on my face"
bad,"Reduction in staff especially full time means not enough skilled help who cares to get things done, management scrambling to get things done and being stressed constantly. Some managers were actually nice and still human beings but some obviously play favorites. Company is trying to put too much work on less people while still expecting the same standards they had 8 years ago. They need to figure out that the recession is over and start actually staffing the stores again."
bad,"A typical day, started with putting away freight, if needed run the register, helping customers and front and facing the inventory. teamwork, makes jobs more manageble, and you can accomplish, more in less time, if doing it alone."
bad,"I would start my day organizing the front store before we opened, I would do cashering and returns and also with customer complaints"
bad,"The job was ok, the only downfall was the management. I enjoyed working with customers and working with teams when I had the chance. The manager were rude and expected unreal work in unreal time."
bad,"Departments are constantly behind due to lazy, under paid, or under employed people. There are a handful of good managers, but most are condescending, unorganized, uneducated, and unethical, among other things. Same thing as far as customers, and they will try to start fights with the employees or lie just to get free stuff. Co workers are mostly nice people but are stressed out a lot which makes them grouchy. There are a few pros to this job- you rarely have to think, you learn to appreciate decent people, and if you're crazy enough to want to move up in this company all you have to do is kiss a lot of butt... No intellect required!"
bad,"Low pay, hours were frequently cut to reduce payroll.  Typical workday involved ordering product, assisting customers, and making department look tidy."
bad,"The associate are so friendly and kind, but the management of Walmart is horrible! They don't have respect for anyone and they are constantly putting people down, when they want certain people to step down they make it impossible for them to do their job so they finally give in. They don't give department managers the help that they need and they are so horrible to associates that they cant keep Walmart fully staffed."
bad,"Learned a lot about retail"
bad,It is a busy atmosphere which I like to stay busy. I learned that when you have to many managers that what you actually do at work gets complicated when all the managers are not on the same page. I enjoyed my customers and working with my co-workers.
bad,"The job itself is an amazing experience. Working with the people is amazing. Management team needs to work on how they work with their associates and customers. Management needs to also work on how they represent themselves as a team and they need to collaborate together to choose one particular way something needs to get done. One member of management doesn't need to make a decision unless management higher than them is aware and agrees to the change. A typical days at work includes giving breaks, money and keeping up with and to all the front end associates. I make sure they have what they need when they need something. My past five years I have learned how to successfully manage a team and provide great customer service in a timely manner. My fellow coworkers are amazing they make my day great. I have very good standing relationships with all my immediate fellow associates. I love the fact that I can make my customers day just by being courteous and asking how they are and if they found everything they were looking for. I love that I can make a crying child in a register line or at the service desk happy just by saying something to them. I enjoy being the last face a person sees when they are leaving."
bad,The job itself was typical however there were unrealistic expectations on associates to meet deadlines and work more then was required. managment did not communicate well with one another causing confusion.
bad,"A typical day at Wal-Mart was checking out customers and ,greeting them. I've learned that its always nice to greet customers with a smile even itf they don't greet you back. Management at the company was Ok I feel as if you were over worked and under paid. Co-workers were somewhat dramatic at times but if you stay to yourself but friendly you will be fine. The hardest part about this job was when it was very busy its busy you have a long line of customers and some got frustrated. The most enjoyable part was checking out customers in a timely fashion"
bad,"Would never work here again, pay sucks for a multimillion dollar company, no over time ever,"
bad,"- Worked for an overnight shift for 10:30hrs for 3 to 4 days a week."
bad,"horrible management, co workers were worthless, only thing i liked was deorating cupcakes and cakes"
bad,Assisted custers with selection of jewlery and pierced ears. Learned how t set up displays and how to selced
bad,"A typical day was not full of smiles. It wasn't very organzied and management was not too pleasant. Breaks were late always and as disorganzied as it appeared, fairness diminished. In my personal opinion, I did not enjoy my job."
bad,"same thing slow over nights, not many customers, being in the backroom all night with no one but a couple people and a radio, fast paced during inventory love that, and the having to focus and count and be accurate, but the down side was anytime a manager would come to over nights they would never be on the same page as anyone else there was no steady managing, there was no consistent staffing. One shift would want it one way when another shift wants it another way, but over all I liked the physical challenge of the job the most it would challenge math skills, challenge your physical abilities."
bad,I typically go in working in electronics and  provide customer care. I'll help customers make buying decisions based on their needs and after i'll take my lunch come back and do that the rest of the day.
bad,I work from 11.pm till 6am iwas a long night the hardest part of the job is to stock the shelves to get ready for the customers next day and to clean up. but I learn a lot from my boss to keep focus on the job at all times.
bad,"very poor management, never had enough time for lunch, people are very rude to you there"
bad,"I have never worked somewhere where managers and people are consciously moving or leaving the store for another or leaving the company.The high number of turnover didn't surprise me,I didn't enjoy how management could neglect people in their department and offer no solution to the problem but to fire and pick someone for a postion  they like.I was never trained well nor was i able to perform my own job as a result they let me go,but I have seen how they run and how badly things are their i was glad to be out of their and that environment.Honestly speaking i feel they are corrupted company and corporation.To pay people 9 or 10 and hour and pay all these managers 25 to 30 an hour is just corrupted."
bad,"A typical day at work for me was standing behind a cash register, ringing customers product through for them to pay. "
bad,"Une journee normale de travail consiste a remplir les tablettes et repondre a beaucoup de notes des adjoints et superviseur."
bad,"The days are usually the same nothing new really. My job is to bring in carts from outside the store and downstairs in the parking lot, and to also  assist customers with large merchandise. Another part of my job is to also clean up any spills that have happened in the store."
bad,"Unbelievable. In an industry that is to communicate with people, store managers ironically degrade employees beneath their job title, seem to propel personal an irrelevant agendas, create impractical surplus of duties and do not appreciate employees of hard work. Customers would be disgusted at the reality of how employees are treated behind the consumer curtain at this establishment. "
bad,Awful.... The pay is too low for all of the work they have you do. Not worth it
bad,A regular morning for me is working on the front-end and not having enough cashiers to cover shifts. Customers are rude and management is unorganized.
bad,easy to keep a lot of costumers you have to keep on top off as well as your tasks easy to keep  your department clean just anytime hard
bad,"On a typical I stock items, answer customer questions, and work with inventory management. Occasionally I will work as a cashier. Working here I've learned inventory management and time management skills. Management turns over too quickly to be consistent. Most will help if you have a problem and they tend to give reasonable tasks. My coworkers are a bit gossipy and tend to complain a lot. Turnover is predictably high so there are constantly a large group of new faces. The hardest part of the job is staying interested in my work. Most of what I do seems kind of pointless in the grand scheme of life. The most enjoyable part of my job is the conversations I have with a few of my coworkers, and working with my current department manager. She moves at a fast pace and the days seem to go quicker anytime I get to work with her,"
bad,"The most rewarding part of this job is the amicable associates you work alongside everyday.  Though, this in contrast to the ineffectual way they complete their tasks leaves something to be desired."
bad,"I work from 10pm until 7am two to five days a week, cashiering and stocking a walmart grochery store. The management as well as coworkers are very team oriented and fun to be around. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers but I did it in a respectable fashion. The most enjoyable part was the structure. They tell you what to do at the beginning of the night, you have your list and no one bothers you unless there are extra tasks to be done."
bad,"very fun enjoyable work place."
bad,"Good for getting that 1 to 2 years of job experience that applications ask for, that's about it. Management can be very hit or miss."
bad,Normal walmart issues that is expected with any job at Walmart
bad,Era responsável em fiscalizar a loga carimbamento de notas fiscal os colegas eram bons
bad,"are given project to be done in a timely manner and when there is not enough coverage you are expected to finish the project, provide customer service and run a register as needed, which is all the time because there is NEVER enough cashiers.."
bad,"very busy, productive and a lot of work, with the right mind set you can do it."
bad,A very horrible workplace. Didn't learn anything while I was at Walmart that I didn't already know. My co-workers were hard to work with a majority of the time but I kept focused an always got my job done.
bad,the review summary sums it all up there really isn't much to say ....like I said it's Wal-mart....and what most people see about Wal-Mart well that's how it really is
bad,Management sucks. walmart isn't like it used to be 10yrs ago.co workers not friendly to other co-workers.
bad,"A typical day at Walmart is continuously greeting  & cashing out customers in a respectful manner. I work well with all my co-workers.  The hardest part of the job is when we run out of (large bags), that is for customers with large items/and or purchases.  The most enjoyable part for me personally, is greeting the customers w/a smile, good personality, respect and patience. After all, like I tell the customers,  I'm there to wait on you, not to rush you."
bad,The work was good and it helped me to learn a lot about being a cashier and working in a fast paced environment.
bad,A typical night at Walmart would be calmed and easy depending on the pallets that we had. the most that I learned from Walmart was to work with a team more because working with a team things get done quicker. The management at Walmart was pretty good also but sometimes not on specific day. Some of my co workers could make the job stressful but if you have the right mind statement it wont get to you. The hardest part of being  a stocker was doing the job when your the only one there. The most enjoyable part of this job was taking your break when your ready but only if it was before 4.
bad,A typical day at work would be starting off by checking daily job assignments. Completing assignments in the required time given while helping customers.
bad,"Long hours, poorly made schedules, and extremely low pay. I was told I was seasonal only days before my assignment ended, leaving me without a job completely unexpectedly."
bad,Walmart Is an okay job to work for but when you have responsibilities you cant really count on walmart pay and hours
bad,High turn over rate. Training is necessary but not given in manner that helps employee's suceeds
bad,The management teams are all against one another there no leadership and accountability held. I have learned before working with a company I would like to know every area of the store so I will be able to help others when needed.
bad,"Clock-in, stock shelves, go help at registers when busy, help in pharmacy if they were short handed, carry-out, answer phones in dressing room area, sweep and clean, organize, customer service"
bad,"trabalhar de mais pouco remuneração muito cobrança, e muita gente com dor e reclamando do supervisor e gerencia."
bad,"O horário era ruim, o salário era muito baixo, tinhamos q fazer funções que nao tinham nada a ver com o nosso trabalho."
bad,"I would love to work for the corporate office to try and make some changes but I know I need more education.  A typical day at work is to arrive about 15-30 minutes early.  I have learned that performance of your duties are not taken as individual achievement but everyone is treated the same.  While I think management is very friendly, I do not find them to be approachable or helpful.  My co-workers are very friendly and knowledgeable for the most part.  But I have seen a lot of short cuts taken.  The hardest part of the job would be learning the different ways in which to do things.  You are being trained one way but when you are on the floor you learn to do it differently in order for it to be more efficient.  The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting the different people.  The majority of the people are so friendly and nice, I really enjoy talking with them."
bad,the hardest part of my job was staying awake and focusing on my job but i done it and i likd it because we got an hour for break my co-workers including no one because u worked aloneand the hardest part of my job also includedputting up with people that is never satisfied
bad,"Hours were never the same.  Sometimes started at 7am, sometimes 5pm...ever knew.  If management got irritated by you, they would cut your hours, or give you bad shifts.  Too many managers...you had to answer to two to 5 managers in one shift.  You had to know each manager's way of doing things as they wanted.  Never dismissed when shift was over-if it was busy, they would let you keep working forever!!  Nice if you wanted the hours, but bad if you had somewhere else to be.  Hardest part of the job and most enjoyable was the customers...they could be the nicest person you ever met, or a venomous snake...and you never knew what you were going to get!!!   No time for getting to know your co-workers, as breaks and lunch were very strict.  Most co-workers were more helpful than management!!  I learned how to work under a lot of pressure and stress!!  Also learned how to run a cash register, and get good at it."
bad,only work for Wal Mart if you want to be the store general manager otherwise you will make a low salary and hate your job. nobody is happy at Wal Mart.
bad,"ruim acesso a empresa para ir trabalhar mas para voltar tinha condução,bom relacionamento com os colegas de trabalho."
bad,I enjoyed working overnight stocking shelves and working as a team with my coworkers
bad,unloaded the trucks and palletized the laon and moved the pallets on to the floor.
bad,"Long hours"
bad,"Pros: coworkers are helpful and nice for the most part; they train you more than your supervisors or managers ever will."
bad,"You are supposed to have a team of 10/12 people unloading these delivery trucks. However we only had 5/6 and most of the time we would have no shows. The managers were terrible, completely disregarded our lack of workers and treated everyone like children. Coworkers were all angry people that called out most of the time. Hardest part was trying to make the daily time limit when 80% of the team called out of work. Enjoyable part was the lunch breaks."
bad,"walmart is a job, not the best but it was a job that paid the bills."
bad,good stepping stone job if you wish to work in retail chance for advancement
bad,I like the job I didn't intend to remain long but it was a learning experience and a stepping stone
bad,"•	Stocked and rotated grocery items while providing customer service"
bad,"Bad management, bad environment, not good pay, to much expected each night"
bad,"Company is very busy and you end up learning a lot of new things.  There is a lot of discrimination within the company.  They don't care if you have a family emergency, they count that against you, and that can get you fired. There are no real advancements, they pay only minumum wage, no benifits what so ever."
bad,"Treat employees horrible."
bad,the main associates i worked with where all good people but the people to work ratio needs to be fixed but that would be easier if they paid more. every one has a sense of humor and most work really hard but keeping up with the slow pokes was the hardest part of the job.
bad,"Good co workers"
bad,"things during the day were routine"
bad,Not a challenging position. Very under paid for the responsibility. Managers are not trained well.
bad,"Merchandise food products, inventory control, ordering of products on a bi daily need. Assisted customer with products ranging from locating to special orders. "
bad,"learned about sales,purcheses ,very relaxed working relation with co workers,and good puplic relation."
bad,Walmart is not a good place to build a career. The value placed on employees is very low.
bad,"Was ok working there, was treated ok, until a few employees carried on in appropriately during work hours, instead of working they would be flirting back and forth on company time.  one was rude to customers and other employees, telling them to shut up a fair amount, and insulting other employees in front of customers.  Complaints were made, and those that made the complaints suffered rather than those causing the issues.  Management was friends with most of the employees, so if you didn't fit in and weren't part of their facebook cliche there and at work, you didn't matter.  Of course you did matter when one wanted a day off work, or such, and then of course they suck up to you to take their day for them, knowing they aren't going to do the same for you when needed.  "
bad,OK pay but management did not work around availability like they said they would. Showed favoritism towards certain coworkers.
bad,"Cashiering, Making sure everything scans right with the right price, price checks"
bad,"A day at work with walmart was simple, manage the grocery departments.I  Iearned to have more people skills. management was easy. MY co- workers were friendly and very helpful. The hardest part of the job was the low salary because of all the long hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was when shopping, knowing where everything was and when there would be discounted."
bad,Upper management required all salary employees to work long hours without taking time off as needed.  They put the district managers at risk from having them drive after only a few hours of sleep.  Decided to lay off or terminate the district managers after they filed to go union.
bad,"I am a Connection Center sales associate, a typical day consisted of maintaining certain requirements around the department like maintaining daily logbooks such as the Cell phone logs and Ipad logs. Helping customers make and informed choice on cell phone devices and other electronics. Setting up customers on various cell phone plans. Since electronics and connections are in the same area i am also cross referenced as and Electronics associate. The hardest part of my job is when there is a lack of coverage. The department becomes very busy and it can be very overwhelming at times. Another problem was lack of knowledge about electronics from my coworkers. The most enjoyable aspect of my job is the perk of getting to experience new electronics. I love technology so i like being in a department full of it."
bad,Loved my job and the work I did. Hated the stress put on us by management. I loved the people I worked with and the customers we helped on a daily basis. Bad parts were management would not give days off requested even if requested well in advance. They also didn't staff well enough and we always worked shorthanded. This put a lot of stress on workers. Keeping customers happy and keeping them coming back was the most fulfilling part of my job. Seeing that smile on customers face made it all worth it.
bad,Working at Old Navy was the first job i had and it was only a summer job because I was in high school also.
bad,"No Comment. "
bad,"the most enjoyable part of wal-mart is showing up being part of the team to help the customers"
bad,"Stocking, cash register, customer service"
bad,Didn't like working here only would get like 10 hrs a week and get paid 6.25
bad,Cashed people out and helped with merchandise on a dialy basis.
bad,This store has an amazing set of managers. People who will work with their crew to the best of their ability without crossing corporate guidelines. It's hard to find a management staff that shows the compassion that these managers showed.
bad,meu primeiro emprego de carteira assinada muitas coisas novas a aprender com colegar da aria
bad,Unruly customers managers dont care about you. No benefits.
bad,I liked working in the deli but Walmart's policies about not accepting Dr. notes as a valid excuse is what lead to me parting ways with the company.
bad,"Stocking and shelving product, price checking and assisting customers and associates."
bad,This is a good place to start out when looking for positions in the retail world. I did not have a lot of great experiences working here as other employees and managers acted very unprofessional in a lot of ways and were not very good at communication. They also did not provide a lot of good training.
bad,My  experience with walmart was satisfactory and I would work there  again
bad,"I only worked a couple months, but in that time i did learn alot about walmart. To walmart, you are a number not a name, they dont care about you they just care about sales. I worked in the back and my supervisor tried to make it fun and he did a really good job in what would otherwise be a very boring job."
bad,"Estou fazendo faculdade então o horario das 15:30 as 23:50 era muito puxado pra mim, "
bad,Not a good company to work for. You do not receive anything but harsh and cruel feedback
bad,I really enjoyed my co-workers.  Management on the other hand is a totally different story.
bad,Very interesting work that allows you to see a difference being made in everyday people's lives.
bad,"Worked as a cashier providing a fast friendly checkout while utilizing excellent customer service skills. Worked in both the money and customer service centers in training to be a CSM (customer service manager). Kept a nice and tidy work environment, cleaned counters, provided bags to entire front end, and many other various jobs as directed by management."
bad,I didnt like Walmart because Management was always leaving and going home early without saying anything to the employees
bad,Worked as a cashier and did other duties at the store. This job is ideal for those needing a little extra money but not looking for a career.
bad,My typical day included being in the back room stocking inventory and pulling orders as one of the most experienced inventory control specialist working for them at the time. I have learned that hard work doesn't pay off for this company because I would come in on my days off just to be able to manage financially. With my personality I can get along with anyone so my co-workers were great and loved being around me. Working 3 times harder when co-workers called out on busy days was the hardest part of the job because there were a million things do do in such a short window of time. Being proficient at my job was the most enjoyable part of the job.
bad,I decided that working for walmart was not for me. I was only given night shifts at minimum wage. I do not believe walmart is very good to their employees.
bad,"Checking out customers was my responsibility, as you can imagine I worked there from September to January. HOLIDAY SEASON!!! dealing with shoppers through this time of the year is very stressful, but the most enjoyable part was helping the elderly when they would come in!!"
bad,I want to work toward leadership position to provide a upbeat culture.
bad,"walmart was a great place until they stop working with people in the family.  they forgot how to treat people"
bad,"The hardest part was dealing with all the different personalities of my co-workers, and my customers. What i enjoyed most was helping customers/people of all ages."
bad,"Wal-Mart does not take pride in there workers,nor does they care because of the massive success wal-mart have experienced."
bad,I clocked in we had a meeting at the begining of the shift after that we began our shift.
bad,liked the interaction with customers but lots of favorites by managers.
bad,A typical day at work is fast pace. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to focus on my job without customer interruptions.
bad,"*always on my feet and comstantly waiting on customers."
bad,Perfect place to work if you don't want a life hours are so different from day to day managers are rude and treat you bad  and plus lots of rude customers to deal with
bad,"On a typical work day you will have three to four managers tell you to do the same thing because there is no communication among  management. the only way you will move up in the company is if you are an incompetent ""yes"" man. however they do strive on customer service, so that is really the only thing I learned. there is a wide range of ages and races that work there, but some of the older folks are stubborn and are not willing to be taught some of the basic technological skills to perform at their optimal level."
bad,"was very stressful. ok for temporary employment or part-time,"
bad,I have not worked here long and I'm still tiring found how things work.
bad,anyone who knows walmart knows that it is a really horrible place to work for no need to explain....
bad,You learn how to work on your customer sevice skills and how to moltytask. People that work there are not that friendlyand act childish.
bad,"If you enjoy being confronted by hundred of customers day in and day out, who are on average abhorrently rude, then sure this the place for you. Make sure to enjoy the managers who are so tangled up in maintaining the status quo of a giant 24/7 warehouse and keeping up with the miasma of managerial hierarchy that pretty much an sort of employee interaction falls through the cracks."
bad,not enough hours no overtime and barely 30 hours.  only good for a part time job
bad,"Walmart cares about its customers more then they do about employees. The night manager we had after they switched over to new managers did nothing but herass co-workers. They came by me every 5 minutes just to see if i would get my work done. They are supposed to come and check twice a night, not ALL night!"
bad,"Work experience at Wally World is a journey for those with tough skin otherwise you won't last. And if you leave either on good terms or not, you are on a hit list that say don't let this person back in."
bad,"I'm all about my customers and also my fellow employees. I teach and train daily. I get my duties done and completed on time, and I would like to learn more about different duties. The most enjoyable part of my job is dealing and helping the customers in any way possible."
bad,"Pushing carts 90% of the time "
bad,"Sold cell phones and got them started with a plan, Helped out in electronics, took inventory, cashier and stock."
bad,"As a salaried member of management, I am not bound to any particular policies on how many hours I have to work, and how many extra days I have to work. It really depends on the store manager, but most of them will push the envelope on over-working their management team in the name of ""executing the business."" The starting salary may look appealing, but when you divide out how many hours you work, you may be disappointed in how much you are actually making per hour. "
bad,"bad management , no job sercurity, low pay, you will have to do every job in the store including you own.lots of mistakes made."
bad,"No management backup."
bad,this job was not my best i took this job as a break from a nursing home and death
bad,"I've seen better at my old store it takes forever for management to get to you for assistance, people are rude"
bad,Management does not seem to care about the individual workers.  If you aren't good at playing company politics you will not advance within the company. It is not uncommon for management to ask you to do multiple things a day that are above your pay grade. Hardest part of the job is keeping up with the growing expectations of you as a worker as you are not getting compensated to do them.
bad,"I come in unload the trucks and pull pallets to the sales floor, I learned how to stock and clean up spill the was the worst but it could have been a lot better, the was cool and willing to help was nothing hard on the job, meeting new people"
bad,Not paid enough to deal with situations that you have to put up with from customers and employees.
bad,They rarely schedule you full time and they are always understaffed. They also try to get one person to do a bunch of other tasks other than their job title.
bad,"I started overnights as a receiver, stocking shelves and customer service, and ended with working during the daytime as a cashier, staff was so so on friendliness, management was so so on being kind and helping you out."
bad,Arriving early and giving 200% rarely mattered. Most Co-Workers are good people.
bad,"Es una buena compañía y con trabajo estable pero también es lo peor de lo peor ya que se explota a los disque asociados (empleados), si realmente se pusieran en practica todas las políticas que dejo el fundador Sam Walton fuera la mejor empresa de México y Centroamérica pero lamentablemente no es así, y la realidad es que dentro de cada unidad se trabaja sin las herramientas necesarias para realizar las funciones diarias y lo peor es que la gerencia de cada unidad no puede y no tiene el poder suficiente de cambiar las situaciones aunque así lo quisiera y solo se trabaja con lo que se tiene y a como de lugar, dentro de cada unidad existen los malos y pésimos salarios que recibe cada empleado y de igual forma la explotación de los mismos, eso y muchas cosas mas."
bad,I came in and went through training for a whole week.  Some of the management team were helpful.
bad,Learned alot met a lot of different customers on a daily basis.
bad,"bad work environment"
bad,"Just as the summary states most of the management team is lazy, spend alot of the time sitting at tim Horton's. expects you to do your job but will make you work in every other department. doesnt schedule enough people so when it gets busy they get people from every department leaving most places understaffed."
bad,Working as a pharmacy technician I learned a lot of types and reasons for certain medications. It was a very busy environment. The management and co-workers kept the pharmacy working in a very well flow so it was never really backed up. The hardest part of the job was just making sure that I had the right medications because a lot of the medications were very similar. I really enjoyed inputting the patient information and preparing the medication.
bad,"cashier"
bad,I was their just for a check i did not enjoy that job at all and i have nothing else to say about wa-lmart.
bad,I also did not like working at Wallmart beause of the clicks that were formed amongst the employees and the managers were not friendly at all.
bad,The breaks were long and the very little hours for a part- time job
bad,Have to struggle to hit production unless you know a lift driver.
bad,over all the reveiw i have about walmart is they dont care about there employes the are just trying to make a dollar and i feel if they would care about there employees then they would be able keep people whenever they hire somebody but that is just my opinion a typical day at walmart is you are never in one place where ever they put you
bad,bad experience and poor management. did not train me well and always rude. poor pay and wanted you to do more than what you were paid for.
bad,"The management team at this store was inferior to any other I have worked with. The Manager was new to management and had no handle on his store. Each of the Assistant Managers had their own way of running the store, none of which were in line with the Manager. "
bad,"O trabalho era cansativo na maior parte das vezes,pois é um hipermercado,quase sempre tinha que fazer horas extras que se revertiam em banco de horas,o salário era baixo...a parte mais difícil acredito que seja o estresse no início de mês em que o movimento de pessoas é grande...a parte mais agradável era a convivência com a chefia que era muito agradável e com os colegas."
bad,Dont expect to move up with this company unless you are a favorite.  Very clicky work place.  Managers dont follow up with you when you have issues.  They expect to much for what they want to pay you.  No recognition for a job well done.
bad,tough place to work.  Minimal Pay and minimal benefits.  terribleHours. company is no good.  Bad supervisors and Bad competition.  bad culture.
bad,"assisted customers with products, stocked supplies, I learned a lot about the grocery/ retail world"
bad,"the work environment was pleased with coworkers, was relaxed working without any problems."
bad,"Se aprende mucho sobre todo a dominar el trabajo bajo presión y obtener mucho sentido de urgencia."
bad,"Not the same company anymore."
bad,"I've worked in retail since the day I was legally eligible for working papers. 10+ years in retail & I have to say it's a great job for teenagers, college students or a part-time job & you meet tons of different, interesting customers through-out your day. We all love to shop at Walmart, but being an employee is a completely different story. On the downside, I never even knew what an anxiety attack was until I worked for Walmart. After standing on your feet all day, breaks were not long enough. Not being allowed to use the bathroom when you need to go & when you finally get a mangers attention, they take hours just to get someone to cover you for a restroom break. They refuse to give you full-time status or full-time hours for that matter."
bad,I learned about the different duties at a retail pharmacy and how much patients is required.  i made many friends and the customers are amazing.
bad,"Great Co. to work for. The managers at the store level are pushed to hard by Market and Regionl managers who dont work in the store day by day. They expect the stores to look perfect, make money with no help and understand staffed (sat afternoon and sales floor associates for help and 4 registers open)"
bad,"A typical workday would be making production most of the time. Sometimes obstacles may prohibit you to do so. "
bad,"I have been working at walmart for 7 years. I graduated in college and was asking for a better position, the store manager don't even bother to talk about my career. It's  really not a good place for people who want a better job or opportunity."
bad,"was full of great people that you worked besides but the management sucked, and the salary sucked too, they worked you like a dog and you got paid horribly"
bad,"I was a 3rd shift stocker"
bad,"Aprendi muito nesta empresa , agradeço muito à Deus por ter  conseguido ingressar nessa conceituada empresa ."
bad,"I would do the ordering, setting up displays,  and helping customers meet their needs."
bad,taking care of customers and answering phones. Did not learn much. Didn't really have much of a good management.
bad,"Very difficult to move forward,and was demoted when I came back from maternity leave"
bad,Not the best place to work but provides decent benifits. The hours are not that great also.
bad,Wal-Mart is a company that is difficult to work for. The hours are long and daunting. The customers were the hardest part of the job.
bad,I was only an intern asked to successfully run a full time position so it was a bitter experience.
bad,I developed pictures and ordered and made sales and did the schedule
bad,"the job is demanding in itself with meeting the demands of the customers, but management is very difficult while trying to do so."
bad,"Walmart is a cool job but there was somethings that wasnt acceptable. They where very judgemental,the pay,and dealing with the bosses and people who were trying to be bosses.dont get me wrong there were good days involved such as having multiple people ask for you and only deal with you. most of the time some of the CSM workers where nice and repsectful."
bad,"After eighteen years it is time for a change.i want a position I can be happy to go to every day. I want guaranteed hours and a job I can honestly say I like,Walmart took me from being an eightee year full-time employee to a barely part-time employee in a matter of weeks.I need full-time hours;day time preferred.I am a very good worker;always willing to learn. I am loyal and I take any position that I am in very seriously. I have held many positions with Walmart over the years.by far my favorite was working in the accounting office.It is the position I held the longest and I truly liked it.I work on the sales floor now, in Boyswear. My days consist of setting modulars and floor plans,stocking shelves and racks and customer service. I get raves from management , as well as other employees. That,s why the hours cut is such a hard pill to swallow. Above eveything else I am quite honest.I believe in teelling it like it is. I don,t sugar-coat.I can teel you what you want hear but, I prefer the truth."
bad,"Too much drama from coworkers, and way to many managers trying to run each department."
bad,A typical day at Walmart consisted of assembling bikes and stocking areas of the store. During my time at Walmart I learned a great deal about inventory. Some structures of management were not respectful or competent some struggled with communication from other managers as well as employees. The best part of the job was the CHKD fund-raiser and basketball tournament.
bad,"Not a good work environment.  Poor management, no organization and no leadership."
bad,mangers treat u bad. They will yell at u infront of anyone. They dont  treat people or customers right. They work u and want u to do triple the work no matter what.
bad,it was a good place to work learned how to use a sscan gun and i learned how to unload a truck
bad,el ambiente laboral de mi area era bueno solo que en ocaciones no se contaba con el equipo necesario para hacer nuestro trabajo al 100% incluyendo la falta de personal
bad,customers gave me the best compliments about my customer service
bad,I began and ended the day on the exact same note. I never left the register or did anything other than scan customer's groceries. It was very tiring. I learned various helpful things such as: the benefits of couponing and food stamps. My managers were always in their offices and most of my shift supervisors were either incompetent or gossipy. My co-workers were all depressing and boring. The hardest part of the job was pretending to be happy. The most enjoyable part was being on break.
bad,"This is the last place you want to waste your efforts.I used to start work in the morning after a 45 minute job. Even though I was hired afterwards and had the least experience as a technician , I was the opening technician, I had to clear the orders, stock all the floors and do allthe filing ."
bad,"began as sales associate, then was promoted to asset protection in order to keep a handle of the stores assets, was a good environment with great people. was always on time and enjoyed showing up to work."
bad,Enjoyed the customer service aspect of this job. was able to assist a lot of wonderful people
bad,I assist customers with questions and shopping needs. Walmart is a very good place to work.
bad,No matter how well you worked it was not good enough. Managers always found something to complain about rather then complement. You got in trouble for things others often get away with even on your first offense.
bad,This job was okay at first.  I enjoyed most of my coworkers.  Management was not that great.  Trying to move up in positions was quite difficult.
bad,"Walmart is easy, management makes it worth nothing. The pay is very low for people and there families to live off of. The co-workers are great to work with just manangment."
bad,Poor management structure and no company support to accomplish expected goals.
bad,"I was a remodeling associate, which meant I didn't have to deal with customers very much. My manager happened to also be a good guy and tried hard to do right by our team. If it wasn't for those things, I wouldn't have anything good to say about the job. It was high stress, no job security, low pay, etc. "
bad,"Doing the managers job"
bad,"My coworkers were quite friendly and easy to get along with. I did learn quite a bit about wireless contracts, the various carriers, and the latest wireless devices. I have slightly mixed feelings of management. I got along quite well with my department manager, however my coworkers had complaints about certain managers. Some of the managers were very approachable and friendly; a few were not. A typical day involved checking wireless plan updates and inventory, checking email, and selling and activating prepaid cell phones, contract cell phones, and gps devices. The hardest part of the job would probably be trying to continue to provide excellent customer service when faced with rude or impatient customers. I enjoyed helping people who were not very familiar with the latest technology, and also assisting co-workers when ever needed."
bad,"Depending on which department you're in you may actually get to work in that department.  You are CONSTANTLY getting pulled to ring a register or work in another department you know nothing about.  The benefits are only good if something horrific like getting your leg blown off happens.  You have a $2,700 deductible that you have to pay out of your own pocket before insurance will pay 80% after that.  It's a joke."
bad,"1.interaction with different customer and helping find what they need."
bad,be prepared to work your  butt off. You are timed for each task and expected to beat that time even though times are not correct.
bad,"Wal-Mart does provide a lot of hours to a lot of people, but does a poor job of having employees when they're most needed. This results in stores that are dirty, poorly stocked, and not enough help to wait on the customers."
bad,a typical day at walmart is greeting customers before I go in unload the truck.I learn you have to more quick the job has more hard days then easy days.Management is ok it could be better my co-worker are ok it could be better. The hardest part of the job is throwing the truck itself cause it be very big or very small.The most enjoyable part of the job is getting it done.
bad,"The best part about my job is some of the eople I work with and the occasional customers, mostly regulars, who always seem to brighten your day."
bad,"it is a good job for college students, but dont expect a career out of wal mart"
bad,"This was one of the worst places I ever worked! I applied at Walmart #1677 in the hopes of being able to advance in the company, and expecting minimum wage was excited to hear I'd be making $8.30/hr, but was sadly mistaken after being there a few months! If you're hired at any position - besides cashier - you're able to cross-train in almost any department so you have some great advancement (and pay increase) options, but if you're a cashier like I was they won't let you switch anywhere in the store. They are so understaffed with cashiers that they don't let you switch anywhere else in the store, but they do cut your hours so that they can train all of the Sales Associates on the registers so if they are getting long lines they can just bring up all the associates instead of getting more cashiers. They treat you like dirt, and if you don't kiss their behinds you're treated even worse! The Customer Service Managers (CSM'S) that run the cashiers are a bunch of young immature barley out of high school kids who are best friends and play favorites with the cashiers and hardly ever do their job, and if you're not in their ""group"" of friends than you better not even sneeze wrong!! If you do you'll run the chance of getting fired for something you didn't even do! "
bad,"It had its good points and bad points, as all jobs have. The break room had refrigerators and microwaves for workers to use and free coffee"
bad,The store management was still learning how to run a new store with new and transferred employees.
bad,"change oil, change tires, rotate and balance wheels, cleaned fuel injections, etc."
bad,This is a very fast-paced work environment that requires it's associates to  work under a lot of presure to meet tough deadlines. One thing that you must have to  be successful is thick skin and the ability to communicate with all types of people.
bad,"Worked in a cooler all day organizing stock for the lunch meat/raw meat wall. Breaking down pallets and unloading the truck in the morning by myself or with one other person. Upper management was terrible. The hardest part was volunteering to work overtime, and being told to go home early later in the week because they decided not to give overtime. There was nothing I enjoyeed about this job, sorry to say."
bad,"• Assists the store manager in daily operation of the store (Occasionally assumed store responsibility in Mgrs. absence) "
bad,"customer service, working with people who are willing to help you in any way possible"
bad,"Just helping any customer that comes your way, developing photos selling phones. learning where everything is was very difficult."
bad,"It's Walmart people don't expect a whole lot from Walmart.  The customers are awful, the managers are awful, even the building is awful.  People should be aware the Walmart is the root of all evil and is slowly destroying anything beautiful, cultural, and soulful left in the world."
bad,"Walmart was a new experience to getting the knowledge to the retail business.  Learned a lot.  My co-workers were wonderful and teamwork awesome,  Management I had concerns.  The hardest part was having bad leadership. The most enjoyable was the customer."
bad,"I was able to become very well rounded here, was able to try out different areas in the store and meet different people, was not able to get a consistant schedule and management was not very clear on some of their direction."
bad,Employees are over worked not enough help.  Clean freindly co-workers.
bad,I would say that this place was just a pit stop to a better place and really don't have anything to say about it. If your looking for something you need immediately go for it otherwise look a other opportunities
bad,Year experience being a cashier. Loved greeting customers in a friendly way and giving them the best customer service.
bad,"While working for walmart i learned several different retail positions. I learned how to do inventory, stock shelfs, order products, receive trucks and other duties. Walmart does not have good management at all! They do not communicate at all! The hardest part of my job would have been the experiences i had with management the best part of my job would have been my coworkers and the customers."
bad,"A typical day at work would consist of collecting carts, maintaining them and inspecting them, keeping front entrances, clean, assisting costumers in need of help with large/heavy carry outs and returns, as well as any miscellaneous tasks the manager may have for you. I learned the importance of hard work, I had a good group of costumer service managers as my superiors whom all where very nice people, the hardest part of the job was the inconsistent hours and the very low pay. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people and having such wonderful co-workers."
bad,"Stocking shelves, placing damaged goods and out of date goods in their proper bins and assuring all shelves were in proper condition."
bad,"The hardest part of the job, was putting my all into my work and not being recognized.!"
bad,The scheduling was terrible. There was a lot of favoritism within the company. Too much drama between the associates.
bad,"My issue is all csm had different views of doing work never were on same page."
bad,Check out customers in a timely manner. Refund and exchange merchandise. Enter tax exempt business information in the SMART system. Collect all money from cash registers at the end of night shift and deposit into the safe.
bad,"Pretty much what you would expect working at a corporate box store. They are the bottom line, and you can easily be replaced. If you can do the job the way the way they want, you can have a job here. Make friends with your coworkers, though. Their stories can make the day more bearable."
bad,They are ok not as bad as others and if I had to chose I wouldnt work there
bad,worked Wal-Mart at least three times and its worst every time. They do everything to satisfy the customer and don't care how much it goes against the polices.
bad,"Associates are friendly towards each other, you are cross trained to learn many task, but you're not compensated for it. Management makes you feel bad if you have an unexpected family issue that arises. Company has a habit of working part timers 40 hours when they need the help but won't make you full time."
bad,"To receive a raise you would have to work a full year for .25 Cents time to find something better,if you worked any over time witch some times you had no choice,they did not want to pay you,instead they made you take a longer lunch untell all over time was met."
bad,"Horrible place to work. Wages in NOT good, managers are not all the great."
bad,"Assisted customers with their needs."
bad,rude managers. easy to work for. all sales associates were nice. did not do well with making schedules.
bad,"i come to work drop my food in the break room, grab to l carts to put boxes on and a pallet jack. go back to the break room and wait for meeting to start, just before we start work. Ive learned how to stock merchandise properly. learned how read bar codes, and how to organize stocked the right way in receiving area. learned how to properly operate machinery suck as forklift, electric jack and compactor. Management needs to learn more about the job. the hardest part about the job is that they have time limits per department. my job is to work 4 departments. my first department is house ware, the most time they give me is 2 and a half sometime 3 hours to do 15 to 25 pallets from the truck by myself not including zoning, ics stock and returns. im always there the whole night. while everyone else has 3 to 4 pallets. the most enjoyable part of the job my lunch time, thats when i can walk out side and cool off."
bad,Recibir a los colaboradores y asignarles su trabajo especifico supervisar despues lo ejecuatado realizar pedidos por medio d elos proveedores y realizar negociaciones para eventos de fin de semanana y coordinar a promotores y demostradoras
bad,"When I first started working for this company it was fun, the people were so easy going and I actually looked forward to going to work on a daily basis. I did a lot of different tasks in WalMart."
bad,This company happens to be okay for starting out. You learn several things about yourself and the company
bad,I was assigned to walmart as a cashier and ended up stocking and even doing maintenance my experience there was not the best.
bad,"meeting customers was a bonus. putting out stock was a perfect fit for me , as I love organizing."
bad,Good people to work with as associates.Not a good company for longevity and retirement.
bad,"My typical review of walmart in Batavia, I very much so enjoyed the people I worked with but the management staff leaves much to be desired. Favoritism is horrendous, and kissing up to management would get you farthest. Unwilling to work with you in some cases, promotions to workers who are undeserving. Also use and abuse their good workers to make up for the lack luster workers they also have working there. Work if desperate and need money."
bad,"Typical day is placing picks, counting merchandise, auditing bins, and binning overstock. I was told to not help customers so much, to finish one thing at a time, and not follow demands from my department manager. Management downgrades and manipulates weaker employers by picking at every wrong they have done. Management also is lenient on procrastinators who roam the building while on the clock. Some co-workers have team player attitude and others feel the need to work alone. The hardest part of this job was when being told by one manager to do a task then asked why by another manager, do to poor communication. One enjoyable part about this job is having time to complete a task and working with customers. Fulfilling customers need and wants is the best part of this job."
bad,Stocked shelves. Clean environment. Overall friendly and fun place to work. 
bad,"clean maintain floors,run buffers/ polisher machines,unload trucks ,stage and transfer  merchandise  to floor, stock shelves,set up displays,return over flow  to  warehouse,clean up after overnite shift."
bad,stocking. filling in merchandise. customer service. I taught myself how to do the day to day tasks needed for the job. management don't try to help or care about anything. co-workers try to dump their work on you. job has been easy to do.
bad,"well everyone was nice, you come to work and get right to work. no matter what you do u have to say yes not maybe and not no. if you didn't finish even the worst things you got in trouble. the management was like 1-2 years into the job so didn't know much themselves. "
bad,"Stock freight in whichever department I'm assigned for the night. Finish on time, everyone is happy."
bad,"Not too bad of a place to work at. the people were nice and friendly. third shift wasn't too bad you would have to deal with all the mistakes from the day is one of the bigger problems though while watching out of the safety of late night shoppers. "
bad,What else can I say. I was grateful to have employment and it served its purpose for what I needed at the time. 
bad,It was okay to be honest. I would rate it as the lowest Job quality I could ever have. I wouldn't want to work there even in a high position. Walmart is not my type of job.
bad,I would like to start off saying that it was very unorganized and uncareful managers. Most zoning managers kept up with the place and very few co-workers did what was necessary to get the job done. The hardest part of the day was hearing customers complain about how nasty and how unorganized the store was but my most enjoyable part of the day was being able to ring customers out as fast as i could so they won t be waiting for so long.
bad,I did not like the management its easy but if you are not on the suck up list then you dont really fit in
bad,"Nice friendly people, night stock. Stocking shelves moving pallets and cleaning. "
bad,"I treated it like any other job. I showed up on time, I never called out, and I put in great effort even without little or no acknowledgement from management. As soon as a better job opportunity came along, I left with a new more humble spirit. "
bad,"The pay, people, management and work place is a disaster. Customers are mean and rude just like the people you work for."
bad,"i would cut and sell fabric, provide customer service, and work freight along with stocking the shelves. I also would do whatever projects i was asked to do and cashier when needed "
bad,"For me, Walmart was just something to get me by. Upper management, for the most part, were terrible, but the people I worked with in ICS were alright. My father also worked for the company, and they were awful to him, so I can't really say I cared for them at all."
bad,No puedes aun mentar el conosimiento ya que no tiene un seguimientos de las personas que ahi laboran
bad,"I learned about food service regulations, but found that they only apply to certain people.  I had to beg to learn things and then was criticized because I wasn't fast enough even though I was allowed limited exposure to those tasks.  Rules changed moment by moment so it was difficult to effectively perform.  There was a lot of gossip and efforts to undermine co-workers, for example, accusations of misconduct, rule violations, and lying.  Management did not investigate but took the word of certain associates without even checking out the situation.  If one was accused, he/she was guilty period.  Some associates were disciplined for infractions while others were given a pass.  All in all, a very stressful workplace."
bad,"Kind of busy, the job really wasn't understanding. I didn't learn anything that I didn't already know. I assisted customers, and put up returns. The hardest part of my job was being off and going back to work and the other employees didn't maintain the work area the way I did."
bad,"This company came and went very quickly, I enjoyed being an assistant and helping customers on a daily "
bad,This job was an overnight position with unprofessional workers. There were people trying to be jealous at how many hours other people were having. I learned how to communicate and never get into an argument with anyone. I learned how to use machinery in the workplace and how to price items.
bad,Do not want to discuss details but it was  job that would not allow me to use my full potential
bad,i learned how to resolve difficult situations in a professional manner.
bad,"An Inventory Management Specialist scanned out all of the department picks from the backroom so the stockers could stock them."
bad,"Poor pay, messed up hours and terrible management. Sometimes, I would have a 6 hour turn around to be back at work after a 9 hour shift. Overnight.  I didn't work overnight. Disliked almost everything about working there sad to say."
bad,"I enjoyed this job simply because I am a fast paced worker so therefor this job seemed to suit me well. Management was good as well co workers. The hardest part of the job was the hours that I worked, however, the most enjoyable part of the job was being given individual responsibilities which resulted in working at my own pace, etc."
bad,"Job security is the only benefit to this job. Other than that the management is horrible and the co-workers are all lazy, everyone does bare minimum to get by."
bad,i think management is very inconsiderate. but i enjoyed workin in the big area at times it was peacefull and other times are very crazy. i also didn't like that the store is closed half the day every sunday. it was very inconvenient. 
bad,"Could be slow paced."
bad,Broke my ankle and was expected to still do heavy lifting and push carts. Didn't have any down time til i was back at work where i was expected to do jobs that i clearly wasn't capable of doing.
bad,The Southington Walmart was a great place to work at first. Unfortunately a misuse of power and refusal to cooperate with employee needs resulted in poor working conditions 
bad,I just went to work each day because I have too. the worker sometime got along we had to stand at the register for long period of time 
bad,"I would avoid working at this particular Walmart. There were about 6 managers of the same level and they would not communicate with each other. One of them would give you a 2 hour job and one hour to do it, then 2 of the other managers would give you jobs to do during the same time on opposite sides of the store. They would each tell you to disregard the other managers and do what they told you to do. So you really needed to pick witch manager you wanted to not complete your work for today. Then you would be reprimanded for not completing all of the other jobs you didn't do even tho you were told not to prioritize them over the work that whatever manager was talking to you at the moment told you to do.Everyday is one step forward six steps back. It was terrible."
bad,"Associates are expected to be able to do the job of several associates on a part-time basis. They have a bad tendency to have one associate straightening, cleaning, and stocking in several departments during one short (5 hour) shift. Especially during the busy season. "
bad,Management changed a lot. Great benefits and even helps with school for continuing education. Co workers were great.
bad,It was calm place we had good management & the hardest part of it was the fact that we had a lot of trucks to load and unload. the most enjoyable part I guess was that I pretty much was good with everyone there
bad,I learned to handle damaged products that had been returned to the store and ship them back to the manufacturer. The job was very physically demanding and problem solving was very important.
bad,A typical day at work you really dont know what area you will be working your always going to be busy doing multiple things at once from working others areas to pushing carts outside to helping others. co - workers/Management its not the greatest team effort when it comes to effective team work and communications.the hardest part of the job is alot of fast pace multi task physical work. i feel the most enjoyable part of the job is really nothing its a job the only real good thing is quarterly Bonuses other than that Personally i really wouldnt recommend other people to Work here.
bad,No hous available.Short on the breaks.No growth in the company.
bad,For the three years i worked at Walmart i hated the job the management team sucks and don't care about its employers and and its a very underpaid job .
bad,Its a good company if you dont want a family life. I worked my way up to management.
bad,"I would start a day around 9:00 in the morning. I broke out the breads to be baked for that day. I answered phones, waited on the customers, did production sheet etc. I learned that if you need something done you had better just do it yourself because you don't get much help. The management team needs to be improved a lot I think. I didn't think to much of some of my co-workers. the hardest part of my job was trying to get the breads set-up for the next day and getting my breaks. The best part of my day was when it was time to leave."
bad,This is an ok company to work for. They try and tell you management is on your side but it seems as if you get nowhere unless you go to the store manager or above. For the last month I have not been working in my department because there are not enough cashiers which has caused the days I request off for vacation or personal days to be denied. Lately no one has lasted past about three months. It is constantly busy which is great but they are usually so understaffed that customers constantly complain. I love my co-workers they are part of the reason I am still there. 
bad,"i gained lots of experience as far as working in the warehouse aspect of it,as customer service,sales etc"
bad,its ok i am looking for better pay and a company that can give me a better work life balance 
bad,"repetition in the work place, same task almost daily some repeated. learned how do work cash register and how inventory should be kept. management was a mess, all of the managers contradicted each other, with rules or leniency and were poor on setting schedules.co-workers were awesome although many had the same complaints about management. hardest part of the job was dealing with management not a fun atmosphere. most enjoyable part was customers and co-workers."
bad,"Typical Day - Made sure fresh produce was on display, the temperatures were correct, bad produce was taken to a compose, and the produce were within their dates."
bad,A typical work down was dealing with irritated customers because management would not schedule enough cashiers for the front end. 
bad,A typical day of work at Wal-mart was fun but challenging. The co-workers were just as helpful as the managers.
bad,"absolutely hated it there worst job ever "
bad,was a good place to work at first til i decided to return to school.
bad,"A parte mais dificil do meu trabalho era quando tinhamos que trocar nossos horarios devido a falta de funcionários presentes na drogaria. Tive muitos aprendizados, empresa ótima e cumpre com os processos."
bad,walmart is a decent place to work if you dont mind not following state and federal laws.
bad,"A typical day for me would be stocking shelves of all the new freight that comes in, pulling freight out of backroom to work, cleaning areas as well as manage the merchandise system."
bad,"typical day calling patients or receiving calls about their copay and insurance"
bad,"Managers are always on your case, as well as lack of communication between them, your hours depend on them not you and if your not friends with the managers then you may as well stay in your position."
bad,"A typical day as a sales associate is pretty boring: you check the inventory, restock what's missing if you can, then spend the rest of your shift zoning, i.e. tidying things up after customers have come through your department and disorganized things. If you're lucky, you'll have a co-worker on duty with you; the co-workers are often the best part of the job.... Unless they're incompetent. But, most of the co-workers I ever had were great. The managers... not as much. Department heads generally knew their stuff, but the assistant managers, by and large, seem to have no idea what it's like to work on the sales floor, and thus will sometimes assign ridiculous tasks. But really, the hardest part of the job is dealing with customers. The customers are generally disrespectful, dismissive, or outright rude most of the time, and you the employee are forced to smile and suck it up. This is probably true of any job, but I'd say it's worse at Wal-Mart than at other places. And really, they don't pay enough or give good enough hours to make it worth the hard work you often have to do, like moving huge piles of freight or enormous boxes by yourself, while dealing with perpetually unpleasant customers. "
bad,"Management is horrible, pay is unreasonable, and you can forget about a life. No room for advancement or anything else."
bad,"At Wal-Mart, I worked as a cashier, until promoted to Accounting Associate."
bad,loved the job because I loved shoes. I also loved meeting new people everyday.
bad,"It is a very unique place to work. With the volume of business that they do, its amazing to see how product moves in and out of the store. The schedules at the store to me were the worst part. They would not allow you to have time off for important dates and many associates did not like this fact and had to miss important dates because they were at work. The job was enjoyable some days and others it was annoying but i believe that's with any job."
bad,They do not have a flexable schedule. They don't allow personal schedules. You have to work there schedule & that's final/
bad,too much work not enough compensation
bad,"the walmart i was working at had great workers and a few good managers but the upper management had no direction which had the store in chaos no one known where anything was everybody play the blame game, total disorder."
bad,walmart has nothing going for the company anymore. the company is nothing like it use to be before when I first started but since walmart sold out to china the company isn't the same
bad,Working for Walmart is just not the same as it was in 2004-2006 they no longer provide you with the hours to survive in society.
bad,My typical day is to deal with declining benefits and increased workload. The pictures of the people of Walmart are factual and often hostile. I have been threatened several times by employees because I couldn't give them free stuff. Managers over look their employees for advancement and discrimination is rampant in the company.
bad,I loved working here but the area just wasn't for me. Some of the managers were nice others were hard on you.
bad,Wal-mart was little different than a lot of places have worked. Worker stayed at there longer Pay was not good.
bad,"Walmart is not a place I would suggest for people to work. The management is so overworked that they cannot begin to do their job. Everyday tasks cannot be preformed with adequate customer service, therefore causing unhappy customer."
bad,"the Store in Fort Graitoit MI will treat workers poorly, with no respect, even hard working employees"
bad,"This was the first job i ever had, the amount of hours i was given were very minimal. Never the less, it was the foundation for a strong working class ethh"
bad,"I learned a lot about customer service, management and retail business working for this company"
bad,"Wal-Mart is a terrible place to work. The pay is lousy, and lower level workers are treated poorly."
bad,40 Hour work weeks. Tons of time off due to the 40 hour work week. Paid 15 minute breaks. Fun time with fellow employees when give a chance.
bad,"Work the texlon machine for pricing, stock merchandise occasionally, clean shelves, zone merchandise for neatness, markup and mark down on prices, price changes daily, greet customers, work pallets of toys , pallet jack operation"
bad,hard work didnt have enough time to finish job duties got along with co workers the hardest part was trying to go at a very fast paste. made us push carts in the snow. met new people good benefits
bad,often told to work outside your department and then get in trouble for not getting your own tasks done. poor pay. decent hours.
bad,"My shift starts at 10pm. to 7am. I am a overnight cashier. I also stock the shelves, build end caps, set modules. There is nothing hard about working at Walmart I have been there for almost 2 years and I work part time. I need a full time position."
bad,"I loved working with customers at Walmart we were a team did it as one, I enjoyed being able to assist my customers with there needs."
bad,"The management doesnt communicate, and I was laid off without notice, I was told they were hiring us back in February and it never happened. They pick sides when things happen the management is always right."
bad,"Management treat associates horribly. You start working in one department, then next thing you know, you'll be in 8 different departments."
bad,Pay rate was not competitive whatsoever.
bad,"I worked at a Walmart recently so my account is true. The above ratings are fair. Good people work there,but they wiil not remain good people. All long-term employees, will change slowly, unpreceptably wiil change to what the management want, how they want. Something is amiss."
bad,"I work there currently as a support manager. My co workers are friendly, upper management such as the assistant managers are disorganized and untimely. The hardest part of my job is figuring out which assistant manager to listen to because of the lack of communication, I am stuck in the middle of a feud and being told to do 2 different things at once which is obviously impossible. I do enjoy the quiet time I get at work because it is rare and I am able to get my work done. I do the same work and most days even more as the assistant managers and get paid less than half of what they make and they usually sit in the office and make me do all their work for them and they are automatically paid for it because they make salary. I worked for a different walmart before as a zone supervisor and it was never ever like the one I work at now. Needless to say, i am seeking employment elsewhere because I have had enough."
bad,I worked at Walmart and performed all the duties well. I later learned that I had been underpayed as a female employee.
bad,"Organization does provide many un-credentialed or un-skilled people with jobs, so if an individual that has impressive skills & experience, this is not the organization to nurture ones tallents, but it can suffice for those in-between career moves, or when an economy will not support ones true worth in another employment venue"
bad,Don't like working there. There are too many chiefs and not enough indians. Their idiology of do more with less isn't working.
bad,This job was pretty laid back. The best thing about this job is helping the customers.
bad,The coworkers were horrible and the management did nothing but complain and blame somebody else for their faults.
bad,Was a very good place to work at. All the staff were friendly and helpful. Had a lot of fun when I was there. The clientele were very good people too.
bad,"Two months can move real quick; if you work nights. Working at Walmart was alright. Good pay. Nice co-workers. I just found overly managed systems, strict routines, and HUGE workloads. I felt like I was at a camp. I didn't mind doing the work, just that the system was strict, I felt watched at the time. Working for Walmart was an easy job, but really tiring."
bad,"I enjoyed working at Wal-Mart however, the rate of pay does not match the work experience. Management in Wal-Mart are trained to be robots, meaning they do not allow management to think for themselves"
bad,"Everyday at 3:30pm We would unload full trailers, that were full of products."
bad,Every day is a new day. They try to get things to fire people instead of really training and showing them how things are done. They are all about the back end instead of the front end check out. They are too busy trying to get the product out and not about customer service.
bad,"my days were long and boring even when i tried to be productive. i learned how to paint, how to make bails and stock merchandise"
bad,Managers are nowhere to be found when needed. Too many employees come into work two or three hours late to work almost every week.
bad,I typically float between five sections of the store. Working with the customers is the most enjoyable part of working. What I have learned is that I am more fitted to a workplace that is looking for a dedicated individual that is self-motivated to accomplish tasks successfully with little supervision. The hardest part of working here is the personal differences between my work ethics and management's work ideology.
bad,"Walmart only hires temporary employees, they often find ways out of giving you raises. The management lack people skills and are often hard to deal with."
bad,"I liked the work that was needed to be done, but the snide, rude, inconsiderate managers that I had to work with was just unnecessary. The best days were when either manager wasn't around, it just seemed like the moral was higher & work got done faster."
bad,walmart did not provide much for benefits and was not the best work environment. was glad to leave the company for a better job
bad,the hours are ok but the management is very horrible overall walmart is a ok place to work at but the boss and supervisors need to be trained more and more ppl friendly
bad,"Understaffed, stressful, very busy, co-workers are hard working, hardest part of the job is not having any help"
bad,"Worse job i ever had. Most of the people on graveyard older and kinda cranky. The head supervisor was an awfull person. He yelled at the top of his lungs, threw things, got in peoples faces it was horrible. The mantaince supervisor was using and selling drugs on the job. The only reason some people even work at walmart is because they rat out their co workers to the superviser so they can get away with being lazy."
bad,"Stock shelves, Inventory Prep, customer service, great people!"
bad,"Wal-Mart has their good and bad management. They are always pawning off jobs on other lower employees, when they are the ones suppose to be getting the job done. The lower employees are not paid to do all the work they have to do. If you hold certain positions, the expectations from you are way to high. The management is scatterbrained, and they need more than they have. The store in Quincy, IL isn't the cleanest, and the employees are not always the friendliest. Macomb store has much better management, and the cleanliness is way better. Overall I would not encourage anyone to work for Wal-Mart, the discount isn't that great, and they make you work almost every weekend. It is hard to get time off, and you will always be picking up the slack of others because they do nothing about their call-offs."
bad,"A typical day of work is clocking in, then being nabbed by all the managers in the store to give you tasks."
bad,We had to clean up after the other shifts because they did not finish there duties before they left. I learned to take what people say with a grain of salt. Very harsh and uncaring management.
bad,"My typical day at work is okay, I enjoy some of the coworkers but I don't enjoy the Pharmacy scene."
bad,A typical day consisted of enforcing the fitting room policy and keeping the immediate area neat and orderly. I was also responsible for answering the phone and directing customer calls to the proper departments. I was responsible for sorting through the returns and putting them in different bins so that coworkers could collect them at shifts end.
bad,"The work that I do at Wal-Mart is very easy. I have to scan all the fashion that comes into the store and ensure it is the correct price, that the amount which is on our bill of lading is correct to what I am receiving. I change labels if needed, change shelf counts, pricing and bin any overstock. I also, work in the cash office; which I enter all till floats into our computer system (smart) and ensure everything balances, I ensure the main float for the cashiers is always full and I do till pulls (take extra money from tills). I do deposits and paper work for managers."
bad,"There really is no typical day at WalMart. Many different situations could arise, for the most part my job was overseeing the operations and overall well being of the store. Helping customers with any problems and training associates in all areas. Ensuring maximum profitability was being achieved along with monitoring expenses."
bad,"Only work at Wal-Mart if you want to have no outside life, family, friends, etc. They only want people who will devote all time to them. No more full time, only part time and you have to plan around Wal-Mart."
bad,It's just processing merchandise and stocking them according to departments. Co-workers are cool and overnight hours allows me to do more during the day.
bad,"long hours, running around building displays helping customers, solving associate conflicts."
bad,"As an APA we are considered to be seperate from your everyday WalMart Employees. The team I work with was hand picked and we all get along extremeley well. Team work is a big part of the job I do. As for WalMart in general, from store manager to department managers, no one accepts responsibility and communication breaks down to quickly. They pay me for continuous work history and I started around 12.00 an hour which in NYS is really no money but most employees make 2-3$ less."
bad,I love work with the public and helping them with there daily needs.
bad,"You've heard about it, but I've lived it. If you have no skills but live in some little community where jobs are scarce, go for it. You still might be able to get Walmart stock, but frankly, if you can go anywhere else to work, Id say go....the managers are poorly trained, I saw and complained ALOT about staff who were repeatedly DRUNK at work and it took as long as 18 months for anything to happen. The general manager had a real arrogance that I found offensive. Cronyism and nepotism is rampant. People protect people who they like. One time the GM asked me to stay into the next shift because the were short, and promised I could keep my extra hours...that promise was forgotten by my personnel manager by the end of the week who asked me to stay home so I wouldnt go over 40 hours. Overall, I was desperate for cash so I took the job, but if I had had any other choices, I wouldnt have...Walmart sucks..its a bottom line type corporation without a soul. Id go to Costco, they treat their employees wayyy better..be advised..."
bad,"The hype about Wal-Mart is true, they do not care about the employee. Management and employee turnover was very fast; so much so, that we could not keep a trained employee or manager in house. This company was what I needed when I was unemployed, but even for someone who is unskilled I would not recommend the company, unless it was an absolute emergency."
bad,Aprendi a trabajar en equipo buen horario trabajar para esta empresa
bad,"They offer good pay and quarterly bonuses but, the management was very hostile and discriminate horribly. They stereotype black customers by standing at the end of the aisle watching them til they leave sometimes. Some of the mangers are nice but a majority will do whatever and say whatever to get ahead even at an employees expense, I saw it happen a few times."
bad,busy all the time that the customer is not always right and management was not .good there had some good co-workers and the hardest part of that job was that I put in three and some good years there.meeting nice people.
bad,"start greeting customers and assist in receiving the medicine , learned a lot of the hipaa and medication throughout the experience , however there was never any room for advancement and i had a lot of additional skills and never could quite get to use them, the hardest part is the drive to work and i did enjoy a lot of the people whether they were customers or co workers"
bad,"I enjoyed my job duties of preparing food and cleaning, however I rarely saw my manager and there was no real rules assigned or enforced. Co workers were extrememly lackadaisical."
bad,Additional employees works from same drawer without balancing
bad,"Work was mostly busy at the sporting goods register for people checking out, or wanting to buy a gun, which took awhile to sell with all the paperwork/calls. Relatively simple job, not too physical."
bad,It was a great place to start a change in career. And there so many varieties of product from: Automotive products; Home furnishings; Hardware; Sporting goods; Pet supplies to Housewares.
bad,"Advancement was almost impossible unless someone left the company. Minimum wage with bare minimum in raises that were mandated after being sued several times. Tons of managers, no one really knew what was going on though. Co-workers were great, but no one felt like they were going anywhere. Hardest part of the job was working all the time all hours, with no personal life. Enjoyable part of job was the people that worked there. Good for college and high school, but no further than that. Definitely not for family oriented people."
bad,Only hired certain genders and races.
bad,low pay and they treat u like u don't matter would love to have a better place to work where they treat u like a person.
bad,"I learn how to work with others much better and give it my all to make the customers pleased and satisfied. The hardest part of the job is putting up with angry customers, but you encounter that everywhere."
bad,Sales was great. Gave me great opportunity to gain customer service skills.
bad,"Not meant to be a career just a stepping stone, to something better."
bad,"Walmart was an ok place to work for, They worked with her sched when they wanted to. But overall was an ok place,"
bad,"Hectic environment, not employee friendly at all"
bad,Most of my co-workers were the hardest working guys I ever knew. The management was very unorganized and only focused on themselves; instead of the company as a whole.
bad,I love working with people and really enjoyed the diversity of people who came through my till. I learned that retail can be really fun but hard on the body when standing for the whole shift. Management was there to address the problems in a timely manner.
bad,Y es un poco complicado redactar que pienso con respecto a esa empresa.
bad,3rd shift cashier
bad,this job really didnt care about the life had out of work if u had anything going on in your personal life it wasnt reverent
bad,This company is not the greatest company to work for. They don't pay well for the amount of work they want you to do. They don't feel the need to appreciate the good workers. They say they promote from the inside but I've seen them skip over really good people to go outside the company (for their friend).
bad,Working overnight was the hardest part of the job. Unloading and stocking merchandise from receiving trailer to stockroom.
bad,"A typical day at Wal-mart is coming in, clocking in and getting sent to a register. The things that I learned were how to process a money order, and various customer service skills. It is very rare that you . If you are a cashier, you don't get to communicate with your Co-workers very often because they like to separate you, which does help keep you attentative to your job. The hardest part of the job is when prices go up and on holidays, customers are very irritable, and whether you do anything or not, they are on a short fuse that they slightest thing can set off. The enjoyable part of the job is when someone has an issue that you can actually resolve and you see them go from irritated to satisfied."
bad,A typical day in the life of a store manager. Supervised various ad-hoc projects.
bad,my experience with walmart was not the best. Ive seen a lot of favorism between most of the managers and the associates and a few workers who wasnt appreciated even though they was working much harder than most. Ive learned who manage my time better there and because of it was able finish my work and still help others daily. The best part of working with walmart is honestly being able to make good friends.
bad,Walmart is infamous for having the managers and customers treating the workers very badly.
bad,After failing and failing to find a job out of highschool I was forced to work for this company. I will say the other employees can be some of the nicest people you can meet. However the management and pay are some of the worst in existence. The company often makes employees perform jobs not listed in their descriptions and pays them below the wage of other employees hired to that position. My only positive thing I will say is that if you are even moderately competent you will never have a problem with job security.
bad,"o k place to work samething everyday but managers make the job harder than it has to be. while I was there I learned to order merchandise,receive trucks, also learned to log trucks in and out. I enjoyed training co workers and the hardest part of the job was being rushed all the time. The worst thing about most managers was that they never back there employees up on anything."
bad,"never really worked enough , not enough hours. managers over did each other all the time."
bad,A typical day at work was very busy with limited employees to cover all shifts. Management was very laid back and the hardest part was keeping up with the fast pace of retail.
bad,"A typical day at Wal-Mart is helping customer's in a friendly and timely manner. I also cooked and cleaned, run cash register, and stocked supplies."
bad,I hope that my experience with Wal-mart was only at my store. The management did not mirror the goals of the over all company. I havent worked for another Wal-mart before but I hope it isnt like that all over.
bad,"A typical day at walmart is harsh work environment, little to no help, little pay, never had a steady schedual, and management was mediocre."
bad,This employer did not take interest in knowing their employees or fitting their needs. I was disatisfied with this job within the third month i was there. I was told i was getting promoted and didnt receive the promotion.
bad,There is no communication between management and employees. They care more about the customers than the well being of their employees. Co-workers are okay but tend to start unwanted drama.
bad,It is a terrible place to work. Managers single out associates for disclipline. Scheduling is pathetic. Don't waste your time.
bad,"a lot of work for little pay, very hectic, management don't seem to care about anything."
bad,Talk with customers and worked with them at the fitting room. I also took call that came into the store and answer their questions.
bad,I ran the register and zoned the store. I learned how to run the register and zone the store. Management was difficult to get along with because they seemed to be under alot of pressure. The co-workers were hard working and friendly. The hardest part of the job was working third shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the public.
bad,"My typical day at work is long and boring. There is no fun in this job. From this job I learn how to be more organized and better with customers.The management at this job is horrible.That's my personal opinion...I love some of my co workers I get alone very well with most of them. The hardest part about working at walmart is being nice to some of the most ignorant customers,but that's with any customer service job. The most enjoyable part about my job is helping the customers n giving them a better shopping experience."
bad,"I check out customers and straighten shelves when not busy, stock bags."
bad,I was employed at another job along with WalMart & they were not willing to work with me on my schedule
bad,"Foi meu primeiro emprego,onde passei 10 anos, desgastou com o tempo pois queria crescer e n tinha oportunidade,queria estudar e o horario n permitia"
bad,"As with any job, it is what u put into it. If you like that kind of work then you have a good chance to land a job there."
bad,"At the time I worked they were at an in-balance of management. There were 4 co-managers on days, 4 on nights. One manager would ask you to do something and then another would ask something different; they were never consistent. They were favorable to certain associates and unfair to others. This was 14 years ago, but they haven't changed much, according to some of my friends who are still there."
bad,"Work was always different u never knew what was gonna happen or what type of day you were gonna have. Management is only out for themselves and could care less about you. Here you are underappreciated, overworked and underpaid for all you do and all the drama. I learned a few things but not much just got more experience on the fork lift and some customer service experience"
bad,This was my first job. Retail. Super easy. Didn't have to know much about the products to work there. Super easy job.
bad,"little or no advancment poor wages,pay scale is not intune with work to be performed would not recomend this job to any one."
bad,My job is to pull stuff from the back of the store and srnd to the front. I do grocery and general merchandise. The management keeps changing every month. So the routine keeps changing. I am told to do one thing and then told to do something else the next. The co-workers that been there for a long time are good workers but the new ones that they bring in are lazy. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the older workers and the breaks.
bad,"processing and printing pictures,Nice job , enjoyed meeting new people"
bad,"I worked at 2 different WalMarts and they were both the same. The one in Barrie was ran a lot better than the one in Guelph however. The one in Guelph was beyond ridiculous... The door greeters would have to practically pass out before they got their lunch breaks, some of the staff at the front end was able to stand around and do absolutely nothing (and always got away with it due to the DISGUSTING amount of favouritism..) people would go out for smoke breaks whenever they wanted to without clocking out... I worked my butt off at this job and was never shown an ounce of recognition yet they were hiring customer service managers and assistant managers off the street without considering the hardworking employees they already had under their roof. I had to quit this job due to all of the back stabbing, drama, and cattiness... I would go home and cry every night because it was ran so poorly and I hated being there. My husband told me to quit because he would have rather me been unemployed than work somewhere where I was just treated as another number. You couldn't pay me a million dollars a year to go back there and put up with the terrible management. This store is SO poorly run... there are SOME good managers here but they are few and far between."
bad,Every year of the five I have worked at WalMart all the above catagories seem to be a little less stable.
bad,en esta empresa aprendi el manejo de montacargas y asi poder facilitar el trabajo al momento de descargar una caja de mercancia
bad,"My analogy is this: Walmart managers have been handed a fantastic playbook. They are all on the sidelines trying to implement and understand this playbook. The game, meanwhile, goes largely unattended."
bad,"I am sure where I worked is an exception rather than the rule. I enjoyed the people, but the management had a lot to be desired. If the management is not good the store goes downhill. Most of the people I got along with, but too many did not do their jobs. The pay is not good unless you are in upper management. The hardest part is having to do other peoples work besides your own.I learned to be more outgoing and getting to know how to wait on customers. I learned how to keep my area neat and to stock and set modulars."
bad,very busy pace enviorment you alwasy learn somthing new all every day co workers are all freindly the hardest part of the job there is not enough time to do everything you like most enjoyable part is making new friensds and getting smiles backfrom cutomers
bad,Wal-mart could be a better place to work only if the managment would communicate better with there employee's.
bad,My typical day consists of working 5 am to 2 pm. I usually spend about 5-6 hours doing my job with the remaining 2-3 hours either doing busy work or being asked to help someone. What I have learned working in this position I have mostly taught myself. Management has very poor communication skills. The hardest part of the job is getting up so early and not feeling satisfied at the end of the day that I have done hard work. Most enjoyable part is Donuts on Fridays.
bad,Bad review about this job and i didn't like working there
bad,working with customers
bad,Walmart has to many leaders with very little trainning.
bad,I worked in apparel overnight and mostly worked alone sorting apparel for six departments. Learned the differences in clothing sizes for for men and boys as well as women and girls. Learn to set modules for clothing displays. Only worked with other employees if the inventory was very light. The hardest part of the job was doing a job alone that was meant for four employees. The most enjoyable time on the job was meeting all the different people shopping at Wal-Mart.
bad,"I worked there 4 12yrs total,it took me 10yrs b4 they gave me a management position. I even trained my bosses,that were men. I got let go,even though I was the best manager,I was the last one hired in."
bad,"I learned that great customer service is a must , your customers make your buiness without them you would not have your appeal and they come back . I have made many life time friends , and have many members of management that has helped me achieve my goals ."
bad,to go in and do a meeting about being a better worker that not one did.
bad,Every manager has different ideas and nobody wants to work together
bad,Wal-mart is great place its just certain locations hire unfair managemnet and poor work team. certain wal-marts making it an unwanting place to be.
bad,just a job while i was expecting that's all the review i have for this company since it was over 10 years ago
bad,"• Service, clean, and supply restrooms."
bad,"typical day at work: make cake orders, work with frieght in freezer, put products on sales floor, and clean bakery. I've learned how to decorated cakes, which can be the hardest part of the job at times verses working in the freezer. decorating cakes is also the most enjoyable part along with helping customers that really appreciate you."
bad,The expectation working at Wal Mart was not to go there and become wealthy. It was to have a job.
bad,"A typical day at work as a cashier is taking care of customers and ringing up their orders on the register and bagging up their items. A typical day at work as a back room inventory associate is working with a tel zone and taking merchandise from the back room and putting them out on carts and stocking the out on the sales floor. I learned how to work a tel zone and do audits, picks and count requests. Management was okay. The hardest part of the job was the work shift. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping out customers and meeting new people."
bad,the wal-mart i worked at the more brown nosing the faster you move up in the company and got your requested days off accepted
bad,-Same task everyday
bad,"Work you hard with salary cap. After you reach salary cap.Lacking grocery experience,Don't treat everyone the same."
bad,"My day started at 5 in the morning checking in local vendors and freight trucks. What I enjoyed working there was talking with different vendors that would come in to service the store. I got along with most of my co workers and I had no problems working along the side with them. Best part of my job was my day ended early, my shift was over at 2 in the afternoon so I still had the rest of my day to do other stuff."
bad,They require alot of work with little pay or hours. Customers where the best part.
bad,"After more than a decade with the company, they have taken a turn for the worst. They have gotten too caught up in the politically correct, that things like reverse racism and reverse discrimination run rampet. The employee is no longer a person but an expence at which they want to be minimal."
bad,Good place to start out your career but not a place to retire from.
bad,"GM (General Merchandise) not Grocery side. Customer service; helping customers find product, as well as answering questions. Registers; if the lines got long they call for sales associates to go up front and help till the lines died down, that or to help give some of the cashiers a break or lunch during busy seasons or hours. Stocking Merchandise; brought merchandise from the back-stocked items on shelves. Worked the risers (the highest shelf with overstocked product). When stocking from the back the items that wouldn't fit on the shelf go on the overhead shelf. This needs to be worked every day by bringing down and shelving items that have sold and now have more room for more products. Returns; items that are left around the store or that were returned (still work and unused) back onto the shelves. Also responsible for bringing items found in your dept. but belonged to others up front and placing them in carts for them to receive. Damaged Items; items that are found broken or damaged had to be marked and brought in back for the associate the worked and returned those. Cleaning/Dusting; made sure dept. was cleaned, dusted items, wiped shelving, nothing was ever to be on the floor, etc. Facing; made sure all items were in their correct spots and pulled forward so that the diamonds on the front of the shelf were covered, as well as front of packaging facing forward. Also at the end of the night you help other departments make sure that all returns are put away, as well as all items pulled forward and faced. Once store is done you are set to go."
bad,Very busy center in the co workers or very helpful in the hardest part is when a customer come to your line with alot of itme when you on the express lane
bad,"Employees are just numbers on a sschedule, schedule changed constanly and there were split shifts"
bad,I did not enjoy my time in the Walmart Bakery at all. It is much more fun to shop at Walmart then it is to work there.
bad,"I worked for Walmart close to 8 years, in just about every department within the store. I saw good and bad things, just like any other company, it has its flaws. I had many good managers that helped me along the way. I feel that the skills and abilities I gained with Walmart will benefit me in any job I get in the future."
bad,"Easy job I had but it was very hard dealing with customers who had to use the bathroom and walk all over my wet floor. Never had an attitude about it. I learned a bout chemicals, safety, responsibility. The management really didn't help me much, that is the reason why I quit after being harassed daily by one of my coworkers. Some of my Coworkers were nice, neat, clean and gentle, some werent. Hardest part of my job was keeping the bathroom floors spotless. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting every thing finished fast."
bad,I found that working for this company was on a scale of 1 to 10 would be a 4. Simply a below average company. They hire solely to fill a positions and at the rate of pay some have to lower their standards to just take the job.
bad,Working here is very stressful and hardly ever see u family around holidays and inventory
bad,I've seen how the workers are treated there and i was disgusted. They are just treated as time slots and drones.
bad,There were often times were you would see associates goofing off on the job and showing absolutely no enthusiasm in the workplace.
bad,"Store was a very fast paced place to work. The demands were high. But they did lack very much in the training of all employees. They expect for a new employee to have the knowledge. This did make it very hard to do well in this store. The customers were great, and the fellow employees were like a small family . The job was very action and fast paced. Hardest part was expecting to get things accomplished with a small staff. The store did teach me how a big box was run and what the expectations were. I did not like the 3rd shift, took a toll on me and my life. That is not a position for everyone."
bad,"Walmart was like working in a cotton field. They wanted you to learn everything so they could work the people they had without having to hire additional bodies but I do thank them for the experience. I now can make keys, mix paint, cut fabric, fold properly and dip fish."
bad,"i worked there for over 3 years, first as a cashier than a stocker. One manager wouldn't let me go home when i was having a miscarriage, another fired me because I injured my back and they had ""no other positions"" for me. They say they are a family company but they treat their employees like dirt. The medical benefits were horrible, the management were horrible. They didn't care about your side of the story. The only good thing about it was the people you worked with most of the time and the customers you met."
bad,This job has it's ups and downs. But what really gets me is the management. They are ur family but they treat u like slaves at that job.
bad,"A typical day at work is more with less. As a supervisor you are pulled to go everywhere with little or no help. The day starts with Management walking my floor delegating notes for the day. But, then being pulled to work the freight in the back room, as well as stocking the floor. Mean while, upper Management is directing me (us) depending who's there that day to run the register's, customer service, help in another area and yet maintain a presentable department witch includes price changes, need to counts and label changes. Needless to say, my days are not boring, its a combination of multi-tasking and prioritizing. But, over-all I enjoy the retail industry, there never seems to be a dull moment."
bad,Basically I would spend my night stocking merchandise and helping customers. The hardest part of the day is when managers stress and passes their stress unto the associates.
bad,Great place to work but theres no movement in the company and the pay rate is not very good at all.
bad,"A day of work consists of making sure the produce department makes a great impression to customers. I've learned how one department can make or break an entire store. The good thing about produce is I work around very good, knowledgeable associates (including our supervisor) who communicate well and emphasize great teamwork to make the job very easy to accomplish our everyday goals. Unfortunately our managers lack communication pretty frequently. They're scheduling and sporadic involvement can sometimes set us up for failure. That can be the hardest thing when we don't get that support. But overall it is a somewhat fun experience."
bad,"I have learned many things while working with this company. My experiences have been learned by applying hands-on experience with very little training. I have learned how to build bicycles, paint, make keys, stock merchandise, and use various power equipment to perform tasks. I have also learned to provide outstanding customer service to the customers."
bad,Customers are the best part of my day
bad,"it was ok to work there i made some friends,but not sure if i ever want to work or even shop there the place isn't the problem but some people there can be very rude."
bad,I worked at the customer service desk. I either open or closed the service desk. i usually dealt with mad customers
bad,"If you are young and just need a job to get a few bucks than walmart is the place. If you are an adult and have a family to provide for than its definitely not the place for you. Uncontrolled management, hours are all over the place, pay is NOT good."
bad,"A normal day at Walmart involves much direction from many members of management. For that reason nothing is done correctly, and the job that I signed up for is not done at all. However, management feels the need to always look at the short-comings rather than encourage and work with the associates. The most difficult part of the job is the inconsistency, please allow the time necessary and give the correct direction by one person rather than everyone saying different things with no communication. The most enjoyable part is when management goes to meetings and allows us to do what we do, we always excel in those situations."
bad,Typical Day: Shelving stock & Assisting customers
bad,More work than could ever be completed. Company not structured toward career advancement.
bad,The management team is very unfair with their employees.My hardest part of the job was getting along with some of the management.The co-workers were great especially the people I worked with as a cashier.
bad,"The job was fine at first, but it has become JUST a job. It's not enjoyable. Morale is down. I have little desire to stay or to try to advance in the company. I do not like the way management interacts with or treats the associates. Co-workers are extremely immature, and that makes the work environment very unpleasant."
bad,"I worked as a stocker overnight. The best part of the job was there was always a lot of work, so 8 hours flew by quickly. The worst part is the unbelievable time limits. Management expects you to complete maybe 6 hours worth of work in 2 hours! It does not matter if you are young, old, pregnant, or disabled, they expect you to get large amounts of work done in an unrealistic time limit. I was once timed when I went to the bathroom. I learned how to utilize machinery such as a fork lift and pallet jack. Co-workers were some of the best people I met in my life. I say this is an idea job for a student because you DO NOT want to be stuck doing this job all of your life. This job motivated to graduated college so that I could find a more respectable job."
bad,"Was a great job to start, management was horrible at scheduling. Would not let anyone advance to the next position. Wanted me to do a manager's job without compensatiting me for it."
bad,"The work pace is very fast. Keeping track of cashiers, stockpeople, greeters, service desk assocations during the shift and making sure everyone got breaks and lunches. Responsible for making change and doing audits on all assocations. Making sure supplies are on hand for all front end assocations. Taking care of Department 82 making sure all items are stocked on the front end of the checkouts. Keeping customers happy."
bad,This was Walmart and everyone know how Walmart is. It is not exactly employee friendly and has a high turnover rate.
bad,"When I was first hired I told the interviewer and the managers that I had a vacation planned the next month, and they told me it was OK. So I go and look at my schedule that week and I was scheduled. I had to talk to three different managers in order to get that week off."
bad,"Managers are not professional. Long hours, low pay. No way of moving up the ladder."
bad,The first thought that came to mind when applying for Walmart was that it was a major company so I figured I'd get well paid and plenty of hours. Unfortunately this was not the case. I was paid minimum wage as a cashier part time with limited hours but still required to go above and beyond my duties which I always do anyway. Not only that but I also wanted to go to school but they couldn't seem to make room in my schedule for that either. The managers at this Walmart did not treat employees with respect. I always felt under pressure and unhappy every working day. Which to me is the biggest priority because if employees aren't happy then customers aren't going to be that happy either.
bad,management does not try to help or explain anything. i thought it was a good company i guess i was wrong but i know all stores are not like that and i would love to work with them once i find that store
bad,Everyone that works there is grumpy and doesnt care. I also tried harder to be better and more considerate to the customers. I know it is not the companies fault that most of their employees hate their lives but at the end of the day we are not suppose to show it. The company should try harder to promote a positive attitude and not limit their employees to so little knowledge that way a cashier or stocker or whatever is more prepared to answer customers questions and able to correct mistakes made by other employees
bad,Hardest part of the job was working hard while every one else was not and not getting noticed for it.
bad,"Greeting Customer, Money Gram, Bill Payments, Check Cashing, Customer Returns,"
bad,"If you like to work min wage forever or can do that, than Wal-mart if for you."
bad,"A typical day at work comprised of providing customer service, zoning and keeping the shelves in stock. Working there on the weekend allowed time to go bye fast"
bad,"The upper management is constantly forcing managers to cut hours last minute. This leads to having to tell your associates that they have less hours and therefore, less income then they had expected for that particular week. This also effects the ability to perform customer service because often times all of the associates are sent home to cut hours(hours = expenses in the eyes of upper managment) and the only Wal-mart employees on the floor are the Assistant Managers who have to perform a dozen tasks all at once."
bad,Wal-Mart is a good place to work if you need asummer job but if you're looking for a career I would not recommend Wal-Mart.
bad,"Come in get projects.. get them done, help people."
bad,I worked overnight stocking merchandise. Most of the time you were given workload for three people and if work was not done you stayed until mostly or all the way done. I received an hour lunch. Co-workers asked for help but never helped when you needed their help. The most enjoyable part of the job was the friends that I made working there.
bad,"This was a fast paced ever changing demanding environment. I learned a great deal about people, associates and customers. I learned that all customers want to do is spend their money on reasonably priced quality merchandise. I learned to deal with strong demanding personalities and pleasent people of a diverse background. the hardest part of my job was supervising associates who were working hard to make a living on less that competative wages. The most enjoyable part of my job was the brotherhood and sisterhood of the management team. Along with the satisfaction of assisting customers with their needs."
bad,"I was a fast, friendly cashier at Wal-Mart. I would also help stock inventory on the front line as needed. I would also offer and suggest products as I am checking the customer out to ensure they have not forgotten anything. If I was not at the register I would also guide and direct customers on where they need to go to locate requested products. The most enjoyable part of the day at work would be assisting the customers that would come to my line only."
bad,The org. Has very good ideas but never completes what they start. Does not show real concern for its employess nor its customers. A typical day at walmart would mostly consist of auditing other managers jobs and follow up with associates work completion. I have learned that when you set out to do a task my sure you complete it. The management team was often stress because of the lack of training. My co-workers and I worked as a great team always as one. The hardest part of my job was not being able to divide myself into ten so I could help eveyone that needed my help. The most enjoyable part of my job was teaching and training.
bad,"The people I met while working there are people that I still talk to everyday however the company is a horrible place to work for. They expect to much for that little of pay and most not all, of the managers are jokes!"
bad,"Huge regret. This job was able to barely pay the bills. Went into the job with management, supervisor, trainer, and retail experience of about 4 years. I was hired at just over minimum wage. Needed a job so I accepted. Was told that it was easy to get into supervisor and management positions, but each time something opened up, it was replaced by a supervisor in a different department and then would just move supervisors around. Management gave big promises of advancements, but would never deliver on anything. Also, they are happy to give you quarterly performance reviews, but dont expect a raise until a year comes around, if you can last that long."
bad,"Management in my store was very poor, often times schedules were made outside of an employees availability. Salaried managers often not knowledgeable of the departments they are in charge of. Especially when it comes to departments in the fresh area such as meat, deli, produce or bakery. None of the members of the management team were capable or willing to work in the deli in the event that we were short handed due to absenteeism or a poorly written schedule which results in poor customer service. Managers never compliment the work of their subordinate employees and many are condescending."
bad,various physical and mental demands
bad,"It was always busy. Learned alot from co-workers. I really loved my job, but the hardest thing was trying to teach the young ones. They always new it all."
bad,"Overall I became certified to use the forklift and was training to become an assistant manager, co-workers are fun to work with, the ones that tak to you walmart co-workers were divided into two groups and one side doest talk to the other for some reason. The hardest part of the day is two hours before shifts over because I'd have to make sure everything goes where it's needed to. The fun part is the first three hours because it's the easiest. They say to follow walmart procedures, but not even managers follow them, it's an unsafe work area. Managers don't care about what's going on they don't even communicate with each other, productivity on sales floor is poor."
bad,"Employees are not valued by the establishment. However, I did learn time management skills in terms of department work. Stocking needed to be done in a timely fashion."
bad,"I made really good friends while I worked here, but I believe that every WalMart is the same. HORRIBLE!"
bad,My day started at 4 pm unloading the truck. When that was done we took 15 minute break. After that we worked on breaking down the loose freight till lunch. we took 1 hour for lunch. Then we the pallitized freight out to the sales floor. We had a 15 minute break then started the last few hours of work by helping out with the picks for the store before we went home.
bad,My typical day at work would consist of me either ringing up customers or lending a helping hand at the customer service desk. During my time there I learned how to work the cash register. The management was ok. Working here I really never interacted with my co-workers like that. There was nothing hard about this job nor was their anything fun about this job.
bad,"do telzon work, stock the sleves, go to the back room pull merchindise out and stock"
bad,"My typical day is manageing 25 cashier , assisting customers, paying vendor. The hardest part is co-worker calling off & I have to be manager and cashier. The most enjoyable part of the day is solving a problem for customer which and knowing they left happy"
bad,Too many managers come and go. Management does not deal with harrassement issues from other employees and they do not enforce policies. bad communication among managers
bad,"Over the course of the last five years I have witnessed the price that the low prices on our merchadise comes with. Schedule changes are often required at the last minute. I have gone from 1st shift to 3rd shift back to 1st seemingly every other week since taking over as a Department Manager. Employees are expected to sacrifice their time at a moments notice, by being asked to work extended hours minutes before leaving for the day, only to be required to shave the time by taking extended lunches the remainder of the week. The sick leave program operating on a demerit based system is a joke and is often only enforced when convenient. I've witnessed persons being reprimanded for taking maternity leave, as well as those missing time for taking care of a sick child or themselves. You're required to give at least three weeks notice for use of personal and vacation time, but often times are forced to wait until the very week before to find out whether or not it has been approved. The favoritism at play in some stores is enough to make you sick though I'm sure that this is a quality rampant everywhere. The absolut worst thing about working for Wal-mart is the micro-management. People are often pulled in so many different directions that very little can be accomplished. When stating tasks that have already been assigned they are waved off dismissively, but are then held against you when you are unable to finish all work assigned."
bad,There were alot of times when I thought that I was being singled out because of my age. And Management team was very divided
bad,"This place started out with so much hope and promise and quickly went down in flames. I started working here as a cashier over night and quickly got promoted to manager. This job had no further room for advancement, I worked every weekend, I had to work while I was sick, they took everything about this job being rewarding and fun and made it against company rules. It should be all about making your customers happy and their best interest. That clearly isn't the case in this establishment. Moral is low, after one week most people don't even come back. Those that have been here for a long time can't get hired anywhere else or have mental issues with the same result.The most enjoyable part of this job was clocking out to go home."
bad,"Walmart is an alright place to work. Customers are great, you get the odd one that just won't budge but for the most part all is well. as of right now part time employees are working almost full time hours and unfortunately not getting any benefits which is unfortunate considering most are parents. Associates are awesome, again with the exception of a select few. The hardest part of the job would be lifing awkward items over and over again and not being able to always perform a safe lift. Management is ok, some managers listen and some do not. Most enjoyable part will always be the customers hands down!!! Working at walmart has given me patience, understanding, and comstantly learning new ideas and recipes from customers."
bad,"Since you never receive your lunch and breaks, you get to know your coworkers. Management always blamed the computers for scheduling errors but ""certain"" employees never had these problems. Sorry I can stop my dad from dying, control the weather, and some predictable and some unmanageable medical conditions (like cancer). When there is a travel warning for a blizzard or ice storm, I am not killing my self to drive there or getting arrested for drive to get to work."
bad,Part time position. The optical was very very slow. Not much business. There was little training by management.
bad,"I was treated like a number not as a person, not much room for advancement, short breaks, and management was horrible."
bad,"Manager's acted as if they didn't care about anything. They would not give you any important days off, but they would get off for any little thing. They would not help as all when work was very busy."
bad,This was not the best job in the world. It is great for people in high school or just graduated.
bad,"My day at work begins with clocking in, going to the backroom to prepare it for a truck unload. Once we are set up someone opens the door to the truck and we begin the unload process. After finishing the truck which takes anywhere between 2-4 hours, we go on a 15 minute break and depending on the time we either help in other departments of the store such as the pets area, or we go to lunch (if it's nearing 8 PM). From there we come back pull out the pallets of freight we stacked from unloading the truck to their designated department, clean up the back room, and finally are sent to a department to work for the rest of the night. That is also the time we can be pulled to do other tasks that our co-workers need help with."
bad,A typical day at Walmart always consist of the same daily routines used to make production run smoothly. Dealing with different people everyday made the job more interesting. I learned alot from working at walmart I gained alot of management skill but most of all people and communication skills. My co-workers were good hard workers and I made some life time friends working there. The hardest part of the job was there was no recognition for the work you did do but you were always critized for what you didnt do. The most enjoyable part was learning new things that helped me become a much better and productive employee to the company.
bad,"I had worked there for 5 years, but it seemed like they wanted to use every excuse to get rid of me after I got a pay raise in the double digits. Sure, I was glad to get benefits, but the management had gotten really bad at the end. They would only cower to the customers who would abuse their power and not give any consideration to what the employee would say. I would not work at that location again, nor would I shop there. That is why I am very soured on this company."
bad,"I work at 8, First things i do when I get to work is turn on the lights, computers, and then take out the tires that sit outside. I usually open with a good friend. We find stuff to do until customers come in to get work done. Before this job I never worked on any vehicle, now I'm one of the best in the shop today. The hardest part of my day is the slow times when we got no work, and just waiting to go home. I really done enjoy my job and that is way I'm looking for something else to do."
bad,Training
bad,Walmart very easy workplace just relies on your people skills. I learned a lot from Walmart all about the stock system. Management had a little too many power hungry levels of manage personnel. Employees consisted of a wide range of personalities. I enjoyed interacting with the customers even though your ran ragged.
bad,· Developing a workflow process resulting in the ability to manage multi worksite employees
bad,"As a formal employee, my job duties were to restock shelves, clean my surrounding area, and dispose all empty cartons. While working at Wal-Mart, I was asked to work in different departments that was required to have two employees, but instead i was left alone to replenish all heavy loads. Most managers would not even bother to help. They give remarks about how other employees were capable of doing it themselves. Only thing enjoyable about this job was taking breaks with other employees."
bad,"was a short term job, but we got it done, we put up a new Walmart store"
bad,"Walmart lets certain employees get away with things and others get written up. If you have a bad day and are not performing to your max at all times, you are subject to a write up. When Pregnant some stores do not take that into consideration on time constraints."
bad,The company doesn't stand behind their employess. If you are making above the average new hire they will look for ways to demote or terminate you.
bad,Liked the job but not enough hours for what I needed to have. I got to the point I made an 8 hour shift into a 5 hour shift.
bad,not a really good place to work its really over worked and under paid if you have ever heard of that expression
bad,"Arrive on time, prepare for work, greet co-workers, take orders and prep food. The hardest part of the job was having to stand long periods of time."
bad,"Poor job, poor money, Too far away from home. Needed to find a new career. was unsatisfied with work and pay."
bad,"When leadership changes direction, you better hold on tight or run to keep up. The salary for most management positions is high compared to other jobs in this state. Just know that you'll be spending a lot more time at the office than with your family, and the dusty cubicles are far from cozy. Expect to go in early and leave late every single day. You'll spend countless hours in pointless meetings and hardly have time for lunch. Don't bother calling ISD when your laptop crashes. Just find the smartest guy in your department and beg for his help. Even if he's on vacation this week, it will still get done faster than going through ISD."
bad,work from 10pm-7am ...stock clean and organize section ....work your area from back have to lifted boxes and pull frieght
bad,Walmart has a bad relations with its employees. High turnover rates; poor beginning wages which makes the majority of its employees reliant on welfare to survive; it takes a year to get some of your benefits and two years to get all of them; backstabbers and favoritism is more common than you know.
bad,The management staff is rude and inconsiderate. Hours are rediculous and benefits are terrible.
bad,"Overnight is what keeps this store going, and we're understaffed, our hours have been cut, and it's all to maximize profit, and make the shareholders happy.. versus keeping your workers happy.. it's just a weak job."
bad,"Was a good learning experience, I was a fast learner and taught others as it was needed. I learned how to take care of my cusomers and there needs, how to order and special order for the different departments that I was in. Working in a large place with over 300 associates taught me how to work with others."
bad,"The job wasn't the bad part, it was the management and their lack of communication."
bad,They do not work with you when you need to change hours or need to come in late or leave early.
bad,"Once you enter management your family comes second. Regardless of how well you do, it will not refect on your eval."
bad,Wal-Mart is pry one of the worst place that I have ever worked. All the employes are vary unhappy they hate their job and feel like they are slaves to their job and are treated realy bad by the management. Most of the staff that works over night are looking for new jobs or have been there so long that they feel they can not find a job that pays as much and dont want to do any thing to risk there jobs.
bad,"Management personel that I encountered never followed through with discussed issues. These ranged from established work schedules, assurances of transfers, to waiting weeks on urgent needed work supplies (such as hair nets). Fellow employees complained constantly of short staffing and more and more cut hours."
bad,It was a fun place to work when I started but the company is not what it used to be. My store was a training store so we had to train many managers and that made it harder on the associates. They also expected you to have full and open availbility and yet only wanted to hire part time. I got a decent rate of pay when I started but they have gone to mostly minimum wage.
bad,Wal-mart isnt so bad for working for a summer job it is usually pretty easy to get on and the work isn't complicated. However staying there can be pretty tough especially now full time hours are hard to come by and the criteria for advancement is not static. How ever the customer service experience one gains by such a job can be useful. Having worked at multiple wal-mart stores in every one i have been in management is always very inconsistent be prepared to be tossed in with out any instruction and learn as you go and hopefully you have people to help but more often than not you are by yourself.
bad,Working relationship good with coworkers.
