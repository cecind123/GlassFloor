good,"Start your day with fast meeting. Currently undergoing a transition from old to new tools involving clouds, which will be certainly beneficial for the organization."
good,"There are some politics you have to battle through at times... but overall it's a good place to work. If you stay engaged with your manager, you can advance in the company."
good,Typical training consists of learning as you go. There is formal training provided but it will more than likely not be tailored towards what you will actually be doing.
good,JPM looks to keep you in your role if you produce.  The direct management  only cares how you make them look and has no concern about your skills or future.
good,"Development, innovation and aggressive quality control is paramount to the daily culture. With the ability to use tools outside the company, we are able to develop aggressive quality standards that challenge daily tasks."
good,"Typical work day. Great benefits, 401k match, pension etc. Solid vacation time. Good company to work for. Management is good but changes rapidly. Enjoy the co-workers."
good,It's a good job. I love working there and still do. The department right now is volatile because of streamlining and outsourcing our work. The only downside to this position is the stability and likelihood that it will exist in the future.
good,Working at JP Morgan chase has been a experience. The company really does take care of their employees I work part time but I still get benefits and a 401k. And the I loved working with the people their.
good,"Great place to work at. Abundance to learn however you learn and get used to it over time. Pay was good as well, especially if youre a college student.

good,"offer a lot of banking services like other bankers do, except they deal with professional businessmen/women, entrepreneurs and investors. Help with complex issues."
good,My favorite part about JPMorgan is the culture. Internal mobility is truly part of it.I have seen many colleagues move internally and to other lines of business.
good,"Entered at the top of what I can do with them without going to corporate.  It's a good job though, just make sure you have a good branch manager, or you'll find yourself getting cut out of PVCs you deserve and earned."
good,"A typical day at work can either be slow and smooth or busy and hectic. Being a friendly , open minded person will get you far within the company. Sometimes being outspoken or too determined can hinder your success with the company. The hardest part about the job is maybe the constant change in protocol. The most enjoyable part is that you are in a healthy, positive work environment it makes it easier to get through the day no matter what the work load entails."
good,"I worked with JPMC as a consultant so I wasn't an employee with JPMC. I worked with them for a period of one year. "
good,Good culture and friendly people.  I worked for 2 great people that I really liked. Its competitive and a great place to network for career advancement.
good,Best part of my job is brainstorming with colleagues on how we can error-free our invoices to our clients as well as meeting their expectations and having transparency with management.
good,"JP Morgan Chase does care about employees. Great benefits. Excellent coworkers. However, not enough room for advancement. Advancement requires being able to work any shift. Not every person can do this."
good,Chase is a good place to start a career. The benefits are very good. There are plenty of opportunities to advance if you take the time to research. Self starters will excel.
good,Being part of this organisation learnt various new things. Sometimes there is micro-management and you are reviewed for your work everyday. Apart from it the company is good and people are good as well.
good,"If you have a good manager who communicates clearly and fairly with you, this is a great place to work. They invest in the facilities and technologies so that employees have everything they need to do their job and enjoy working there. They are making a company-wide effort to make it a flatter organization, be more agile and cut bureaucracy. At any company there may be some inexperienced or deceptive managers who may make things difficult, but overall it is a great company that cares about its employees and does everything it can to help them succeed."
good,"JP Morgan was very strict when it come to their client security. Team Leaders made sure their direct report are doing a good job by having one on one every month. "
good,Chase bank good place to work. but there is a glass ceiling. no career growth options. Chase did not Promote with in the company. Chase always hired supervisors from other banks that had issues and never trained or supported employees to grow with in the company.
good,"Overall, JPMorgan has been a great experience thus far in my career. I took part in the Analyst Rotational Program and got to experience multiple departments within Wealth Management."
good,"Ability to work daily with clients and customers."
good,The work environment at JPMorgan Chase is very challenging with daily production goals that are set to challenge and encourage a highly productive environment. The company offers a learning environment by providing continuing education that is relevant to each line of business through various mandatory trainings. The hardest part of the job is trying to achieve a work life balance as the demands of the job are high along with a high expectation on quality and productivity goals. The most enjoyable part of the job is the support for employees and the best system processes in the AML industry that JPMC offers.
good,"JPMC has lots of opportunities to choose from, which means there is a lot to learn. The culture in some areas is fun but fast-paced. Some managers are great leaders, and help with career development."
good,"JPM is at the top in many areas of the industry, and therefore it opens door to all kinds of growth opportunities, which is a big plus."
good,"JP Morgan Chase is an excellant company to work for if your career goal is business related. Employees of the company are always reconize for the contributions to their position. "
good,"This company was the only company ihave ever worked for that developed my skills and allowed me to grow. I have since gone on to working in other companies in tghe same capacity, and was grateful for the development I received at Chase."
good,Good working environment but lack of salary is one reason I am leaving. I've learned alot in this role at JP Morgan but want to pursue other opportunities
good,"Large company, can be good for advancement but rules are very stringent. Compensation is generally lower than similar jobs in the area, but work-life balance is better."
good,"Was many years ago, but did not have any real issues with company. Loss Mitigation area was very stressful department because of the nature in which group had to deal with clients. Many of which were losing their homes. Great benefits and company di care about their employees."
good,Attained a vast amount of knowledge in payment processing for multi-channel merchants.  I was able to use my experience and knowledge to advance my career.
good,It is easy to get pigeon holed in the consumer level.  You are as valuable to the company as a transactional employee. You could be really good at certain things for example lending and investments but want to keep you in front of customer service because it is what the branch needs.
good,A great company to work with as its a technology driven company. Workplace culture is awesome. There are opportunities to learn a lot as you get movement to other teams regularly based on performance.
good,Chase offers competitive PTO and decent benefits. Most of the managers I've had were passionate about their job and cared about their employees. The biggest downside was lack of advancement opportunities between lines of business.
good,"•	Prepare and calculate income and assets thoroughly before submission to underwriting "
good,The opportunity was a fundamental stepping stone and I am glad that I had the chance to belong to this corporation.  I am ready to challenge myself at another level.
good,"Since JPM is a Fortune 30 company, it is the work place of choice for many people, so it has the ability to select the most talented people to work there.  Being a global company, it offers a great deal of mobility and management is open to helping you move."
good,accuracy and being meticulous is a must. extreme patience is needed to deal with customers.  Employees need to understand the importance of confidentiality and privacy with regards to personal information.
good,Reconciling different accounts keep you alert and on task.  Which I love learning new things and helping others. You have to be knowledgeable for each company at the bank and making sure the accounts are in balance.
good,"Typical day for me consists of coming in the morning "
good,"Excellent company to work for.  "
good,Chase pride themselves at winning- customer satisfaction surveys were important and could be the determining factor of losing your job.  Chase love to celebrate wins
good,"A lot of hands on experience"
good,"Although, the company provide training and activities for advancement management can hold you back. Promotions of managers are based on previous performance and no abilities and skills to manage people. Many managers micromanage even you are salaried."
good,"Continuous training offered"
good,I enjoyed my time working here.  I was contracted to work at JP Morgan Chase as a Legal Assistant through Hudson Legal.  The pay was good and the hours were flexible which was a blessing for me as a single mom.
good,"Awesome benefits, advancement opportunities at this location dependent on who you know. Lots of diversity and acceptance of others, but not of personal life issues. They want you to anticipate when you will be sick."
good,"In whatever role you find yourself in at Chase, you can be assured that the level of effort you put in will equate to the amount of compensation received. While the salary range falls a bit short of the industry norm, the incentives more than make up for the differential. That said, the direction from management is often cookie cutter-esque, robotic, and often misguided in an AZ market that is substantially different than Chase's other major markets. Additionally, work-life balance is highly promoted, but the compensation structure and desire to operate on lean staffing models makes that balance often hard to find."
good,A typical work place deals with researching and analyzing documents.I will write letters for corporate clients using corporate actions. The workplace culture is relaxed.
good,Just make sure you are using procedures accordingly . They stress being ontime 15 minutes before work to ensure your are ready for the day. always use job aids as well.
good,"Not a very progressive company."
good,Fairly easy job but no job security what so ever. Played favorites most of the time and made the rest of us feel a bit awkward when it came time for business.
good,"3 paid weeks of vacation, 6 sick days, 3personal days, 5% 401k match, retirement plan...low salary. Job security as long as you do what you need to do, but ike every corporate lack of career mobility unless you are part of the ""group"" ."
good,I worked mortgage collections for Chase during my stay.  The morale was mostly positive.  This was due to scheduled team meetings and competitive team activities .  Work was always competitive due to the high incentives that were paid.
good,"The last manager I reported to was very fair.I worked in a call center with a very strong emphasis on excellent customer service. As a Correspondent channel employee, i learned how Chase did business with Correspondent Lenders as Agencies. (FNMA, FHA, VA, etc)"
good,"* It's pleasure working on day to day basis with JP Morgan."
good,Entry level position with a low yearly salary. They offered overtime but rarely. Overall the position was not terrible but there was little room for advancement.
good,"Great people and culture. Great benefits, supportive coworkers. Excellent training and ways to continue to learn and improve. Good schedule flexibility."
good,great people hard to advance.  Pay is good not great.  You have to make connections to advance.  They like drive.  Had a great time the years I was there.
good,Good company good benefits horrible pay.  Good culture repetitive work.  Give good beaks  .  Management varies some good some bad but manger move every couple of months so if you dont like one just wait out for next
good,"Great management team at JPMorgan Chase - it was a great place to work with some great people. Unfortunately, the card side of the business has pulled out of Canada."
good,The firm is well respected but i found that the size of the company prevented you from doing anything that was out of the ordinary for your position. I was around from the merger of Bear Stearns so there were many meetings with large groups to determine what needed to stay and go.
good,"The project was estimated to take about 6 months to complete, my team completed it in half the time, so I focused on other issues within the department and they were handled but because I was just an intern my job was temporary. The department that I worked for no longer exist because they did not allow me to fix the other issues within the department because I was a temp."
good,"JP Morgan Chase is overall a very good place to work. The salary is competitive, the culture is collaborative, and the work can be intellectually challenging."
good,"Keyed clients information into an excel spread sheet. "
good,"Oversee Branch Audits, Loss Control Evaluate and Document risk Exposure"
good,Working at JP Chase Morgan in the collection department was hectic.  A person had to be organize and quick thinking to be able to offer or resolve or find a solution pertaining to the clients over due accounts.  Must be flexible.
good,"global authority on building, sustaining, and recognizing high-trust, high-performing workplace cultures. We have crafted our perspective by learning from great leaders, surveying millions of employees, and examining thousands of the best workplaces around the globe. We thrive on sharing the insights we’ve gleaned from our work with companies of all industries and sizes in order to help organizations around the world build, sustain and scale their great culture."
good,"It was a fast paced and competitive environment.  There were monthly and weekly goals that were somewhat difficult to attain, but there was plenty of support from management."
good,"Its a great place to work. I was an intern for six months. I have learnt  a lot about how corporate world works. This internship has helped me to improve my work ethics. All in all, it was a great experience working in JP Morgan Chase"
good,"You are mainly tasked with opening and closing checking and saving accounts. All the while selling customers on applying for credit cards, applying for mortgage loans, opening and funding a savings account if they do not have one. Opening business accounts and getting high balance clients to meet with Financial Advisers."
good,Management is pretty good at assisting employees needs. Friendly atmosphere and management does help protect employees from abusive customers. Small problem with each employees knowledge.
good,"JP Morgan has great benefits and has a great workplace culture. My department lacked good management, however my peers and staff made it enjoyable. JP Morgan has many different lines of businesses that give opportunities to many types of people."
good,Everyone is very likable and very good to work with. I've learned many things about the job itself. The management is still pretty good but some managers do not really tend to help you advance so you have to really want it.
good,"I enjoy working at JP Morgan Chase.  Sometimes its size as an organization causes challenges for asset management.  Overall, the organization is run at a high level."
good,Constantly having to cross sell products to the same customers. Most of the branches in Westchester/ Putnam county are small branches and it's mostly the same people who come in and do business.
good,Competitive Benefits with great 401k matching.  Culture is improving with executive leadership focus. Most difficult portion is the constant adding of duties without proper compensation
good,I loved working for Chase and would be open to returning to the firm. The last manager I had there was less than competent and ultimately the role I was recently assigned to was eliminated.
good,"Supported up to 5 market managers and completed whatever their task were for that day.  Set up meetings, processed expense reports, collaborated with branches on their needs and would find a resolution.  Handle customer issues and handle resolving the situation.  Send out correspondences emails to staff as well as letter correspondence to customers.  Maintain various monthly and weekly reports. Take meeting minutes.  Maintain branch manager and assistant branch manager employee files.  Process all new hires, promotions and terminations."
good,"I really enjoyed my time here working as a Business Project Manager and got to participate in helping to define data flows for a Statements product and work in an Agile environment.  Unfortunately for Contractors, there were budget cuts and all contractors were let go at the same time, regardless of performance or seniority.  This is why I'm still hesitant to pursue contract opportunities with this firm."
good,Worked in company over 32+ years and found it to be educational as well as exciting.  Ability for advancement and gained opportunities to learn new skills.
good,"Quickly assist clients with their basic finances, while still making sure that they receive excellent customer service and getting them out of the bank in a timely fashion. Still making sure to sell both checking and savings accounts and directing them to a banker."
good,Very professional and fast paced environment. Typical day at work involved solving several problems and meeting numerous deadlines. Lots of phone calls and meetings to attend. The hardest part of the job was the three hour commute by car. The most enjoyable part of the job was being part of a very professional and dedicated team.
good,A typical day at JPMC is being busy from the start of day to the end of day. I've learned a lot of different tasks and my manager was very flexible. The workplace is very diverse which makes it easy to be social to your co-workers. The hardest part of the job is when everyone isn't on the same page as far as the updates that's going with the different teams and the changing of the process of how certain tasks work. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you're able to work at your own pace as long as you're getting the job done effectively.
good,Great Place to work. provide option to relocate however when business need changes your whole world changes in a blink of an eye. Chase provides option to be rehired.
good,Good job not much opportunity outside of sales. Good benefits. No more assistant branch manager role. Relationship bankers have lots of stress. Good company if you don’t mind working Saturday’s
good,Learned a lot working there didn’t know it took so much to come to this country. So happy to help someone do what that wanted to be with the one they loved.
good,"The company has several restriction that impede in sales objectives, but complete fair to protect the consumer. having an understanding of that will help any one be successful at chase"
good,"Overall working as a teller at Chase had it's pros and cons. Luckily the management I worked with was great. It was a busy branch due to high demand of commercial business, so it was stressful out of the times to do what was required."
good,"Chase is a great place to work with a good culture, if you are willing to work hard.  If you are lazy and want everything just given to you, then this is NOT the place for you.  "
good,"MY opportunity at JPMChase was a great one as far as benefits, pay, and incentives is concerned. As for my actual work, it was constantly changing as my team was assigned to help out with numerous other teams and projects. There weren't many opportunities for advancement in my opinion, just several opportunities to move laterally."
good,"It provides job satisfaction as you feel that you accomplish through the work you do, though it is competitive and long hours.If you are looking for a place to grow work wise this is the right place."
good,You are allowed to work as an individual as well as in a group environment. The employees will make time to teach and help you out if you require additional assistance. They are focused on meeting expectations and exceeding them. One of the best financial institutions to be a part of.
good,"If you're determined to give it your best shot every day, this is the place to be. Everyone is focused on the same thing, meeting and exceeding the goal. There are no slackers and it's great place to learn new things, if you're interested."
good,go to work answer phones I do not feel conformtable answering this review of a current employer without knowing how the information is being used. this is all i will say
good,Ability to take time off when needed. You can manage the days you want to come into work and the time you would like to take off for whatever the reason.
good,"The call center environment was extremely stressful, with almost no downtime and not enough people to take calls to reduce the stress of back to back phone calls for an entire 10hr shift. The people I worked with, including managers, made it a little easier to deal with. Monthly bonuses were outstanding when I started and were done away with after a few years with a negligible increase in pay to compensate. The main reason that I left was due to the company making us do a 'shift bid' every six months roughly, regardless of how it would interfere with family life-i.e. you may end up on 1st, 2nd, or 3rd shift, working Sat and Sundays, etc."
good,JPMorgan is a good place to work.  There is room for growth and they believe in work-life balance. The managers were very knowledgeable and encouraged staff to expand their horizons.
good,"Making phone calls using my book of business."
good,Worked under tight deadlines but it did not seem like I was under tremendous pressure. The supervisors were very helpful. I had great supervisors and great co workers.
good,"good work culture, competitive work, good team and lovable work atmosphere. the terminal under data processed is very accurate and helps you be on top of your business."
good,"Long hours at work almost everyday."
good,Solid company in both reputation and financials. Excellent job opportunities from entry level to Vice President. Relocation will be necessary for positions above Managing Director.
good,"nice, fun and fast pace environment. Great leadership team; however not really diverse. Compensation is poor but there is a great work like balance. Great company to work for"
good,"JPMC is a worldwide financial entity with hundreds of thousands of associates, yet within each team there is a true level of teamwork and camaraderie, especially between diverse teams in different companies."
good,"I do not feel it appropriate for me to rate JP Morgan Chase today as my last day there was in 2008.  "
good,"It is a great bank to work for. I regret leaving and going to another bank that was definitely not as good to work for. Anyone who wants work in banking, Chase is the best one to work for."
good,"In terms of culture, I would rank JP Morgan amongst the top. Senior management cares about the people who are working in the organization by constantly arranging one on one meetings with them"
good,"Overall, a typical day was fast-paced handling high-level clients.  On the phone with clients or meetings.  Workplace culture was lacking as the company grew.  As a result, opinions/feedback of employees weren't heard.  The company has amazing benefits and various job opportunities."
good,"Chase allowed bankers to work at their own pace. Every morning starts with a briefing that consists of progress reports for each banker. So everyone is very aware of each other's monthly numbers (successes, and failures). Each banker is required to get a certain number of ""points"" per month or quarter (I don't remember which), this number determines your bonus pay. Also, if you don't meet the minimum # of points, you can be terminated."
good,"Great working and learning experience related to the card processing industry, very good incentives and benefits. Team leaders are willing to help along with senior agents in the training process"
good,JP Morgan Chase is a great company to work for if interested in the banking industry. The company values your opinion and they find ways to assist customers.
good,Liked JP Morgan a lot. I would have loved to stay if not lured away by another firm with more money. was a very convenient commute for me. I truly respected my first line manager tremendously.
good,"A typical day is fast paced, is an overall good place to work, a large company with many career opportunities.  I have learned much about mortgage banking, coworkers have been the most enjoyable part."
good,"I would receive calls from brokers to release funds that needed to be put into different accounts, at the end of the day I had to run reports make sure everything added up at the end of the work day"
good,Left because an old colleague recruited me to where she moved to. She lied about her experience at her new place of work but that really made me realize how much nicer it was to work at Chase
good,"Company culture is good, but quality of life largely determined by immediate manager."
good,"Diaponibilização aos funcionários das mais modernas ferramentas de trabalho, empresa oferece aos funcionários os mais modernos recursos tecnológicos em termos de equipamentos, telefonia, informática."
good,Aggressive and demanding workload due to department job responsibilities.  Great rapport with internal and external clients.  Offered a great benefits package.
good,Great environment with good working hours. I worked as part time but whenever I wanted I could take on extra hours and make extra money. They provided a very good training on customer service.
good,It is a great company to work. I have learned many things and taken many different responsibilities and overall it has been a great company from benefits to time away.
good,good place to grow very competitive you got to like that type of workplace to thrive in it but great benefits and employee discounts hard work pays off at this job
good,"Overall, I really enjoyed working at Chase. There were coworker issues like there would be at any job, but it was fast paced and great with your time off, benefits, etc. The management at my branch wasn't the best at times and there was definitely favoritism. Not a lot of room for advancement and if you wanted to advance, you had to be there for at least a year. The best part about my branch was that one of my coworkers always had Friends on in the breakroom. It would take the stress away from a stressful day at work!"
good,"Being promoted, wage and limited breaks. They do have a great culture. They have many type of benefits you and enroll in. The branches will be short staffed."
good,The department in Chase that I work for has taught me a wide variety of skills. The many benefits and the pay that JPMorgan provides really puts this company at the top of the list for most desired jobs.
good,Company underwent several rounds of layoffs as they outsourced jobs to Asia.  During my time there I did receive bonuses & promotions.  Would certainly consider working for Chase in the future.
good,"Chase as a company is amazing, I had some pretty significant things happen in my personal life while working at chase that impacted my attendance and ability to focus at work. I had pneumonia the first of the year and used up all my sick time. Then My husband had a heart attack and was hospitalized for some time after which he was diagnosed with congestive heart failure. My management team bent over backwards to help me in any way they could. The pay is decent, benefits are wonderful but the job itself is very repetitive. Your entire day is planned out-each second is specifically accounted for and you answer the exact same questions over and over day in and day out. Like I said, as a company chase is great and you won't find a better employer but the job itself lacks intellectual stimulation, which makes for a long boring day leaving you to feel pretty un-accomplished."
good,Chase is a good place to work. The people you work with are generally just good people. Usually the issues that run there is they tend to over hire causing issues every few years. There are many managers who are competent and search to uplift their team. Probably the best part of working there is the people. Even when things may not always ideal most do what they can for others which speaks strongly to whom they seek to hire.
good,"Fast Pace work environment"
good,"I have worked as transaction specialist (business analyst).."
good,"I started as personal banker and I was trained to become a Relationship Banker. I was in training for 2 months to get Licensed with Series 6, 63 and life"
good,Service centers receive less benefits compared to branches.Some teams may tend to specialize solely on one kind of process that it limits growth. But generally a good place to meet people and advance your career.
good,Chase is a great company to work for. I honestly have no complaints other than some areas should be compensated better than what some are. I would go back any day!
good,"This was my second contract at  JP Morgan and what little work we got to do, I enjoyed very much. JP Morgan always has had a high "
good,Good company to take new challenges and learning. Also to grab new opportunity within the organization. Salary is good and if you earn always good rating then earnings become more.
good,"I no longer work for JMP Chase, but it was a good working environment, I will recommend this company it has great benefits. I will like to work for them again."
good,"Typical work day was reviewing approximately 40-60 possible short sales in the mortgage industry. Of these short sales I was responsible for government loan, (FHA, USDA and VA.) in which I would review the offer on the property and then determine if the offer was good based of appraisal and governmental guidelines."
good,JP Morgan/Chase stays competitive in the market place by treating its employees with respect.  Competitive compensation and benefits help defer the quick paced work environment.
good,"Working for JP Morgan Chase, which is a big cultural pot and you will learn the company's value . The company provided all sort of medical and compensation meets the industry standard."
good,Fast paced and dynamic workplace dealing with investment bankers and a full floor fit out was fun and exciting.   Contract terminated based on outsourcing cost cutting.
good,Chase was a good entry level job to start working at. I advanced over the course of 9 plus years with hard work and dedication put forth in my work and time there. You have to keep advancing forward otherwise it is very easy to become stagnant in your job role there.
good,I hit my 15 year mark with the company July 2017. They have great benefits and a winning culture. Management assists in your development. There is room for learning and growing.
good,Chase was a great place to learn about the finance industry with great people and benefits. A positive experience in spite of the past housing industry challenges of the past.
good,"When I was there, I was a paralegal in the Legal Dept. It was a pretty good place to work. For the most part the employees were nice and worked together to get a problems solved."
good,I began my work experience at JPM Chase in the student loan department.  We worked in a call center environment and it was somewhat stressful because management didn't anticipate the high call volume.  I later moved to a new area of student loans and it was much better but our jobs were eventually eliminated and I was reassigned to the West Ops Location where I worked in the subpoena processing department.  It was not bad but we worked long hours because every subpoena that came in had to be processed into the system the same day.  Also there were sensitive documents that had to be mailed out daily.  I loved the people at Chase and the management in student loans worked hard to let us know they understood what we were dealing with and presented extra activities to make us feel appreciated.
good,"Chase bank is a good employer, but as with a lot of corporations now, they hire more part-time tellers and advancement can be slow depending on the area and state that you live in. Training is very good and management has always been extremely helpful. Benefits are decent, but if you're part-time and employed for less then two years, you do not qualify for FMLA."
good,Learned PeopleSoft and how to process very large payrolls (85K employees). Management and trainers are in a different state and abroad so training is on the phone for hours everyday.  Most enjoyable part of job is working from home on Friday
good,"A typical day at work are long hours and intense if you have the wrong manager working with you."
good,JP Morgan Chase was a good job to have. It provided good experience. Accept the position was a bit mundane to me. Other than that it was pretty good overall
good,"JP Morgan Chase is one of the most competitive companies I have ever worked for. The nature of the business is bound with opportunity for some of the leading banking minds, and to see technology used at the highest level. Change is inevitable in this company, so flexibility is a must as the environment changes rapidly and frequently."
good,Good training program for newly hired and existing associates. Heavy Sales focused environment. limited growth and development.  Feels like you are 1 of a million employees.
good,"The benefits are very good as far as time off (3 weeks paid vacation to start, 3 personal days, and 48 hours sick time).  You can't find that anywhere else.  But if you end up with bad management it brings the job culture down and it creates a high turnover rate.  "
good,"Great for college students looking to get their foot in the door. May not be a place to make a career for everyone. Relaxed environment, friendly coworkers, great management team."
good,"JP Morgan Chase is a fast-paced company with a focus on quality. I enjoyed the management, job culture, the people I worked with, great benefits and the work I did. The only issue I had was with the pay. I found that I could make much more money at other companies. Also, JP Morgan Chase gave me promotions and more responsibility, but rarely with any pay increase. Even with high yearly reviews, I was denied pay increases because of ""timing issues"" or some other seemingly made-up reason."
good,"The department was all work and there was some burnout among loss mitigation and collections representatives.  Senior management was mindful of this and both receptive and supportive to my idea for a reward and recreation program.  I was able to establish the program which included impromptu team games, month end catered lunches, small and large prizes and ongoing recognition for individuals in a variety of categories.  This is a company that understood morale had a direct impact on performance and success."
good,"I truly enjoyed my time working at JP Morgan Chase.  They gave me a great opportunity to use my skills to be very productive.  The incentive plan is great if you work hard.   My only complaint, other that some of the regular corporate culture items, is they have many unusual policies with very little room for error that lead to high turnover of employees."
good,"Expect at least an hour overtime for a typical day at Investment Banking. On heavy days, expect to stay for over 12 hours. As you climb up the ladder, expect higher pays to come with more hours and a lot of stress. Team Leaders do not get overtime pay. Expect to work during local holidays. Do not expect company sponsored team buildings at Investment Banking."
good,"Overall the company in itself is good. Upper management might be difficult to deal with. Very old school company with old school methods. A lot of them are staunch believers in working long hard hours to show real dedication, instead of just working smart. Plenty to learn though, and if you find a good mentor, they can really show you the way to success.

My manager is very understanding, and helps with goals that I have set for myself. The hardest part of my job would be dealing with rude customers here and there. I enjoy the people that I work with and assisting our clients the most. I've learned that it is easy to complain about things that you do not like within your job. It is a lot harder, yet rewarding, to find innovative ways to create a better work environment for all parties involved."

good,"A typical day at Chase was pretty easy going. Being in the mortgage field, you have your typical stresses. these were managed well at Chase. Our management structure was very adept at knowing it's people, and assisting us when needed. I spent two tours with Chase, in management and training; also as a processor. Chase went thru several cycles of mass layoffs. My number came up and that was that."
good,JPMorgan as the biggest bank in the world and a great company to work for. I find the work/life balance to be rather favorable compared to competitors.
good,"As with any large institution, management can be a mixed bag. Senior management can be very detached from the day to tday concerns of the average worker. However, the company does a very good job in allowing for a work life balance."
good,"Good company to start your career with.."

good,"I worked for chase for 5 yrs and enjoyed my time there. They have wonderful benefits, good employee perks, and friendly work env. Its a good start for entry level employees who want to enter the financial industry weather your in the call center or being a teller. Plenty of opportunities to grow and make a career out of Chase. There were a few cons to working here, the pay was not enough I started out at 12 and was only making close to 15 an hour after I left, the only time I made more than that was when I worked 3rd shift which is a 15% increase other than that I didn't make much. The pay raises are a joke, considering the other companies start you out at 14.50 min to 16 min. Chase was only offering me 12 start. Management comes and goes."
good,"JP Morgan has a very good working culture."
good,"Either you have a work schedule that works for you or you don't. The benefits(medical, dental, vision, medical reimbursement 401k/pension, sick/personal time,) offered especially the amount of vacation time is exceptional. Its easy to become burnt out from the job so its good to take advantage of projects and advancement opportunities. All of the managers  I have had are knowledgeable, down to earth and don't treat you as if they are just your manager somewhat as a colleague but they have your best interest in mind to develop your career."

good,"it is typical daily routine to check no of transactions in queue and monitoring all day long delivery of it."
good,"High pressure under production and quality"
good,"The company seems to be embracing the mobile future.  One aspect of the employee experience that could be improved upon is parking in downtown Wilmington.  New hires have to park in a lot almost a mile away from the office, and take a company provided shuttle to and from the office, whereas more tenured employees park in garages closer to the office.  They are trying to improve upon the situation though, as now you don't have to pay to park..  Employee perks are getting better, too.  Beer, appetizers, and live music were featured during the last employee function."
good,Great organization to work at. Has got a strong legacy backing of values and business principles. Has a strong and committed management. Is a large firm to absorb shocks

good,I really enjoyed working at chase because I felt that there were a variety of products that you could offer customers.  The hours could be long there and work/life balance was difficult to achieve.
good,I got the professional experience that I needed for the competitive job market.  The overall environment is very positive but you'll need to become friends with management if you want to advance your career.
good,"long late hours, the location I was in was robbed 3 times  while I was there. It didn't feel safe. I believe the branch I worked in closed because they were building new locations around town, however I am not sure about that. The main company wasn't willing to put in bullet proof glass around our stations to protect us tho. I will say I worked with wonderful people tho."
good,New to the company and I thoroughly enjoy my job.  Pay is competitive and sometimes higher than local markets.  Transition was easier than previous companies in respect to access and onboarding.
good,This is a good place to work for. The only thing that i am not too fond of is the constant change in management. They try and make the work environment fun when they can and show their employees appreciation at an annual event.

good,"Work closely with branch partners, always communicate with your branch partners - able to run reports for lead generation."

There is high-energy once the markets open and every day brings about new and unique challenges to help our clients.  Colleagues across the firm are great professionals with extensive educational and cultural backgrounds.
good,A typical day at work is being on the phone working at all times scheduled. I learned a lot of time management skills as well as self monitoring. The hardest part of the job is working with constantly changing guidelines and regulations. The most enjoyable part is the atmosphere. My co-workers are a joy to be around.
good,"A empresa carrega uma cultura americana em seu DNA, sendo assim, há muitos processos e de modo geral é uma empresa organizada. Por estar na indústria financeira, é agressiva em suas ações, mas está de acordo com os padrões do mercado. Oferece também uma oportunidade de intercâmbio entre divisões."
good,"Had the ability to work from home more often"
good,"A empresa oferece ótimas oportunidades para crescimento e aprendizado, sem mais comentários."
good,"With in the lending department we worked long hours in a professional and productive enviroment. Most team members, coaches and management team were there to help grow them selves while assisting others as needs arrissed. Even though this was a fast pace enviroment there was a flexibility with in hours, lunches and work place atmosphere. As long as our numbers were on top and worked our 40 hours we were able to arrange our own schedule as things changed in our lives."
good,"This review is for Delta Drive  Production site only"
good,"customer  interaction good"
good,This is a fast paced work environment with lots of learning opportunities. The ability to grow with this company is abundant as long as you progress. A typical day at work includes multi-tasking and attention to detail. You will need to work well with others in order to accomplish daily goals.
good,Good company to work with great benefits. The only improvement area is work life balance and appreciation which is missing.

good,working at a bank might sound hard or difficult (not to mention a very popular and high end bank) because you'd be dealing with money and of course money is one of the basic necessities people need in order to have comfortability in life but no work is easy and working in and with this very competitive and challenging company gives life a little more boost and time a little more worth .
good,A typical day at work was to review clients potential risks with the bank and make recommendation to continue banking with the client. Management was supported in decisions.
good,"I worked in different chase branches. The managers are the one who either suck the life out of you, or help you advance. I was lucky to have 2 great managers! Some busy locations can be stressful for tellers, but bankers can really profit from sales. Slower branches are better for tellers, and bad for bankers, due to sales."
good,"You can never have two similar days, each day comes with it's own challenges. Excellent place to work and learn, the senior officers are always ready to impact knowledge and very friendly too."
good,"As long as you provide the work product they need on a timely basis, their compensation is better than most.  They also have a progressive benefit package for corporate employees.  I was laid off, so I had to move on, but I would work for them if they asked me."
good,"JP Morgan Chase is an amazing company to be a part of. It provides necessary assistance when needed. It buildings strong long lasting teams. Positive, friendly environment. Successful careers, space to build."
good,Part time job while in college- Like that the bank is closed on holidays. Good management. Would recommend to a friend. Would like to work back-office rather than branch banking.
good,Banks are all pretty much the same.  I don't really have anything good or bad to say.  You are either interested in working at a bank or you are not.  You learn the rules of the game or you will lose. Politics are everywhere.  The difference with Chase is this - they get what they want and will pay you for it.  Don't be afraid to ask for an out of range salary.  You may be surprised depending on the line of business. Otherwise a bank is a bank is a bank.
good,"Worked with Customers to help them make deposits, withdrawals, payments, and general customer service. Was a busy place to work during the fall, winter and spring."
good,"Production environment without much creative, grabbing jobs from rack, working as quickly and error-free as possible. Made great friends."
good,"There are corporate politics and dirty favoritism from management.  A typical day consist of many calls stressful atmosphere lots of product information to learn.  The people are great everyone looks after the other beautiful team work and life long friendship.  I enjoyed working there and helping others but the distraction from lack of communication, stringent work standards and policy and poor management makes for a stressful job.  More is needed to show appreciation to their assets the frontline employees"
good,"Great company to work for. Excellent work and job culture. Benefits are GREAT, no other competitor can beat.I enjoy work life balance most."
good,"The company culture is just okay. It really depends on what team you are on that can really make a difference between liking JPM and your job."

good,this job was stressful. team leads were constantly over your shoulders making work uncomfortable. the benefits were nice.
good,"In a day, I supervised daily financial transactions, corrections, rejected items and audited daily track of changes in account; authenticated late and calibrated future returns, credit, debit adjustments; validated payments, returns, debits, credits, and reversals of transactions; and balanced monthly and custom calendar account statements accurately with zero error. I've learned to be a diverse or manifold type of employee and consorting buddy at the same time to my colleagues. The management was good in handling errors and unpredictable mistakes. I felt that I was really a member of a family to them from the start. The hardest part of the job is creating precise coversheet of clients reports because one mistake could make a bad impression or impact especially to the big clients. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fast meeting wherein all of us could share millions of ideas, opinions and suggestions regarding our job for function enhancement and progress."
good,"There are a great many things that banks do. Treasury Services is a very interesting aspect of banking, especially for businesses and corporations. Money has to be moved around the world, and reports have to be filed. JPMorgan made it easy."
good,"I loved working in JPMC. I have been in the company for about 4 years and I loved it. Good benefit and holiday and work environment."
good,"The culture is amazing with extremely talented people. Management Structure is little off as they follow twin city model, which becomes difficult to monitor and showcase your performance."
good,"Friendly environment "
good,"Great company to work for and great compensation but not a good place for growth. Company's vision changes frequentt and they are not upfront with where the company is going. It is very good in their products and services, however company management is poorly handled at times. Also not good on raises."
good,I really like in JP Morgan& chase and i work environment is excellent and also people used to help me a lot in the team and also we used to work together.
good,"Fast paced, time sensitive, team orientated workplace. Communication with live people as well as emails and phone calls. A happy enviroment"
good,"Day to day grinding in a large bank. Easy to get lost in the shuffle, have to network or will set to the side by management. Good work/life balance, however compensation is the lowest among the top tier banks."
good,"Good place to work, great benefits, bonus and pay. No room for advancement. Managers fair and helpful.I enjoyed working for Chase. I had no complaints. I just wish I was able to find a work from home option as was hard to transition back to work after my baby"

good,Very good place to work.Good brand name in the market. management is very professional and co-workers are also co-operative only the Extra working is the consent area.
good,I learned I am capable of so much from the opportunities I was given. I was given the chance to utilize many of my skills in every position and at the same time obtaining new skills and experiences from them.The toughest part was not having many options to continue to grow and expand within the company. New and advancing positions were either short lived or just not made available in WI.
good,"I write letters for JPMorgan clients with corporate actions, The understanding for different corporate tasks for researching. I learned a lot about corporate actions and the appropriate protocol. The Management were very flexible with daily work. The management trust you to complete task without looking over your shoulders. My team members were very insightful about their job and helpful also. The hardest part will be some miscommunications about certain tasks to be complete.I enjoy using some qualities from school in my job."
good,"Overall, it is a great place to work. One of the best training programs I have participated in when working for a company. They always make sure you have the tools and resources you needed. The only downfall is the procedural things can be very hard to understand and sometimes contradict themselves."
good,A nice place to work and build your career. Could give longer vacation to loyal employees who have been there more than 10 years.

good,"A typical day at work in JP Morgan includes extensive involvement BAU activities, presenting leadership decks for the CFO and meeting ad hoc requirements at the same time.

good,"In the first 3 months I learned numerous amount of skills for customer service. Their process of training is amazing. Now by the 4th month it was getting repetitive it just became mundane for me. Co-workers well we all have different schedules which was one of the awesome experience some working 5 days a week for 8, 4x10, and 3x12 with one day working 4 hours. Co-workers were really helpful most were positive. Hardest part of the job remembering to keep the tone upbeat light but also keeping the call efficient by the company standards. The most enjoyable part was the random event of thanking the employee by giving the employee some kinda snack, lunch( ordered pizza), or remembering to bring them something from where they went to vacation."

good,"While I worked there there the company had a good incentive for their bankers, sales and service associates, and tellers. There was room for advancement if you wanted to move into another selling position or even assistant management. You had to have a degree to do pretty much anything else.

good,"JP Morgan provided a lot of autonomy. Task are assigned and once it is completed correctly and on time you don't have too much pressure from management. The management team is extremely understanding that people have a life and that at times the too may cross. The downside is that there are times when the workload can become heavy, and you are still expected to complete task when assigned."
good,Learned a lot from that company.  First company where I learned to do trading tickets. As a team player I was glad for the opprotunity.
good,"Typical work week averaging between 45-50 hours w/ OT per week."
good,"JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A. has been a very balanced and often rewarding workplace. It is not without it's challenges mostly stemming from the size of the company itself and a certain level of separation between upper management and the mid to low level offices.  My experience with management and co-workers has been mixed however generally has been positive more often than negative.  Most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with my best colleagues and learning from them as well as teaching what I have learned to others.  The hardest part of the job at times is striking the right balance between helping the firm and helping the customer, usually its possible to do both but not always.  As a relationship banker with Chase and a member of the branch leadership team, I spend the average day interacting with customers and firm partners, helping them plan their finances and financial decisions while also being responsible at times for exceptions processing of transactions and management approvals in ad-hoc situations. There is not a day that goes by that I don't use my knowledge in banking regulations, compliance, controls, sales, marketing, economics while on the job."
good,To help customers with helping them save there homes and get Loans approved for new mortgages.  Enjoyed working with the customers and save there homes and keep there families in there homes.

good,"Established strong rapport with significant consumer and business clients to encourage long-term business. Starting new accounts, revenue generation, and the ability to deliver results."
good,"I worked for the company for almost 16 years in a branch setting.  It is perfect place if you like working with customers and you are career oriented.  I loved my job however there is a lot of changes in company structure and in next few months my position is eliminated.   In addition, the current manager is micromanaging and the atmosphere in branch had changed."
good,Overall a good place to work. Management is experienced and values employees as assets. Lots of opportunity to advance within the company.
good,"Being in Escalations was not an easy task. The calls we handled were escalated calls or supervisory calls. Sometimes, telephone bankers escalate calls to our department if they cannot find a resolution to their customers' issues. What we do in Escalations is process exceptions, submit a research or conduct the research ourselves and make a follow-up call to customers for the resolution"
good,"I worked at J.P. Morgan as a contractor."
good,This was a fast place environment and very productive. Management was good and helpful. Company likes to award top performers and promote within the company
good,Decent Pay. Reg bank hours. Friendly Staff. Great starting job for anyone looking for employment in the finance industries
good,"JP developed me from just a professional to an exceptional one.I owe a lot to this place. It was unlike any previous 'Call Centre' I had worked for. Integrity to the core and that's what I liked. As the saying goes, 'All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy', is the gist of how things went about there. The only drawback was the odd hours of work and therefore affecting work life balance in the bargain.It felt like working abroad while your yet in the same country, and I mean timing wise. Overall, It's a People's place to be in."
good,"Chase's retail banking endeavors to be the most well-oiled machine it can be while keeping customers happy.  This means managers have high expectations of employees and decent pressure is applied to keep compliance, efficiency, and customer growth and satisfaction sky-high.  Promotion from within happens, but can be difficult.  "
good,"Most of all, management will work with your school schedule. If there's a line of open communication in regards to scheduling flexibility/needs, they will work with you."
good,"The firm is a stable and settled organization but bureaucratic at the same time."
good,"Credit line review for extension of credit or denial do to credit, value, or income, research completed that put a stop line."
good,training? what training?  sink or swim.  will miss these wonderful people - fantastic opportunity to gain skills and experience
good,Helping customers. doing basic day to day tasks. One Manager is really not good under pressure. Great hours and really great people.
good,Work to deepen relationships with existing and new clients of affluent households.  Help clients achieve personal and financial goals through a variety of financial services and products.
good,it is a very productive fast pace office.  The work never stops and decisions must be made quick and decisively.  You must be able to answer all phone calls and process the medical daily.
good,"Offered awesome benefits and flexibility in schedules."
good,"Most days are rather busy interacting with clients and growing the business. Account management, customer satisfaction, deepening relationships, and developing my skills is what made me successful."
good,"Very good place to work, I had no issues with the company, it's manager or culture."
good,cookie cutter job culture. Limited growth. the average large company. out of touch with the core employees. top down rather than bottom up.
good,"Fast Paced, well structured work environment with knowledgable managers, and helpful team members. I enjoyed the Chase's attitude toward cross-training opportunities in various depts."
good,"Pretty good company to work for. There are sales goals but you are not scrutinized day in and day out. They expect you to work you best and that is what counts. Co-workers were great,management was nice, and overall a good job. Ultimately, the pay and the hours just was not enough for me to stay."
good,Very good company overall. Great management along the way. Very diverse group of people. A lot of experience can be gained due to variety of roles.
good,"Walk into great atmosphere at work. Everyone's is always in a cheerful mood ready to help. "
good,this company is amazing. The benefits are great and the people have a lot of compassion for others. Everyone is easily accessible for assistance and to help you build your career path. This journey has been very sweet but I require constant elevation.
good,"A typical day at work would always be busy and productive.  The day would always end knowing that I was productive.  Working with JPMorgan made me realized that I would need to do change my attitude towards my career and the rest will follow.  If there  is something that I want to change, I need to change first and be patient but don't stop instead keep moving forward and do what you can to help the customer.  The management may not always agree with me but they will listen and will try to compromise to make things work.  All employees are intelligent, hardworking and will do everything to succeed and reach the goal.  No one Is perfect but I see that my co-workers do their best and can proudly say that at the end of at the day they reached the goal. My co-workers makes the workplace fun. Hardest part would be when procedure changes not to make things easy and when people in control does not listen to employees who provides feedback about the process.  For me, the enjoyable part would be every time I completed all task on my plate and be able to meet my goal."
good,"Great company, awesome benefits, pay could be better. Overall great company. Not too bad to work here."
good,Fun work environment. amazing co workers. very easy to learn. NYC was the best part for training. Management could be better. Barley enough opportunity for advancement.
good,I enjoy working for JPMorgan but am looking for a career in Asset Management currently. I feel that my qualifications (especially regarding client relationships) will go a long way in this industry.
good,"Temp Job, little to no chance for advancement"
good,I've worked at Chase for about 6 years in default. Company has great benefits. Days are full and work is fairly complex for my area. Continued education is encouraged.
good,"A typical day at work is fun, innovative, laid back but productive work place, i have learnt  to always take to innitiative, look ahead, become more creative. there is minimal management supervision, my coworkers are fun to be with, very knowledgeable and engaging. The hardest part of the job is the take home pay. The most enjoyable part of the Job is the medical coverage"
good,"My typical day at Chase was to get my morning coffee, listen to voice messages from my customers, return calls, start pulling daily reports for my largest customer Carnival Cruise Lines. I would fax all reports, I would answer random calls from customers in between emailing customers."
good,"Great company that puts clients and customers first. Alot of outstanding people to work with and learn from. Promotes mobility actively and there are many opportunities to move around different departments, lines of businesses and even geographical locations"
good,"JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a great company to be part of. They value their employees so much, so much that everyone in the organization feels important. In JPMorgan, I learned the basics of work ethics, and how important one's values are in line with the companies values. I had a really great time working with JPMorgan because the management knows what they're knowing, they always have a plan for their people's career path. Also, my co-workers there are very intellectual people, and it always feel good to work with a smart group. The hardest part of the job is the pressure when certain deadlines are tight, the most enjoyable though is the fact that you do that very thing I like most - finance and accounting."
good,great place to work in! Management was great. my co-workers were fun to work with. I would handle all cash advances and cashier checks. Also the business customers.
good,A typical day at work would consist of assisting customers at the teller line and in the office. We worked side by side with management. I had a great relationship with my co workers. Hardest part of the job was working with customer's money. Best part was the great vacation and holiday time.
good,This job was far from typical. I learned to process the calls for JP Morgan and if needed to dispatch the police and or FBI for the hold ups at the different branches all over the United States. The workers were the best all worked as a team.
good,Mortgage call center providing assistance to borrowers having difficulty making their payments. Satisfying when able to provide solutions to prevent foreclosure and keep them in their home.
good,"It was a very good experience working for JP Morgan Chase. A typical day at work would be full of challenges, which would result in me learning new things and how to tackle a scenario. The management used to be kind enough to listen to your opinion. At JP Morgan Chase My fellow colleagues created a very work friendly environment. The hardest and most interesting and enjoyable part of the job would be when the team used to work on deadlines of HNW and UHNW clients, which would be nearly everyday and this would keep us alert."
good,"A person can advance into other fields and departments. The job can be challenging, however manageable. Managers can be straight forward and understanding. Work atmosphere is adaptable."
good,"The company has great benefits, but there is favoritism everywhere. Regardless of how hard you work, if management doesn't like you, you will not move up and they'll lie to you about it. I would go back, but it would have to be under different management and hopefully a new department."
good,I have held many different positions with Chase and was given so many great opportunities to grow in my career.  The managers are very knowledgable and care for their employees.
good,I loved when I worked at chase mortgage. The job was structured based. A nice environment to work in. A lot of opportunity to grow within the company. When the help was needed it was available especially when it comes to answering customers needs.
good,During my tenure with JP Morgan Chase I was giving the oppurtunity to work independently with an exciting group of co-workers. The knowledge that I was able to obtain was very helpful even in my everyday life. I had the ability to give critical feedback on new processes and also help out new associates. The management team was very professional in giving critical feedback as working with the OCC many changes were always happening. The hardest part of the job was determining whether or not a customer was conducting any type of fraudulent activity in their account. And that process was also the most enjoyable part of the job as we really were investigators.
good,Great place to learn and expand knowledge about the housing and finance industry. Ability to learn about different states and their foreclosure process. Plenty of guidance on how to accomplish tasks and the appropriate training to do so.
good,"I have learned a ton working for Chase in the year and half I've been there. I have had managers who really push me and if I can wait it out I know it has an amazing future for me. My main concern is how long it may take to get to that future. I feel I have learned an amazing amount about the financial industry, that with my customer experience and management skills make me a fit anywhere now, thanks to working for Chase."
good,"From the short time I was there, I had a blast. This is a great job for college students or people that need a little more money."
good,"The management I have worked with made my work environment very employee friendly and made us productive."
good,"Great place to work. Good people, Lots of room for advancement. Extremely focus on employee satisfaction and career development"
good,"Been in JPM India for more than 10 months now and as a fresher it was the best place to kick off my career with. Amazing co- workers, transparent management, open discussion to improvements, good amount of knowledge to and fro from people from all levels."
good,"There are many bright, talented people working at this winning company.  Employees are friendly and team well on projects.  Projects are loose and lack a common methodology.  Career mobility is self-directed meaning you have to scope out your next position on your own."
good,"I've spent a great deal of time with JP Morgan Chase, and I can say that it's a great company to work for.  As with any large firm, a change in leadership will at times impact job security, location strategy, and other factors which can cause a toxic work environment.  If you are willing to relocate and make sacrifices, the sky is the limit."
good,"A typical day is structured. You will easily learn what to expect in your duties. Responsibility, accountability, and integrity are the essence of this job.  "
good,This company has solid work life balance. I can work from home and that's beneficial for my family life and conducive to my kids school scheduling.
good,JP Morgan is a great place to work. They truly look out for the best interest of their employees and create a relaxing work environment.
good,"Worked in many areas over the years, but enjoyed the last position, people worked with and the hours."
good,I work for global Invesment Management product of Equity and GIM Solutions and Its a good learning experience and challenging environment
good,"The job wasn't bad and there was absolutely no recognition from anyone when you did a good job. the Underwriters were the gatekeepers basically. But when they decided to get rid of QA and turn everyone into a call center rep and change hours to night shift, I left instantly."
good,"verify client information, run deposits/withdrawals, transfer funds, run payment on client loans, and answered phones. worked 20 hours a week."
good,"Although JP Morgan is a large organizations where employees each have a lot of individual responsibility, the environment is easy going, fun and comfortable."
good,"There is a reason Chase is the company that it is. There is a reason it continues to profit and grow. It treats its customers and employees the right way, and in turn, that shows in the long run. Anyone interested in how to run a business should look at the Chase model."
good,"I don't like to speak badly about a company as I believe there are pros and cons to all companies and they are individually based.  That being said I will tell you what I know from my experience. Depending on your position you are either over compensated or under compensated.  There are no bonuses and usually no over time, so what you see is what you get.  The health benefits are affordable per pay period, however if you are someone with a chronic condition like asthma or diabetes that require regular check ups or medications it can get expensive.  There is little to no employee appreciation including little to know annual raises, not even cost of living increases.  Even as a permanent employee you can never be sure you have a job the next day because they are always realigning departments, changing business practices, and laying people off.  The company boast about 0 tolerance and codes of ethics but they are rarely followed by most of the management including but not limited to the HR department.  Happiness in this company will entirely depend on you as an individual, your direct manager, and your position.  In my experience the position was redundant, boring, and underpaid, but my hours, manager, and coworkers were great making the bordem and low pay acceptable.   If you take a position with the company it is best to keep to yourself, do your job, but keep your eyes and ears open."
good,"Upward mobility is luxury with such a large, stable company. Company culture can be fun and supportive. Customers are put first and work/life balance can be achieved."
good,"Great place to work, great work life balance.  The benefits are great, the available options for advancement are limited in Texas."
good,"This job was merely a stopgap due to my life situation at the moment, but it was a pleasant experience and I have cultivated relationships from my time there"
good,"Diverse Business Culture; "
good,"Flexible work schedules, more of a micro managed company, which trickles down to the employees..  The leading large bank in customer service.  Very diversified.  Many cultures and all are appreciated."
good,"All reports are completed. "
good,Process variable volumes of work with a 24 hour turnaround. face challenges of matching capacity to volume and meeting daily deadlines.
good,Chase is a great workplace.  I learned a lot of about myself and was able to develop and enhance my customer service skills thru trainings provided by Chase. Chase enforces Code of Conduct and Federal regulations within the workplace and any non-compliance is dealt with accordingly. This is how Chase protects their integrity as one of the most respected bank in the country.
good,"Typical day at work would be considered to be very repetitive, but the job basically entails trusting a well put system to guide you through running all transactions."
good,"1. Typical Work Day - life cycle of a trade post execution. Handle confirmation, trade discrepancies, settlement, dk's, corrections, etc..Trade Allocations for MBS products, send out EPN notifications and run daily end of day process for PNL."
good,"We are required to be at work at 7am everyday in order to kick off morning operations in a timely manner. The mornings are always a busy time for us as we try to finish up our morning responsibilities in a timely fashion, so as to give us more time to concentrate on afternoon reports and projects."
good,You can do what ever you want at JPMC if you apply yourself.  No shortage of opportunities with a globally diverse workforce and new technologies.

good,"Met with the IT team and interacted with Business Owners on a regular basis."
good,"Chase is a really good place to work, especially the younger you are when you start."
good,"Um dia  típico era faturamento de boletos e pagamentos de contas. Todo dia era uma correria e havia muitas funções novas ha serem desempenhadas e pude aprender muito com os erros e acertos, aprendi a ter disciplina, adminstrar o meu tempo, dar prioridade as funções que exigia um grau de importància maior."
good,"JP Morgan was a bit of a change from my other jobs, most of my colleagues were older, but they were all very helpful. The job was mostly computer/data entry work, so it could be tedious at times."

good,It's a great experience to view a large banking firm at it's best.
good,I worked on a few reports daily. My main report was the open items report. Fixing the issues on the report helped save the company money.
good,Its a company where you can explore new skills and new skilled peoples everyday. You can enhance your existing skills as well.
good,"I enjoyed the team spirit that Chase promoted.  Chase is a corporate bank, and it's a little more difficult to build relationships with the customers.  However, because of customer loyalty and my outgoing personality I was able to build solid relationships. Some managers made the job difficult at times because of their personal relationships ,and friendships with employees.  It made the work environment uncomfortable for some if they needed to file a complaint. I worked mostly in the Motorbank, and I enjoyed the fast pace that it offered.  It pushed me to really have to focus in order to excel in speed and accuracy."

good,A day at JP Morgan begun with the previous day's work review & to set a goal for the day. The management ensured to set achievable goals & at the same time maintaining the required business statistics. We had a good break out area where we could go to enjoy a cup of tea or coffee or a round of table tennis. Good transportation was available too.
good,Loved working at Chase in the Foreclosure Department.  Unfortunately with the decline in foreclosures layoffs occurred.

Most callers are quite problematic ,specially with their mortgage.As i have mentioned on the first description i made, ""Just a sets of Good peeps around you and a cool Team Leader...everything goes away"

good,it was a nice place to work my only issue was that people really didnt hangout with each other on lunch break or anything. It was simple work and then home.
good,"Working in the Executive Office for JP Morgan Chase usually consist of receiving calls from customers, via letter or phone and occationally  a Branch Manager looking for guidance to resolve a customer issue. Once we receive the complaint or inquiry it will be sent off for investigation using our LOB partners  whom will provide us with a update to provide to the customer. We are currently short staffed so breaks are limited and often it requires employees to work overtime to ensure work is completed. This job requires minimum supervision so I may only see my manage only twice a week. One difficult thing about the position is when I am advocating for someone whom I really feel mistreated or her case was not evaluated properly I have to deliver the resolution to them which is not in their favor. One thing that stands out to me about the job is I do really enjoy my team members as we all get along and make the job a fun environment."

good,"Productive, learned preciously about Mortgage Banking and Default system."
good,Fast paced environment.  Most important measured criteria is being at work all scheduled hours. Negative factor is that taking sick time or personal day off is counted against you in monthly statistics.  Vacation time is almost impossible to get unless applied for minimum of 3 months in advance.  Managers are positive and helpful.  Insurance is outstanding.
good,Chase is a awesome place to work if you're in school or don't want to work too much.  The pay for tellers isn't all that great though.  If this is your only job you will have a little struggle
good,"I had a couple of crazy managers, but overall, the benefits and pay at Chase are the best I have enjoyed in my professional life."
good,"Learned and acquired credit analyst skills to advance positions. Reviewed collateral, income, risks, and everything required to analyze mortgage applications for approvals or declinations.

good,"Some of your success is dependent upon at which branch you are located.  Financial demographics of the clients in the area as well as how strong of a team you have working with you in the bank can make or break your level of success.  There is a tremendous level of autonomy, unless you are not producing, and then you can expect a phone call from your manager. The compensation grid is among the lowest in the industry, starting at 22% and maxing out at 35% with $45,000 in revenue.  The company does provide you with some solid tools to help with acquiring clients, and there is an annual net new money bonus.  Overall a good company to work for."

good,"Work days aren't bad, very easy job! This job has a lot of upside, but the one downfall is the management staff.  They are in competition with each other and one is looking for a way to mess the other over, which in turn, rubs off to those of us on the floor and we become part of their issues!  Also, you will work holidays if you are scheduled to work unless you put your time in at the beginning of the year."

good,"In spite of being an extra large company, JPMorgan Chase truly cares what the employees think. They constantly send out surveys and ask employees and customers for feedback for how they do things.  (However, you have to be politically correct in what you say or else you could end up going to the chopping block as well).  They also invest in technology and strive to stay at the cutting edge.

The hardest part of my job was feeling like there was no advancement, unless you transferred into a completely different line of work. The most enjoyable part of my job was that I was not micro-managed, and I were able to work independently. I felt like management trusted my work ethic and my performance, so it made for more productivity. I was  always rewarded for exceptional work, and praised when the job was well done."

We take about 80-90 inbound calls a day from answering banker questions to resolving escalated customer issues. We have 2 team meetings a month to talk about performance and the up coming changes. I learned a lot about the banking industry, federal regulations, different customer personalities, how to think outside the box to solve complex problems and much more. Management was good but there were things that could have been done better. We didn't get much one on one time to talk to Team Managers, didn't show much recognition for top performers and hard to access when you have a customer that wants to speak with a Manager. Pluses for management when employees have concerns they listen and try to make changes, great with keeping team update with all banking and policies changes and great with making team competition keeping team moral up. I loved my co-workers b/c I loved my team. We were the top performing escalation team in the nation 10 out of 11 months. Very competitive, hard working team. Were there to give one another encouragement when having a bad day or bad performance. Most enjoyable part about the job at chase its real easy to make human connection with the customers.

good,On a daily basis I helped customers of the bank put their money in places that would be secure and also grow a little over time.  I also helped people learn how to get out of debt.  I was there to listen and help without judging in anyway.  People were losing their homes at this time and were very scared and I was there to help them think more creatively and offer other possible temporary solutions. We had a large team to work with and we were all very close and had the same values.  I was not ever going to offer a product to a customer if it would harm their finances or not make sense to them.  My part of this job was changing peoples lives for the better and giving them some hope.  I had customers come in every other day just to say hi and bring me coffee or have a coffee with me to discuss other financial options.  Very rewarding position.

Great overall company support with Loan officers, Financial Advisors, Commercial Banking, and Small Business partners to improve customer assistance in different facets.

good,The workplace is very fast paced and busy at alll times. I've learned how to prioritize better by handling the most important tasks first and working my way down to the least important tasks. The management staff is focused and very much driven on effective communictons and immediate resolves. The hardest part of the job is having enough time in a single day to complete all tasks.

good,I love my boss. He gave everyone opportunity to be very good at what we did
good,Given adequate work to fulfil a full 8 hour shift. Management can be a little bit of micro managing and co-works are all professionals that have required experience and education to fulfil the job performance.  The most enjoyable part of the job is that I am given direction and turnaround time required for my tasks and I am allowed to perform them on my own without interuptions from management.
good,"I value to experience I received at Chase from assisting homeowners avoid foreclosure to assisting with refinancing. I began my career at Chase with little knowledge of the banking world concerning foreclosure, modifications, refinance etc. but Chase provided the necessary training and guidance I needed to succeed. The management teams for the most part were accessible and provided valuable feedback. I made lots of friends that began as just co-workers who I keep in touch with to this day. The hardest part about the job was the ever changing truths about banking with regards to the economy which has a huge effect on the homeowners stability and delivering bad news to the homeowners we couldn't assist for one reason or another."

good,"I was employed by chase for 25 years. I did many jobs over those years. I was in management 20 of those years. I loved my job the people I worked with and my manager. My Manager left the bank because our District Manager was to say it nicely, quite a treat. She was not thought of very fondly by her whole entire district. After my manager left the bank I received an new manager who was 29 years old.  His age was not the problem, it was hos treatment of the entire staff. I was the assistant manager and felt I had to run interference between him and the entire staff. He bullied , talked down to, made fun of not only me in front of my staff, but he treated everyone that way. There was a 23 year old man that had gone through the 3 month assistant manager  training program and they had no place to put him. After he had been my manger for 6 weeks, between him and my district manager they rail roaded me out of a 25 year career with Chase. By doing this they found a position for 23 year old man an also helped their P&L , because his salary was quite a bit lower than mine. I would also like to point out that the young man who replaced me had been with the bank for about 2 years. I would like to conclude by saying that Chase was an awesome company to work for or I would not have worked for them for 25 years. It is just too bad that a couple of people could ruin my life by firing me for unjust reasons, when the company is so big and has many awesome people who work for them. I believe I was shoved out the door because of age discrimination and that is a very big shame. It is so sad that"

good,The culture and values of this company are what make it such a great place to work.

good,Worked with JP Morgan Chase on a migration project for 2 years.
good,a typical work day includes helping clients going through a mortgage modification daily team meeting to make sure we are keeping up with mortgage rules and regulations also making sure we're staying current with daily tasks. While working in my position I learned you can't always help everybody and the service that the client is requesting might not be the service for there situation. My co-workers and I had a very great working relationship if any one on the team needed help with anything we were willing to help. The hardest part of my job was that i wasn't able to offer assistant to all my clients being they wasn't eligible or just could provide all the correct info needed to be eligible for the program and the most enjoyable part of my job was when i help my client through the entire modification process and they were able to stay in their home.
good,"I manage a group of employees that track and resolve verbal complaints. I am also responsible for policy updates, new procedure implementation, training, and performance management. A typical day begins with checking ""the numbers"". I review the productivity, compliance, audit reports, and call quality reviews. Throughout the day, I serve as a mentor to my peer. I enjoy working with my coworkers. We have a dynamic relationship that has grown over a 12 year period. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to create anything from procedures to training tools. The hardest part is finding the balance between developing your employees and developing the department."
good,I was introduced to JP Morgan through a temp service called Manpower. A typical day at work included 8 hours plus of data entry and training. It was okay. The contract ended and it seemed as if Manpower just stopped helping me. I called every day but never got a call back.
good,Good place to work. Have learned a lot from my profile and products
good,Typical day at work meant dealing with customer account and service issues. You learn how to handle different customer related issues effectively and how to analyze each situation individually. Management varies but all the managers I have been under were always listening to the team for ways to improve. My co-workers were outstanding and made work not feel like work. The hardest part would be dealing with difficult customers and still being able to keep your cool while being insulted.
good,Good team work exposure and had a great team to work along.

good,J.P. Morgan Chase is a leading global financial services firm & leader in investment
good,"Great program really helped me launch my career. Program is big, so you really need to make and effort to stand out"
good,"My day was spent reviewing customer files that were headed for foreclosure and insuring that everything was in order, and that all attempts to offer assistance to the customer had been exhausted before allowing the file to move further. There wasn't much interaction with other employees (unless there was a question about an account) as the main focus of the company was to process as many loans as possible within the 8 hour work period. The hardest part about this job was the fact that there was not much room for advancement at the Florence site. Also, the department in which I worked was phased out and I was laid off. The most enjoyable part was the fact that the company allowed me the opportunity to continue my studies in Management Information Systems when no one else in this area would. I appreciate that very much."
good,It is a a good bank and there are opportunities for growth and professional development.
good,"JPMC is the prototypical Fortune 100 company. Strong work ethics are usually rewarded and there is ample opportunity to sustain a 10-, 20-, 30-year career building great breadth in skills. Lateral moves are common, but advancement through the organization is not. Leadership vacancies, more often than not, are used as opportunities to bring in fresh perspectives from outside the firm as opposed to promoting from within. Co-workers tend to range in capabilities from competent to excellent, and there is a Midwestern pleasantness that permeates the organization thanks to its retention of much of the old Bank One staff and offices."
good,Must be flexible. Work changes from day to day. There were very little opportunities for advancement due to the economy and the current mortgage situation.
good,great place to shine up your resume meet new people gain experience
good,"I learned much about the banking and mortgage industry, had great co-workers on my team. The hardest part was telling someone they didn't qualify for a modification. The most enjoyable part was the hearing the excitement from a customer I worked hard with, when I gave them the good news that they did qualify for a modification."
good,"JPMorgan Chase was a great learning experience for me. While the pay was not so hot, the experience was great!"
good,"A typical day at chase bank would be clock in, count cashbox, log in to system, set up, secure cash box with drawer key, keep drawer key with you at all times, process transactions, provide excellent customer service."
good,This was my first time Consulting. I experienced very nice people within the Consulting Firm and at the Client site. The co-workers are nice. I would go back to the client site and work permanently if given the opportunity. The hardest part of the job was trying to adjust to the way things are done work wise vs my own way of doing things and still get the job done. The most enjoyable part of the job was the flexibility within the team that I worked with at the client site.
good,Typical day included process oversight and management of up to 80 employees.
good,"I come in do my work. I love the fact that I'm not micro managed daily, it helps me to remain focused and I'm able to get a accomplised at my own pace. My co-workers are all pretty much great team players and we get alone well. The hardest part of my job is remaining focused after lunch because I'm sitting. The most enjoyable part of the job is my work."
good,"I worked in the fraud department as a CSR and I was nice and friendly. I was able to meet goals such as handle time or quality reviews. Chase is very much a numbers organization and I enjoyed my time there. I then was moved to the Collections department. The management was good, but could always use improvement. My co-workers in both departments were greaet. Always willing to help and encourage were the best parts of the day for me. The hardest part of the job was not being able to help those story just was heartbreaking, but not able to assist."
good,"I enjoy working at JPMorgan Chase & Co. My co-workers and managers are very nice people and are easy to get along with. The team is very focused on working together to build the branch and make work fun. The hardest part of my job is working through slower days when customer flow is down. The good days are Monday and Friday, there are always a lot of customers and other things to do and time goes by quickly."

good,I have learned to deal with cutomers over the phone and to escalate any problems if I am not able to solve them
good,"I've been with this company for 18yrs so I have seen a lot of changes. The banking industry is always evolving so you have to be flexible and be able to roll with the changes. I've learned to work with many managers and supervisors and to always expect the unexpected. I worked the last several years in the IT/QA Environment. I spent my days reviewing documentation for assigned projects. I then wrote test scripts and loaded them into the tracking module. I executed the testing when ready and reported any problems or issues I found. I was available for testing in the Production environment, which often occurred in the early hours of the morning or very late evenings. I learned the importance of being a valued team member where everyone pulls together for the common goal of successful data implementation. I had wonderful co-workers which makes our team very efficient. The hardest part of my job for me was working so much on the PC and not having much communication with other business partners and no customer contact. I really enjoyed the people I worked with on our team and the programmers and support staff we sometimes dealt with for resolving issues. I felt much satisfaction from doing a great job and knowing that no defects went to the production environment because of the testing I performed. I hope to secure an new position where I can interact with people as much as I utilize my computer experience."
good,I managed an email box for various client media requests. I would retrieve the media and email it to the client. I also managed a spreadsheet of basic client info.

good,Chase is a great company and was promoted many times throughout my time here. Downfall is not a lot of IT opportunities where I'd like to move to. They have always allowed me and encouraged learning new skills and have a positive work environment. Overall love working for Chase and wish they had more opportunity for what I'm now looking for.
good,Responsible for assisting the sales staff as needed. I enjoyed workingn with a variety of people.
good,I learned a lot from this experience and look forward in using these skills in my next career.
good,My typical work day is not very productive. I have learn a lot from this job as to how to underwrite mortgage loans and the Executive part of Mortgage Banking. I have a great manager and my co workers are team players.
good,i enjoy working at Chase because it did teach me alot about the financial environment....one of the problems that i had with chase was the pay but i guess they make up for it in benefits...overall its a great place to work
good,"Coworkers are fun, yet competitive. I love interacting with customers."
good,- Typically focused on sales and customer service while building lasting relationships with the clientele
good,"I worked for Chase while in college. It was a great job while in college, however, I don't think I would like to have a career with them. Corporate micromanages every aspect of daily branch operations. Even what the employees say to customers is scripted. The micromanagement takes away the enjoyment one should have at work. My managers were amazing and knowledgeable. I learned so much about customer service and professionalism from them."
good,"A typical day at work is getting there 10 minutes early, getting set up for customers, morning huddle, manager giving daily instructions, greeting customers, chatting with everyone about their day, and getting the job done. I have learned many things about the banking business. I enjoy the atmosphere and morale of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is it's only part time"
good,JPMorgan is a great place to work. Theres is a scope for constant learning and development. There are many training sessions that help to enhance knowledge on specific products and processes.
good,No work life Balance. They do have great benefits and room for advancement. I think Management needs to talk to employee in a better tone and they wil get more production from them.
good,The overall workflow is great. I work independently with my daily production along with assisting teammates with the completion of theirs.
good,"Good training, benefits, and people! It was a good place to have a long career."
good,JPMorgan Chase is a great employer to work for if you're looking for job security and higher than typical pay. The management style varies amongst department and there can be a lot of confusion and chaos between departments simply because everyone isn't on the same page at times.
good,A typical day at the workplace is to conduct multiple conference calls with various Lines of Business entities in which the most recent audit will affect. Constantly learining different processes within a department as we prepare them to speak on their process. Help find any self identified gaps not within compliance and remediate the situation.
good,Its a great place for anyone starting out. There are seminars and training programs. I started as a clerk and worked my way up to Vice President/Manager.
good,A typical day at work would be arriving on time with a smile ready to save homes.
good,"There are many talented people at Chase, and the corporate culture is very warm. There are great benefits provided by the company, 401k matches, and other incentives. Overall it is a great company to work for."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of a meeting with the previous shift to discuss the work being turned over, as well as any issues or concern. I would coordinate the daily workflow for up to 20 associates, prioritize the work according to deadlines. Respond to e mails and escalations from management and customer service. Have a five minute daily huddle to inform team of any changes, ways to improve productivity and quality. I quality checked the work to make sure it was processed correctly. I also monitored the system to ensure deadlines and SLA's ( service level agreement) are met. I enjoyed learning new accounts as well as training the associates so that we could be a more efficient team. I liked that I was able to help others and go home with a feeling of satisfaction. I however, disliked being bogged down with paperwork at times which kept me from doing what I do best, which is working with people. At the end of the shift, turnover numbers were reported during the shift transition."
good,great company full of advancement opportunities to seek and you will find!!
good,"overall Chase is a great company and there is a lot of room to move up, if you know the right people. without experience in the area you are applying for it is still very difficult to get into that area without a little help. they do have great benefits and the compensation is pretty good. i enjoy most of the people i work with."
good,"First full time position after 15 years as a consultant. When I started in 2000, this was my ideal company and planned to stay until retirement. The culture changed from an international top teir company that would had the clients first to a same size fits all with all IT job going off shore. Other major change was from company team culture that would do anything for the client to one using the Jack Walch model of back stabing, information hoarding, no pay increases except for brown nose 10%."
good,work day would vary from busy to slow
good,Its a very nice organization to be associated
good,Take inbound calls and more than often transfer the calls to other departments. Working for JPMorgan chase was a nice experience. They would order food for us all the time and I definitely miss that. My pay was great too.
good,"Hardest Part of the Job: Working with High Value clients and managing their relationships, growing balances and doing business lending."
good,contact client on past due mortgage and set up payment arrangments
good,It was my first time being in a retail atmosphere. It was fun dealing with the large amounts of money every day. It felt good to be number one in referrals to bankers almost every month. My customer service experience sky rocked in this job. I have carried on these skills to other jobs.
good,"Good opportunities for retail positions, not much room for advancement once you secure other positions within the organization."
good,great job to start of with when entering the banking world you get to meet new people everyday
good,I enjoyed my time at Chase (left to relocate to another state for family reasons) I worked within the mortgage department as a Team Manager. I had no issues with Chase other than they could use an updated system for processing their mortgage applications. Currently it is a very manual process.
good,Great place to work. Manangers are great sometimes the people that are higher up the chain of command forget the Chase values.
good,I enjoy working for Chase in there mortgage department. I have been able to learn a lot of mortgage any where from foreclosure to underwriting.
good,"A typical day at work for me included opening the branch on occasion, or coming in during the mid-shift. It was my job as a Personal Banker to assist customers (current and potential) with any questions, concerns, or transactions that they may have at that given time. In a span of about 45 minuets I could easily have set up a new checking account, filed fraud on a debit/credit card and processed a deposit for a customer as well. The environment was very fast paced seeing as how it was classified as an ""in-store"" So there was never a dull moment and being in that environment is definetley a good way to learn to mutlitask. I worked with about 3-4 other people on any given day and we were all required to work as a team and help others when neccessary. The hardest part of this job was at first learning and processing all of the new information that comes along with it. But I was properly trained and adjusted very well. Not only was I a teller at this Job, I was a personal banker as well as a manager in training."
good,"JPMorgan Chase & Co., went through some of it's most unsettling transitions during 2008-2009. This was a time where mortgage lenders came to public view of their inappropriate actions, the stock markets barely survived a severe crash, cut backs were in full progress for the company to survive."
good,"This was a very great job and I truly miss it! When I started, I was not a people person, but through this experience, I have had many opportunities to be a team player. Of which, I have embraced 100%. My only regret is that I did not take advantage of the opportunities to further my education through the company."
good,Fun cultured place to work.. work with dedication and capacity to take new roles and you will prosper
good,This employer changed my position and team several times during my employment without any choice on my part and the end result was that I was no longer reaching my goals.
good,"Good company, Good pay and benefits, fair upper management, good work environment"
good,J P Morgan Chase overall is a good company to work for. Their compensation and benefits are great. My only qualm with them is that you're required to be in a position for one year before you can apply for something else. I just don't feel that's fair.
good,"The eighteen years I sent there were sound, educational, stressful and challenging. I learned that all jobs and even careers can and will change,"
good,Its a Productive and challenging environment. You can sharpen your skills constantly. Good work culture. Team management is supportive. Collaboration of great minds together at one place.
good,"Intelligent Co-workers who add value into their function."
good,"Awesome 7 years there! Full autonomy to run my branch, hiring of personal bankers and teller staff. Ability to earn annual bonus based off of the branch's previous year P&L."
good,"During my tenure, I successfully transitioned through several roles with many opportunities for personal and professional growth.  I started as a temporary clerical staff member, and my last responsibility was Vice President / Business Project Manager."
good,"I find new managers inexperienced in dealing with a staff, expecting unreasonable actions and results. Not enough coaching only demands. New managers need to learn how to coach for results without constant oversight."
good,I have been at Chase for ten years. Overall it is a good company to work for and the life balance with the teams I have been on has been very good. Work is challenging at times but there is a good amount of structural red tape that needs to be dealt with.
good,"J.P. Morgan has been a fantastic place to work. I would recommend it to anyone, particularly graduates looking for a first role in the financial services industry."
good,Busy days on the phones taking calls but helping people get there problems solved. First call center job and ive have to say id recommend this job to anyone looking for a call center job.
good,Chase is going in the right direction with making sure employee's have something to do. I've been able to learn quickly in my roles but have done so by my own admission asking other knowledgeable colleagues as we are not given the training one requires but have managed to work my way up the rankings in my department. There has been a change as of lately with employees being appreciated. There's always going to be things at any job that may get hard at times but nothing I can't overcome. Overall it's a great place to work for but have decided to relocate.
good,"The management most supervisors operate with a clique mentality. Their favorites will always be recognized first and will get the benefit of the doubt on their perfor4mance rating. But the overall system seems fair and HR, fortunately, does have teeth."
good,"It was a pleasure and great experience working for the company, multi cultural, the management group was always there to assist you, the bonuses and commission was good, we had great diners once a year paid by the company, great team meetings and training sessions, one of the best companies "
good,"The Fraud Department at the Elgin Illinois Branch was fantastic when it came to the culture, coworkers, and managers. I really enjoyed going into work everyday just because of the people who were on my floor/team. The pay was not something I enjoyed, for the stress that came with the job. If you found someone who filed a false fraud claim you might spend over an hour talking to them till they understood their claim was false, and you could not end the call till they agreed, which is ridiculous. You are also recorded on every call, and they listen to them to ensure you didn't go off script. The benefits and PTO were decent though."
good,"JPMorgan is a great place to work and evolve professionally, lots of challenges, lots to learn. Many possibilities, awesome people, decent benefits too. Very proud to work there. However corporate heaviness can be a big burden, older employees being reluctant to change. It's too bad also that they've been massively laying off many positions (at least in the NYC office), this does induce uncertainty for employees, and that may not be the best message to convey at this time. Generally very happy with JPMorgan."
good,JP Morgan Chase is a industry leader in the banking world. As a Business Process Analyst your job is to help make an already great company better. The company is very supportive of your personal development goals and wants you to succeed. The overall work life balance is good and the working environment is good. Compensation even after benefits is a little under the industry average for each position.
good,"chase is a great place to work, there is a lot of responsibility demanded but it is worth it. Also chase offers great benefits and career opportunities."
good,Overall I enjoyed working for Chase. Good and bad managers but mostly good. I had 3 promotions while employed. Great benefits. The pay is a little less but the benefits that they pay for you on your behalf is amazing!
good,My days were filled with opportunities to constantly learn.   It is a very fast paced environment and so there is plenty of work to do and keep you busy depending upon the area you work in.   There are numerous opportunities to learn and advance your skills through online classes and getting involved with projects or some portion of a project.
good,"It's an extremely good company with regards to pay and leaves. The culture is very good . The management is indeed collaborative and helpful. JP beleives in doing the right thing  Just come to work for 9 hours, do the right thing while you  at work and otherwise and everything is sorted."
good,"This was a Temporary position.   While I found the job very enjoyable, I encountered a few employees in my department not very helpful to my questions."
good,"Its a good workplace with good work ethics. Open culture with access to all levels of management.A typical day at work is bit stressful but is timely."
good,It is nice place to work with plethora of Opportunities. I have learnt leadership skills in the organisation. The Management is very supportive. People on the floor are very friendly.
good,"Great place and company to work with."
good,"Flexibility with schedule to balance family and work life. On site cafeteria, wellness center with doctor, nurse, and counseling, quiet room and game room for employees to use on their breaks."
good,In my 8 plus years at Chase I found the overall environment and benefits highly desirable. I worked under consistently changing supervisors. I recommend employment there.
good,"Good place to work. "
good,Good place to work but under compensated and more responsibility compared to other banks. Longer hours and lower base salary compared to other firms. Culture is good.
good,"Good company with lot of benefits and work life balance."
good,"Positive work environment that is geared to self motivated employees. Do your job well and make yourself heard. Employee benefits are good, 401k and pension as well as Medical, Dental, Vision and Life Insurance"
good,"Good place to work with. Cool and calm environment. High level management has their specific goals."
good,"Very fast paced, high stress but manageable most of the time, the staff are excellent people always willing to help each other and grow, I was never refused by anyone there. Hardest part of the job is days after holidays when it's swamped and the supervisor decides to take an hour lunch in the middle of a 14 person line. The most enjoyable part was the culture, im still friends with my co workers at the branch to this day, very happy positive people."
good,JP morgan corporate and Investment banking profile is very demanding and also helps one to learn things on the job. It also helps one being responsible for the job we do.
good,Always was in fear of redundancies as it's an ever changing company. But was very rewarding and good bonuses. Contractors are treated very differently as expected but overall was happy at this job
good,"Great team, great management. Highly professional, motivated,  team players.  Good benefits, and work life balance. Compensation can be improved upon."
good,Great job for motivated people. Lots of room for advancement with a nice benefits package. Commission is great for those who like to sell. Can be very lucrative.
good,"An average day consists of consistent inbound calls, with a clear and vast database of process instructions. Supportive management that supports a culture of freedom to explore and resolve client issues."
good,"great company to work "
good,Work for yourself.  Little management involvement.  Flexible schedule.  Get paid for the effort you put into it.  Must be a team player.  Able to work with all areas of a branch.  Ability to advance to any other line of business.  Great place for someone new to the business or highly experienced.
good,"A very good firm to work with and the benefits to employees are wonderful."
good,Chase its a great place to work at. You can find opportunities of advancement. It offers Excellent benefits and it also helps you out with school. They offer tuition reimbursement for undergrad and grad school.
good,"I have enjoyed my time at JPMC and learned a lot. The firm is moving towards implementing frameworks that make developers plug and play for the stack of technologies they offer. Writing if/else statements all day can be mind numbing, and the ability to use a tool or latest version of an opensource library is limited. The work environment is comfortable and the work life balance is good most times."
good,when I was there it was a fun and family oriented company. I can't really say for now because I have been out of the work environment for three years.
good,"The people are good, they try hard to make it fun. The systems are very primitive and takes away from production. A good place overall. Some of the work practices are primitive but believe management listens and does the best they can"
good,"Working very closely with onsite and offshore resources, flexible hours and we focusing for MR release and  four major releases in the year, followed by learning process in regular intervals."
good,"I love JPMorgan Chase. After 11 years I have found that it is a company that rewards top performers, however you have to adapt to changes constantly. I embrace change, but it is difficult when they impact your earning potential. In management here staffing guidance, policy and product changes, and shifting priorities have to be juggled to be successful."
good,"it's good overall with a culture and working experience.  I like it so far about the company and the management team.  co-workers are good as well. overall, it's a good company to work for."
good,"Scheduled project meetings and prepared minutes."
good,The typical work of my previous company was back office  and fixed for graveyard or night shift schedule.The reason I left the company because  I'm looking for dayshift work. The company was no available for morni g shift schedue.
good,"Working here provided stability for me as a single parent by providing great benefits, back up child care center, and vacation.  Great training provided."
good,"Executive Director was replaced and the new director brought his team.  I ended up with a manager who knows nothing about managing, no annual reviews, no objectives and set the team and it's members to fail except for his friends."
good,Good Place to Work.  Good Culture but a terrible commute.  Relocation to Jersey was a huge mistake.  The effort to save money by taking tax breaks and relocating everyone took a huge toll on the work life balance of the employee who was moved to Jersey City.
good,It's a great place for work and learning new technologies. There are several divisions in the bank that need various technical services. We can move from one to the other divisions in 2 years.
good,"I take over 30 calls a day, problem-solving and analyzing redemption accounts to determine if customers will be able to redeem their cars. I stay busy but it is work with a purpose because you know you are making a difference in someone's life."
good,"Banking is going through a transition of automating a lot of positions. My role is safe for now, however in a few years who knows. The job is primarily retail hours working from 9-6 with very little flexibility. If you have a family it is very hard to make events. If you are a top producer you can make over 100k. As the branches transition to less staffing, you are now asked to wear different hats and it can impede with production. Benefits are great. Overall, good company, I am just looking for something with more flexibility."
good,Nice place to work. Good working hours usually somewhere between 7am-6:30pm. Usually the most busiest during the 1st of the month. Pretty slow though out the day until about 3pm then it gets moderately busy. You do repetitive work all day usually just cash withdrawals for people who don’t like using atms and also deposits for the local businesses. Good benefits great maternity leave benefits.
good,"JP Morgan is attempting to be a start up fails.  There is just too much inertia.  They are working hard to improve the processes, but everything takes a long time to get done and it can be extremely frustrating finding the right person to fix an issue."
good,"Many layers of management"
good,Great place to work.  I learned a lot. Very challenging but rewarding.  I recommend it. Excellent benefits and work environment.  That's all I have to say.
good,"Good opportunity & perks but compensation can be more competitive. Overall, a stable job at a stable and leading financial services company in the world"
good,"Relaxed management - at least in contrast to Citibank. As a investment adviser, I spent most of my time with customers, which I enjoy. Working in the private bank, I worked very wealth people who tended to be interesting and generous."
good,"No review at this time. I have nothing to notate at this time. When I am able, I will be more than willing to provide a full review of my days and life at CHASE."
good,"I really like the company culture, and feel JPMC is a great place to work.  Management needs to be better aligned and informed, but people are helpful, collaborative, and motivated."
good,"Small, casual department. It's also very new. Managers are very good and supportive. I must leave due to a spousal relocation in Chicago, IL and they were very understanding."
good,For such a large corporation they do recognize and appreciate their employees.  They are flexible and provide opportunities to grow and move with in the company.
good,"The days seemed short as there is constant multi-tasking and meetings to  attend. It was in best interest to excel in all tasks as the quality of work was tied to an annual performance review."
good,"Fast paced environment, typical day of work was between eight to ten hours. Attention to detail was imperative in order provide an excellent customer experience and minimize transaction errors."
good,"We at JPMC are a talented team of 15,000 individuals with unique backgrounds, perspectives and experiences. We're looking for the next generation of Techies - dreamers, disruptors, creatives and trailblazers - who are fascinated by new technology and want to be empowered to change the way business is done."
good,"Took about 100 calls a day,  Great benefits. vacation pay.  Management good.  casual dress."
good,"A typical day would be packed conference calls,  interaction with lines of business, complex and routine decision making, sometimes on the fly, review and approval of compliance documentation and/or issues as well as management of several concurrent review/audits in process.Management was supportive and available. The culture was relaxed yet fast paced which was quite enjoyable. The most difficult part of the job was the amount of work which was a great way to enhance prioritization skills.  While it sometimes seemed there was more to accomplish than time in the day, work life balance was always a big part of the culture, allowing for remote work and flexible scheduling. Management fostered a team oriented culture, allowing for the ability to build and maintain strong relationships with all areas worked with."
good,Management from superioirs could be better. But supervisor and team amazing. A day at work great we coe indiffernet times. Prodctive nice warm enviroment. Feels like home
good,"I started as a temp was hired after 6 months. Really relaxed place to work you just need to pay close attention to your work.  The pay as a temp was not good but once hired, the pay was above average"
good,"I worked here for over 19years in a number of capacities, i loved this place to work.  i only left due to job elimination, would've gladly stayed to retirement."
good,"Great place to learn."
good,"This job was a great place to work. Could be very stressful at times, but was very challenging. Learn a lot through the research department.  Had to stay focused."
good,"JP Morgan Chase can be a fun and productive environment. The work environment moves fast pace depending on Location of branch, management are hands-on and job Understanding is consistent on the floor"
good,"Overall and excellent experience. In my experience I was able to advance rapidly from one roll to the next. Unfortunately, my most current roll, along with others, was phased out and/or consolidated due to the housing market fallout."
good,"I loved the team and the work ethic, unfortunetly I had a lousy manager who wanted to micro manage everything but wanted non of the work and all of the credit."
good,"The typical day at work continuous outbound phone calls to customers and merchants. The amount of calls we are required to make is excessive, but making those phone calls does help pass the time. There are many different cultures within the firm, and I have built many new friendships with individuals by working here."
good,"Working for chase has great advancement as long as you apply yourself. They definitely pay attention to hard working employees. "
good,"Well run organization with a committment to excellence and driving efficiencies that help provide a great customer experience.  Employs discplined approach to meeting goals and objectives."
good,"Great company to work for in the mortgage industry. A lot of people beg to come back after leaving for ""greener grass."" It's strict and corporate, but the money is there more than any other bank."
good,pleasant work environment with a good worklife balance. learned a lot from my managers and they always encouraged me to push myself and fulfil my potential.
good,"During my 6-month stay with JPMorgan Chase, I have dealt with numerous clients, all with varying attitudes. During my stay here, I realized that even though clients may be tough on you, as long as you have good people and good management surrounding you, you're good to go."
good,It is fun when JPMC have the ideas of life work balance to the employees. Family day and movie day and summer outing is the best thing this company gave to their employees.
good,A lot of great opportunities within the company. Entry level positions are a great to learn about the basis of the business. The culture is great and invest a lot in the employees.
good,"A typical work day starts from 8 am -5 pm with flexibility to start earlier or latest 9 am. Learned financial analysis skills, enhanced accounting skills, enhanced excel and reporting skills. Fun environment to work in. Hardest part of the job is meeting certain deadlines."
good,"The people you work with ends up being like family. It is hard to move up in any position if you do not know the right managers. You can be stuck in a department if you do not know the right managers as well. "
good,"JPMorgan has great health and dental benefits and the work environment was competitive yet corroborative.  The downside is that there is little room for your personal touch and career development.  Little say and input on the larger picture decision making and really has a limited, specific job role and function."
good,"fairly fast paced, good opportunity for income. Schedules can move around a lot. Meetings take up important time. Too many changes in a short period of time."
good,"The salary and bonuses are quite exceptional as expected of the demand of the job. The environment is good as I have learned to be more competitive and enjoy life at the same time. Some down points are the following, the job is repetitive, the queue is terrible, prescheduled team meetings, which are considered a breather are canceled, the metric demands are quite frustrating. Still, I recommend JP Morgan as the best BPO experience I've ever had. We just have to learn to adapt to changes and business demands because as an employee, what more can we do."
good,"Everything at Chase was great. However, they do layoffs if your department isn't making money. Lost my job due to outsourcing. Month off for vacation. Starbucks and cafe on site, as well as day care on site too."
good,"Work pace is reasonable."
good,"All days are very similar, as job is repetitive. As long as one gets in a routine, and follows rules, job is not too complicated. Company is great, and always trying to find fun and interesting things to do. Overall, very good experience."
good,"JP Morgan has given me immense knowledge about investment banking. It has the most complex operations in India with middle office and back office located at various locations. "
good,For the years there I have met many people and obtain new knowledge. Management great to work with. There are many jobs to do and learn from the work.
good,Working at JP Morgan was exciting and very challenging. My coworkers really made the place a joy to work at. The management was great and they worked hard at improving the work environment.
good,"I just love this firm. People are so talented here, and so much to learn. Though work life balance is bad, its worth it as you never get bored at work. If you want to be a banker, no better place than this."
good,Enjoyed working with JP. Want to see more challenges in other areas of work and business. Exploring new challenges and opportunities is he best way to keep us moving in life.
good,"Its a great place to work at, it depends on your position. In my position I am able to customize my work schedule as long as I meet the deadlines and get the work done."
good,"Definitely a corporate environment driven by the senior management, although it did seem to attempt to listen to employee input.  Good benefits and compensation programs."
good,Chase stays up to date with the latest technology.   They spend a great deal of time training and preparing employees to be successful in their roles.
good,"Talent employees, good management. Great technology to support clients. Ground breaking products and willing to spend the money to support them. Very open environment where employees are asked to figure in decision making process."
good,"I enjoyed working for Chase for 10+ years. I saw a lot of people come and go. I saw a lot of people that went come back. Apparently, that is the game that is required, as they don't really reward their loyal tenured employees. Promotions from the company are often considered lateral moves. The constant reorganizations make it hard to keep consistent management. The promotions are political, complicated maneuvers that are burdened by red tape and aren't necessarily tied to the most deserving employees. If you go in with a good salary, then you are good for a few years.  The mediocre raises and bonuses will disappoint you, though.  I enjoyed their corporate culture and found them to be progressive and they did encourage independent thinking to some degree."
good,Great company for professional development and growth.  Excellent employee training programs.  Management team gives clear direction on deliverables and expectations.  Brand awareness is present in all communities. Past experience of multiple meetings/conference calls daily.
good,"The time I have spent at Chase have been challenging and fun.  The work is interesting and you will learn a lot.  However, they tend to try and shift jobs to places that they deem a better fit for their business and really cut good employees from places like Milwaukee"
good,JPMorgan Chase has a large presence in the Columbus market and has many opportunities for their employees.  Locations throughout the city accommodating most.
good,Workplace culture was great. Direct management really cared about their employees. I learned a lot about default and how it impacts a business. The best part about the job were the great people I worked with on a daily basis.
good,"Addressing client issues, focusing on improving client experience.  very fast paced environment, strong management support.  Most enjoyable and rewarding part of the job is getting things done and making a difference."
good,I enjoyed my time at Chase.  Lots of advancement opportunities if you are inclined to look and it was a challenging work environment.  I would recommend.
good,"Nice stable group in retail sales reporting.I did production support along with debugging, coding changes, and got reports out as needed. We did agile methodology."
good,"Very big and Global bank"
good,"Organization is solid and does a great job encouraging diversity, compensation is not competitive.  Internal promotion component could use some improvement."
good,"Overall the company is probably one of the best available if you consider their consistently strong business results.However not all the departments are the same, so you have to be lucky to be in the right team for you to develop and progress your career, otherwise it is easy to get stuck."
good,The work environment is collaborative and fast paced. The organization is a firm believer in  retaining top talent due to which internal mobility os encouraged.
good,Chase is a great place for a long career.  There are multiple lines of business and disciplines to explore and career mobility is always encouraged.  I recommend finding a mentor outside of your primary discipline.  The firm is massive.  Driving solid business results and building and maintaining strong relationships at all levels are the keys to a long career at Chase.
good,"Worked here for 2 years and enjoyed. Everyone is approachable and you will get to make a lot of friends. "
good,"hard time was keeping up with handle time"
good,"J.P. Morgan Chase provides a diverse culture and provides great vacation, time away and retirement compensation. I would recommend chase as an entry level company to work after finishing school and when just getting your feet wet."
good,Could be better. Stressful at times. Good entry level job but hard to move up. A lot of office politics but things get better as you go along. Everybody is friendly.
good,"I liked JP Morgan Chase.  But i do not see advancement in growth."
good,"I have been working at JPMorgan for the past 2 years."
good,"good place to work, great work culture. Management needs to improve. Overall a good wok environment and I have gained a lot of knowledge and learnt a lot of skills in my 10 years with Chase."
good,Good place to learn. Managers were demanding but fair. Extensive overtime were sometimes required as need arose. Friendly coworkers who were always ready to help each other.
good,Though the call volume is high you are trained very well with how to handle the wide variety of calls received. Management is somewhat of a hit or miss when it comes to critiquing your areas of needed improvement.
good,Fast paced environment  with a diverse culture the hardest part of the job is the schedule changes (inconvenience) but the enjoyable part is you’re able to sit at your desk listen to headphones The environment with your coworkers supervisor and management was somewhat on a friendly family level!
good,This was many years ago. The workplace was a little different from now but still was a good place to work. Had a great managment. Still friends with my coworkers.
good,Great management company close down doing the depression but I would work to them again in the warehouse customer service just a great place management very well put together
good,The company was organized with appropriate checks and balances in place. Upper management was knowledgeable and training for each position was outstanding. Mentor ship and support r to succeed was in place.
good,"Company needs to update its pay standards for contractors."
good,"I worked their 20 years and would still work their if restructures were not a constant event every 3-4 years."
good,Underpaid but enjoyed my co workers and management team. Unfortunately tons of layoffs  but that is to be expected in the current climate of the mortgage businessl.l
good,"Greet and assist customer with their banking needs. Process deposite, account transfer, withdrawels.The most enjoyable part of the job are the coworker whom are great people."
good,"Working at JP Morgan Chase as a Customer Service specialist was a good experience. This job was a good experience overall but extremely stressful since 90% of customers call just to complain and you just have to sit and listen all day nonstop, call after call."
good,Chase is a fast pace working environment that challenges job roles and employees to work to advance in current and prospective roles with the company.
good,"Every job has its challenges but the one thing I have here is that I don't feel like I am coming to work everyday. I feel like I am coming to hang out with friends. The culture is one of growth and learning and as long as you apply yourself, the opportunities are there. Some of my only complaints are that all paid time off is earned after 5 years and nothing else is earned after that. Additionally, some of the end to end processes for Change Management are quite lengthy but the changes are always positive."
good,"It sets your mind and helps you discover field wise where you would like to go, with the interacting with so many new people daily. The balance of work and life are possible"
good,"I used to work in JPMC for last 6 months and found a good friendly environment as well as a balanced workload on every individual."
good,"Extremely busy engaging and/or soliciting existing and prospective clients in-person, over phone calls and emails. I learned professionalism and poise at the highest level. Management drove the culture and were supportive to my career development. The hardest part of the job was being able to overcome rejection from prospective clients. The most enjoyable part of the job was the opportunity given to me in meeting a number of senior bankers from competitive institutions and how they often shared their insight of the financial market."
good,I was able to easily move up within the company and my efforts were noticed by my management. I received the recognition that i deserved. It's the upper management that has a hard time maintaining order and transparency. As long as you're on a great time and under a great direct manager the company will be pleasing to you. Great benefits and friendly team members.
good,"I like the job because it allow me to understand other cultures."
good,I learned a lot of extremely valuable skills but was not able to move up from Lead Teller into other job positions even though I have experience within Chase. Management wasent held accountable for their actions even when reported on.
good,i love working for chase. Chase in an awesome company to work for. Since I've started my banking career I've built collaborative relationships with customers as well as my colleagues. I appreciate what I've learned so far.
good,"A good company to work for, very good benefits, very great incentives and a good hourly to work for. Gives an allowance for apparel for men and women."
good,Constant change occurring at a fast pace. Need to be flexible. Reorganizations occur resulting in frequent management changes that you need to adapt to.
good,i am still friends with many of the coworkers i met there even 10+ yrs later. I will always remember my time there as influential and inspiring. I usually enjoyed going to work.
good,Chase Bank is a great company to work for.  I started out as a banker and was quickly moved into a management position.  It gave me a chance to run a team and work closely with our members.
good,"I worked for several different groups within Central Technology. Each group had its own set of priorities and methods for managing and delivering projects. I found my groups consistently focused on teamwork and building good relationships with the clients. The company as a whole has a strong focus on hiring and providing lateral and vertical opportunities for its employees.  It provides many internal networking options and is a very diverse company."
good,Chase is a very big company. It handles all kinds of banking from Diret Deposit to Loans. The company is really nice but keeping up with metric can somehow be a pressure.
good,"The hardest part of the job was maintaining your metrics to goals, because there is no way you can really control each calls, you can only go as fast as the caller, especially if the caller does not understand the term you are explaining to him. The management was really biased and it was not neutral everything was based on favoritism, some of the employees were treated differently than others."
good,"JP Morgan Chase is a great company to work for. "
good,"Depending on your immediate manager, there is a lot available to each employee but you have to take it upon yourself to go out and get it. Chase has great benefits and overall as a company they do care about doing things for the employees."
good,This is a work holistic company where there is no time limit of finishing work. However management culture is very good in terms of approaching any senior management is very easy
good,"Working there was good. I learned a lot and they provided training but sometimes you have to learn it by yourself with their written procedures."
good,"Like I said already, great place to Work, just not enough hours. Can't wait for them to call me back in to work there...that way I don't have go through this,again."
good,"Nothing negative, even when the site was shutting it was handled very professionally with 60+ days notice, severance, and support team to help with the transition."
good,Good place to work. Very diverse group of people who are friendly and respectful of other cultures. Management was fare and understanding of work life balance.
good,"JP Morgan Chase was a great place to work. In Management you will wear many hats. The environment is ever changing. The pay, at least for ne, was above par. No complaints there at all. You can grow as much as your performance allows you to at Chase."
good,"JPMorgan Chase & Co. overall is an amazing company who continues to innovate and has the management to position them for success in the future. Management is exceptional and know what needs to get done and how, but bureaucracy due to the size of the firm needs to be firgured out."
good,The only reason I left was because I relocated. I enjoyed the challenges and how how we resolved them as a team.  Chase cares about work life balance and family.
good,"Fast-paced, sink or swim work environment. If you have what it take you can make a name for yourself at this company. Great culture, everyone was more than willing to network with you."
good,"I worked for 4 different branches during my tenure at Chase. Always great/team friendly environments. Great position training and advancement opportunity. Base pay is decent, but commission is the best if you're pretty good. Company is working toward pushing low income clients out/toward technology/ Branch atmosphere is being conditioned to only reach out/acquire well off customers. Great company overall."
good,"chase eliminated assistant manager positions, put in place Lead vault teller.  Good work life balance but the salary was not advancing at all. I would work at Chase again if there more of them in the area."
good,For the most part I enjoyed working at chase. The only thing was they would change management like changing underwear. I couldn't keep up. It felt like I have a new supervisor or manager every other week. My co-workers were amazing to work with. Everyone would help each other when ever anyone needed it. The job was stressful but what customer service job isn't? I would still recommend working for chase because they offer great benefits. I would return in the future giving the opportunity again.
good,The people that trained me at JPM helped mold me into a hard working individual in the financial services industry.  I enjoyed working directly with the corporate banker while managing the mortgage/insurance portfolio.  This middle office role also provided communication with our loan administration team.  The level of visibility was great here.

good,"The areas/depts that I worked in at this company no longer exist in my state. I felt it was a great place to work, but the coworkers were very clique oriented. If you stayed to yourself and did your job you were good to go."
good,"Over the Virginia staff of processors, closers, shippers . Respond to QC audits. Hardest part of the job answering to sales team inquiries or locating sales managers for various offices. Responding to underwriters request . Most enjoyable was the my staff. A wonderful group of professionals."
good,Its a place that promotes inclusiveness in all aspects of the job.They have recently adopted a dress down business casual attire in non client facing roles to based on employee feedback. The company listens to employee concerns.
good,Ensure you are landing in the right role and constantly think about how you can be a better professional . You will have enormous opportunity to grow as professional.
good,I would still be at Jpmorgan had it not been for the LOB company layoff. I learned a lot and met great people with whom I still keep in contact with. I've  considered going back but I trying right now to learn more of the healthcare industry.
good,"wonderful place to work   "
good,stressful yet rewarding and enjoyable. variety of projects. excellent co-workers. Good management - always very supportive. excellent benefits and 4 weeks vacation.
good,"I only worked in one  branch the full 7 years i was there, over the years our employee hours were cut back, which left us with not enough help alot of the times"
good,Every day you are able to utilize any line of business that you need to assist clients in their simple or complex needs. No client is too big or too small for this bank. You can assist clients with a simple credit card or finance a private jet.
good,Chase is very well managed at the top and provides decent job security.  The culture is very customer focused and provides for a good work/life balance.  Very little investment in employee development.  Very structured employee performance review process.
good,"Medical and Dental Benefits, Paid Personal and Vacation Days, Challenging work environment but fun.  Lots of people to meet and work with on a professional level"
good,"I have the best manager here and I've been fortunate to have great managers in the time that I've been here. The only problem that I have with the job is there don't seem to be a fair process of advancement in the company. It's not based on your performance, it's based on who you know."
good,JP Morgan Chase is a world class organization that provides top notch service to customers around the world.  While at the same time provides a great place for employees to learn and grow.
good,Customers can be rude most of the times. They work with your schedule. It works great if you are attending school or have another job. They do offer job advancement.
good,I only worked there a short time. People were friendly and courteous. They were also very helpful.  I like helping customers and meeting new people. It was a decent company.
good,"A typical day is taking calls at a cubicle....most co-workers stick to themselves, unless they need help. The environment was not very team oriented, the management was approachable and there was room for advancement. The hours were not as conducive for schedule changes; Saturdays were mandatory."
good,"Chase is a good place to work.  It offers many benefits and Chase is good to there employees and gives there employees the opportunity to succeed.  Every company has it down side, but I think Chase has more up side than down."
good,I enjoyed working at JP Morgan because I had the opportunity to work with a great group of professionals while learning from them.  I also enjoyed the incredible benefits offered.
good,"I've worked in several areas of the bank: good people and good management. I'm hoping to land a full-time position there, but they are not always forthcoming."
good,Discovering needs and tailoring solutions to help customers reach their long short medium and long term financial goals. Provide help to customers with product knowledge.
good,Consultant work was very interactive.  I learned a great deal. I worked on various projects in various departments.  Everyone I interacted with was an expert in their field and most professional.
good,"This is a great place to work.  The culture is professional and management is easy to work with.  However, we are currently very understaffed and the hiring process is extremely long."
good,"- Health plan options are expensive and lacks sufficient coverage"
good,"- Commercial Teller"
good,Challenging environment.  Livek many big organizations it w internally in something of a mess and my team's job was to sort that out at least for the UJ datacentres
good,"I am a consultant not an employee.  FTC's are treated different than FTE's.  Not necessarily bad bud different.  Also, Firm has a policy which prevents them to recognize ftc's publicly.  Overall a good company but could improve work, life balance"
good,"Great opportunities for career advancement. Chase is a highly diverse company that takes care of it's employees. Fast paced work environment, that urges collaboration and teamwork."
good,"Great company to work for! Lots of resources and opportunities to learn, if you're motivated to look for those opportunities--managers won't do all the work for you to advance your career and build strengths, but they will support and advocate for individuals who seek out those things themselves. If there had been a larger JPMC presence locally, with a wider variety of advancement opportunities available without the need to relocate to another state, I would have stayed with the company."
good,"The company gives lots of opportunity to work on the Projects like-wise to mitigate the risk, to save from error, to give best Clientele Experience."
good,"I leaned alot from this company. Most of my growth in the customer service industry was cultivated with Chase. It had so many opportunities that help advance my career with them and with other companies afterwards. Management could have shown more appreciation for what our teams did each day but overall I was one of the lucky ones because I was awarded one of the best practice leaders in 2007 and was honored in Tampa Bay, Florida where they flew us out to. It was a great experience that I would never forget. We also had a great team. Towards the end of my time there, the management team had changed instead of them trying to get to know each member on the team and judging them according to their stats, or fairly, I just became another result of high turnover. However, still a great company to work for."
good,"Financial Adviser for Credit Card Deals with end to end Solution for US customer on their Credit, i would personally deal with customer interaction on Calls, emails and Correspondence to resolve their queries also create reports and submit feedback to improve policy, procedure and product. got Opportunity to learn different Business Analytical Tools such as ALM, MS Access, Advance MS Excel, SQL, cognos, QlickView etc.;"
good,I actually very much enjoyed this job. The benefits were great and the pay was more than fair. The manager was always on top of things and that place was run as smooth as can be.
good,"Great place to start your career. You work with very bright and hardworking individuals. Also, like most big companies, it really depends on which group you work with. I would encourage anyone there to move around and try different roles to really see what you become passionate about."
good,"It was ok.  Some managers had no experience, therefore had no idea what they were talking about.  Other than that, it’s a pretty good company to work for."
good,"Great atmosphere, sometimes stressful, pretty consistent, clear cut rules and regulations. Not much chance for advancement though. Has become less personal which I think is a downfall"
good,"JP Morgan is a wonderful place to work, especially if you have a family, are in need of relocating often, or if you want to find a company to stay with throughout your career. They offer great PTO, 401k & benefits, and discounts through retailers and other promotional partners."
good,"Management is stressful at times, it was a fulfilling and rewarding career. Customer experience was the most valuable experience along with developing the employees. Throughout my tenure there were many rewarding experiences, and many unpleasant experiences. My last district manager was dishonest and non-supportive. A huge disappointment with me. In that time of my life I decided to retire. I was fortunate enough over the last 15 years in my career not needing an income . Staying that additional time, fulfilling a passionate need to help customers, and to assist in the development of my employees, providing a career path as I enjoyed ,and being successful doing so."
good,"I love Chase. Great benefits, great pay, great culture. The only thing negative I can say is just like other large companies, they often have layoff's"
good,Generated a lot of cash for the parent company. Treated as red-headed step children if you weren't in the NY office.  Suspect all in NY wondered if we even wore shoes to work.
good,This was a good job to start out in. There is room to grow and advance and or transfer. You have opportunities to work relocate to other states with good job choices.
good,"Full Hours, Good Benefits."
good,"Great experience, I learned so much about mortgages. My manager was very supportive, we remain friends until today. Most enjoyable part of the job was to work with such wonderful team."
good,I worked for JP Morgan Chase for several years in the Cleveland office. The only reason I left was because that particular office had little career advancement opportunity. They genuinely try hard to make their employees feel valued. I would go back for the right job.
good,good place to work with a good team always willing to help out. very professional so stressful at times but relaxed on the down time hours. good experience
good,"Only negativ thing I can say about my time with Chase was the low pay."
good,"The work place was fast paste and very busy at the location i work. "
good,Send out documents to customers and quality check for accuracy. Create checks for current lender of customer's auto loan. Audit colleagues checks for accuracy.
good,"They have great resources for you to exchange knowledge-- discussion forum, internal websites technology  -- so much for you to learn, participate, share, help others to grow or to enrich yourself."
good,"Typical day as a Financial Analyst involves supporting LOBs with management reporting, metrics analysis, forecasting, and several 'drop of the hat' requests with quick turn times.  Great for those of us who love getting deep in the data."
good,"from personal experience and speaking with other departments, JP Morgan departmental teams have always had a good sense of work culture and sense of family. People stay because of the people they work with. No matter what, people work together and help each other out. Nowadays this can be a rare find."
good,"Performed detailed analyses of transactions within retirement accounts to detect and correct errors in compliance with JP Morgan Chase and Securities Exchange Commission guidelines. Collaborated with compliance department to ensure accuracy of findings and notified clients and the Internal Revenue Service of discrepancies; and utilized Client Access System (CA), SAP (General Ledger), UNIX, SBS (Strategic Banking System), CAMS (Document Management Supporting System), RRS (Chase Reporting System) RPAM (Chase Automatic Distribution Payment Center), and Tax-Port Programs to research transactions."
good,"Work place culture is great.  You will learn a lot about how the bank functions from front end to bank end.  Investments, Retirement, Asset management, and Retail"
good,"A nice place to work. Company offers opportunity for advancement. Company offers perks such as day care, work from home, discount at various local businesses."
good,I've worked with JP MOrgan chase on a variety of occasion and was always welcomed with opened arms.  There are always new projects to assist with in the company and managers are always on the lookout for qualified candidates to joint their teams.
good,"Fun place to work, good compensation. Sometimes expected to work on weekends and late evenings after work hours on short notice if there are deadlines."
good,I enjoyed working at JPMorgan chase. They have the best benefits. My job title being a Data Specialist was very laid back and interesting role. I learned many things from working there.
good,"The company provides great benefits, which I feel are necessary since the job is very stressful. It is not a career for everyone and it is difficult to get off the phones unless you are close to someone who is involved in hiring for that position"
good,The culture is changing from how it used to be. The company seems to be transitioning branches to create an environment as an advisory branch rather than transactional.
good,The overall work is satisfying and the people you work with are among the best in the industry.  Will definitely develop legal skills and knowledge during your time with this company.
good,Good place to work. One down side was that they were not always willing to train employees for a new job within the company. There were other positions within the bank that I could have taken on if they had been willing to take the time to train me. Instead they would always take some one that could hit the ground running. They always told the employees that they wanted to promo within but would take outsiders first if they had the skills.
good,The Sales force worked well with processing and underwriting to get loans closed. The co-workers were friendly and fun to work with.  The work was consistent
good,The work is good and management does a good job of help balancing work and life when there is not pressure caused by understaffing.  The retirement of the boomer is really starting to weigh heavily on the existing staff.
good,A good company to work for. Chase takes care of the employees and I have enjoyed working there. Good work structure and good management. Easy systems to work with.
good,"Not competitive pay, but the value of benefits were great. The work culture was appropriate and no one was ever combative. Yearly raises are set on production."
good,"JP Morgan is a strong company with lots opportunities for advancement. It's a very diversified culture that includes collections, fraud, fraud recovery. customer service and disputes."
good,"Consumer retail back offices with JP Morgan Chase is an excellent work place.  The building is clean, facilities and amenities for employees are comfortable.  There is a big cafeteria with reasonable prices, also a fun / relax lounge with massage chairs, tv, ping pong table and puzzles."
good,Execellent place to work with lots of growth opportunities. Enjoyed cultivating relationships with my co-workers and clients. Proud to work for a large global organization.
good,This is an excellent company but the people working here are back stabbers. There are process that are very old and no communications. Each department is given different directions and cannot work together.
good,Working for Chase was my first career job.  Worked for 13 years in operations environment.  Started with entry level position and was promoted 5 times within 13 years.
good,"I enjoyed working at J.P. Morgan and partner with my team."
good,JPM is a great organization. It affords a great deal of challenge. More energy and resources should go into training and professional development of diverse employees.
good,"During my tenure at JPMorgan, I enjoyed the work, environment and the people.  I recommend JPMorgan to all individuals.  A company that care for their employees."
good,"Working face to face with clients. Handling money. Working as a team is a big part of the teller position. Workplace moral is always high, a lot of smiles. Positive energy."
good,The company has a good benefits package.  The culture is focused on the customer and celebrating successes.  Many technology changes present new learning opportunities and challenges.  Management encourages new idea generation.
good,"Chase is an awesome place to work,  the benefits are GREAT, the people are so nice and helpful. You gain many friendship and there are many ways you can move up within the company."
good,"JPMC is a great employer with an established history, opportunity and great benefits, but depending on location, advancement may be limited. If you are geographically mobile then there are many opportunities."
good,"well my typical day at work is to check my email for any new information needed to aid my work ."
good,It is a fun place to work and it was a hard job to learn for the pay involved.  The good part is that everyone chips in and works as a team to make sure the job gets done.
good,"Overall great company to work , provides great opportunity to learn business closely.i would strongly recoomend for any budding analyst to work here in jpmc"
good,"Managers vary, and things always change. They promote diversity and inclusion. The provide great benefits and you get them the first day you start work."
good,You are tied to a phone for your shift if you like that then go for it ! Its not a bad job you just have to meet all the requirement for you month. You don't get enough hours to take off like for vacations and ect. They do value customers experiences so even if you are right and they listen to calls and you followed the policy you still will be at fault. and it drops your call ratings for the month because customers leave surveys ALL THE TIME! sometime the customers may accidentally give you a bad survey but it will still count against you! and they have great overtime hour pay !!
good,both Full Time and Part Time employees get full coverage benefits plus retirement and investment options. Career advancement is pretty competitive depending on which job role you are looking to get into.
good,"Good place to work.  There are a lot of opportunities, but the rating system can be highly dependent on your manager.  Overall there are seemingly quite a few mobility options internally."
good,"Mt tenure originated with Washington Mutual, which was later purchased by JP Morgan Chase. Both companies were leaders in different roles. Washington Mutual was an excellent company for underwriting FHA home loans as well as servicing all loan. JP Morgan Chase is a leader in providing great rates on conventional loans. Both companies worked in the mortgage industry nationwide.  Management and continuous employee training was a great asset to employees. Much mortgage related education was provided by these employers to provide to ensure excellent customer service."
good,"Has great opportunities for advancement and great with letting you transfer to different departments. Management is great, they watch you and make sure you are meeting your goals and find ways to help you reach your goals. Schedules vary and are given based on lottery. so there is a possibility you get a schedule you don't like but they do have the option to trade shifts and schedules permanently with other employees."
good,The work culture and benefits are spectacular at Chase. However the Expectations can be a little harsh and can be difficult to live up to. Not a job for everyone but certainly worth it if given full attention and effort.
good,I worked for this company for tax season 2 years it was a lot of work ! and it gets super busy the dress code very enforced! the company is great.....
good,I worked for a company called Paymentech which was bought out by JP Morgan Chase. I was responsible for credit card collections and enjoyed my coworkers.
good,"I worked in operations, such as data entry and doc prep, mailroom, etc.. In Binghamton NY. was a great place to work. It was stressful at times due to deadlines. I liked my immediate supervisors, I was promoted to Team Lead within a year after I went full time. They made it a great place to work and took the work seriously. We did have fun times as well, pizza parties, birthday celebrations, many short breaks throughout the day/night.  Overall, I had a good experience"
good,Very nice team members. Great benefits for those working full time. Relaxed environment. No rush and craziness. Team and staff management is well balanced but low salary.
good,Overall it’s a great place to work at good people always willing to help. Benefits are good not expensive at all when you do the wellness program. If you do your job right you will get far with the company.
good,Company is great to work for if you are looking to get your foot in the door in the financial industry. Great advancement opportunity and great environment.
good,"great place to work depends on the area and management, also sometimes is very stressful need to multitasking at managers discretion and needs could change weekly"
good,"This is a job that requires a lot of talking, but it's over the phone. So, it doesn't always feel like you're involved with a lot of people. You can keep to yourself or communicate with your coworkers. It provides great benefits and after leaving, I've realized it had a lot of awesome opportunities and was a generally awesome environment!"
good,JPMorgan Chase is an exceptional company to work for.  The company puts emphasis on the workplace culture and an inclusive management team.  Everyday is something different and constantly keeps you growing.
good,Was able to move up in the company fairly easy. Decent pay. Most managers seem to truly care and want to see you succeed and advance in your career. Good work / life balance.
good,Typical day at work was going to the vault taking out the cash to take upstairs to give to the other tellers so that we could start our day. I learned how to work at the business window and do foreign currency. Management was ok teller supervisor was awesome. Worked with a different variety of people we learned from each other. Hardest part of the job was putting the boxed coins in the upstairs vault. The most enjoyable part was the teller meetings.
good,while working here I was cross trained in both sales and operations platform. management is very motivated with people that are willing to develop within the firm
good,Good place to work. Very results driven. Can get bogged down in too many meetings. Too many cooks in the kitchen. Focus on mobility is good but can become excessive
good,"I got to learn new things and how to mentor and manage team, understand the business  and client requirements, establishing goal and ensuring we meet it"
good,"Management at JP Morgan as a whole is excellent. For years I have seen many people grow their career in an encouraging environment. I would never even consider leaving. However, a recently hired manager has caused the morale in the department to decrease drastically. Instead of the team working together as they have for years, we are encouraged to compete on every level. This has caused quite a bit of back biting that I have not seen in other departments. "
good,There was always a lot of pressure to meet sales goals and collect more money.  The place became more and more easy as time went along and i learned more abouit the credit bureau.
good,"I started as a CSR and eventually was trained  in new accounts. I later became a bank auditor.  "
good,"The work/life balance runs team by team. It can be rare to achieve a normal 9 to 5 schedule because the position of operations is a constant push that is based on trading volume."
good,"Originally tasked with developing and implementing processing and risk management mitigation practices for a low performing pecialized mortgage product.  This quickly morphed into something larger and more exciting.  Volume and profitability grew exponentially and management provided enormous leeway, courage and technology investments.  Overall, it was an enormously gradating and rewarding experience.  Untimely, the product offering was lost via a merger and other changes in the wind."
good,A great place to grown and learn how to connect with people. Teaching you to balance your on accounts. what to expect from customers. How to show empathy.
good,"My time at JPMorgan Chase wasn't very long, intentionally. When I first started Chase I was very excited to embark my journey with this new job. It did not take me long to realize how tiresome and repetitive my role really was. There were many uncomfortable things I was asked to do, like walk through the line of people waiting for the teller to see if I could offer other suggestions to get their transaction done (really what they want you to do is bring them back to your desk because that's where you make your $$). About 10% of the time I was able to find another solution for them, the other 90% of the times I was given short answers or simply ignored. The typical day at work consisted of 50% refunding fees for angry customers and doing other tasks that customers could simply get done by calling customer service. The remaining 50% is where I made the monthly incentive. Opening checking or savings accounts, Cd's, credit cards, and referring to the partners (CPC banker, Advisor, Home lending advisor, etc). Management varies from branch to branch, as does some of the ways you may do things depending on your manager. I got lucky enough to have a manager who was very nice, but would micro-manage every thing you did. It was like she didn't have faith that her employees were doing things correctly or a certain way. Also, she often reinforced or reiterated whatever customer service B.S. corporate would spit out that week. It never failed to hear ""the customer experience"" about 3 times per day. The workplace culture was good, never had any problems. Just do your job. Nobody ever really"
good,"People stay late night for the work completion."
good,Overall Chase is a good company to work for.  However it is not very easy to get a promotion and the salary ranges are not industry competitive for Project Managers.
good,JP gave me the foundation to become a great employee.  It allow the freedom to learn and make mistakes.  I would have love to stay but my salary was low since I started in the back office.
good,I did learn a lot within the short time frame I was there.  The day usually starts off with a learning exercise and off to the races.  Project life cycle takes up most of your day.
good,"Helping your co-workers with high importance calls or changing payment's to the customer. Have some ideas to offer the customer on how to pay there credit card bill. "
good,"Chase is a fast-paced, very stressful and competitive place to work. Most of the co-workers are friendly and easy to work with. They frequently have mandatory overtime."
good,Great company to work for. Many changing parts. I always worked with a great crew. Everyone was willing to help with new projects. I would work with JP Morgan Chase again.
good,"Excellent company, well run, but very large and positions are ""assembly line"" like. Breadth of experience can only be gained after years of various roles."
good,Nice place to learn for freshers. Good guidance from seniors. At times it becomes very stressful when there are production issues but again it was a great learning experience
good,"Always interesting, no 2 days are the same working for GTI. My day to day activities was taking care of tickets, storage provisioning, planning upgrades. For years I was able to work remote, which was much less stressful considering much of the work was after hours and weekends during non production time. I really enjoyed my 10 plus years at JPMC."
good,Great place to work. Great staff. Good benefits. Paid time off. Tuition reimbursement. Downtown location easy to get to. No paid parking. Nice building
good,"best place to work. Good learning and helpful management and colleagues. This place helped me in developing my overall personality."
good,J P Morgan is a good and stable organization. It has well management team and in general better decision making prevails. The work force is well diverse and people get very good experience of working in a multi-location and diverse group of people.
good,"Great culture and great people. Some buildings and facilities were outdated but a new cafeteria was recently built. The work was repetitive, mundane and boring but the people are great."
good,"Great place to work - long hours, even in HR but inspiring leadership.  Size of organization can make change difficult but supportive managers.  Career advancement is a plus with opportunities for domestic and international transfers."
good,"Working at Chase was like being in your own little world.  Two different cafe's to eat at.  A little store to buy just about anything.  A coffee shop.   Chase tried to make things easy for employees.  On side cleaners.  Company paid flu shots in winter done on site as well.   Office available or accessible 24/7 which was very convenient.  If you had to leave for any appointment, you were able to make up time without using personal time.   Enjoyed working at Chase very much."
good,"Pretty cool place to work, great benefits and decent hours. nice work place culture, easy to advance if you want. Can be very stressful everything you do is grade/monitored."

good,"Daily job functions includes reviewing medical documentation to support short term disability, contact providers to get additional info to support disability claim, maintain contact with employees and managers regarding claim status, Our department was very diverse in gender and ethnicity. We considered ourselves as family because of close contact and daily communication. We enjoyed being together and helping each other. The job was fast paced where as tasks were required to be completed by end of day. I learned so much from others regarding process and procedures. I appreciated the experience."
good,was a vp in high level group. Lots of type A head butting but generally exciting work. Some red tape and issues associated there but other than that good gig.
good,Somewhat of a Great Company to work with. Benefits are great . Its a relaxed atmosphere to work in. Great Leadership. Opportunities for growth and advancement.
good,"Beautiful  area to work near,  people and staff are friendly..... Would def recommend  working fornsuch a great company.... The benefits are excellent and health and dental are very reasonable... Not much more to say"
good,"Chase is a very competitive company. You are constantly told to refer/sell/promote banking services. They are strict on goals being met. Depending on what location you get, meeting your goals can be stressful if there is not enough foot traffic."
good,I enjoyed my time at Chase Bank. The pay was good for the industry and job category. It is very competitive so you need to be the type of person that flourishes in that environment
good,Great company to work for with plenty of paid time off given. The work hours can be hectic and it's tough to balance life and work. Pay was adequate before commission was taken away. The management is great but in a call center there is very little room for advancement with limited transitional skills in regards to the finance sector.
good,Senior leadership receives excellent pay and a great deal of autonomy to run their departments.  If you're good...you're not micro managed.  If you are lacking...expect to be micro-managed.
good,Great work environment and culture with firm rules on unacceptable behaviour. Good work life balance. Salary and advancement of employees needs improvement.
good,Had a great management staff that absolutely cared about their employees. Great job but not a lot of room for career advancement. Flexible hours if you wanted to do more than the standard 40.
good,"an entry-level position into any of the central ohio corporate locations will prove beneficial for anyone undecided on career, but wanting structure and security along with the corporate banking environment."
good,There was some good day at JPMorgan. Atmosphere was very relaxed. I worked with some nice managers and  people. We worked projects as a team. Nice job

good,"This organisation respects its people and their abilities. Good paymaster and provides adequate opportunities of growth. During my stint with this organization, I was able to grow professionally"
good,I've enjoyed working at Chase for their home mortgage department. Their manager team is amazing but their systems have some opportunities to improve. I would recommend this job to others.
good,Enjoyed getting to know my team members in this mortgage environment. Connected well with different lines of business. Learned how to communicate with clients through different channels.
good,"JPM is financial leader that offers a lot of opportunities.  They offer a pension, 401k, and several other benefits.  There is also a lot of room for career growth."
good,I've enjoyed my time with Chase thoroughly. The management teams have given me the opportunity to move forward in my role and have helped me to balance life events.
good,"I worked in the branch during the time Chase was transitioning customers to using the machines more instead of the tellers. Also my role was becoming more of a teller and personal banker hybrid. Although I was still required to meet my sales goals, often times that was difficult since I spent so much time at the teller line. As a company, I truly enjoyed working for Chase. If they had a centralized location in Chandler, or offered more remote positions I would consider going back, but in a different role."
good,Very pleased with my time at JPMorgan Chase - would definitely recommend that qualified candidates consider opportunities at the firm..................
good,Overall I enjoyed working for Chase. I was there 11 1/2 years so of course there were ups and downs. But the pay was good most of  the managers were cool. One thing I did not like was favoritism.
good,"A typical day is watching the clock so that you don't spend too much time with one customer."
good,Chase offers a very flexible work environment depending on the department you are in. The benefits are great and the pay is reasonable. I recommend the company to others and have enjoyed working here for over 8 years.
good,"I believe this company was great company to work for.  You have a lot of training and sufficient help if you should need it.  This company provides a great work life balance, and the pay structure was fair."
good,I've learned a lot about the banking industry at Chase. Chase is a great company to work for. I enjoy that there are so many different areas of the bank for advancement.
good,A typical day at work is being in an inbound call center on the phones talking to customers regarding their mortgage. The job has  numerous training classes that can be take to help in career progression. There is diversity in the workplace which makes it very unique. The hardest part of the job is being able to fulfill the needs of the customer to their satisfaction.  The most enjoyable part of the job is making the customer happy.
good,"My time at JP Morgan chase was very interesting and I am forever grateful to the management for all the training provided."
good,"Engagement across firmwide controllers, reporting teams and technology teams. Have gained extensive experience with improving analytics and reporting through automation of processes. Proven project manager leading global teams and onboards of internal stakeholders."

good,Competitive benefits. Diverse culture a priority. Able to interact with various levels of management. Career mobility a priority. Career development focus.
good,While with Chase I was offered extensive training and many benefits of working with a large and widely known company. The environment is very large and bustling you have to be a stand out to be noticed. Customers were great and I rarely had any calls that required management to intervene when it came to upholding company policy.
good,I accepted a position under a manager who was crazy.  The position did not require a VP level person.  At Chase VPs were a dime a dozen when I was there but it made her feel good to have VPs reporting to her.  This job could have been done by an intern.
good,"Good company to work for, great benefits- including insurance, time off, 401k. Lots of changes and lack of communication at times but overall a positive environment to work in."
good,"If you are in school JPMorgan Chase is a great place to work. They will work with your school schedule. Customer service is a must they take it very seriously. Make sure that you are ready for change, there are always new training and new rules to be followed."
good,"Provided commercial and small business financial services to members of the community"
good,"A lot depends on the silo you are working in , since this is a bank and like most banks has different towers that you work for.  But for the most part this was a decent work place with good benefits."
good,"Advance computer system."
good,"Nice place to work.Big Brand. Good exposure to market movements."
good,"My manager is very cooperative and colleagues are very helpful. Everyone is ready to help you and they treat you very well, but workpalce is very less interactive."
good,"The thing about Chase is that it offers plenty of benefits. Many volunteer opportunities, and incentive programs. I would reccommend working here. However, depending on your position, you could get bumped to a different office, in a different state."
good,JPMorgan Chase was a great place to work.  Most of the Management was always interactive with the employees and genuinely cared about us.  The only reason I left was due to lack of career advancement and that I was not being paid the current market rate for my position due to an outdated HR rule about salary increase caps when you change your job to a higher paying position.
good,"Good pace with a rigid structure including numerous meetings & committee work.'White shirts"" were a ""must"". People were well-educated & generally friendly & eager to help."
good,"Although manager after manager over my years have preached advancement they have ignored my requests to keep my skills under their P&L. It is poor management like this that has made me look for another career. However, the work and benefits are good for a starting position and I would recommend them as a starting employer."
good,Working at Chase was a good job but it can be stressful dealing with customers at times. I liked my coworkers and my manager. They were understanding about changing around my schedule for my kids. I would overall recommend this job
good,You usually know what you're going to do once you get to work and they'll provide you with anything you need to succeed the hardest thing are meeting the numbers but with repetitive practice and a determined spirit you'll be the best document specialist there
good,"JP Morgan is a highly competitive, challenging environment. Every day you are afforded the opportunity to be better than you were the previous day. Work-Life is what you make of it. While it is a competitive environment, it is also highly collaborative. The culture is reliant upon the best people working together and making the company successful."
good,"I retired as Senior Vice President and Director of Community Relations. I now write essays and magazine columns on various topics  including business, politics, consumer issues, and current affairs."
good,"Working with my book of business around 700 customers, building relationship and recommend financial product that best fit for a customer"
good,"excellent company to work excellent company to work for  Friendly, challenging , fair, fun nice people.  Interesting clients and lots of great benefits and paid time off, etc"
good,"Overall great experience, had a great manager who provided many career growth opportunities. Left this position for promotion. Made many great relationships here."
good,The company has many different departments with customers feeling confident with the name.They try new different ideas very often and they let us take part in them.
good,JPM has a flat working environment and good rewarding package
good,"Maybe this is an issue anywhere, but it was impossible to request a higher salary for a supervisor position strictly because they had my existing salary information."
good,Easy place to work. Management very friendly willing to do what is necessary to make sure your work environment is a safe and comfortable. Hard to try and advance in company.
good,"Es un ambiente de trabajo muy bueno, donde el compañerismo abunda, y también ofrece muchos beneficios además de un sueldo competente."
good,It was a temporary job I took until something better came up.  I came over to this company as JPMorgan Chase took over Westpac Banking Corp Operations dept.
good,"I loved a very everything i did at Chase. My position as a QA analyst at chase was my dream job. I loved what I did except that we had management. Also, constant layoff  at chase was very depressing."
good,it is a great place to learn and get to know people. i had a great time with my co workers and they were very giving to me and others. I had an awesome time but the company was split and moved to different states.
good,Typical day is helping the branch grow through teller sells or personal bankers getting in new clientele. This place is a good place to work. The staff was amazing to work with and the job was interesting.
good,People work together to meet goals. There is tremendous opportunity for growth. Chase cares about being employee and customer friendly. I recommend Chase to anyone who likes the large bank culture. They are straightforward with reasonable expectations.
good,Good place to work overall but super competitive.  Hard to move to different family job.  Firm encourages you to stay within your line of business. Very good reputation but underpays.
good,"All in all , JPM is probably one of the best employers in Bournemouth. Good salary and benefits, significant career opportunities but also relatively long hours"
good,"Working here for about a year.  The culture is great but the time management of the company, is lacking.  In our market risking customer satisfaction for people to not get overtime is not worth it."
good,Work life balance is amazing.The company supplies you with everything you need to be successful.The pay is limitless.They help with schooling and even pays for everything thru a reimbursement program.
good,I had a very good experience in this organisation. work and personal life manageable. I enjoyed the tenure. management is good. management had provided good tracings.
good,"While working for the company, I was able to learn the in's and out's of the banking industry and culture. While it was rewarding with great co workers, and benefits package, who your manager is plays a big role in how you enjoy your job, as well as how well you will succeed. "
good,"My overall experience working as a consultant at JPMorgan Chase was fair.  As a consultant, you are expected to come in with your box of tools to perform"
good,My manager is very much interested in the career development of his subordinates and works toward that goal. I can say all managers are like that but my previous manager who relocated outside of Ohio and my new manager both exhibit this characteristics.
good,"I loved my job as it had the appropriate balance of challenge and time to accomplish goal.  The people culture there is good.  There will always be issues in a major corporation as management has a trickle-down effect but, in general, it was one of the best jobs I ever had."
good,Chase is a good company to work for. I was able to become well rounded in the Loss Mitigation Area while employed there. My tenure there was not as long as I wished it to be but I understand company needs during economic changes.
good,"Chase culture is amazing.  You are expected to balance what is good for the customer with what is good for the firm.  The benefits package is amazing, and in ten years I only came across one manager who was counter to Chase culture."
good,As one of the largest banks on the U.S. the culture in the retail bank is one that you are only limited by your ambition. One can make a very good salary if one works hard enough.
good,"Typical work day starts at night especially for consumer banking working in the Philippines, You learn how to multi task and meet deadlines since you are only given specific time to finish your job. High volume of work load on a daily basis. High standards when it comes to metrics so you learn how to be efficient in and out."
good,it's worth it as long as you work in a good team; great benefits and culture; there's multiple possibilities for promotion but you have to work closely with your manager
good,everyday learned something new. manager is very nice and helpful. the hardest part of this job is to get identification from people and that is the most important part if our job because we deal with people's money.
good,"I would recommend others to work at JP Morgan.   Unfortunately, they have removed their on-site presence from the Kansas City area.   If you are able to relocate, then JP Morgan is a place you should consider."
good,Joined here from a competitor. Has it's upsides and downsides like all companies. I find it rewarding. Hours are very manageable and the standards of work are high. I am extremely hard working and strive to excel and so the culture here helps me achieve my goals.

good,"Lots of great opportunity as well as learning available, great place to start and move your way up and around if desired. Career availability and movement."
good,"A typical day at work is spent taking incoming calls about the basic requests..close enough to the next person to talk but far enough to have adequate personal space. Culture is real laid back, until you hear managers yelling and then you are flooded with incoming calls--u hang up and then the phone rings!! But, when it slows down, only an hour has passed,,management is applauding and thanking the teams efforts, as they were monitoring of course!"
good,"Perfect for women employees .Beautiful work culture. Team work is very much visible , The management is ready to help with anything . Good for gaining knowledge"
good,This is a great company to work for.  I enjoy the position that I am currently in.  I have been with the company going on 11 years.

good,Work life balance is good. Various options within the Organization to switch if not happy with current role.Good Management. A fun place to work with not just work all the time.

good,"Learned a lot from this employer, awesome management and all around friendly environment. Can be stressful but with a can do attitude, it isn't to hard. The hardest part is having to know how to learn to handle stressful callers that are unhappy with their account."
good,"I have had a long enjoyable career with the company.  Started as a bank teller and worked through 3 mergers to eventually become an assistant manager.  Staff and customers have always been a pleasure to work with.  Hardest part of the job was working from opening to close daily but as a salaried employee that comes with the territory.  Most enjoyable part of the job was building long term relationships with everyone, they were like family."
good,It was a great opportunity to work for JP Morgan Chase. There was a lot of opportunity to grow within the company with a significant amount of support.

good,I really liked working for JPMorgan Chase.  During the 12+ years that I worked for JPMorgan Chase I earned several commendations for superior performance.

good,"Typical day at work involved team meetings, day planning, goal setting and work production. Management was as helpful as they could be. I enjoyed the atmosphere."
good,"A typical day involved answering consumer questions concerning their home mortgages and accepting payments for their mortgages.  I learned a lot about home mortgages and the ""behind-the-scenes"" rules and policies concerning anything and everything about home mortgages.  Management was very understanding, helpful, and easily accessible.  My co-workers were dedicated to their jobs, and we worked as a team to help each other in difficult situations.  The hardest part of the job is that sometimes, actually often, you had to inform consumers they would definitely be losing their homes and have to find a new place to live.  The most enjoyable part of the job, was helping a client through a difficult time and ensuring they would remain homeowners!"

good,JP Morgan Chase is a great place to work.  Excellent benefits and unbelievable amount of time off.  Salary could be better but the perks make up for it.
good,"I worked here doing investment research during my MBA program. They have a very organized school-year work program where you get paired with a team and you get to help them out. "
good,"I worked in a small town so some days would be busy, and others slow. A typical work day would start out with getting myself organized for the day ahead. I would check the calendar for upcoming appointments, gather any documents I would need in the next few hours and then continue with checking my emails and calling whichever customers needed immediate assistance. I would help customers with managing their accounts, answering questions about Loans, Lines, Investments, Business related questions and general account questions.  I learned a lot while working at JPMorgan Chase such as how to better manage my work load when conquering a very busy, almost unmanageable work day and how to be extremely diligent with my work consistantly. I am a team player and have always meshed well with my co-workers. I believe that it is extremely important to be there for your team members and always include them with any new information. Teamwork is the key to success.  The hardest part of my job was working late hours. Although I was always available whenever they needed me and I never said that I am not available, it was hard to work until 7PM and not get him until 7:30PM.  The best part of my job was the feeling of achievement after a long work day working with people."

Everyone was helpful, full of knowledge and we complete our work daily."
good,Working for JPM was a rewarding experience. Its a massive corporation that provides opportunities for advancement or atleast variety. The key is to network and understand the political nature of larger corporations.
good,"JPMorgan Chase is overall a very good company to work for. Their work life balance is great, opportunities for movement are vast, and the people are spectacular. The only downside is their pay structure, and the many rules that dictate how, when, and how much, you receive for promotions. They often treat internal applicants rather poorly, compared to external applicants. In fact, there is a well known saying in Chase that if you want more money, you need to leave and come back."
good,"Processed deposits/withdrawals/payments for customers. Balanced cash drawer and TCD machine in drive through. I learned how to process all customer transactions using simply a computer whereas in my previous banking employment it was all done a 10 key calculator. We were short a Manager for some time up until one was finally transferred to our branch, she was very easy to get along with and work with as were all the team members. The hardest part of the job was that we were consistently short staffed in our branch, unfortunately no matter how fast we were behind the line our customers would have to wait at times. Even though we were short handed and customers would have to wait the most enjoyable part of working at Chase was the interaction with the customers and how flexible they attempted to be with their employees."
good,JPMC's work/life balance and flexibility is exceptional.  I have never had to miss a school/sports event for my children because of work.  Having the flexibility to adjust my work day is one of the reasons I chose JPMC.

good,A lot of change in architecture and management within technology due to reorganizations and changes in business structure. With new management came new visions on how best to leverage technology and staff. This provided challenges (in a good way) on making these visions come to fruition. I have reported to management in all lines of businesses in my tenure there and enjoyed the majority of them. Sadly the last change that impacted me was the decision to vacate DFW as a strategic location for global technology.
good,"my experience at JPMChase was wonderful, only left to pursue a"

good,Great place to work. Product offerings are second to none. Company prides itself on training and their platforms. Systems will help you succeed.
good,"Working daily with customers who reached out to the Executive office for assistance on their current or past mortgage loan application.  I learned how to work with all types of customers and handle difficult situations.  I enjoyed all of my co workers, and we supported each other.  Most enjoyable part was to know that I resolved a customers complaint and made them happy.  Hardest part was to tell a customer that I could not or did not find an issue that supported their complaint."
good,Day starts getting into computer verifying and accurately putting in client information so they could get their taxes back in a timely manner.  Great people to work with.

good,"It's best to work at the LOB HQ. Great company with opportunity. I would consider working at JPMChase again."

The benefits package is excellent, and if you are willing to learn, there are a lot of good mentors within the company."
good,"I have enjoyed my time with Chase and there are fantastic people working there.  The work can be hard and the expectations are high, but there are endless opportunities."
good,"A typical day at work was fairly unexciting; it was very routine. I learned how to multitask. I had to be able to count cash, process transactions, and talk to each customer as they drove up (I worked in the drive through) all while continuing to provide excellent customer service. My managers were nice and always made the schedule on time, however, I found that they did the least amount of work as possible to get them by. I believe in putting 100% of your effort into your job and they did not."

good,JP Morgan has certainly afforded me the opportunity to get some substantive experience and exposure and I am ready to take my career to the next level. I have built successful teams and managed  important functions and am confident my unique approach sets me apart from most .
good,"A typical day at work would be meeting with new clients, and following up current files, returning and answering incoming calls. I had the privilege of working with many great mentors and managers. I worked with a lot of great co-workers who were great at sending referrals. The hardest part of this job was dealing with a out of state processing staff. The most enjoyable part of the job was making the dream of home ownership come true."
good,"Overall the job is a good job.  It's not really challenging, because, just like any sales job, it's about building life long relationships.  Chase's training is program is not bad either.  They have continuing training each month which always helps and keeps employees ""on their toes."""

good,Overall a positive work environment with opportunities for advancement.  Very fast paced and hard work is needed to maintain day-to-day responsibilities and to succeed overall.
good,Love My colleague's and the environment! The growth is limited this is why i'm currently searching for new employment. Chase is a great place to work for other than that one issue.
good,The company is great to work for. The company is well known and you learn so much about mortgage banking. I would recommend this company to others.
good,Giant aircraft carrier with as many professional roles as you can imagine. Similar to any other place of employment there are really bright people here and also not so bright people as well. The unfortunate thing however is the likelihood that your boss happens to be one of those not so bright people. However this speaks to what I consider a pretty good shot at advancement if you know whom to rub elbows with. Compensation is not the highest in the industry but otherwise it's a great reputation to carry with you.
good,Great place to start a career. Multiple choices for career advancements. The retail banking hours are a little later than I prefer with having kids.
good,Every day presented new challenges to stretch creativity in meeting and managing service levels while sustaining a fun and productive work environment

We then wait for various packages to come in via, Fedex, UPS, Interoffice mail and U.S. Mail once that happens we begin to open these packages and begin to sort through all the legal document, subpoenas, live checks, foreclosure documents and many more to make sure they go to their proper departments. Heavy filing, scanning and copying. I learned to properly screen all form of legal paperwork and legal support functions. How to locate documents to respond to subpoenas and several more great skills. Co-workers and management were helpful as well."

good,"Overall people really like working at Chase Mortgage and want to stay.  Because it is such a big organization, changes take a lot of time."
good,I enjoyed the challenged related to the work performed and sharing knowledge gained from said experiences.

The challenge of identifying gaps in processes or trending errors provided the opportunity to interact with management. This interaction centered around training opportunities and procedural updates.

good,"Its a very good Company to work for, have a very good work culture.A typical day at work would completing valuations for the UUT team and placing trades for AS and Trades team."
good,"Same as my previous 3-4 required reviews, Chase overall is a good company to work for if you are located in one of their footprint states.  There are no longer no opportunities working remotely.  Due to billions of dollars in fines over the past few years, pay increases and annual bonuses were slim to none."
good,"Same as my previous two required Reviews.  Overall, the company is good to work for if you are geographically located in one of their footprints.  In addition, due to the billions of dollars in fines over the past few years, pay increases and annual bonuses were reduced to slim or none."

good,"Leveraged extensive knowledge of state foreclosure guidelines, federal and state requirements, HAMP, HAFA"
good,"It wasn't easy at first to transfer to a company with a diverse workforce, but as days and months pass, I learned a lot and developed my personality in a better way. Leading and learning how to act and take responsibility at work was one of the things i learned and will definitely take with me wherever I go. Not only this company focuses on goal and efficiency, it also makes sure that all employees get to enjoy their stay at work. They would often have an activity wherein everyone gets to take a break from work. They also gives recognition to employees who have gone beyond the expectations of the company."
good,Chase's Security and Fraud department is constantly busy dealing with both a consumers issue with a credit card and any other goings on that require a human element.  While fast paced the people employed are generally nice and amicable.  All the coworkers constantly help one another as it may be them who needs a colleagues help later.  Management always made time to talk to you if you had any issues.  No real abundance of time off of work as it is extremely busy.
good,"Overall good place to work for. Positive environment with great co-workers. Had great medical benefits. In most cases management is more than willing to work with you to help you achieve advancement. The actual job I did was excellent. I loved my job. When new upper management came there were a lot of changes made that were not beneficial to the customer or the employee's. The department started to struggle as a whole, which when I started loosing interest."
good,I loved working for the firm I spent 25+ years building and growing my career with them.  Due to a personal loss I had to make a decision for my family otherwise I would have stayed there until I retired.
good,Long Hours but nice people to work with. Encourage changing teams and more advancement. Many section to choose from when apply for fadp program
good,"I enjoy and feel comfortable working with money.  But the most enjoyable part is waiting on customers.  Getting to know regular customers and chatting with them, catching up on things going on in their lives while you assist them with their transactions. Knowing them by name and them knowing me.  I also like suggesting products to them that may help them in their banking.  Introducing prospective customers to our personal banker, to open accounts"
good,"I support the IT infrastructure in the company. Server, Network and end user technology assets."
good,A good supportive company with many long serving members.Constantly developing and improving systems with a lively workforce and supportive management

good,"Huge company, Fun place to work with great work culture with tons of exposure and opportunity to learn and grow.........."
good,Everyday is always a learning process. Every audits have different scenarios and treatments. I always seek supervision from my leader and co-team mate. The company make sure that we have a work-life balance. We have monthly programs that every team would participate and enjoy. The environment is good and secured.
good,Productive workplace with managers that are not only mentoring but fun to work with.  A lot of opportunities to learn are available but not always attainable because of work load.  The job push you to work above and beyond and have work accomplishment that are fulfilling.  The hardest part of the job is the job itself with it's aggressive timelines and deliverables.  The most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with people of all kinds.
good,"The company was overall great. I was able to go between different branches and experience different environments. Co workers make the work place better to work in, it didn't just feel like a job"
good,A great Work/Personal Life balance.  Overtime was often available.The management is not great but if you do your job no one bothers you. Overall is not a bad company.
good,A fast-paced environment.  This company thrives on being the best in its class.  Who wouldn't want to be on the best team?  Chase is well-known for its rigidity.
good,Run different transactions as needed. I learned how to run and process a number of different transactions. Management is very helpful and is usually always available when needed. Co-workers there were never a problem but some were lazy which made the job a bit more stressful and difficult for me but I never let it affect my performance. The hardest part of the job would have to be when we had really busy days with only two people on the teller line and we had to deal with impatient customers. The most enjoyable part is knowing that when the customer leaves that I have completed all of there transactions to their liking and they were satisfied.
good,"Great company to work for. All benefits are included even for part time employees. The management team, however, is not the greatest."
good,I love working with Chase. I am part of a great team that is very supportive. I am part of a team that is constantly working on bringing new and exciting products to market.

good,"JPM is the largest bank and a peoples firm."
good,"you had so many customers you needed to contact daily for various reasons.  I learned that even though we would like to keep everybody in their homes, it wasn't always feasible. Not all management totally understood what the job was like unless they did it previously. Some judged you on their feelings for you. Others knew it wasn't always an easy job to do and understood your frustrations. My co-workers were all good people and willing to help  when they could, but because it was number driven, not being on the phone exactly 8 hrs a day wasn't acceptable. The hardest part of the job was having to tell a customer there was nothing we could do to help them stay in their homes. The best part was telling them they could and we were able to lower their pmts to an affordable amt."
good,"Great place to work with team assocated with groups gathering for birthday,baby shower and chances to win gifts. And rewards for quality and production"
good,"pros;environment-ethics-security-company-benefis-schedule-policies&proceedures-job"

good,"In the telephone banking environment you learn the underlying details that make banking easy and convenient for the customer. You take at least 1 to 200 calls a day and resolve a variety of consumer concerns; In doing so, you must engage the customer to find the root cause of a problem and use bank products and disclosures to not only help but ensure the client has complete understanding to avoid future occurrence. The hardest part of the job is saying ""no"" to the customer if and only if you have exhausted all of your or your team options. The most enjoyable part of the job is when the customer is in a really hard position and you think outside the box to create a spectacular solution! The customer is excited, you are excited and the bond between the client and company became a million times stronger!"

good,"A principio iniciei minha atividade no banco realizando atendimento a clientes, efetuando a identificação de necessidades e esclarecimento de dúvidas referentes a produtos ou serviços. Posteriormente, com mais conhecimento e bagagem passei a efetuar esse atendimento em campo ou seja ia pessoalmente, quando fosse o caso, para remoção e substituição de equipamentos com avarias bem como solucionando problemas do software interno do banco. Para execução do meu trabalho na condição de aprendiz, sempre contei com o apoio e orientação da minha chefe do setor e dos meus colegas, uma vez que nos sentíamos como parte de uma equipe. Durante o período que estive no banco, a parte mais difícil do trabalho estava relacionada a comunicação de um certo desentrosamento dentre as varias equipes responsáveis pela solução dos chamados efetuados pelos colaboradores, isso porque havia casos em que uma das equipes mudava/atualizava algum programa sem que houvesse a imediata comunicação a as demais partes na cadeia de solução de problemas. Com isso havia um atraso na solução do problema."

I learned accountability and was able to take charge of projects that had very high stakes and was always successful. My immediate team always treated me with respect and fairness.

They have some amazingly skilled managers. I was fortunate enough to work for one such manager. I learned a lot i was put out of my comfort zone and i excelled in everything that was thrown at me. Hardest part is finding resources within the company. Being a huge organization it is very difficult to find everything that you need. Often i came up with things that even my manager was not aware of. Compensation are the worst part along with a decent salary there was nothing provided no housing, no insurance, no food, no snacks. It was hard to save money while at JP Morgan. I was expecting a lot more from them being a huge organization that it is. Also the full time salary is not up to the mark for me to accept it as a Masters student."
good,"JP Morgan Chase has everything it takes to be a great employer. The company offers  a competitive salary, a decent benefits package and a good  training program."
good,"I liked working for Chase for a few different reasons. I like the customer service atmosphere, they have good pay compared to other banks and as a teller you are not required to push sales. The work environment depended on the individual branch."

The work days were good a lot of of work but that's ok, the people I worked with were a lot of fun a made the job easier.

good,"A typical day at JP Morgan chase starts off with a short team meeting were we discuss any relevant news or changes in our credit card & home loans. Then I would take calls throughout the day resolving customers issues and then possibly selling products when appropriate."
good,I have been part of JP Morgan for almost 7 years. During my tenure I had a very good support received from Management with regards to work/life balance.
good,My job was not a hard job just the tasks were repetitive. You had to shift between multiple applications in order to get the simplest task complete. Also trying to find information on the company intranet was very difficult.
good,"Started working 2nd shift monitoring Novell servers across the US, working with very professional co-workers.  We also did desktop  support after hours to help staff complete projects.  Work on server builds with server management team, which was helpful in my IT education.  Started troubleshooting networking problems on a wide scope ( replacing cables, toning drops to locate problems with cables or NIC cards).  Replacing cards in switches/hubs.  Learned the 3 or 4 helpdesk ticket systems that the company used during that time.  Worked on various projects from OS upgrades to patches for Window/Novell servers.  Unlock databases for users during crunch time to help meet deadlines.  Worked with people from all parts of the globe, met and still maintain friendships with alot of them.  As Team Lead my staff build and installed over 100 servers in our data centers around NYC area. We turned down and deracked all equipment during the closing of data centers.  Which was the worst part of the job ( like tearing down your house after you have lived in it for years )."

good,"Working at the bank we dealt mostly with business people and the general public. A fundamental part of our job was providing excellent service while still maintaining controls, hitting our goals as a branch, and creating a atmosphere where people felt safe and open to discuss very critical topics such as their financial needs. Security and privacy was huge among our top priorities working at the bank. My daily routine included opening and closing the branch, signing off on checklist, maintaining controls of our cash boxes, keeping private customer information, and much more."

good,"Chase has a pleasant work call center  environment. They provide excellent training tools and reviews periodically. Also management assigns teams leads as needed. The hardest part of the job is unfortunately repossession of a customers vehicle, once all available options have been exhausted. In return, the most enjoyable part of the job is address and resolving a customers concerns in a timely manner. Excellent company to work for."
good,Completed quality audits on Loss Mitigation phone calls to confirm that policy and procedures were being executed on every call.
good,JPMorgan Chase offers a wide variety of opportunities to explore;   Internal advancements are hindered by lack of pay growth
good,"Chase is a very fast past working enviornment, in the department I am in the call are not always back to back. Some days are worse than others but thats the same with any job."
good,"This job can be very rewarding and even fun at times, but you have to learn to have thick skin. Some days are great, some you don't even want to pick up the phone yet when you get that one customer that you know you made a difference for them even if it's as small as reversing a service fee, now those are the days I live for. Management is always helpful, but not only that all the employees really care and help each other. Such a positive work culture."
good,Outstanding job where i managed a team to assist homeowners who were due to lose their homes.  I was responsible in reviewing all paperwork to ensure the homeowners paperwork was in accordance with all policy and procedures.  Hardest part of the job is when you have to contact a homeowner and inform them that the were disapproved for a modification.  The enjoyable part of the job is when a modification was approved and to hear the tone of the borrowers voice when you inform them

good,working with this company was one of the best experience I have ever have

good,"Implemented new processes. Monitor daily volumes, load balance daily production. Completed daily, weekly, monthly RSCA audits."
good,"The department I work in grossly underpaid. The management in the dept is amazing and I will, without a doubt miss them most. However, the duties continue to rise, the responsibilities continues to increase, but our pay is about $10-20K under what it should be. Bonuses vary (annually mind you), but when I know credit is taking home bonuses upwards of $30k, our measly $10K stings a little bit. Getting promoted into the team lead position I was being groomed for has taken over a year. I created ""How To"" guides and even a training deck for my Credit Support Coordinator position. I am look to expand my horizons. I have many coworkers who have left Chase to join Opus, and are quite HAPPY with the hands off approach allowing folks to be compensated appropriately in proportion to their work output. I am ready for a change. "

good,"As a Business Banker at JPMC, you will be expected to excel in relation to your peers, but the peer group is small and chances of doing well are good for a motivated and talented individual.

Management was also learning with us on new policies and procedures implemented for the benefit and protection of the clients.

good,"Working at Chase, I was in awe of the new and upcoming technologies being developed.  Much of it in-house."
good,"O volume de trabalho é bastante grande, com muita pressão por parte do cliente. Aqui amadureci como profissional e aprendi a tomar atitudes necessárias no momento, com consciência e conhecimento dos possíveis riscos. Como sou dedicada a um único cliente, a gerência é compreensiva, nos dando liberdade de trabalhar, sem colocar mais pressão do que o cliente. A parte mais difícil é administrar as falhas do processo gerados pelo cliente, que impactam nos resultados, de forma a não gerarmos um conflito com o cliente. A parte mais agradável do trabalho é ter a liberdade de mostrar o seu trabalho, onde a visibilidade do seu profissionalismo junto ao cliente fica mais transparente."

My team had to constantly work in unison with other teams and at most times this proved difficult. Our manager's manager's office sat close to our cubes so he had great influence on us. His policy was to get work done as quickly and as to the letter with no problem. So in all projects, even the tiniest ones; the pressure was on. Other teams liked to take their time so they would constantly hinder our progress. Sometimes things would be rolling smoothly until someone decides to file paperwork or do what was required of them right away which would result in a cease-halt and a delay in the implementation in the physical aspects of the project.

While some of the changes in my department were good others were bad and did not bring as much success to the Chicago Cash Vault Department as previously anticipated.  One of the major cons in working in the department and working through the changes were the changes in management.  Though out my time there were 5 to 6 Site Managers, some managers used this position as a stepping stone in their career advancement and others were not prepared for the role and its responsibilities.

The best part of my job is when people thank me for putting in a better financial situation. Everyone I work with is great.  From the VP's to the assistants.  Even though the envrionment can be stressful, management tries to do what they can by having ""pep rallies"" and other fun activities."

good,"A typical day at work would involve reviewing the financial profiles of individual customers with the help of various credit bureau reports and deduce their credit worthiness for issuing credit cards. Apart from decision making, credit line determination was also a part of the profile."
good,"Typical big bank, just dont become a number. You can have a decent career here."
good,Coworkers are extremely fun and great to be around. Management team is excellent. Fast paced with always something to do!
good,Every day will be different. Very active environment. There is lot of opportunity to learn new things. Very good place to network with people. People are very friendly and ready to help.
good,"Com o pouco volume de trabalho e diante dos anuncios sobre prejuizos na imprensa decidi ir pro Pine. Mas o salario otimo, clima agradavel, boa gestao, tinha um back office de baixa qualidade devifo crescimento desordenado."
good,"Great place to start and understand the industry. They have recently changed to more of a customer service envirnoment, which has made the sales process alot easier and better."
good,Typical day is working on documentation. Closed accounts. Management was good. Enviroment is laid back
good,Chase has tought me many things throughout the years. I am very pleased that I had the opportunity to have worked with a great company.
good,Since I work in the Mail Department; I learn the definition of Team work and hard work. Everyday we would receive hundreds of Priority/Non Priority mail sometimes near a couple thousands and we would have to process all the mail withing a certain time frame due to the company's standards and policy.
good,I enjoyed this position because it gave me the freedom to go out and acquire new business from a warm list of premier customers.
good,"Temporary occupation through randstad, Processing immigration applications daily ."
good,A great name. Solid benefits. Good job security and opportunity for advancement. Focused on shareholder value.
good,Great Company to work for. Great Team work .Great co-worka typical day at work
good,I had a great experience working with Chase bank my manager was great
good,"very easy to learn and fun! very tedious at times, but we were allowed to switch to diff depts throughout the day if we needed a break. Not very many employees so its easy to get along with everyone there, and during our busier parts of the year we had temps come in but it was usually the same temps every time, so you get to know everyone. I loved everything about this job."
good,"A typical workday begins with signing into a computer and organizing your cash box for the day. My whole shift involves interacting with the customers as well as conducting basic transactions such as deposits, withdrawal and transfers. I make appropriate referrals when the opportunity arises; referrals are made to the bankers when a customer is eligible for an upgrade, certain products or services. The day ends with balancing out your cash box and ensuring there are no outages for the day. Transactions that are out of the ordinary can be easily executed by looking up P&P on the database. Other than that, when there is downtime, some cleaning and re-organizing will be done. I work 20 hours a week, 4 days, with 5 hour shifts each day. I get a 10 minute break which is pretty short in my opinion. Nothing exciting occurs and most of the focus in the branch is on the personal bankers because they make the sales. Tellers tend to see 80% of the customers who walk in and sometimes we have to deal with a lot of angry clients."
good,Very nice company to work for with great benefits. Management did not have enough experience but everyone was in the learning process. Mandatory overtime always good for those who need extra money.
good," Served as team leader for group of up to ten reconcilers, coordinating workflow in and out of the area, increasing production by approximately 20% above previous levels and consistently meeting deadlines ahead of schedule."
good,Challenging and fun work enviorment
good,"Enjoyed my time their. Management has above average skills. I was impressed by the stable, calm demeanor and problem solving skills of the staff over all."
good,I enjoyed working at JPMorgan Chase. But everytime I tried to advance I was unable to because I was to valuable in that department. I would do all the training for new employees.
good,"But some members of the management team need to learn how to manage people, not just numbers!! And it not good when the employees are well over educated compared to the management team"
good,"My daily activities include teller transactions, customer service, answering phone, balancing cash drawer, and teller referrals. I have learned the basics when it comes to the operations part of banking and how to conduct audits. My co wokers and I get along very well with one another and we are able to help each other without feeling as if we have overstepping. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with customers and getting to know them."
good,"Great company that is very employee friendly. I love overseeing the operations, however, the hardest part of the job is the FTE hours being cut and management frequently working as a teller - deadlines at times are not met and can make for a stressful environment."
good,I am responsible for managing the customer experience through the loan modification process. Primary contact for customers and approved third parties.
good,I enjoy being an underwriter because I know I have helped a family remain in their home. Its a very rewarding job
good,• Meet goals/deadlines set by Project Manager
good,"I would begin each day with a quick start with all of my employees to discuss sales and customer service focus for the day. I would review production reports and employee calls to pinpoint areas of improvement and provide feedback each day. My team had a wide variety of personalities which was fun and challenging at times. Ongoing sales trainings and one on one meetings with the team was the most enjoyable part of my job. Consistently being interactive and work together as a team made all of our jobs more enjoyable. Its hard to teach an employee who is satisfied with being just an average employee, so the challenges to motivate and push those employees into successful professionals, although challenging, it is what I would stride for."
good,"As one of my first jobs, I was fortunate to have this experience within a large financial institution that was about to undergo a substantial transformation with acquisition by Chase."
good,Good place to work. Competitive environment. Approachable management. Long hours.
good,Stable and Consistent
good,Enjoyed each day I worked there. Co-workers were eager to help me if I needed any assistance with anything.
good,"great compnay to work,great pay,overall good atmosphere"
good,A company with competitive culture stressing on sales goals and numbers but offering quite lucrative bonuses. The coworkers were friendly. The hours were not suitable for my life schedule at that point.
good,this place of business is a great place to work at. They understand that you are a person and not a slave. The benefits for working for this company is great as well because the support a lot of other companies.
good,"Chase had chosen to no longer provide patient financing, therefore, this facility will be closing 8/3/2012."
good,"Advanced technology focused; leading in areas."
good,I started young and learned a lot throughout my career. Compensation and benefits were great. I learned throughout the years that management needed better leadership qualities and less managerial.
good,"Evolving and accommodative work culture. Fun activities, great place for lunch and coffee, good social mixups with co workers, strong work ethic. Great place to work!"
good,By demonstrating my ability to learn and adjust quickly I was able to navigate between different LOBs and roles. I wish the firm had a different location strategy in NJ.
good,Everyone at work is willing to help each other. A typical day at work is a fast fun and friendly environment. The benefits are amazing and I enjoy coming into work everyday.
good,"The focus is definitely on speed, not customer service, or even employee happiness. Calls must be completed within a certain time. Managers will even come to your desk to urge you to hurry a long call."
good,Good company to work for. Good pay and benefits but there isn't much room to advance beyond about 20 hours per week. Unless of course you want to drive about an hour away to a different location for a promotion or job title change.
good,Learn lots of things with direct iteration with customers. Most part of days are busy. Have to stand of of my work time. Divers culture at work. Most of the time it's fun to work.
good,"Promotes a balanced life, with good benefits. The system needs improvements and daily work is manual and requires technology upgrades.  People are nice and promotes a healthy environment."
good,It was a great experience working at JPMorgan Chase. Got to learn new technolgies and implement as well. Management and teams are great.They encourage you to thrive and succeed.
good,"Chase does a very fine job of educating, training, and assisting with improving the customer experience throughout each transactions. Employees are provided with assistance beyond just a normal employee"
good,Good culture. Good work life balance and benefits are okay. Overall a good place to work. Everyone’s experience is different depending on what department you are working in
good,Nice place to work. Good company.  The location was good.  Friendly and good benefits.  I've worked there twice and each time was a great experience.  That's it.
good,"Good culture and nice colleagues."
good,"Good friendly working  environment , helps one to learn other areas of the business .family friendly balancing work with family needs , another aspect is innovation . Always  learning new things .one will always have room for advancement in ones career ."
good,nice place to work and chill.  The company wants to hire people who fit or represents what their brand is all about. The last thing you should do is submit a run-of-the-mill application.
good,"JPMC is the best company I've worked for. The typical work day is quite hectic and overwhelming however, networking and delegation are key to a successful career. One of the draw backs is much like other companies most of the managers are focused on the reports rather than the behaviors that impact the reports. The greatest thing about JPMC is the workplace culture. The culture is very positive and upbeat. There's always something going on."
good,"The name JPMorgan Bank is a people friendly bank whose brand identity is world renowned. My time spent at Chase has been the most memorable during my banking career. The latter part of my banking career I went to another competitor who tried to mimick Chase core values and technology, it falls short. There is no comparison to the level of professions at Chase."
good,"I worked in a great office in Berkeley. It was a very eclectic clientele. The customers were very friendly, and the staff was very supportive, and would help if needed"
good,"I have been at JPMC for many years and I was always given plenty of time to learn and try new things. I was never over pressured with work. Not saying it was not stressful and difficult at times, but it is normally more self imposed then forced. I could really work from home when I wanted, but I typically go into the office because I prefer it. Overall I enjoy working here."
good,Great opportunity to make a decent income if you have the appropriate skills. There are constantly making changes which can be frustrating at times but challenges their employees to grow.
good,"I just wish I could find a full time and permanent job like JPMorgan and chase because I really enjoy the work and environment but I can't do it anymore cause I had to get a full-time job that I don't like but I have to pay bills and I can't afford to work here and there, evrry few months isn't good for me. But I sure wish I could work there permanently full-time"
good,Working with JP Morgan Chase was a pretty good place to work. Management would always encourage growth and offer assistance. They also took pride on training to ensure every associate was equipped with doing their job the best to their ability.
good,"great bosses most of my time with bank one formerly jpmorgan. some flexibility. my pay was good during those years. keep in mind lay-offs, mergers acquisitions was heavy. overall, i had a very good experience and i enjoyed listening to jamie dimon speak. very knowledgeable and he will speak his mind."
good,"Working at Chase is great opportunity to grow and advance in the company.  The Company promotes moving and growing as a person.  If you're in an area and you want to grow, there are opportunities to flourish."
good,"A great place to work, build you career and grow with the firm. They are customer focused while caring for their employees servicing those customers. They offer personal and family support, educational opportunities, chances to succeed."
good,"I was blessed with a great manager and  co-workers that made the job a pleasure to serve."

good,"* proactive in creating a diverse and inclusive environment as well as engaging in cultural and community events. "
good,"I really enjoyed my time working at Jp Morgan on a number of team assignments. Mostly working on banking transactions, and AML work. I really enjoyed the team members there as there were a lot of smart people teaching me everything I needed to know."
good,"•	Government operations consultant in charge of analyzing a large dataset of operational security-related data across numerous Chase premises"
good,Solid reputable company that recognizes and does everything possible to accommodate work/life balance for their employees.  Company provides an excellent benefits package
good,"·	Implemented process improvements that ensured appropriate access controls are in place and performed as designed."
good,The environment of working in a small branch is that you always see familiar faces. The people and the staff are very welcoming and makes you want to continue to grow with the company.
good,Working in Technology at JPMC has been a rewarding experience but it is often difficult for people with business and non-technical skill sets to get promoted in technology.
good,The workspace at JPMorgan is pretty agressive with fast paced delivery. They are doing business in multiple LOBs and are always expecting the resources to be highly skilled in order to meet their customer requirements.
good,"Good place to work, worked with some great people.  Challenging work, great experience.  Decent work life balance at times.  Was able to work with people across the globe."
good,"I had some health issues that prevented me from continuing to work at JPMCh... but I enjoyed every day there! It was a very cooperative place to work and the Company seemed to want to take care of us so that we can carry the weight of company duties. Very flexible schedules and at least around Columbus, Ohio a plethora of locations. (They took over Bank One OH and AZ locations!) If given a choice I would go back to then any day!"
good,"I worked as a Technical Business Analyst on the YouInvest project here at Jpmorgan. The culture here is great, and senior managers really like to get involved with your career development and growth. It's very unfortunate that the company recently opened a new office in Plano, and a lot of the teams are making significant cuts in the tri-state area for budget allocation purposes."
good,Overall Chase provided me many opportunities for movement after being in a particular dept after 1 year. From there I moved to various positions until finalizing my career as an Executive Administrative Assistant for the past 12 years
good,Chase gave me the opportunity to grow not only on a personal level but on a professional one too. The have a customer focus focus that helps us cater to the needs of the clients. In regards to the employees benefits they provide a vast amount of training and job opportunities.
good,"JPMC is very good place to work ,"
good,"I worked there for a long time. Moving through the ranks of one department. It was a family environment until it wasn't."
good,"J.P. Morgan Is an excellent and leading Investment Banking Firm in the Industry. In what has been my short tenure there, I have found all the employees on my team to be extremely supportive and thorough in my training. The morale of all the employess I have met is extremely enthisiastic and positive."
good,"Unlike many other jobs I have been employed with, this employer allows you work work a year and after your year is up you have the opportunity to find a better fit or a change in pace or atmosphere across the line of businesses. A better and faster chance at getting promoted or moving latterly."
good,My experience at JPMorgan has been amazing throughout my tenure. It has a great working environment and extremely positive atmosphere. The work hours are flexible as well within the compliance department.
good,Corporate environment . New skills to learn. Peer group is strong. Multi faceted. Many new opportunities to learn new skills and use them. New opportunities
good,The teams are structured to work together and depend on each other as well as foster growth within teams and beyond. It makes for a great enviornment.
good,My overall review is that JPMorgan Chase is a good place to work.  You must be efficient with managing personal and business time as your work schedule and/or changes may effect this.
good,"Great Benefits, Back- Up Child Care Center at the Wiseman Location.  The phones are a secure jobs.  If you work hard you can advance.  Cafeteria onsite."
good,Good employer. Focused on its business culture and goals. Good benefits especially offered for employees to keep track of their health. Low base salary but good incentive pay.
good,"I was very sad when I was laid off . They have great benefits, the work is not hard and there are so many opportunities. I have tried going back a couple of times, but hard to get your foot back in the door."
good,It was a great job! We handled taxes. It’s a seasonal job so it was not a guaranteed. Anything that was bankruptcy was handed off to someone higher and they took care of that!
good,"The job itself was excellent. I worked on a small team that developed an SDK. Our team was mostly left to do our work with minimal corporate interference. My boss was relatively hands-off, allowing us to work almost autonomously. Although we did have some issues with corporate policies and the availability of tools getting in the way of our ability to work, it was always something we could eventually work past and get resolved. The people were always nice and easy to work with. If they hadn't closed down the facility, I would still be there."
good,"Pros"
good,I helped people with their bank accounts while providing excellent customer service. Deepening the relationship with the client allows them to full take advantage of all the products and services the bank offers.
good,Good work experience when we are in development (Scrum team) especially when it comes to production support little bit heavy work but knowledwise you can gain a lot.
good,"Good people, good culture. Sometimes the rules were a little wacky but then again you are dealing with peoples money. Ultimately great place to work and would reccomend to a friend."
good,"Team was great my manager was very knowledgeable about what we were trying to accomplish. Lots of training and learning. No real complaints except that being an SRE is hard, but I guess that’s more about the job rather than the company. My biggest gripe with Chase is the lack of job security. It was not often in the technology sector but you would hear about entire teams being let go because of a slow quarter income wise. Being an employee vs a contractor was like night and day. If you are coming in as a contractor through a 3rd party you could literally start work on Monday and be let go by Friday. "
good,Good company. Rather slow leadership. could be a little bit more streamlined. Could be better. Looking forward to future improvement in terms of leadership.
good,"JP Morgan as it a very old organization it is set in it's ways of work culture which can be quite rigid at times, However the work was highly productive"
good,"Chase is a great company to work for, the team and the leadership that i had over me , where fantastic, i regret leaving the company, would love to be back."

good,"Daily reconciliation of ATM activity at the Branches"
good,"good company to work for with benefits, good staff & management, lots of training and apt in adapting to changes and trends in the banking industry..."
good,Solid company to work for. Typical day 9-6 with an hour lunch. Work culture will vary by group and business unit but most management are willing to help.
good,"Overall, this is a good company to work for especially if you are in a front-office facing position.  Because of the size of the company there are more opportunities to advance your career in different directions than may be available in a smaller company."
good,JPMorgan Chase is an excellent company to learn the financial services business. I have enjoyed my 19 years with this company.  You are treated like a person.
good,"Had moved to Houston, TX and needed to find a job, I always gave my 100% effort, but honestly the job was not for me. Company and I ended on good terms"
good,"flexible work arrangements, work life balance, management friendly environment made it easy to work. Workplace culture is excellent with co-workers stepping in to help when needed."
good,"Overall, learnt my trade at JP Morgan at a very early stage of my career, allowing me to pick up transferable sought after skills in both roles. "
good,Working for JP Morgan Chase was a great experience and I learned so much. Working with the company was like working with family. I wouldn't change anything.
good,"I enjoyed working there, average salary with good commission. Good life balance. they are expanding everyday. great system and products. Good staff and management"

good,"Chase is a great company to work, Paid vacation 160 days of vacation after 5 years of service, sick pay, Holiday pay, Personal Days off. Medical, Dental, Vision Insurance, 401K."
good,One of the best place to start with your career. They provide very good exposure to everyone. The environment is very conducive to work. They provide lot of opportunities to grow.
good,Great place and miss it to this day.  Wish the best of luck to all employees that work there.  Great staff and support from upper management.  Can be overwhelming for newly hired.
good,Over all JPMorgan was a great company to work for. I worked for this company on and off for 20 plus years.  I have a greater working knowledge of mortgage banking from collections to management.
good,Chase is a great company to work for. Management genuinely cares about you and your advancement. The company makes everyone from every type of background feel welcome.
good,A fast-paced environment where attention is very necessary. Requires good customer service for both internal and external customers.  Updated breakrooms and eateries.
good,I learned how to multitask and office etiquette. The hardest part was balancing speed with accuracy but you definitely get the help that uyou need to be successful.
good,One of the best place I worked at.  People really care about their work. Management is flexible and is fair. I have been here for 5.5 years and would have never left if my job was not relocating.
good,"Loved working in this collaborative environment with seemingly like-minded peers, until my job site was abandoned as company chose to move entire operation to locale many, many miles further than I found feasible for commuting.  New locale was indeed possibly better for business purposes but would have placed hardship on my personal life. I had to resign."
good,Opportunities are endless if you apply yourself.  Amazing benefits package and work-life balance.  Learning opportunities are present to anyone to grow and enhance your career.
good,"Amazing place to work and grow in industry. Overall a very good company to increase your skill set and learn. Also, one can manage a vey good work life balance in JP Morgan Chase."
good,"I worked for the company for 44 years.  It went through 3 name changes and I continued to work there until my job went to India and most of the other accounting jobs left Columbus, Ohio.  I did not want to relocate to the state of Delaware."
good,"I started there in 2011 as a temp to help in the claims department. The work was a bit difficult, but once I got the hang of it, it was enjoyable. Most of the people I worked with were nice. The one thing I did not particularly like was the fact that the location I worked at closed down."
good,Great opportunity to enhance my customer services. Customer obsession is the goal here at chase knowing every need and meeting it . Going above and beyond to educate customers
good,"A typical day at work is checking emails, responding to your clients and engaging and daily meetings.  At times, the job can become stressful however the good out ways the bad. This job requires you to be detained oriented and very well organized. Overall, great place to work"
good,I am joined in 2015 in JP Morgan through jll as a Excutive Engineer good company and facilities are good the only thing is salary not good that's why I will chahe my job.
good,I loved JPMC it was great working there everyone there is friendly and caring. It’s also a pretty chill place as long as u got your work done. Another thing was there campus it’s such a nice setting. Overall everything was great there.
good,This a big corporation that values IT greatly but does not always pay the top dollar. I would recommend for your first or second job. Advancement opportunities are there for some people.
good,I worked at Chase for 10 years I loved coming to work everyday and I lived the people I worked with pot lucks every other month or so outside of work activities & I thoroughly enjoyed working there.
good,Handle calls and help customers with their banking issues. Learned how to help customers handle their money and walk them through online banking. Management was awesome. The culture was great. I enjoyed the management because they were there for you and wanted you to succeed.The hardest part of the job was walking customers through their online banking because we couldn't actually see exactly what they saw.
good,"The vacation time given is great.  Sick time on the other hand is a bit low.  Starting August 1st, you’ll earn 1 hour for every 30 hours worked, so roughly 8 days a year.  I love the people and that it is stress free here (compared to other places).  Medical, dental and vision, Plans are good.  The hours I work are from 3:15pm until 12:15am M-F.  They say I have to stay on this schedule for a year.  That part is not so good."
good,"Good place to work, nice people and great environment. Learn a lot with colleagues and managers. Lots of internal opportunities for mobility, including other countries."
good,Enjoyed working at Chase.  The Company was always working to provide training programs to help you move up in position. The management in the department I worked in was great.  They were always available and helpful.

good,"Great perks, adn great culture to promote mobility within the firm."
good,"A decent place to work with good work environment. Not micromanaged but relaxed atmosphere. The legal documents I reviewed were often quite detailed and attention had to paid to each detail to make sure facts were correct. In turn, those documents were then sent back to the law firms,state agencies or courts as needed."
good,"My last position was a very fun environment. My job task required minimal supervision. However there were not much of a work life balance. The company emphasized on the customer experience, so it was very important to treat their customers with respect."

good,When I worked at Chase I was a young teller. My experience was brand new. My time spent there was great but I realized there wasn't much room to grow there. I do however work very closely with the securities team of JP Morgan in NYC and I would be very interested in being able to work with the lending aspect of Chase.

good,"JPM offers a safe, employee driven culture. It really depends on the team, but they really put the effort to keep you happy."
good,I wasn't sure why after reading my job description Chase gave me the opportunity to work as a Loan Processor with three weeks paid training.  It was a great experience and I welcomed the opportunity.  I can tell working for Chase probably in a different area would be a great place to work.

good,I would have stayed in the company if my department did n't reallocate yo another state.  I advanced at this company tremendously.  Also enjoyed the working environment.

good,Great culture!   Was able to obtain a work life balance and I feel the compensation was fair for the job responsibilities. I was always proud to work for J P Morgan..
good,"It is a good place to work, good amount of training but in some cases not enough with new systems. Constantly changing following rules, regulations and market movements. I do not agree with upper management decisions when it comes to re-structuring human resources like shipping jobs overseas and leaving Americans jobless."
good,We were constantly busy trying to finish our work. The hardest part of working at Toronto based CHASE CARD SERVICE was that there was too much politics which was mind boggling and annoying at the same time

good,"Good company. "
good,"Benefits are excellent, the management was great, until they went to a turnaround time, in 2014 , management became hostile. I felt that they would not have any trust in the staff, and I personally was not able to defend myself. On the contrary they doubted me."

good,Chase offered classes to keep your skillset up to date. Lots of opportunity to express your ideas and help to enhance the products and working environment.
good,I was in Consumer Banking business line and doing analysis of integrating bank acquisitions with Chase's core infrastructure.  This work really opened my eyes to the down sides of applications that were heavily bespoke and thus challenges it presented for integration.
good,"I enjoyed working in a fast paced environment supporting maximum uptime performance for customers such as Navy cash, Easy Pass and the NASDAQ.  This company was a great fit for my career goals at the time."

good,Great work culture and various opportunities to grow. Good exposure to other cross impacts and products/BA's. Learning programmes to upscale skills.........
good,"During my time at JPMC, I served as a sales advisor, training assistant, account manager and retention specialist. The environment and role was positive through the education, training and experience in working with customers. However, the call center environment was less desirable. It was a temp position as I was preparing to relocate approximately 18 months into the role."
good,"Over 9+ years as a Business data Analysis, Project Management, Pre-Sales, Project coordinator managing various IT"
good,"I began as a teller when I was in school, promoted to loan department as auto underwriter, loan office, banking center manager.  I left because I relocated."

good,I enjoyed my brief time there but the office moved to Boston shortly after I started and I was unable to move due to family constraints. The benefits were very good.
good,"chase is recognized globally and provides a great opportunity at all levels."
good,Overall a good place to work.  Upper management was a bit challenging but direct supervisors were helpful.  Pay was decent.  They need to better recognize good hard workers.
good,I have enjoyed working at Chase.  It definitely is good to it's employees and customers alike.  I have been fortunate to have this opportunity.  This company has put me in a position to succeed wherever I end up.
good,Poor Management in place with values that did not align with the Chase values. This conflict caused me to go elsewhere since issues were reported and no action taken to resolve that specific managers poor ethic skills and lack of people management skills.
good,Manager were always their to help you do your best. Was able to learn many new jobs. Friendly co-workers and always willing to help you out. Training was a constant with the changes always happening in our call center. We were know for the great job we did.
good,"loved the people I worked with, however did not make enough money to live on my own. May if I were promoted to personal banker or higher. The again I loved who I worked with..."
good,"I processed reversals, stops, and reclaims for the ACH department.  I was a fast job with lots of work to do, but the boss was awful.  He did what he could to make everyone miserable."
good,I worked for Chase for 6 years. It was a great place to work but it was very stressful.  If you ever resign from Chase you can never work for this organization again.
good,I worked for JP Morgan Chase for a little over a year and a half. The work itself was usually rewarding and interesting. The culture is shifting though and many roles on the retail level are being phased out making g advancement difficult
good,"JP Morgan is a great place to work.  They offer advancement and are willing to support education to accomplish this. Pay is very fair and insurance is good. They do hire within when a position becomes available and there is some loyalty to their employees. Down side is that every few years they rearrange and jobs can become obsolete so you will have to transfer to another position or find one elsewhere. Overall, however the company is very desirable to work for."
good,I had the pleasure of working with great managers that really cared for my overall well being so I was quite pleased by the overall experience. However the company is changing the culture so that management has a way to fire employees if need be. It is a program that is used to monitor bankers to see how they do on a day to day basis.
good,"Wonderful workplace environment for me, great privilege to exercise new skills with a team of people of diverse and high-profile skill sets. Highly recommended environment for anyone looking to break into AML work."

good,JP Morgan Chase is a great place to work. Trained well and enjoyed the environment and the work culture.  Goals were attainable and revelent. Offered great benefits.
good,Chase was a fine place to work with a few issues.  People were promoted due to who they knew and not what they knew.  I was bypassed for promotion by someone I had hired due to the fact he was friends with the site manager.
good,"Every day we monitored and researched tranactions to identify suspicious activity in violation of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) USA Patriot Act, and other Anti-money Laundering (AML) regulations. Handled personal and confidential information while updating, analyzing and keying in data using Workstation application . I learned to be consistent, reliable, detailed in using the tools given to input information on all clients with the proper NACIS codes in the system."
good,This was a huge Fortune 500 company that was headed into the right direction.  This company used various technologies and it seemed like they were headed into the right direction as a competitve company.

good,My day at my job was a multi task based environment. We had to work in a Team setting. Not a high stressful position but we made sure we got the work completed at the end of the day. Sometimes I did feel like I was the supervisor because most of the employees would come to me for help and understanding which could be challenging. The work to me was not hard to do. I learned to be responsible and organized. I really enjoyed learning new job functions.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with my customers.  The least thing you talk about becomes a blessing. You give a blessing and you receive a blessing as well.

good,The department I worked in at JP Morgan Chase was extremely busy. We worked with different card types and talked to a variety of clients. Some days we were 300 deep in queue around the busy season.
good,Hard part of job was not meeting productivity requirements when systems ran slow and having to forfeit breaks to get caught up by the end of day. Work distribution was not balanced fairly between co workers. Favoritism was at play.
good,The company promotes diversity and inclusion with much focus on developing/ keeping top talent. Leaderships openness and willingness to also mind blowing.
good,This was a place where you had a lot of co worker and 90 percent of the was great. I would like to go back to job only if the pay have changed. It was fun my supervisor was excellent. Some of the people was friendly.

good,Great management team back in the 90's. Made sure you were going to succeed and room for advancement was open and available. The best teams were in the branches and everyone was family including the customers.
good,They put a lot of attention on the score card. but it is waited against the specialist. and if you want to change dept because its not a good fit to bad they make you jump through impossible hoops.
good,"A typical day at work was fast paced and enlightening. Salary is good and staff treated fairly. Some positions were phased out but overall a nice place to work,"

good,"This is a really nice place to work even being an intern. You get to see how hard people work, experience different events being held, and enjoy the culture of the people there."
good,IT is a well run firm from the top down.   NOthing bad to say about it.   Compensation seems to be lower than for other firms.   They assign a lot to their franchise value.
good,I learned alot working for this company. I enjoyed working for them. The work place was pleasant and most of the employees were very professional. The hardest part of the job was learning the different systems. The most enjoyable part of the job was the opportunity to bring my kids to work with me and have them at the daycare center.

good,Overall A great place to work. People and management is great Compensation is never what you expect and new job or responsibilities will not always come with more pay.
good,"A company where you can find friends as siblings, managers as parents, and other employees as close friends. It's like working 9 hours 5 days a week and not getting tired at the end of your shift. They listen to their employees and extend their help as much as they can. The only challenge was to make sure that you hit your goals every month and be consistent on it. Though the most exciting part was the incentives and bonuses. In this company i learned that it's better to have more feathers on your wings so you can fly high instead of rushing through things of getting promoted."
good,Enjoyed working at Chase as leadership was very receptive to ideas and work/life was well balanced.  People were always wanting to assist in everyday issues.

The other contractors tend not to share the full extent of their job fearing that if they give away the knowledge of their skill set, It will cost them the job."

good,"Working behind the scenes in an operational department was enjoyable due to the team atmosphere and strong work-life balance philosophy. Managers and supervisors allowed flexibility and support to individuals when possible and appropriate.

good,"My day entailed collecting payments on delinquent credit card account holders.  this was very difficult to get someone on the phone to begin."
good,"Although there could be decently strict rules around the office space, the managers often did not actively enforce the rules which allowed for more freedom when it came to electronic device usage."
good,It is hard to give a typical day since after training hardly any day was the same.  Management was great and very involved and there was a real team spirit.

good,Interned here in the summer and is a great place to learn and meet new people form different backgrounds.

The culture depends on the line of business. If one is a project manager, you are going to have a ton of meetings, however there is a large push to make those meetings as efficient as possible. The biggest downside is the compensation. Internal promotions are usually raised by 15-20% max, which still puts you under what an external hire would be making."

good,"Good people, and it was good work. It was a great band of people to work with, I had a great time there. They are big on work, life balance and care about you."
good,"When I started with Chase they put me in their training program and it was awesome.  After I got my branch a typical day would be starting with a morning huddle and set the plan for the day.  Go over yesterdays success, discuss who is coming in for appointments and figure out lunch schedules.  End of the day we debrief and balance and check to make sure everything was done for the day and make sure we call for next day appointments.  The most important part of the job is to provide excellent customer service and assist customers with their financial situations.  The most enjoyable part of my job was building relationships with customers and my team."
good,A typical day deposits and cash withdrawal and counting large quality money. Workplace is busy around first and 15 of the month. Hardest part of the job is trying to please everyone.

good,"A day at the banking center of waiting on customers, supervising staff, balancing cash vault and making sure security guidelines are followed. I learned how to service customers, lead my team, and run the operation of my banking center. The hardest part of the job was the bank changing it's name or being taken over by another company. The most enjoyable part was my staff and customer."
good,Working environment is wonderful and well managed top to bottom culture in the organisation. Hiring takes lot of time and the offer given is not as per your education it is as per there requirement.
good,"The company is great and there are some great people who work there. The work was pretty easy, doing data entry. Pretty straight forward work of ""type what you see"" and repeat it in a different box. Good pay and good benefits if you are a full time employee. You sat for 8 hours a day typing and got a couple smaller breaks during the day. Not much talking was allowed so it was a very quiet environment to work in."
good,"Very busy, a lot of researching.  Learned new policies and procedures. Management was family oriented. Proficiency and accuracy was important and knowledge of KYC / AML."
good,"Nice place to work with"
good,"Was in Management"
good,"Excellent benefits and compensation, but the job itself is draining. The building has an in-house cafeteria, game room, and health clinic. Chase is a typical call center job that you obtain for the money and maintain for the excellent benefits."
good,"Good reputation.   Fast paced, must be 'self starter' and independent worker to work in the finance team.  There are multiple avenues for mobility and the organization is a good place to build a solid foundation of skills and knowledge."
good,Working at Chase has afforded me invaluable experience in the financial industry and a strong company work ethic. Being able to help customers meet their financial goals and their appreciation for my work is the best reward.
good,"Productive and Fun Workplace, Frequently soft skill trainings to improve the skills."
good,"I have learn several new roles."
good,Loved working there. I believe they need to increase the pay for their employees. This job is very mentally consuming. You have to have a great customer service type of personality. Also they should have more team building exercises within the branches.
good,Chase is a good place to work as a teller while in college and to move up with the bank. The best part is being able to help customers financially and having a supportive company.
good,"It is a fun working environment,learned so much about being excellent at work, Caring management, diverse culture, hardest part is if we get to have a lot of calls in an hour.We also get to have incentives."
good,"What I love about working here is the accessibility to knowledge. The more you wish to explore the more the firm offers training courses, certifications, reading material to you. It makes its employee stronger to thrive in a changing environment. The open office culture helps one reach out to the senior management when required."
good,I learned a lot and has helped me be able to continue pursuing my ambition.  I really enjoyed my role within the company and enjoyed working together with my colleagues.

good,"Review loans, update customer info, work with loan closers to close refinance loans. Maintain communication with customers throughout process to keep them enlightened where the loan process is before loan closes."
good,"JP Morgan, Chase is a dream job for anyone wanting to work up the corporate ladder. The pay and benefits package is wonderful for anyone, really and probably offers more in the first year than many careers right out of college. Work as a debt collector is highly tedious but can be made meaningful if the focus is on customer service. Advancement from this career, onward, is very doable and the opportunities are many--if you want to work in anything credit card, commercial/consumer banking, and mortgage related."
good,"I had three different positions at JPM and learned many different skillsets, both operationally and client side. I really enjoyed the client service administration side and meeting wealthy families."

good,"Chase really was the place to grow with a company, help mothers with children daycare on site  help with college credit and a fitness room and  a resting area with television discount restaurant,"
good,"Chase was an excellent place to work. I've furthered my customer care experience with this position as a credit card specialist. Also just took in the overall call center experience as well. The customer's & employee's wasn't the hard part of the job. The hardest part of the job was to follow collections metrics. When ever a customer would hang up or I would get a transfer call that wasn't for my department it would be counted against me, but I continued with my daily duties putting customer's concerns & questions before myself  instead of my numbers. The most enjoyable part of the job was to have continued communication with customers."
good,Large bank with good teams of employees.  I would suggest one work hard in school and push themselves to apply for top companies including this one..  this is what I would suggest
good,"As a very large company, JPMC offers a tremendous variety of opportunities both in finance and technology. There is a big focus on internal mobility and career development. Overall, this has been a satisfying place to work, although bureaucracy can be high at times."
good,"I loved working at Chase. I really don't have any complaints. The only thing I would say is that some branches shouldn't have as many ATM's. A lot of the older customers don't understand how to use the machines even after helping them multiple times. Other than that, I would have loved to stay at Chase."
good,"Everyday is a challenge, well what do you  expect from a top notch company. But it's amazing how the higher management make it so easy for the employees to work."
good,A very well run company from the top down. The analyst position in the Private Bank was a challenging job which necessitated the development of important professional skills. While not always enjoyable - 80+ hour weeks - was an invaluable experience.
good,I was able to move quickly through the ranks and make a difference.  My thoughts and opinions were heard.  I had a great staff that made it a pleasure to come work every day.
good,"Great Company to work with where you develop as a person and professional "
good,"It was my first experience as a teller.  I enjoyed helping and getting to know most customers.  A typical day was transactions which included deposits, payments, withdrawals, cashier checks, possible opening or closing bank, working the drive through, daily balancing. Problem solving."

good,It is always good to work with the teams here. They are very helping and sportive.  Good team work and productive. There is a scope to learn many things in this firm.
good,Chase has been a terrific place to work and I've enjoyed my entire ten years there. It is important to always take time out and review opportunities. After a decade there I want to make sure were I am now I stay.
good,"JPMorgan Chase is a good company with better opportunities to move up if you show the determination and speak up about what you want from them. The benefits were amazing when I was there, 401k dollar for dollar match up to 5%, medical, dental, life insurance, and tuition assistance."
good,Very professional and good company to work for. Great benefits and pay. The company is very by the book due to all the laws and expects employees to be flexible.
good,"Benefits are great, but management needs work. Executives have been working on building the managers leadership skills through training, but I haven't seen any positive results yet. The culture has changed positively in the past 4-5 years and the effect on employee satisfaction has increased as a result. Overall, I like working there, but the bureaucracy is a pain."
good,"JPMorgan is great with work/life balance and the management makes a genuine effort in helping employees with their career development. The office culture isn't as bad as in NYC, but it could be more relaxed. Job security and vacation time are both great."
good,I enjoyed working at this company.  I learned a great deal and was under a great project manager.  I would definitely return to a project on any project with JP Morgan Chase
good,"•Managed operational functions within the branch including loss control, compliance, and customer retention and audit standards"
good,"I haven't worked for this company for a really long time, however when I did work there it was the most fun job I had. The people were great, as well as the environment, the only reason I left was because I needed more money."
good,Servicing partners and their staff with  ongoing information to do the task at hand. Doing it right the first time..Customers internal and external....Great experience.
good,"I worked as a teller, which involved learning a lot of regulations and processes, and interacting with a lot of people every day. The job itself was fairly straightforward and was usually interesting, but what made it great for me was how warm and friendly my co-workers were (especially my branch manager), and it was great to see from a leadership studies perspective how healthy the overall corporate culture was. If I wanted to stay in that company I know I could've advanced, taken on more responsibility, and done alright for myself, but it required time and a willingness to change branches that I didn't have since I'm seeking work in a different field."
good,It was a great company to work for. I love the people and environment. The work was a great learning experience. I learned a lot about Home Loan Mortgages.
good,Things change constantly including your income. Many things are added to your plate even when compensation is decreased. Management has little say in what goes on.
good,"Great place!  Nice people, good pay, work/life balance.  If I hadn't been laid off, I would still be there.  Good technology, good place for women, respectful, professional environment."
good,"Wonderful company to work for, with great benefits and compensation packages. staff are professionals with good attitude, management cares about the overall comfort of staff."
good,I like the job but do not like the hostile environment created by the Nurse Practitioner.  Taking care of the employees is very rewarding.  This is more of an urgent care position.
good,JPMorgan Chase is a global financial institution that invests in their employees (education assistance ; life event coaching). Compensation is competitive to the financial services industry.
good,Fast pace company with a lot to learn and benefits. I learned alot about the financial industry. The hardest part would be the first few weeks of training but they are very well with that. If you can make it past that you will be prepared for the job.
good,Great Company and great management. Very well diversified and offered many opportunities during my 23 years.  Interacted with so many professional and extremely competent individuals. The corporate climate was very organized and  courteous.
good,"Very fast paced and sometimes brutal work place, compensation is great and the discounts are even better. However, the downside comes with the turnaround that Chase has, layoffs and terminations are frequent as Chase moves people the moment their productivity dips."
good,A very professional atmosphere with a lot of talent and competition. Room to move up and establish excellent networking. The salaries and benefits are competitive as well.
good,Encouraging teams. All over the positive environment.  Good coordination between different teams and easy to learn new things from teammates. the only thing is they do not provide sponsorship else everything is good.
good,"It was a pleasant experience to work for JPMorganChase, but the Mortgage Servicing sector of the business is incredibly mundane. I would suggest working for the personal/business/investment banking side of the company."
good,Good place to work at . very good benefits even for part time. not long hours if part time but you are standing on your feet all day . Only down fall is that banks are the root of all evil.
good,"Typical day at work will have me focused on reviewing the work for the day, engage with stakeholders, identify known gaps, risks and derive solution to mitigate the issue/risk."
good,"all my co-works are great and friendly to work with, flex work schedule and able to work from home.  workload not to bad- enjoy working with different LOB groups."

good,Had a wonderful experience at JP Morgan building my career. A typical day would start out with a morning review call and move into the analysis we planned to deliver later in the day.
good,"Reviewed Fund’s compliance: 1940 and IRS. Escalated any compliance issue t manager for resolution."
good,"Chase is a great and fun environment to work in; I recommend it this job to people. I have learned some negotiating skills, adding on to my customer service skills, navigate through adobe, and multitasked with several web pages opened. Management, is inviting and treat you fairly. Hardest part of collections, is getting use to calling customers to ask for a payment and negotiate a payment arrangement. Most enjoyable part of working as a collector is helping out a customer that is going through a financial bind, and I help them with a payment program they can afford."
good,"We explore various tools and techniques on our every day job. "
good,"The firm has phenomenal resources and can deliver an excellent learning experience, especially if you are lucky enough to have a manager that is willing to mentor you."
good,Chase is a great place to work. It has flexibility and training classes to advance. Relationship with co-workers was enjoyable. It can be stressful during holidays.
good,"Answering phone all shift long"
good,"Located in downtown Brooklyn, easy place to commute to if you drive. Great food around the area for reasonable prices. The working environment and office spaces are newly renovated"
good,located in the main corporate office in midtown manhattan. It's a rather strict work environment where you have to be on your toes since you don't know which big wig is around the corner.
good,The downtown Brooklyn office was recently renovated and it's a great place to work in. The tree-lined park outside the buildings live streams US Open in the summer.
good,"I absolutely loved working here, however getting laid off one to many times is why I'm not any more. layoffs are very common due to fast changing financial portfolios. amazing benefits and incentives when i was working here! great referral bonuses too!"
good,Wonderful team environment that encourages collaboration and participation from everyone regardless of experience. Highly recommend people to work here.
good,Great place to learn and work on the best deals in the industry with some of the brightest individuals on wall street. Excellent place to start a career.
good,"It was a great company to work for, the compensation packages are great and the working hours too. "
good,JP Morgan Chase is a great place to work but being in a highly regulated industry there are a lot of rules to follow. A typical day involves reviewing product/business requirements with a diverse team of people.
good,"Good benefits and job training programs."
good,My job at Jp Morgan was stressful and came at a difficult time. It paid good money however and if given the oppurtunity I would appreciate a challenge similar to that one.
good,"Chase has a FANTASTIC training program to start new associates.  Every member of the Chase team I have met and/or worked with has been positive and knowledgeable.  I have learned a great deal about the banking industry and their skills assessments have expanded my knowledge of customer service, compliance, effective communication skills.  However, when looking to move beyond one's current role, It can be difficult to identify growth opportunities.  Also, day-to-day responsibilities for both myself and my superiors seem to hinder conversations to identify and target available positions.  Then, if such an opportunity should be found, getting the training to obtain them comes on VERY slowly with Chase, as with many large organizations.  "
good,i do not want to answer this question or complete this review. It is not important and choose not to leave a review. I think this part of applying for jobs on indedd should be eliminated
good,The workplace environment is a relaxed one if you are not in a call center. The have high standards to meet and don't compensate on the level that other companies do in the same roles.
good,I enjoyed working for this company. The administration and staff were  very helpful and supportive.  I enjoyed working by myself at my own pace while still meeting quotas and deadlines.
good,"Great work/life balance and good benefits and compensation.  However, hard to stand out in terms of accomplishment and slow promotion/growth.  Great maternity leave policy now."
good,"I enjoyed my time at JP Morgan Chase, This was my first introduction to management in the financial industry. I learned how to engage teams and leverage reporting to drive profitability."
good,Started my career not having any knowledge of trust.  Excellent training throughout the years which eventually lead to a promotion.  People I worked with were team players & the culture was invigorating.
good,"I've never worked a call center job before, but I quickly realized it wasn't for me."
good,Excellent company and gained much needed technical experience.  Was able to earn a decent salary while employed as a contractor.  Great work environment and team atmosphere.

good,Great place to start your career. Not very friendly for employees over 50. Benefits are comparable to other wall street firms. Internal mobility is well supported at all level of management.
good,"great company to work for but not a fan of the outsourcing they did as many of us were laid off in 2008 from that.  opening office in India took many jobs away from USA chase employees.  "
good,"The best part of the job is working with customers and resolving their issues. we as peers supporting each other. The hardest part of the job is not always able to resolve customer issue in a phone call, sometimes, there have to be follow ups, which is not a good experience for the customer."
good,This was a pleasant and inclusive work environment.  The company is innovative and has prided itself on being an industry leader.  It is diverse in its employees and products.  They cared about their customer and work hard at protecting their investments.
good,"I would start my day getting invoices for stop payment and input manual check request, post payments and verify and balance daily deposit, lookup Unidentified accounts and assisted in the mail room.

Because of this I have learned that in this kind of field, Time is very important.  When it comes to management they are good in providing us opportunity for our career growth.  But what I really like in this job is that the company recognize all the the well done job and gives us more than what we expected."
good,"The amount of vacation days, holidays, sick time, and personal time that Chase offers is hard to rival in the industry.   This flexibility is paramount when attempting any semblance of work/life balance.  I couldn't recommend it more."
good,"See below"
good,"You will learn professionalism. Good learning exposure, opportunities to fly abroad."
good,Should be able to accept change. Will get lot of things to learn every day. Floor Managers will be next to you as and when required.
good,"Good Place"
good,"Nothing to special about working at a bank, so the days can become mundane. There is a large push towards the advancing technology, and with that there is a lot of push back from the clients. ""This ATM is going to take your job!"", ""...but I like people"", ""Can't you just do it?"" are some of the day to day sayings heard by clients. Definitely a great company to advance quickly in though. Many opportunities whether you want to go down the path of management or sales."
good,I would still be their today if it was not for the workforce reduction. They are committed to being wholly focused on helping their clients achieve increased wealth through a myriad of new programs and ideas.

good,great company to work for. lots of room for advancement. jp morgan chase offers lots of training and further education programs.
good,The bank was great in the beginning. There was movement within the bank If you wanted to transfer. But years went by and jobs were eliminated and set to different states. Coworkers were great.

good,"Working with JPMorgan Chase & Co is the best. I have a learned a lot positively. Working from the staff up to the higher management level is great. In terms of culture, all good."
good,Pay wasn't that great and to many changes were happening. The customers hated the new EATMs and we had a lot of customer complaints because the lines were long. Only one teller would be behind the counter because they wanted the customers to use the EATMs.
good,Learned a lot here in many different areas.  Many opportunities to learn a variety of skills and career planning.  Several opportunities for relocation all across the world.
good,"A typical day at work includes navigating systems and assisting customers through inbound and outbound calls with collecting payments and addressing any questions or concerns they may have.  Since taking on a roll of a collections agent, I have learned to empathize with customers and give assistance in any way to help show we (the company) cares and will lend a helping hand in hard times.  Showing empathy and support of the customer can help building lasting relationship with customers.  The hardest part of the job is when there is no other options available to help a customer to stay out of and avoid foreclosure.  On the other hand, the most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you are able to impact customer's lives by reaching out and offering assistance to help get them back on track and keep their home if possible."

Whenever there was a children's function to attend or a parent that had to be looked after in the hospital or any personal issue, management always understood and offered absolutely any assistance possible. It was very touching. I was proud of JPM Chase for that. You felt they truly cared about you on a personal level. Dealing with the high value clients presented its own set of challenges as you knew any deal you were involved in could have far reaching ramifications if not executed properly, but I loved the challenges and loved ending the day with all issues resolved and your relationships letting you know you did a great job on their behalf. I will always remember that professionalism is of the utmost importance at all times. No matter the situation, maintain that professional demeanor. I remember instances when senior managers would deliver an envelope like a messenger if need be in order to satisfy the relationship (Nothing was beneath them) and that made me work twice as hard in order to be that selfless and determined to offer the best customer service I possibly can. There was never a request that was too small. I feel I represented JPMChase well and thank them for my time there."

Over the next 23 years, I worked in many areas of the bank as opportunities arose.

Maybe that had to be with the great supporting team that I had. My supervisor was very helpful each time I need help. Unfortunately, our calling center was closed and I was not able to transfer to the new calling center in Elgin because I was going to school"
good,"A company that constantly tries to update it's internal processes to ensure that all employees provide a smooth, seamless, first class client experience."
good,The organization has so many opportunities to help to explore and grow in your career. Strongly suggest that you stay involved in all the D&I events that happen within the firm and work with a mentor/sponsor that can advocate for your next career move at the firm then opportunities are endless.
good,You can not make mistakes when dealing with money. You have be pay close attention to all checks and cash. Have to make sure each number is correct and make sure you don't accept any counterfeits.
good,"Chase is a good company for benefits. Pay is okay, could be better. Most managers are nice and helpful. Sales were taken away from associate bankers so doing the extra work for referrals just gets overlooked now for that position. There are so many locations so if needed being transferred is an option."
good,"This is a great place to work, the benefits are good, and there is a great culture. The only downside is related to layoffs, which is due to the economy. Other than that, this is a great place to make a career."

Because of this, there were some days I HAD to stay home to take care of the baby due to her being sick, trips to the ER, etc. I was laid off due to using all my entitlements and taking days off where I was forced to take care of my child."
good,"this is a phone base job, customer service skills are a must, as well as staying calm, focused and being able to multi task on multiple screens and systems to assist your customers."

good,"Work culture was pleasant -- especially for such a large company. Lots of emphasis on hierarchy, titles, office space etc. Lots of mandatory training, which for the most part was a waste of time for most employees...some of it good."
good,"The best part of working within my department at Chase was the diversity of people with different experience, background, and education from which to draw as a resource.  I felt the team was diverse enough to learn from and consider out of the box ideas to resolve the daily issues that we faced. It was a very collaborative group and I always felt comfortable asking questions."

good,Very fast paced with quick turnaround. Goal oriented with a strong learning environment. Very diverse and inclusive culture with a focus on careers. Good place for veterans.
good,"Everyone is so helpful, they answer any questions I may have. They've also explained certain ways of doing things to kind of give me a good idea of how to go about it. A typical day for me varies on what my role for the day is. I'll either be a greeter or a teller depending on where I'm assigned to on that day. On the teller side, I process transactions, make referrals, and do some light account reviews for some clients who may have a simple question or 2 about their most recent account activity. On the greeting side, I welcome customers to the branch, take their names, provide a welcoming environment, maintain the lobby, schedule appointments, and notify the reps if their appointment has arrived. I also assist customers in the lobby with simple things such as: ATM transactions, app password resets, ordering new cards via the app, and educate customers with the technology provided to make their banking easier. The hardest part would have to be the wait times, clients will wait a long time to do certain things that I wish I could assist them with but my resources are restricted. The most enjoyable part is being that person who resolves the issues they had & being able to educate the customers into using the ATMs or online banking so they would save a trip to the bank for the next time."
good,currently working there part time while attending school. The company is very undestandable and flexible. Great place to work at when in school or looking for great opportunities.

good,"The account manager was great, the staff was great if I needed anything. I enjoyed my co-workers. The management at the client site unfortunately changed. However this is typical of a large financial insitution"
good,"JPMC has over 2.6 trillion dollars in assets.  The company invests a great deal of resources and time into ensuring its employees are comfortable at work, can improve processes, and have the tools needed to succeed."
good,JP Morgan is a great company to work for.  The people are what make the job worthwhile. Sometimes it seems as if work goes unrecognized so you have to make it a point to present management your own personal accomplishment rather than them bringing it up to you.
good,"Management is approachable and friendly."
good,"Dealing with high demand clientele, providing effective customer service. Management is good, very professional setting. The hardest part of my job is communicating efficiently with upset customers."

good,"As an employee, you really can't complain about anything at JPMC Mumbai."
good,"great company to work for if you are interested in developing in the financial world. lots of areas to branch out, but high intensity and lots of competition"
good,I wish I was still there. Best job I ever had in my life! I wish that they didn't close the office that I was working from. It did happen during the real estate bubble though.
good,"JP Morgan gave me the confidence to work further. As a college recruit, everything was new to me. "
good,It's a great company to work for. A lot of focus is placed on diversity and inclusion. Culture Council creates meaningful and fun events. Health and wellness are promoted and encouraged.
good,"If you just recently graduated from college with your sociology or international politics degree and just realized you're not going to go work for the state department or just plain don't know what you want to do with your life (like me), then I would highly recommend getting a job at Chase. This is not directed as a sarcastic dig at Chase at all. I'm being serious. I wish I would have started my career with them earlier. The organization runs smoothly, and they make an effort to stay ahead of the curve, or at least with the times. If you are college educated and have a strong work ethic, there are ample opportunities for advancement. You will most likely have to start out low on the totem pole doing some type of work on the phones...I know what you're thinking: ""I didn't go to college to work in a call center"" I told myself that for years and got duped into working ""sales jobs"" that sounded fancy and advertised high earning potential...don't be like me...Start a career somewhere and hang on for dear life. You may be overqualified...you may face resentment from some of your peers for having a degree...just keep your head down, be the best, and apply for a higher level position whenever possible. It is frustrating to see some of the young kids who get internships with JP Morgan making more than you with no job experience...but those jobs are very few and far between. Besides...you can absolutely use your experience in the trenches to your advantage. The culture varies depending on which department you work in...but in general, I have found morale to be good, and there is an emphasis"
good,"1.very busy and steady work flow"
good,"Loved my time at Chase and would love to return one day. Amazing coworkers, fantastic trainers, supportive and encouraging environment. The path for advancement was shown early and you are given all tools necessary to maintain consistent progress."
good,"The Private Client Banker role is a good position for people who want a steady work life and are content in the 60-110k salary range.  Other than having a perfect branch set up with bankers working beneath you 80k in total salary seems to be the ceiling.  Other than moving into an Advisor role, there is nearly no opportunity for advancement, as a Branch Manager role would likely result in a pay cut."
good,Chase is a good company to work for. Your day and shift depends on the department your work . There are shifts from 8 to 5 Mon-Fri or 3 to 12 midnight Tue-Sat. They have a professional work environment and methods to move up in the company. The hardest thing as an employee is the salary part of it. If you are a long time employee the salary is not as competitive as the people that are being hired now a days. In the other hand you have great benefits.
good,opening accounts and meeting with multiple clients throughout the day. I learned basic compliance needs to secure bankings resources and the management was very hands on and micro managing.
good,"JPMorgan is a great place to work, where hard work and self improvement can lead to promotion. it is a meritocracy, that has clearly defined procedures for promotion, where it is up to the individual to define their career."
good,"I had a great boss and enjoyed my team.  I was given a line of business to control test and got along great with the LOB.  I was able to work from home if I had to which ensured a great home/life balance.  "
good,Good Work Culture.Hard working required in order to cope up with daily batch processing for world-wide bank transactions.Good business knowledge gained.
good,Good please to work if you are looking for a quite and relaxed work environment. The job is very repetitive. you will be looking at a computer your entire shift except on breaks
good,"I've learned how to communicate well with customers and find ways to help them solve their issues by offering various options to avoid  issues in the future,if can't solve their issues myself i'll escalate to my manager or upper management.I enjoyed working there because our managers tried their best to accomodate everybody's request ,all employees respect each other whatever culture you have."
good,Working here is great but they way banks are going theres hardly going to be people in branches anymore. Banker are constantly being used as tellers and adopters.
good,"For someone that is looking for very good benefits, this is the place to be. Is the job stressful? What job isn't but in the end it is well worth it especially those that have family to take care of."
good,"Launched their group banking products, for employees free accounts and for employers it increased their direct deposit participation. "
good,"I learnt a lot from working in this organisation and always felt that my hard work was recognised and appreciated."

good,"Pros: Good Benefits, Decent Pay, Employee Appreciation. Great Health and Wellness package. "
good,"Worked here for a little over a year as a temp. The pay is good and I like my co-workers, if you can and will do the work it's a great find. The only trouble is getting on permanent status. The openings tend to be few and there is a little bit of favoritism. If you can play the role and know how to network, you'll fit in. Other than that, if you can get on as a temp, keep your head down and it's a steady job."
good,"As a JP Morgan Chase Notary, my job consisted of notarizing Mortgage documents that were bought from other mortgage companies. The docs were changed to Chase and verified by the Chase employees. I would notarize their signature after they verified that the document was in compliance. I worked the graveyard shift and I sometimes came early to help notarize documents on the evening shift."
good,"My team of 12 was displaced when Chase decided that the return mail could be processed in the state of Delaware instead of Ohio. I liked working there. Wished I could have got another job there, I was there almost 22 yrs."
good,"fast-paced, productive, rewarding department to work in.  Had a lot of fun while getting the job at hand completed.  Close group of team mates.  We still stay in contact after leaving 9 years ago."
good,It was a great experience working for the back I have learnt a lot about the corporate culture and financial industry that will remain with me forever.
good,Management was very personable / Raises not that great.. lots of changes / paid holidays / great cafeteria. diverse environment/ great people to work with
good,"Great benefits, great culture, the hardest part of the job is insecurity of the job. It all depends of economy status on the market. If economy and interest rates are good , job is secure."
good,"I liked it overall. There are some interesting characters that become managers and super visors. Sometimes a stressful environment due to customers and handling lots of policy questions. If you are unsure of your cash handling, maybe not the best place for you."
good,Consistently busy with answering calls. Plenty of opportunity to advance and increase knowledge on different products that are offered. Great management teams in every department.  You get to work with great people.
good,"Very good healthcare benefits, vision and dental benefits,also 401k,"
good,You get to socialize with different types of people and offer financial advice. If you like interacting with people and dealing with money this is a good field.
good,"I have slowly advanced from an administrative assistant in a secretarial pool to a senior executive assistant.  Administrative assistant pool is less ideal as there can be a tendency for petty/trivial people. If one works in the corporate sector, things are much more balanced."
good,"Good benefits and paid vacation even if you are part-time."
good,Best thing about JP Morgan is it's work culture. People at JP Morgan are really professional and maintain its work culture. There are various training available to you for various things being personality management to emotional intelligence.
good,"Great company to work for in many aspects, they have great benefits and gives you the chance to meet a variety of people on a daily basis. I believe the company weakness is in the management because not all of the management are hiring people for the right reasons. The company should really take a serious look into improving on the ethnics side. Some of the best people and employees that you will ever meet in life are sitting inside the branches because the upper management are not really looking to improve in every aspect like they should and people are getting hired in positions for the wrong reasons."
good,Great company to work and first full time job with great balance between job and live. I had the opportunity to establish direct exposure to multiple teams which has helped me to improve my interpersonal skills and gain further knowledge through our interactions.
good,"phone calls all day. breaks and fexibile schedule.   dealing with customers.  the hardest part if the job is dealing with irate customers."
good,"A typical day at work will be reaching out to client  and regrading products and services offer by the company , set appointment to go over the benefits of the products and services recommend based on client needs while keeping customer satisfaction at priority."
good,"This company is always growing and expanding, which provides reasonable job security. They are very committed to developing their employees and retaining talent.Great benefits package. Great employee perks and discounts."
good,Great company to work for. Gave me opportunities for advancement. Continual education helped ensure that you were compliant with companies core values.
good,Excellent benefits with a good workplace culture . Diverse group of people of  different back grounds. They engage in outside activities and helping in the community.
good,"Good place to work.Has a learning and development programs. "
good,"JPMC has worked very hard over the last few years to improve the company culture, and it is very clear that there have been significant enhancements, especially in terms of encouraging inclusivity and reducing bias. However, JPMC would benefit from focusing more on developing existing talent, especially management skills; although there is a lot of internal mobility and opportunities for existing employees to stretch into a vacant management role, it is common to see JPMC hire externally to replace a manager. On a related note, JPMC typically identifies strong individual performers as candidates for promotion, and while these individuals may have outstanding technical knowledge and expertise, that does not necessarily translate to the skills needed to be a great manager."
good,"The professionalism was lack luster and Assurant Duluth, GA. This is typical of the south. Sometimes I wondered why these people were hired, or still have jobs. No one wanted to step up to the plate. and learn."
good,I would recommend Chase because it is a good stepping stone for the hard worker and determined person. A person has to be able to adapt to change quickly.
good,"Executed customer transactions, including deposits, withdrawals, money orders, and checks.•Sold cashier’s checks, traveler’s checks, and money orders."
good,I had some very good managers and interesting and varied work. Unfortunately they closed the facility where I worked and declined to go to Florida or Chicago.
good,"Working at Chase as a teller was fun.  You get to meet great people and work with them as well.  It is a fast paced environment but if you can handle that, you will succeed.  Management was the only downside.  Since it's such a large company, it's not very personal when it comes to management.  If the company has a problem with you, like they did me, they will send a corporate manager into the branch to either coach you or try to push you out; instead of your current manager doing that."
good,"I enjoyed working there, the people were the best part of job."
good,"*Typical day was answering inbound calls, and resolving customer issues."
good,"Chase is a great company.  Really.  The benefits are great and pay is not bad at all from entry-level positions.  There is plenty of sideways and upward movement options internally and training.  The Fraud division's only flaw is dealing with customers and bankers.  Both will have you pulling your hair within a month and the division has a high turn over rate because of it."
good,No comments or input to provide regarding working for this company. Nothing to relay regarding a typical day at work. Nothing to relay about management.
good,Management truely cares about you and what you want to achieve out of the job and life. Very supportive of personal issues or family needs. Work load can be light sometimes and seem repetitive but management is open to new ideas and new work loads. Management trusts what you feel is the best solution.
good,was very satisfactory. the management was understanding and  reasonable. the work was not demanding and the customers were very understanding. they did have a lot of respect for me.
good,A good company to work for. Benefits are very good and so was security of the building. I was in the call center for Bankers help with different solutions and Policy and Procedure questions.
good,Normal Corporate work environment. Good Managers and overall friendly people. Lots of team builders and events. Opportunity for growth is limited but all depends on what dept.
good,"Team members of the support team are willing help and share with each other their knowledge and experience. Global team is located in several countries and keeps in close contact with each other. Flexibility to work remotely from home when needed (weather conditions, sickness, etc.)"
good,"A typical day at chase starts with morning huddle. Reviewing you emails ans your to-do list. Helping customers form the lobby as needed , taking phone calls, cross selling products, working with partners, helping teller line as needed. It is fast paced and there is never free time. I enjoy helping customers the most, the satisfaction that you get from making someones financial dream possible is amazing. The hardest part for me the long hours of sometimes non stop helping a customer at your desk, at the teller line at the same time and also answering busy phone lines."
good,"I worked in the loan closing division and the environment was bright, lively and competitive. There was a real team atmosphere that was infectious from day one. The competition for closings was friendly but fierce. Bonuses were great. A nice bunch of folks to work with."
good,i worked for the firm for 10 years and learned new software to develop with and new parts of the business. on the typical day i would review requirements for projects i was assigned and develop multiple dashboard and suport them for business users
good,Chase has some excellent benefits for retirement and health.  There is not a lot of mobility opportunity outside of call center jobs unless you want to move to another state.
good,Great company.  Has vision and moving in the right direction.  Great benefits and technology.  Upgraded work facilities.   Currently driving to attract diverse workforce.
good,"J. P Morgan chase is a good place to work out for interns, because it helps you see the business sides of things. I learned more about excel and using word."
good,"The people and the work are fun. The work can sometimes be a little stressful but that's work. Management is amazing for the most part. Compensation is based on production, so that's up to your work."
good,Great place to work. Great Maternity benefits. Management is very supportive in helping you meet your goals. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to work with smart and professional people everyday.
good,"Balancing teller drawer, counting money, sending referrals. Learning the operations part of the banking industry. Processing cashier checks and money orders."
good,"Great place to work, but I have experienced layoffs. I have been employed with this company several times over the years. I enjoy the environment and the people that In worked with. I would enjoy going back and continuing employment with this company"
good,"I loved beibg at Chase but it is not easy to move up there. It's your typical call center setting though I'd say it was better than the average one. If you start off in Customer Service, it's going to be hard to move to a different department within the first TWO years of your employment."
good,I am into client servicing since past 1 year and the active title in JP Morgan is Legal Analyst. The role revolves majorly around client servicing and supporting all the legal entities globally (JP Morgan LE's)
good,Morning go over file from the previous day just in case if underwriters need additional docs.
good,Fast paced and challenging. Management is often times changing roles. Compensation and benefits are above industry standards. Would recommend for someone looking to advance in their career.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the day is when management would take walks on the trail in the morning to prepare the team for the day. Taking walks around our walking trail on site was definitely therapeutic.  "
good,"Great benefits, evening shift and fun environment. Several different departments to work in or move to, Management wants to see you succeed and move up in the company."
good,"Very good company to work, paid holidays, good team member always helpful and support in all the way and even the manager, very good salary, free lunch on Fridays,"
good,"Great place to work, great managers, good teams. Columbus Polaris has nice restaurants nearby. I learned about banking systems, how banks operate, etc."
good,Great company with good benefits that fosters a collaborative work environment. They support work/life balance. Senior management is transparent and supportive.
good,A very collaborative and fast-paced work environment. The associates are extremely kind and friendly. There are many learning programs offered both online and in-person.
good,Great environment but not enough room for growth in my dept and not enough pay to keep me there. Really enjoyed the managers that I had. Inspired me to keep working hard and to follow and chase my goals. I learned everyday I worked and am very happy to have worked at JPM.
good,"Honestly a typical day is quite relaxed depending on how busy a branch is. I have learned a lot of discipline and people oriented skills working with all kinds of people. Management is pretty decent , I have had about 4 managers in a 3 year time span and all have been quite understanding, personable and looked out for their employees when needed. The workplace culture is awesome! Everyone I have at least came across were generally decent coworkers. It is nice to come to work and not feel tension walking in the door! The hardest part of the job would have to be the controls side which is basically avoiding fraud and making sure to protect customers information to the best of your ability. In general it's nice to feel appreciation from your manager and customers ! As well as have amazing benefits/discounts ! Chase isn't so bad after all haha! As long as you do what you are supposed to do and have integrity along with people skills, you will go far ( promotions)! Hope this helps someone!"
good,I worked here and would like to thank JPMC for such a wonderful work culture along with the skill set that I gained through the meticulous training...
good,Chase is a good place to be apart of with great benefits and decent pay. Climbing the ladder is challenging as your glass ceiling really depends what department you are in along with the skills you have.
good,I spent my day on the phone assisting customers with credit card questions. I learned all you'd ever need to know about credit cards. Management changed often. Friendly work culture. The hardest part was angry customers. Friendly people and benefits.
good,"JPMorgan Chase moves very fast, but it is a great place to work. Our CEO is 2nd to NONE.  Great opportunity to move about the organization and work in the Wholesale side, and then Consumer, and Asset and Wealth Mangement. There is a real upside to have some many different LOBs that one person can experience."
good,Good Company to work for. Room for advancement.  I have seen several employees get promoted or move to other departments laterally. The culture is wonderful.  Very relaxed. You are not micromanaged.
good,Mentoring and coaching are a high priority at JPMorgan Chase.  Events and local groups provide a good start to launching your career and providing mobility opportunities.
good,"Collecting on late stage accounts that was 10 days or more pass due, home loan, car loan and business loans. Great incentives, overtime, contest. great location.  Meeting your quota"
good,"Really enjoyed working here. Of course, with any large company, it all depends on your group: its team lead and the work colleagues."
good,"Learned a lot about the banking sector. Company is great at service delivery and work is based on a set of uncompromising values. Learned the following:"
good,Systems are pretty advanced with makes day to day very easy.  Easy to open accounts a look clients information up.  Makes customer service easier and sales
good,"I do not have a job review summary to be mentioned at this time. There were a lot of changes going on all the time with policy & procedures, and changing to a new team and supervisor every 30-60 days."
good,"It was a very deadline driven job that required fast paced work in order to meet deadlines on time, excellent management and co workers and everyone worked together well"
good,"Fun place to work. Got to learn about derivatives work. New concept, different from traditional banking. New western culture of open cubicles, where everyone is treated as one."
good,"Working as a Teller taught me a lot about banking and finances. It also taught me patience and how to be detailed."
good,"Great compensation, not a lot of opportunities for advancement. The culture was fast paced as usual for the banking industry. As an intern part of my duty included financial reporting and modeling along with excel."
good,We had to multi-task as we received several different reports that were urgent so we had to work the most urgent first and prioritize the rest of the day based of urgency.
good,good company to work for.. excellent benefits and very good management. would recommend to friends if any were currently looking for work fun friendly environment.
good,"When you work for you Chase you sort of hate it, but once you leave you realize everything you just gave up. Sure they don't pay well but they give you almost 5 weeks of time off which includes sick days. They have the cheapest insurance options out there. They have a pension, plus put money into a health savings account. I wish I hadn't left as it's hard to get back in :-( but if you get in, suck it up on the money you make because the grass is not greener elsewhere."
good,I had 8 plus wonderful years at Chase. Training was great and very informational.  Good place to work and grow in the work place.  Not much room for growth.
good,"Overall, the company provided a good environment to work in. Management always available to assist, and great working hours.  List of current customers made it easy to get started, and eventually attain new clients."
good,it was a small branch and only three other tellers that worked two at a time and then management team really dedicate the time to get to know the employees and connect with them. we became a small family that communicated and got along very nicely.
good,"Easy going company fast pace, work structure strict call adherence goals and handle times fun environment.................................................."
good,"Awesome benefits - Can be stressful depending upon the LOB you are working in.  Salary increases are annual, and there is plenty of paid time off.  Lots of room to transfer to other areas and learn about the different LOB's in the banking arena."
good,"Working at Chase was a great experience and on other side it was stressful too, due to the fact that the department have to meet deadlines and being a collector was a very tough thing to do."
good,"Great resources provided, very competitive sales culture. If you love sales and can maintain your pace while being consistent in the sales process, you are sure to succeed. A great company to work for."
good,"Branch operations is one of the main duties of an Assistant Branch Manager as well as sales (for in-store branches). As a teller or personal banker, your job is to provider top notch customer service and to also recommend products they don't currently have. You're expected to at least ask customers if they're interested in products they've been pre-approved for or you think they'd benefit from. You would sometimes get pressured by the manager to up-sell customers or would be ""talked to"" if you didn't attempt to. The bonuses you received for referring a customer to a banker who opened new products for them were nice. Most enjoyable part was getting to know your clients and making personable interactions with everyone."
good,"Chase is one of those businesses where you have to know someone who knows someone in order to move up effectively. You have some good managers and some bad managers. They are good at showing employees appreciation and trying to make the work place fun. You can meet a lot of people. Sometimes you can go above and beyond and just be the best employee that you and be and in some situations, that is just not enough. Chase can so better when it comes to their employees and the ability to teach and help your current employees move up in the business. Chase would rather hire people from out side instead of training the people that was faithful to the company and are willing to learn more and become a valuable asset to the company."
good,"The work/life balance at JPM has been fantastic. However, the internal movement and advancement is limited and if you make an internal move or advance towards a new position then it will take place at the same salary and job level. People are very friendly and they strive to make you comfortable and happy."
good,"Interact with customers to situate their needs while adhering to company policies and guidelines. Call center environment, team based friendly environment with fellow associates so assist with any given situation."
good,"I loved this job, but they did a mass layoff & if not willing to transfer to another state...faced a layoff...very disappointing after many years of service."
good,Great place to start a career with plenty of opportunity for advancement and mobility.  Excellent benefits and training wit a focus on teamwork and customer service excellence.
good,"Workplace culture is great"
good,Supportive culture with a strong management team and lots of advancement opportunities. I learned a lot about selling the benefits of paying one's bills on time and how to help people struggling financially. My call center position was entirely based around phone call interactions with customers.
good,I would have liked to see more of an increase at year end or motivational bonuses throughout the year based on skill levels obtained. I disagreed with the basis of measuring quality analysts the same across the board as different investors have different guidelines and some analyst reviewed more difficult specialty loans which were more time consuming for an accurate review.
good,"It is very difficult to get a job at Chase.  I keep trying.  They do provide great benefits and pay well.  Keep to yourself and do your work, and you'll be okay."
good,Great opportunity for someone with school aged kids as the bank correlates with the majority of the school holidays. My schdedule was flexible and our assistant manager was wonderful.
good,"If you want to work for a company that takes good care of its employees as well as gives employees the resources to succeed, JP Morgan Chase is an ideal company. The company is one where you can find opportunities across the country that will allow for you to grow."
good,This is a great company to work for. They have a lot of opportunities to move around and to move up. I would work for this company again hopefully in the future.
good,"Chase is a pretty laid back place, everyone is relaxed and helpful with helping advance or just understand. There is constant change in Collections dept, but open door policy is very much available."
good,The pay is just awful and not competitive whatsoever. I would advise management to pay people fair instead of a base and then 50 % incentives.  This will just discourage great employees.
good,JPMorgan Chase is meeting the challenges that are occurring daily in the banking industry with active decision making and client/community engagement.
good,"Nice place to work, high work ethic, career opportunities, friendly atmosphere,  passion for efficiency, excellent training staff, emphasis on employees, good place to work, competitive salary requirements, easily identifiable opportunities,"
good,"The company is a very nice to work for. I like the fact that they offer pensions, which I know a lot of companies are steering away from. The company is all bout their workers but in the same breathe all the clients also. Very good at balance that."
good,"If you have ever worked for Kelly Services, you would understand why they have been in business for so long as a  contract employment agency.  They try to accommodate your preferences for work, and  they are almost certain to contact to you if the work type is available.  They also give you work experiences with great companies such as Chase Bank, Anthem, colleges and independent or small business employers as well.  They also have a training center where you receive free training in employment skills."
good,"Chase went through many changes while I worked there in relations to mergers and acquisitions. It was during the time of the collapse of the sub-prime mortgage market. That was like a huge boom!! "
good,"Whatever your position is with the company, you are guaranteed to learn a wide variety of skills. The benefits are also fantastic, everyone gets insurance and paid time off"
good,Both the training and environment were fun and healthy and room to grow if you applied yourself. Company does care about you - learning is a big step to be successful.
good,Great benefits with opportunities for advancement as long as you are meeting certain goals set by company.  This is a huge company and it does feel like that.  May not be as flexible in certain situations.  Raises are based on managers opinion of you more than performance.  The job structure and pay structure is not very clear.
good,"They are a fair company and the are flexible to the work life balance. They have good managers, a good benefits package, they treat employees according to their specific situations. They environment is good, they provide equal opportunity to each employee. They invest time in mentoring you if this is what you are looking to do."
good,"Although the salaries and bonuses may not be as high as you'd like them to be, the company itself is absolutely great. Work life, sales goals are realistic and achievable, true team environment, greatest place to work. Should never have left."
good,Pay and Benefits were great and overall atmosphere was good for employees. Made too many changes at the in the controls area and took away key support.
good,excellent place to work. great benefit. you will learn a lot. work environment is very busy and you stay on your feet all day. you barely get breaks t
good,"The best part of working for Chase is the job stability in a volatile environment and the potential to earn a Bonus in additional to a Salary.  "
good,"One Amazing company to work at, the management is brilliant and transparent, the kind of organisation who looks after their employees and believes in the theory everyone must be treated equally."
good,The best company I've ever worked for. Pay and benefits were great! There are lots of chances to move up in the company and/or cross train in other departments or roles. I would love to work with them again.
good,"JP Morgan Chase is a large company with plenty of opportunity to advance especially if you're located in a corporate hub site like New York, Chicago, Dallas, or Phoenix."
good,Lot to learn as employees will get opportunity to learn while contributing to production. Management provides proper guidence and hence good carrer enhancement.
good,Great work environment with excellent benefits. Flexible work schedules. Promotes Health & Wellness of its employees and even has an onsite Wellness Center.
good,"good work culture, healthy personal /work life balance.Not enough opportunity to grow within the company. As long as you do your work, no micro management. Good benefits."
good,"i loved working at chase, "
good,"Very stressful job, the salary is very low comparing to the amount of work, long hours and responsibilities. The company provide a great customer experience, all my co-workers are very nice, helpful and really care about our customers. The company has very good employee benefits, but the hardest thing is the long hours and the stress of the job, which as a Lead Teller OPS I'm not being paid enough."
good,"Working for JPMorgan Chase was very challenging.  The loan center was very fast pased, to work in such an environment, you had to learn the products, be professional, provide exceptional customer service, and had to meet the department goal which at times was very challenging."
good,"Working at Chase was awesome I really enjoyed it , the only thing there was a lot of friction between the manager and assistance manager , made us feel very uncomfortable . But here I learned to take more control  to have sole custody of our kiosk which meant filling it up with money for the working day and the fooling working day."
good,"Working for JPMorgan Chase was quite enjoyable. They include lots of benefits from Medical to 401k to paid sick and vacation time. The teams make you feel welcome and part of something great. Lots of positive affirmations and goal setting. But more so towards bankers, not so much for tellers. Training was simple and it was always kept up throughout your employment. I personally loved interacting with different people about their finances and lives throughout the day. The environment was almost always a positive one. As a teller, I found it difficult to excel and break out of being a teller. The only way to become a banker is to get more referrals to bankers, which is not easy to do as a teller especially when you have a line of customers."
good,"Great work environment, great compensation and benefits, room for advancement- I liked it a aloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooot"
good,"It was typical the workplace was fine, and there was nothing remarkable about it. People you work with are competent and friendly. Management was also good, they were accessible."
good,"What I love most about working with JP Morgan is that the management has consistently been able to recognize top talent and invests their time and resources for their personal development. "
good,"JP Morgan Chase overall was a great company to work for prior to the Mortgage scandal that became public knowledge. In my department, Mortgage Loss Mitigation, the job work/life balance was not that great; however the pay was good and matched the workload. The culture primarily consisted of seasoned mortgage professionals and the job stability was in place.  One thing that hurt JP Morgan Chase was that the Sr. Leadership was more reactionary than proactive where the Mortgage side of the business was concerned."
good,"sales oriented, customer service is extremely important, fair wages and incentives are based on how much each individual person produces so hard workers are compensated better"
good,"Great place to work in. Once you've worked with the company for some time you have more vacation time, great work/life balance. Sales  can get a bit overwhelming."
good,"Great Reputation"
good,"Unless you're amazing at sales, the base salary is the least competitive compared to major financial institutions. Although there are many career options, it's hard to switch to back office/operations if sales isn't your forte."
good,"Great place to work with many opportunities to work around the globe in a variety of different departments, atmospheres and different cultures.  A large company with many options."
good,"Chase is great at offering positions that keep your growth consistent. If a person does well Chase makes an effort to recognize their work, and they offer rewards for good work."
good,The company has many resources and offers many benefits. It is a great place to start your career and there are many opportunities for career mobility. Each office will have a different management structure but overall it is supportive.
good,my job at j p morgan was a good learning experience and supportive professional growth oriented and prosperous and fruitful and successful career wise
good,"JP Morgan Chase is a solid bank.  They are in a very competitive market, so they've had to keep up with the times.  However; this ultimately has taken a toll on employee satisfaction.  Folks who have generally served long years with JP Morgan, have had to leave their jobs or the culture they've loved for years; due to outsourcing or job relocation.  "
good,Corporate environment with a lot of opportunity for growth. Not much overtime required. I enjoyed working there for the short period until I moved out of town.
good,"Been a great experience working there, learnt many things in terms of Macros, management skills , handling any unexpected situations in terms of productivity or when it comes to customer handling. Management was always approachable and open to our views.Grooms us in becoming a better individual by conducting  various trainings and workshops."
good,"This is the place to seek industry training and advancement in the mortgage banking industry."
good,"This position allowed me to transfer states and oversee a training program of which I did everything from cradle to grave to include scheduling campus interviews, salary negotiation, creating training schedules, ordering equipment, securing training space and much more!"
good,"One of the best perks is if you travel for the job you get to keep all hotel points, airline miles and they have a great daily per diem.  Also, the company has the best program for veterans and very flexible in work/life balance."
good,Great Culture and exciting place to work.  I have the pleasure to work on exciting things and with very smart people who are passionate about what they do.
good,"This financial institution is headquartered in New York City.  Company encourages upward mobility amongst employees.  Supports increasing educational goals to promote professional advancement.  Great benefits packages, work life balance, 401K, employee stock purchase plan."
good,"JP Morgan Chase is an organization which values its resources, people here are very friendly and approachable ...Overall it is a good experience here.."
good,The majority of colleagues are professional and helpful. The culture and moral is one of the best I have come across in 10+ years. JPMC has given me the opportunity I was searching for and I am grateful.
good,"Learnt many things being in this organisation which makes us confident, enhances knowledge and an independent person to lead our life in a better way."
good,"Working at JP Morgan Chase has been very rewarding, with learning new phases of the mortgage servicing departments. Sufficient training offered. Being chosen for Special Projects. Great allowance for vacation as well as sick time."
good,"I love working for chase. Great company. Some managers mistreat the worker there a lot. if i had a opportunity to get hired again I would go back and work in a different location. I regret leaving the company, but I wanted to be happy and proud about coming to work."
good,"My typical day at work was controlling a 150 portfolio loan spreadsheet.  My job was to manage the modification process for loans in any type of default including foreclosure and bankruptcy. I dealt with many different parties.  From customers, paralegals and bankruptcy attorneys .  Our management team was some of the best.  The most challenging part of my day was making sure all documents were ready to be underwritten.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when a solution was obtained that helped both the customer and the bank."
good,"My typical day at work starts with checking mailbox, for any urgent emails. Then i assign work to my team, depending on the volumes. There are times when we get high volumes and we need to change the priorities. However, being a part of a team where everyone are hardworking is the best part. We need to maintain rapport with the team in order to have a friendly workplace. Most enjoyable part of my job is to work as a team to get the best results."
good,"As a large corporation, there are many opportunities to grow and advance, and I was fortunate to learn several different areas within a few different teams, ranging from graphic design, to ADA accessibility to asset security. The environment is nice and they provide lots of amentities to relieve stress throughout the day."
good,"Staff profile are generally my age who are among the brightest, passionate people I've met with stellar credentials to back them up. Long hours was rough but the company makes it easier and more fun."
good,"loved working at JPMorgan Chase. Workplace Culture is amazing. Willing to train and sharpen new skills. At time the projects can get overwhelming, but  the  managers are willing to help and support  you so you will succeed."
good,"The team dynamics were the best I ever worked with everyone's voice was heard and opinion valued. I cannot speak to the work environment today as it surely has evolved over the years, particularly considering the acquisitions/transitions in banking over the years."
good,"Its been about 2 years since I left, but I had a good experience working with chase. I was a part time Teller. I loved my co-workers, and the company does get involved with outreach and community which I personally loved. I didn't like how they cut a lot of positions and it is extremely hard to get promotions."
good,"This was the first role away from Investment Banking. I was a trader of Japanese Equities for almost 20 years, 3 of which I was based in Tokyo, Japan. I was a facilitation trader which meant I had clients phoning up, asking me to make a price in different stocks and in different sizes. To make these prices I have to price in the sentiment of the market, current currency rate, especially if the stock was a 'bluechip' stock ie Sony or Honda that are effected by a weaker or stronger Yen over the dollar. Have to read every piece of news that has come out on the stock recently. Work out how the stock has performed vs other stocks in the same sector and see if it has outperformed or under-performed the last 3,6 and 9 months. You have to work out the dollar amount of the trade which you will use to work out how many index future contracts you need to  buy or sell to hedge the position. A busy day would see me do this 40-50 time a day. Very exciting, especially if you're able to unwind the position for a profit. The trading floor is a sacred place, you have to be confident in what you do and how you do it. You have encourage your team, the sales team, and get them to start calling their clients to offer stock that you've got on the book. There's no better feeling than buying stock from a client and then selling it to another client for a profit"
good,"JP Morgan is a great company and for many years provided me with the opportunity to work with high levels of management and top tier clients. The job itself was not hard per se as I have many years of experience. However, there were some challenges working with approximately 100 (global and domestic) markets. The best part about the job was the people. Most of us were there for at least 10 years and being that we spent so much time together, we became a family. I guess I would say the hardest part of the job (once the relocation was announced) was leaving my JPM family."

The management is easily approachable, direct, and gives the floor an amazing sense of teamwork. However, management also is not the most organized when it comes to Code of Conduct or department knowledge. It was very clear on the floor who a worker would go to for legitimate answers about customer inquiries and as for Code of Conduct, each manager followed it differently, showing a lack of unity between opposing teams."

The management staff was great when you had problems and concerns. You were praised when you did good and disciplined when you did wrong but respectfully.

I love being able to work for a big Company that does care about its customers. The people I work with at Chase are also great because Chase is really good about hiring the best candidates. I learned a lot. We were provided with classes that taught us how to work with customers different personalities. Management is good about listening to your concerns, and about working with your schedules if needed. I currently work in the fraud department and the hardest part, is meeting pace, simply because sometimes there is so much log in information for a customer that it can literally take 20-25 minutes to decide whether you think you need to call a customer or cancel/process wire instead. Meeting pace can be difficult yet not impossible. Overall I love doing what I do. I have discovered that fraud is the area that I am best at. It feels great saving my customers accounts from fraud."
good,Being a part of a very strong financial institution instills pride.  Knowing that the CEO's vision for the company includes business transparency is a plus.  I feel very confident that the direction the company keeps customers first.  Year-over-year growth is prominently important as well.

good,JPMorgan has an extensive resource portfolio for employees for current role development and for career mobility.  The resources are convenient and most are free.  The company also supports work-life balance and healthy lifestyles for employees.
good,"Contract positions can be very challenging.  Frequently, the job description is generic and does not adequately describe the role, responsibilities, and expectations.  Although this was true for this position, I still had a very positive contract experience in this position and would accept a contract or employment opportunity with this company and the team I supported."
good,"The hardest part of the job and the most enjoyable was to make ""the elephant dance"". In literal terms - to be able to make one change successfully and make it stay. "
good,JPMorgan Chase was filled with opportunity due to the changing technology opportunities.  I learned to empower all employees to meet the technical challenges that the company faced.  I liked the hands off approach of the Sr. Management team to allow people to excel in their jobs.  All of the employees were great to work with and were out for the same business objectives.  The hardest part of the job was to get associates on board with the process and technical changes that were implemented.  The most enjoyable part of the job was watching my team grow and succeed.
good,As a teller I mostly ran transactions all day. I handled confrontational customers on a regular basis. I gained a lot of confidence and patience by dealing with upset customers. Coworkers were great. Management could have been better.
good,"The overall company is great! It was just the department I worked in, we have to remember the company isn't what make employees leave or cause high turnovers.  It's the front line managers or the managers that needs training with people skills.    "
good,"Chase is an overall good company that offers great benefits and pays you always on time which I like. Every year they add money like $600 to your 401k, and health benefits are very cheap like under $20 a paycheck. Tellers are offered items of uniform once a year, and this helps because the uniforms are kind of pricey. Being a teller is only an entry level position that I would not choose for ever unless you are on the way to retirement. Working in customer service, the job will get annoying! My coworkers over the years have always been the ones to keep me going because sometimes customers will get to you and you might have that one manager who annoys the most out of you. The thing to remember is always to be the best at your job if you are hoping to move up to another position. In Louisiana the company as a whole does not have a lot of different positions to move to and corporate does not visit us a lot compared to other states. We have met the CEO Jamie Dimon before and he seemed like a good guy to work for. Chase overall is a good company to be apart of."

good,"I was able to acquired different skills through my period in this company. There was a lot of room for career growth since the company is growing in a tremendous rate in Florida. Co-workers was a young crowd, a lot of fun and professionalism. A typical day for me, was helping clients with their financial needs by recommending the right products and solutions. Would see about 15 clients per day, and about 40 whenever I needed to assist at the teller line. Management had its ups and downs, since there was always constant changes in our management team. I would say the hardest part of my job was to meet monthly sales goals, a lot of pressure from upper management. The most enjoyable part was getting to build relationships with clients, getting to know them in a personal level. Overall its a great company to work for, especially if you like the banking industry."
good,I worked at chase part time while in school so my work day consisted of processing transactions.
good,"Knowledge bank, great place to work with peers of excelent knowledge base. Good pay scales, Various functions and opportunities to work"

The enviorment is very diverse and their are many ways to move to the next position.The only thing I find unpleasant is that the job has no security and the company constanstly have to hire new hire's to maintain the business their is no longevity here. A typical day at chase is having 50- 150 calls and you learn how to deal with different cultures of the world right over the phone. Management can show favortism so it's always best to maintain a great relationship with your unit manager.Also you will constantly switch mannagers because chase is about change and you will be informed soon as you walk though the door. As far as co workers chase has different types of cultures and they let you be who you are as long as they are meeting the company guide lines. The most enjoyable part is the rewards you may recieve at chase and the benefits of the company it self is amazing! It's up to you on how long you last at chase keep an open positive mind and do not stay a telephone banker move to something different within a year because its very repettive and YOU WILL BURN OUT!

good,I began working at 231 East Ave in 1992 as a encoder. I worked part time nights while my children were young. I moved to the research department where I worked with microfilm and micro fiche to fulfill subpoena's for legal. Eventually I wanted to move up in the company and applied for Investor Reporting as I had some accounting experience. I took an accounting course at the American institute of banking and received a grade of 4.0. I worked in the Investor reporting department for 10 years reporting to private and major investors including FNMA and GNMA. Our company was then taken over by another company and I moved to retail customer service. I learned a lot about the borrowers and their accounts. I moved up to the escalation group where we would take escalation calls from the borrowers. This position could be challenging at times as some customers wanted all of their overdraft charges refunded and we were only allowed to refund a specific amount of charges. I learned how to speak to the borrower and remain calm while they were yelling and screaming at me. This help me as I moved to a Manager position. I was able to assist my agents in remaining calm and putting themselves in the customers shoes to better assist them in helping the customer. Moving forward to another company we went into the loss mitigation department where we received calls from borrowers with delinquent home mortgages. We attempted to assist the borrower with options for reducing or eliminating the delinquency of their home by helping with reinstatement or possibly a modification or repayment plan.

good,"I really enjoyed working at JP Morgan Chase. It was stressful at times during the day at work, but we always had enough support to get through some tough assignments. I learned a great deal about the Mortgage industry while employed there. Management was always eager to help when needed. My co-workers were great. I built some long lasting friendships while employed at JP Morgan Chase. The hardest part of the job there was coming to terms with the fact that so many Americans were losing their jobs and losing their homes. We did the best we could for each and every one of them, but a lot of the times we had no other options to try for them. The ultimate ending for most was foreclosure. The most enjoyable part of my job there, was when I was able to help a homeowner either keep their home or work out a plan to where they could sell the property they were delinquent in, so they could escape the debt and move on with their lives. Most of these were cases where the homeowner lost their job, found another job, but it was in a different state or not within a drivable commute. "

good,There is no typical day...everyday is different.  I learned that every customer has very different needs and expectations. My co-workers are excellent team players.  We all help each other out.

Coming into JPMorgan I had no experience in Bankruptcy nor Foreclosure, I did however have experience in certain aspects of Mortgage Banking. Within the 2 1/2 years I have been with JPMorgan, I have showed that I am a good worker, fast learner, and dedicated to meeting deadlines and meeting them fast, efficiently, and accurately.

Inside the building it's about the merchants who represent our pride. they are the reason of our existence as a business. We come every day having them in our mind, thinking how we can help them the best way we can possibly think of. The hardest part is to understand quickly the issues at hand and bring a solution on the spot. Ironically, it is the most enjoyable part of the job as well being able to provide a solution to the problem, a response to the question and everybody is happy."

The company has extensive training. Over the 14 years I worked there all my managers helped me succeed in each department I worked. If you came to work and were willing to work hard and learn new skills you can advance.  I was always treated with respect and the company was strong on keeping a safe work environment for all. There were many opportunities to move to other departments and take on side tasks if you had the desire to do so. I really enjoyed the team work in most departments. I was able to make some good friends. The benefits package is very good. I enjoyed talking to people and being able to help solve customer's issues. I would say the hardest part for me was the 45 minute commute to work. It also can be stressful when there was a high call volume and there was no break between calls. Keeping a low handle time was not always my strong suit. There was also a lot of change so you have to learn to adapt quickly. It is part of the job. The benefits including insurance, vacation time and holiday pay was very good but overall hourly pay could of been higher for the area I worked. I chose to leave the company due to my position was transferred to a different state and I did not want to move.

As long as you could balance your cash registrar at the end of your shift you will be okay."

If you have a situation and need to have a day off or schedule change, make sure to have in a written email everything that is discussed with you and your manager. Most of the managers were great but there was one that made life difficult for everyone. If you get a manager like that, feel free to switch. Coworkers were awesome. Very professional place to work. You feel like you're working with adults, not children. Everything is clean and you have what you need to do your job. Training is awesome. They give you the basics of what you need to know. The rest you learn with shadowing and as you go. Salary could be better but you can always get a raise or promotion. Didn't like the fact that they didn't have assigned seating. Sometimes it took awhile to find a desk."
good,I enjoyed my each and every day in this company. My manager always support me for all the work which i was doing ( which was very much encouraging) .  \..
good,I was able to move up in management along with learn a lot through experience. Most areas were flexible with work life balance. Most managers understand people having kids etc.
good,"Great place to work fast paced environmnt for energetic,enthusiastic highly motivated people comes highly recommemded i would say if your interested in working in the banking industry"
good,"Fast pace, and  it is a Cooperate company, so there is a lot to maintain (target, goal).You are most likely end up with more responsibilities, so if you like challenge, this could be a good place for you to work. It also provides decent benefits."
good,"I started working there in 2006 after a period of 9 years working for a small, thriving company. The owner/manager there did not give me any benefits, paid time off, because I was part-time 25-32 hours. When I got to Chase, I was so happy to have paid time off, sick days, vacation, flexible schedules, nice people to work with, 401k, Family Medical Leave Act for 90 days ( had to use it 3 times) . My managers (which changed about every 2 years) where as different as night and day. But I learned something from each of them. If you wanted to , you could advance quite easily.  The pay was pretty low for tellers. Some bankers would make more than the managers, but they were the cool kids. They could hustle and bring business in from clients."
good,Management is easy to get along with.  Servicing customers is the best part of the day.  The culture is one of inclusivity and collaboration is commonplace.  Employees are generally treated fairly.
good,A great place to work.  Quick paced and deadlines but co-workers work as a team and we support each other.  I enjoy providing oversight for the team in India and have built a nice relationship with the employees.
good,"My daily routines were very simple. I was a part time teller, and attended college. The company was very flexible with my schedule, the employees were friendly which made it a great work environment."
good,Nice coworkers I did love working with my cowerkers and I love my customer. I had good benefits for myself and my family. Good health insurance for myself and family.
good,Excellent opportunities throughout the company.  Jump on board if you get the chance and do your best  Your future is in your own hands - make it count!
good,Usually I stand behind the teller line for the most part of my shift helping customers out. I learned a lot of customer service skills. I used to be a very shy person but this job definitely helped me become more interactive with customers. My managers were all very good. Some had different visions on how to run a branch but in the in end it was all about helping the customer out. Working at chase can be very fun at times. But there are other times were the branch gets very busy and you must focus on the task at hand. Everyone gets along at work and the manager is always open to talk to. Hardest part of the job would be remember the little policy's that chase has cause they change all the time. The most enjoyable part of the job would be helping out a customer that has a difficult transaction and making sure that they leave happy from the bank.
good,"Working for Chase was a great stepping stone. However, they do not pay their associates enough, and the annual raises are not nearly enough to compensate for a year or hard work. Plenty of job security, as employee retention is very strong with this company."
good,"Awesome experience."
good,Management is on a high level. The most enjoyable part of the job is improving existing SQL and PL/SQL code. Too many meetings. Agile stand-ups are too long.
good,"responsible for the timely closure of financial books for legal entities on a monthly, quarterly & annual basis and on day to day engage into ensuring deliverable are met per SAL, control are into place, engage with stakeholders, meeting and people related agenda."
good,The JPMorgan chase call center was a good company to work for. They have plenty of opportunity for growth and you can also get great benefits as well as pay
good,"if you like a competitive field this is the place for you. base pay is a good rate with the potential to earn bonuses, and commission on products recommended to clients that they decide to use."
good,I analyze a lot of data and detect identity theft. I instruct customers on how to handle these situations. I resolve the issue and recover accounts. I notate every action taken and make a decision on whether the identity theft claim is valid or fraud.
good,"Chase bank is the best bank to work for in the banking industry,chase treats the customers very important and also to the employees too.The commision structure of chase bank is one of the best ones I hv ever seen"
good,The most challenging part about Chase is learning the systems.  It is very easy to earn recognition from peers and clients.  Managers are great coaches
good,JPMorganChase was a wonderful company to work for. I would still be with them if there had been an opening at the site I was moving close to. They had wonderful benefits and the job atmosphere was upbeat and encouraging. Everyone was very friendly and management was very accessible and eager to help you promote. They had continuous competitions to create a fun atmosphere and had great gifts to those that won.They also worked with those who needed extra help rather than give up on the poor performers.I would encourage anyone to give this company a chance should the opportunity present itself.
good,Big bank! Depending on your department can be a great or bad experience.   However regardless the company is great for your brand whenever you decide to leave.
good,"Great work environment the managers are really good and they give you significant training."
good,Coding skills improved. good work environment and all team members will put good work effort to complete the tasks. Learned to handle toughest cases in all situation
good,Day to day work is assisting customers to the best of the employees' abilities. There is also a sense of camaraderie among the employees to help create a peaceful and comfortable workplace.
good,"I felt invested in, they had great training and management listened to your concerns."
good,Typical day I take calls all day and we have 2 breaks and a 1 hour lunch. I like Chase but I am looking to either transfer to another department or move to another company.
good,"While i was at Chase, i loved work because I really did feel like a part of the team. everyone works together to achieve the goal together. There never was ""us vs. them"""
good,I worked ten hour days I was always on time. I learned a lot about banking and helping customers with their financial problems. The hardest part of the job was getting customers know the rules in our government about banking. The most enjoyable was helping a customer with their accts.
good,This is a good place to work if you have moderate social skills and aren't afraid to pick up the phone and call people. It is a sales job so you must understand that going in.
good,It was a good culture and good people.  I 2as paid more here than at other companies that I worked for however it did not pay as well as other places that I have heard of.
good,"The company has a lot to offer, with its outstanding work environment, amazing people, and amazing management I have enjoyed working at JP Morgan Chase. The company also offers great benefits."
good,"good place to work and many opportunities to advance and further career. Managment looks out for employees, focus became from sales culture to customer experience oriented"
good,"Truly grateful to have been hired by Chase. From day one I have been treated well. I have no complaints about the company, especially how they have taken care of me through a child birth and two deaths in the family over the last 2 years. Just wish that my position was offered where I will be relocating!"
good,The day is fast paced and competitive. Learned how to work with customer and empathized in certain hardships.  Most enjoyable is competing with other specialist to get prizes for working hard.
good,Years ago this was a great and fun place to work.  I enjoyed taking inbound calls and helping our customers.  I learned invaluable information about the credit card processing industry and grew my customer service skills.  Management has been the best than any other company I have worked for.  More pressure has come down from upper management to keep short handle times and this has increased stress and I believe has lowered the customer service experience.  The most enjoyable part of the job was having benefits and an on-site cafeteria with excellent food.
good,"Learned team work,  new technology and methods. Management,"
good,"Can be a great place to work, however if they decide that they eliminating your product there is no provision for retraining at that time, or if a mgr does not like you you will be terminated"
good,Learn about credit card process and policies. Helping customers with their questions. Using knowledge and giving trust and confident. Communicate with others departments to better assist customers in professional manner.
good,"Banking was about 2 things.  Customer service and sales.  "
good,"A great place to work consisting of dedicated teams.  The IT environment provided many tools, needed by any ardent IT worker.  Whether one is a junior developer s through to Assistant Vice Presidents, one had everything needed to succeed."
good,I have worked for the company for several years. It is a great work/personal life balance. Once you are done with your job during the day it doesn't follow you home. Depending of your team you can also work from home or if you live really far there can be some work from home arrangement.
good,JP Morgan Chase has great benefits and with these benefits it is obvious that they care about their employees. It is easy to learn and grow in your career.
good,"This was an amazing experience with a lot of resources to learn and grow. Unfortunately, unless you are a full time employee - there is no guaranteed job security and the resources available to you as a contractor/consultant are significantly less. You will constantly be indirectly reminded that a lot of things are reserved for full time employees only."
good,"Great company to work for however the opportunities for advancement are few and far between. For any type of promotion you need a certain amount of experience they make it almost impossible to acquire. Although they swear they are creating jobs, they are replacing jobs with technology needing less people overall."
good,"On a regular day at work would be - I start at 9:00 am do everything assigned to me, very quietly, whenever there is an issue I would seek help from my supervisors or someone higher who is always there to assist. I leave at 5:00pm after have a full days' work"
good,"Our voice always matters for JPMC. We strive to build a collaborative, caring and a culture full of integrity. We are able to maximize our potential because the company promotes internal mobility."
good,"Great benefits, great people. Can be stressful to make your numbers. Enjoyed departments that were not on the phones. I learned a lot about credit cards."
good,"I had a great experience working for JP Morgan. At the time I was 16 years in high school. The managers were very patient with me , took me under their wing and help me learn the day to day functions of the job."
good,"Great Place to work and that has been my experience.  Great learning levels.Overall rating*"
good,The company instills in the minds of their employees that professionalism should be the top most priority at all times. The company benefits and compensation is extremely acceptable and justifiable.
good,"100% phone based job.having to learn multiple systems."
good,"Good Culture, Alot to do on daily basis with not enough time due to not enough employees working. Work is overload, many goals to meet. Great health,401k benefits. Chase is a great company to work for but if you are not a top performer its a hard to advance to different roles. Many perks on benefits,discounts and also offers pension."
good,It was fun working there. You get to interact with a lot of different people. If you work hard there are a lot of opportunities to advance your career.
good,"Review is irrelevant, I was there about 18 years ago. However is was a good company to work for.  The benefits were good but there were many mergers at the time so many of us were let go."
good,"This is a fantastic company, but can be a boring place to work. Don't get me wrong there are people working on cutting edge stuff, but they are few and far between. There is also a good variety of teams, and projects all doing different boring things. You will have plenty of opportunity for training in new technologies, although depending on what team you get put on you may never have a chance to use it. "
good,A typical production employer environment requiring specific quota and deadlines to be met or exceeded. Relaxed atmosphere. Management willing to help.
good,A busy department that I work on a daily basis. Nice and understanding boss will listen to your problem and help out. Colleagues is fun and helpful so as the culture.
good,"Good people to work with. Responsive and approachable management. Reasonable worker expectations for the most part. Occasional worker over-expectations (usually when policy or procedure changes are implemented, and the kinks have not been pre-addressed prior to the roll-out). If I were not planning to re-locate to a non-Chase market for my current position, I would remain in my present position here."
good,Work and people are okay and management is very flexible with work-life balance. Encourage growth and always looking to keep you engaged with learning.
good,"superb office infrastructure and facilities"
good,I enjoyed my time at JPMorgan Chase. My colleagues were very helpful and worked well together. It is a first class organization. With a bank as large as JPM there is room for career advancement.
good,"Productive and innovative place to work, things were always evolving for the good. One of the best management team I've ever had the pleasure of working with."
good,"Good opportunity for someone looking to work in a corporate culture. It is a good opportunity to develop skills and work cross functionally.  The managers are hands off, but could improve on skill development."
good,"Eight hour days with the ability to negotiate start and end times.  Start with three weeks paid vacation a year in addition to sick days and personal days. Paid holidays.  Options available for retirement and medical savings.  Generous time off for birth or adoption of child.  Many departments to choose from when looking for a position (banking, mortgage, auto loans, fraud, etc.) with possibilities to work Monday through Friday in some departments.  Friendly co-workers. Opportunities for advancement but slow to advise if chosen & no ways given to improve chances.  Management easy to talk to, work/life balance available."
good,"If you like sales, Chase is a great company to work for. Good benefits and the people tend to be very easy to work with. That being said it's the type of job that is easier if you catch onto programs quickly."
good,JP Morgan is my second career company. its environment and culture and employee treating is very good. they will concentrated employee work place and what they want like lunch transport medical etc.JP morgan is very good for career vis and bonus but salary they will not increase that much.
good,I loved working here until I was lied to by our department leaders and transferred to another department without knowledge of it being a permanent position. I am leaving because this new department makes me depressed and I am not allowed to expand my knowledge in a new department that would suit me and my beliefs.
good,"I worked there for years and got moved around and asked to help out at places. And the manager of each branch is much different than the next. "

good,"Office vibe was super friendly and professional. Learned so much about the UK financial world. Management were young and funky. The culture was very diverse and lots of interesting people work there. The number crunching was a bit boring at times, but the office banter kept everyone feeling upbeat and like we were all part of a family!"

good,If you want to be part of the global brand then this company is what you are looking for! I highly recommend this multinational company. It promotes diversity and inclusion and will surely give you the highest standards of training!
good,"A typical day At JPMC would be strongly focused on customer service and meeting production goals. Your scorecards are very important when wanting to pursue a different position within the company. The workplace culture is very positive and both of the management teams I was part of were EXTREMELY supportive. Most managers on duty are willing to assist in meeting your goals regardless of their tasks in hand. The hardest part of this job would be time management since it is part of your score card. As a quality analyst, production changes from month to month and at times becomes difficult to meet. There are many meetings to attend and your time is not protected and production still needs to be met. For those interested in banking, the San Antonio location is a great way to get the support and career advancement you desire. It only takes 6-12 months to get promoted."
good,"Work with chase is very professional but casual in term how we connect between employee and customer to build long lasting relationship. I learned differently from Chase how to do business and how we approach day to day jobs in sales, operations, and customer service. Very dynamic and diverse place to work and prioritize the employee in individual knowledge and success. Nothing hardest part of the job it just how we can allocate what type we like to do and suite to your skills. If we know our skills and strengths and approach it in the right place and work, it can be the most enjoyable part of the job you ever had."

good,WAMU has been the best experience of my life to work for. Was bough by chase and everything  change but I will say great benefits and great opportunity
good,"The opportunity is a contract opportunity. The inclusion of all team members and leadership is great for building relationships. The leadership is very involved in all levels of projects. In addition, the projects are using Agile methodology which makes it dynamic. "
good,"Employee friendly environment and nice work culture, provides lots of training and knowledge sessions and work life balance is maintained as per employee needs"
good,I worked on a inbound/outbound dialer and worked with customers directly to assist them with a modification review. This was a very fast pace setting with back to back phone calls and continuous changes with the modification program.

good,A typical day at work is doing 5-6 alerts per day.  I've learned to take my time with cases and eventually the production will go up as time goes on.  The team leads and co-workers were very helpful and always provided help and information when needed.  The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with co-workers and their production.  The most enjoyable part of the job was was working in a group and fun people.
good,"Fast pace environment, patience and politeness is key, coworkers are easy to get along with and can be relied on thru the day and we have great communication between each other. Hardest part of my job will have to be saying no to a client when it is necessary, which isn't as often but it does happen.

My teammates and my management team are great. The greatest part of my job is resolving issues for the investors and they pay the claims after my research. I work for such an extraordinary company that on a daily basis shows how much they care for their employees.The hardest part is (being fearful of the unknown),"
good,Loved this job! Had to leave due to relocation would work again. Good co workers and team always had to set goals. Mangers push so you can do better.

good,"my job consisted of managing large businesses cash flow and making sure they are able to run their business efficiently,  I learned that no business operates the same and its important to tailor programs to the specific business needs.  Management was fantastic always there to guide and help you and my co-workers were a lot of fun to work with, we made a great team.  hardest part of the job was finding ways to lend money to businesses when credit was tight.

The work/life balance can be a challenge especially if you are in management and are short staffed. They really teach their managers to be coaches and invest in all employees with training.

good,You get the support you need; to grow in the direction you want. People are get to work with. Being on the phones all day is not ideal  but it is a great starting point for a career.
good,"I'm going to start off by saying that JPMorgan and Chase is one of the best places to work. The staff is so supportive of one another; the team helps each other whenever they can, however they can. Although the particular branch I work at is usually very busy, I learned, and still am learning, many things that I never knew before, such as the new steps Chase is taking in securing its customers' information and how to stop fraudsters before they damage anyone any further. The best thing about it all: I get the opportunity to interact with many kinds of people and help them out as much as I can."
good,"During my 15 year tenure, I was provided with training, both in class and on the job, in emploee relations, supervision, and management.  Opinions and ""outside-the-box thinking were encouraged.  "

good,A grt place to work and it has been a grt learning over the past 4 yrs here..the day starts with glancing the calender and getting ready for the day ahead..the team i work with is great and my lead is a great mentor..
good,"Working at Chase was probably one of the best times of my life. As a teller, a typical day would consist of building relationships with customers, having great talks with coworkers and working with money."

good,I loved the people i worked with. The company overall is a good company to work for.
good,"A typical day started by picking up work from the distribution center. I sorted the work into corresponding stacks and then processed each according to company procedures.  I prepared work to be scanned into the system for processing at another work site.  Folded advice letters for mailing and then delivered to mailroom.  Management was wonderful, very easy to talk to and kept the door open for anyone to talk if there was any kind of a problem. I worked in the research and adjustment department and we did a lot of eating in our department.  The best part of the job was flex time; we had from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. to get to work before we were late. The hardest part was when I learned that Research and Adjustment Dept. was closing down."
good,"Working for JPMorgan Chase as a PreFund Analyst has allotted me the opportunity to grow within the company. A typical day at work would entail being very productive, concentrating on assuring that consumer would have a smooth transition at the closing table. The department manager as well as co workers would support each other in learning constant policy changes. This brought our staff to a cohesive environment as we shared the same mission of wanting to be the best QA department in the country. The most enjoyable experience were the interactive activities and getting to know members of other departments."
good,"Customer Service "
good,"Over the last 20 years, I have successfully lead efforts to: align IC programs with business strategies, balance and reduce benefits budgets while maintaining employee engagement, and streamline HR processes and systems.  I’m seeking a dynamic HR executive role where I am able to make a positive company impact and mentor others."
good,"Chase is a great place to work and strives to keep employees informed and knowledgeable.But, if you want to be promoted quickly within the company, look elsewhere. It's very difficult to move up within the company and they frequently won't pay you what you feel like you are worth. To the company, they offset the base salary with the opportunity to earn more commission (in the branches), excellent benefits and generous vacation and personal time. The company also gives 12 weeks PAID maternity leave and a week PAID paternity leave. Who else do you know that pays for that much time? For the most part everyone works as a team and pulls their own weight, it's the ones that don't that bring the morale down, but that can happen anywhere. The hardest part of the job would be staying abreast on the changes and new policies that change as frequently as regulations do. Also difficult is staying motivated to generate sales, if you are not, it can cost you your job."
good,"Chase was a very good place to work. We did have performance standards which were expected to be met which is one of the things I enjoyed about the job it gave you something to strive for. Overall it was a good work environment everyone was very helpful, the managers reviewed our calls with us to ensure we were providing the best customer service possible. The only thing I did not like was the fact that part time was not available to those who were trying to further their education etc."
good,Great company to work for in every aspect. As a team we were outgoing and very helpful. The hardest part of the job was how aggressive we needed to be with how we sold promotions.
good,Great hours and flexible work schedules. Benefits package was very good. Lots of valuable training available.

good,"Great company to work for. Great benefits, time off, paid Holidays, Vacation for part-time, sick paid time, bonus, commission. Professional company"
good,"Coordinated an inventory of title issues in foreclosure cases."
good,"I like this job, because it is process oriented.  Meaning that I get an opportunity to work from analyzing the requirement documents to creating the test plans, writing the test cases, testing the application, logging defects, retesting, preparing reports and finally testing in production as well. Therefore, I am involved from the very beginning to the end of the software development life cycle (SDLC) process."
good,"JPMprgan Bank is one of the best banking industry in the world. Once known as Bank One and First Chicago Bank, three merger later still finding innovative ways to satisfy their customers. "
good,"During a typical day I would empty and sort interoffice mail bags, pack up out going mail, create shipping labels, meter mail, fill out invoices, keep accounting information up to date, make sure all the work was completed and picked up, and communicate with my manager and other operation team leads and supervisors. I learned a lot about the mail process and how to take the lead in an effective way. My manager and his manager were excellent and were very easy to work with. My co-workers were also hard working and cooperative. For me there were no difficult parts of this job. I enjoyed being able to come up with ideas to improve the work place and being allowed to test them out."
good,"Pros: Superior training, good hours, always innovative, "
good,"A typical day at work would be reviewing emails for new files to work, reviewing HUD-1 settlement statements for accurately entered information. Working with title companies via telecommunication to confirm closing of loans. Funding loans as well as wire transfers. I learned how to process  loans for refinance. I loved working with management they were very helpful with problem solving. The hardest part of this job would be funding of loans, sometimes customer would not show up for closing of a loan, and files would have to be reworked, which could take time. The most enjoyable part of my job would be with a file is complete."
good,"Chase is a great place to work at and to enhance ones customer service skills.  Furthermore, as a teller I must have a profession and friendly appearance at all times and treat customers with respect and courtesy as well as to my co-workers and managers.  With the four years I have been with Chase; almost five years now, one important aspect that I have learned is to always remain calm but alert at all times.  For example, if there is a situation where a customer gets out of hand and starts being overly aggressive about a particular situation that he or she is having and starts using vulgar language, I have learned to not take the matter personal but instead be professional about the situation and if it gets way to out of hand involve management to resolve the issue. Moreover, remaining calm and professional in a situation like the one I mentioned tends to be the hardes part of the job for some people.  Moving on, for me the most enjoyable part of being a teller is to helpe customers resolve whatever issue they may have but at the same time while following the company's code of conduct.  If for some reason I cannot help them find an immediate solution I always give them other options they can make.  For example, Chase has a new regulation that states that only accountholders and signers are allowed to make cash deposits.  Furthermore, if a person walks into my teller window and tells me that he or she wants to make a cash deposit into someone elses account I explain to them that we no longer accept cash deposits for nonaccountholders but I give them the option of making a transfer"

good,"A typical day at work starts with me greeting clients with a smile as they enter the bank to perform their transactions. The hardest part of the job is having an unsatisfied and irate client. The most rewarding part of the job is just working with the general public and being able to provide that extra individual help and security with their account as their trusted personal banker. While this company is very productive and the my co-workers are very professional, I find it to be sometimes more about making money than fulfilling the clients needs."

I was a teller at Chase and by the time I came in the branch was open.  I did assit with some EOD balancing when the time allowed.  I learned the basic teller procedures, but at Chase is where I learned my selling skills.  The management team encouraged me to learn how to sell.

The hardest part is really keeping up with all the new things i had to learn. Not one day was ever the same. The most enjoyable part of my experience was my Managers support and my team. I enjoyed pair programming with them. JPMorgan really invest in their employees."
good,I was entering wire transfers for the middle market division. I learned about ABA and swift codes. It was a friendly place to work. There weren't any hard days but I can't say there were any really enjoyable days either.
good,Good work life balance. Fair management. God support network. Job title dissolved and was given very fair severance package. Enjoyed my 10 year career with company.
good,"Good place to work. Supports inclusive and diversity culture. More emphasise on Employee Statisfaction. "

I have learned a lot about business credit card accounts,  I had great management in Business card some of the best at Chase.  The culture is the same through out Chase.  There hardest part was learning the ins and outs bout business credit cards.  The most enjoyable were my team mates."
good,"Good company, decent money if you're willing to work. Flexible schedule. Sundays you're always off as well as all major holidays. Just stay away from Private Client branches and you'll be ok."

good,I worked at Chase for 8 year as a Senior Financial Advisor. Outstanding customer service and great team work! Work day goes fast because you are always busy.
good,Chase was a great place to work however as time went on and you made more money opportunities became limited. However chase has great benefits such as vacation time paid time off and on site back up child care. They have a very good training program when you transition to another department.
good,"Firms are made up of people. First class people make first class firms.  JPM is fortunate to have great people, best in class client offerings and employee benefits."
good,Being a student intern meant that I would have to help around with the workload around the office space. I also assumed that I would not get respected but I was wrong. Such a great environment to be in and people trained me to learn for the real world.
good,"had a great time here. i left when the financial industry took a hit. otherwise, i woudlve stayed. great coworkers and manager really wanted everyone to succeed. great company in my point of view."
good,"I would help customers inside the branch, which ranged anywhere from account matainence to sales production. In sales you cannot be the same way with every customer, you have to learn how to adapt to each individual's personality go off of their energy. That builds a better connection and trust with the client. They are not just another number. Robotic performance in sales is not beneficial for your customer. Be different and set yourself apart from the competition."
good,I've had the pleasure of working for Chase Bank for the last 15 years. I've held various roles from entry level customer service phones advisor to Senior Business Analysts roles. I would recommend Chase as a great place to work.
good,A nice place to work if you love to work in a call center. I love to work at JP Morgan but the job were stressful. The benefit were great. and the working were cutthroat.
good,"As a teller, your goals are mostly oriented around customer service. While doing transactions and handling cash are a big part, you are the main point where customers will go. It is important to be able to be friendly and develop rapport with customers as well as focus on the transactions at the same time. Overall, it was very enjoyable though it greatly depends on the manager you have and the branch where you are located."
good,"Chase offers great incentives. They offer great vacation hours, insurance options, and maternity leaves, even for part time workers. The hours are steady, they've worker around my schedule well. Would recommend if you're looking for a nice job, with decent money, and steady hours."

good,J.P. Morgan CCB finance A very fast paced work environment. There is a lot of learning on the Job but it is impressive to see how all the working parts come together.

good,"I feel like this job is pretty great for any college student wanting to pursue an accounting career, many opportunities to move up. Benefits are great even for part-time employees."
good,I worked for JP Morgan for 25 years and in that time went through many takeovers and acquisittions. I started working for Manufacturers Hanover in 1986 which was taken over by Chemical Bank which in turn was taken over by Chase Manhattan and then finally became JP Morgan. I reached the level of Vice President managing a team of 15 including 3rd party contractors. The job was very rewarding but as we reported directly to the traders could be very stressful. I spent the last 3 years at the Bank managing all of the EMEA branches which involved working on many projects and intensive travelling.
good,No experience necessary to be a teller. Chase educated the tellers VERY well. A complete course with computer modules with all the tools was utilized in a daily workflow. I felt very prepared on my first day.
good,"Great benefits,tons of paid time off. The customers are usually nice but about 25% are ridiculous. Management takes care of employees"
good,"JPMorgan Chase provides a great workplace for its employees.  The company offers learning opportunities and a culture that is focused on the customer, employees and doing the right thing for the communities in which it does business."

good,This is a good company to work for. great benefits and you are able to have a work and life balance. The training is long but they are fair at the time of training that they give you for the role that you are hired.
good,"For the most part, Chase is a good employer.  There is very little supervision as long as employee meets or exceeds production and quality expectations."
good,Don't expect to sit around in this organization. They are the number one bank for a reason and that is because of the employees. The organization takes care of their employees and promotes hard work.

Employees hardworking. Most enjoyable part of the job was the employees.
good,"Job advancement is excellent at Chase. Benefits are also really good.I enjoyed working in the branches I was put permanetely or covering. Their 401K, Health and legal services for employees is one of their biggest perks working for them."
good,you'll have to work there to understand. Working at JP Morgan has been beyond an amazing experience. The people are very courteous and friendly. I hope I will be working for this organization for many years to come.
good,"Chase has a lot of peer coaches and assistants that help you when you're stuck on something. Someone is always providing you with solutions and job aids to find your answers Most coworkers are very nice some. Some of chase's policy are too extreme and csat scores are too overwhelming... Everything is based on customer's surveys. Even if you do everything right and provide excellent customer service skills, customers will still end up giving you 1 stars. I dislike that if you are stuck on a call pass your break/lunch time you wont be able to get your full break or you end up missing your break."
good,"Its been extremely well to work for this company. The people are great and you get great exposure. I truly enjoy my job, you learn something new everyday."

good,"i work as chef de partie in the global section where i have a new menu every other day so which helps me to learn and cook different cuisines. i have learned a lot from this kitchen, like managing the operation, ordering and stock taking, doing the costing of the food. the management here is very helpful and uderstanding. we have a team of 4 chef de partie, 1 senior chef de partie and a head chef . we all work as a team, it helps to finish our task soon and also helps to do less mistakes. the hardest part of job is food delivery as there is no fix time of the delivery so sometime we have to change the menu in last minutes. the most enjoyable part of job is when i get appreciated for good work i do."
good,I loved working at JP Morgan. Communication was very well handled from the CEO down to Vice Presidents. The benefits and compensation are top notch.
good,Feel very proud to say that I have worked with such an esteemed company. It is a place where i have learnt each and everything the employees at the company are very good and the management is very supportive and encourages us in developing our skills and qualities
good,"Overall experience has been superb. Only negative is if your an internal transfer, most promotions are somehow lateral transfers with little to no pay raise. But on the plus side, those coming from the outside face great pay potential!"
good,It is always good place to work and encourage the talent of the people and also good package and provide good infrastructure to the assoiates who are working in the organization and also motivate the people difficult to do the process.
good,"JP Morgan Chase offers a positive work environment with great,well-trained managers who make the employee feel like an integral member of the team.As far as call centers go, it doesn't get any better than this. The best people are hired and it shows in their professionalism and the quality of the work environment. The demographic is varied across cultures, nationalities,races and the compounded result is one of a microcosm of what the larger,global,corporate environment is constituted of. It is a pleasure and a privilege to be a J.P. Morgan Chase employee."
good,Great benefits. Be open to change working here. Fast pace work enviornment but can be enjoyable.If interested deffinetly apply.
good,"Excellent place to work. Great benefits, major opportunities for advancement within the company.  This company really takes care of their employees and is always showing appreciation for their employees. The break area was very nice there was no need to go off the premises for lunch because their is a cafeteria on the premises with several choices."
good,"I always had very supportive management. I felt appreciated by my company. We had good benefits, time off policies, and compensation. My role at the branch is to uncover opportunities with our existing clients as well as reach out to prospective clients. I would meet with clients for whatever reason they came into the branch for and looked for a way to deepen the relationship. Whether it be to introduce them to a loan officer for an up coming move or schedule them with a financial advisor for review of outside assets."
good,"A well rounded job- Chase helps develop your administration, operational and delegation skills. This being paired with a sales position and great attention to customer service really helps you to diverse yourself within the workplace."
good,A typical day at work is being very productive and proactive along with providing best effort to the client and having a team to depend for support.
good,"- The Organization has a very good work life balance."
good,"I learned so much while there.  Customers were pretty fun, as were co-workers.  Always something crazy happening.  Didn't always like all the employee meetings that they say are ""mandatory"".  But other than that this was a good-time job.  Teller manager was great to work with- once I figured out what she wanted in her workers.  haha"
good,"•	Maintain contact with clients regarding cash and checking services "
good,Got best opportunities in work to learn many more things. I'm working in a professionally managed organization where work demands out of box thinking and throws up new challenges. And enjoyed a lot with my co-workers.
good,"Great workplace, Easy advancement IF you are motivated and professional"
good,"First identify objectives for the business line, objectives for the tem and the company to be delivered short term and long term.  Perform weekly one on ones with direct reports for evaluations.  Keep open door policy for all staff.  Ensure the staff objectives were measurable and their personal development for example up-training, cross training were being met.  The hardest part of the job was measuring the success of your team and having to distinguish who was more successful and reward that with compensation even though all deliverables and objectives were met as scheduled.  The most enjoyable was seeing the promotion of my staff to higher positions and know that you contributed to their success"
good,"Challenges you to be the best employee that you can be, and constantly develops employees.  Excellent atmosphere."
good,I was a full time employee at JPMorgan Chase bank for almost two years. Benefits are great. Motivations are great also. Co-workers are helpful and plays well as a team. The hardest part was leaving the company due to a situation that I had to leave the country for more than 4 weeks which my vacations time can't afford.
good,"Branch Management"
good,"As an Assistant Manager at Chase Bank, my day would consist of educating my team on compliance and operation so they are following proper controls and procedure. Auditing tellers to make sure they are in balance every day and following all the policies in able to achieve 100% accuracy. With bankers, set daily goals to achieve sales and help them be successful. Meet with Manager everyday to set expectation and standards for Private Banking and how to acquire new customers in able to increase bank profits. I loved what I did because every day was filled with a new challenge, a challenge that might seem impossible but with the help of great team work with my manager we were able to acquire what we wants and achieved all the goals. We wanted higher goals for our bank and we successfully acquire that by helping the team."
good,I love my job at JP Morgan Chase and what I do but I do not like the fact that they push you to apply for different positions and openings then deny you the opportunity to advance or to get into programs that can help when your numbers speak for themselves. It's very frustrating even though the job itself is great.
good,"Chase is a great company to work for, their focus on Customer Service has boosted the succession of the company and has also created a fun and enjoyable environment to work in!"
good,the best job i have ever had. very understanding to employees along with customers.
good,"My day starts out logging into all the applicatons that is neccessary for me to perform my job duties. I learn about different loans each and everyday the status, the delinquency, the amount of times the loan has been in default etc. I wouldn't say that I have a hard day at work becuae my job consist of me self managing myself. I enjoy working for Jp Morgan Chase Bank, I enjoy the people that are surrounded around me and I also enjoy my manager because anytime I need help she goes the extra mile as in to helping me  find the tool seetings to get the answer I need. Overall this a great company."
good,"The branch I worked at was very slow traffic, so I assisted the bankers and managers with other tasks relevant to customer accounts. Detecting fraud was a challenge that always has room for improvement but the company gives training for the required knowledge/practices."
good,"Was a wonderful experience.  Had contact with great co workers and management.  Enjoyed time on the phones, each day brought a new situation."
good,"Great place to work for, ever changing keeps you on your toes!"
good,"set up teller drawer and audit it in, turn on computor at customer service center, go through folder for things to do and follow up on, check for appointments, finish up everything that was left from the day before such as filing and copies for loans.  Answere the phone and direct to appropriete area if needed. Make calles to set appointments for bankers, help customers as they come into the branch and direct them or help them out if there is a problem. Watch teller line so I can help out if needed.  Check the audit for the safe deposit boxes and work on that when I have down time."
good,Exellent pay and benefits! fun place to work with nice people. My branch always did stuff together outside of work. made great friends and always had pot lucks at lunch made work feel less like work.
good,I got good opportunity working in JP Morgan. I learnt Financial Process and Technical Skills.
good,"Easy access,"
good,"I spent the majority of my time in a cubical in front of a computer. But the more experience I got the more I was able to collaborate with my peers and solve complex problems as a team. My managers and co-workers were interested in ""streamlining"" and removing complications from the department. There was a significant learning curve to mortgage-backed securities which takes at least 6 months to surmount. Working in a laid back environment enables you to become successful at your job."
good,I enjoyed working at Chase. It was very fast paced and I learned a lot about banking and troubleshooting. The management was very helpful and always were available to assist. The hardest part of the job was the different types of customers and being responsible for managing bank accounts.
good,i personally like the company as they provide the good work culture. Work life balance.
good,"JP Morgan Chase is a competitive organization that have daily sales goals.  Prior to Chase; ive had several years in retail industry so i understood the importance of customer service but with JP Morgan Chase help, I've developed my customer service skill to a more ""mature"" way.  Also was given more responsibilities, like handling lunch schedules, loading ATM's and TCD's as well as managing the Vault.  Ive gained a great sence of pride through them for they helped mold me and helped me succeed within.  With the environment of 'sales' being so stressful, we had days that we goofed around within ourselves as well as customers.  Our branch was very laid back; friendly group of individuals and we became successful for it.  My manager at Chase knew my potentials and helped me get to were i wanted to be."
good,Lots of daily deadlines and fast paced friendly environment.
good,"I was an intern here for the summer of 2013 and really enjoyed the work culture. There was a great balance between work/life, and the management was fair. Everybody works hard at the Wilmington, DE office. The pace as a bit slow at time and I found myself looking for more work on many occasions outside of my direct team."
good,Company is great. We have trainings from time to time. No problem with co-workers. Managers are great and takes care of their subordinates well.
good,"They had great management, well structured and set up. This place was great with benefits and pay, etc. I'd work here again. "
good,"Learned about Excel Formulaes,Worked on personality Enhancement etc"
good,training and career growth are some of the key focus of the management
good,"Interact with clients on a regular basis"
good,"Interacting with great coworkers getting a common job done successfully."
good,"The overall experience was indeed good, there were good oppourtunities given and the work was excellent to be into"
good,The experience was wonderful and if I could I would be more than excited to do it again.
good,"JP Morgan Chase is a great company to work for. They are constantly teaching their employees new things and keeping us on our toes. Over the course of the 2 years I have been with JP Morgan Chase, I have learned how to build relationships with clients as well as co workers, to always exceed expectations and that hard work is usually recognized. You meet people that eventually become friends and people you can rely on. Although it can become tough to memorize and stay updated with new policies and procedures, once you figure out how to keep it all stored, work becomes easier."
good,"This is a great company if you want to advance and learn a lot. The company has great values and very good to its employee's, the pay is not the greatest for the amount of work you do but incentive's are really good. Benefits are amazing."
good,Working for Chase introduced me into the banking world
good,At work you can enjoy the presence and laughter with your co workers and managers. I have learned a lot about the mortgage business. I have been well trained on all aspects of mortgage.The hardest pat about my job is staying organized becaue your obligated to do so much for your loans.The most enjoyable part is the company events.
good,"Chase is a great place to work. I learned Chain of Title procedures. Entered data into the system for the next stage of the process. Most of the co-workers were easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was the essential job function itself (I can explain if need be). The most enjoyable part of the job was once a month we would have goodie day, like a potluck dinner if you will, and having a ""rush file"" night, because i like a good challenge."
good,I love JPMorgan Chase alot of oppurtunities and advancements.
good,I sit at a cubicle all day and take inbound and make outbound calls on deliquent mortgage loans from 30days past due accounts to foreclosed accounts.The most enjoyable part of my job is helping homeowners stay in there homes. My supervisor and team mates are great they make my work enviroment fun. The hardest part is sitting at a desk all day.
good,Supportive management that will help you build your career in whatever direction you want to take it within the company
good,Woking with JPMC was a nice experience for me.
good,I learned how to work in a team. my co-workers are very good very cooperative.
good,"A typical day at work, was an ever changing world. There was a lot to learn about the changing policies and procedures in the mortgage industry. The office was large, as there were over 200 loan processors, 200 underwriters and 200 loan closers. Management does well with what they are given, and closely communicate with the Team Managers, who then in turn communicate to their team. The hardest part was to have to turn down a customer who really needed the help, the best was to get the difficult customers financially to a place where they were able to survive."
good,I been working for JP Morgan and Chase over 5 years now. They offer great benefits and management team is awesome. Great company to work for but not exactly in the career field I went to school for.
good,"Chase is a pretty decent company to work for. I worked for them 3 1/2 years and it was a good experience. Just as many companies do, they did have their short comings. Some included the system crashing too frequently and the customers who had been on hold for long periods of time did not get the care and service they needed and deserved. Calls would be backed up 400 in que at times. For me, that meant something was definately wrong. That met there were many customers not getting the quality service they needed and many times they were frustrated by the time they got on the phone and we were still expected to push sales on them."
good,I enjoyed working at my cubical on the computer processing the checks and my co workers were very helpful.The hardest part was getting off late hours but other then that I really like working there.
good,"JP Morgan is a very liberal, fair place to work they are just as concerned about the employees as they are the customers. I only left this job because I wanted to come back home after graduation wish I stayed."
good,I loved working with my co-workers (including management). If you are productive your hard work pays off. I was proud to have worked for them.
good,"1. Productive enviornment which allows employee to grow professionally."
good,"I always feel very welcomed by my team. I help out at two branches and I never feel too overworked. The meetings and parties are great to participate in. There is a dress code but they give you funds for chase apparel. There is training mostly everyday, you never stop learning new things. Management is open if you have any questions."
good,"It is a stressful workplace, employees are a bit flexible, and most employees have worked there for a long time, longer than I have. Everyone is very friendly. I still maintained good relationships my former managers."
good,A typical day at work is about getting the job done in an efficient error free manner. There is a known desire to complete your work as fast as possible without standing over you.
good,Its a very slow paced job at the location I am.  The transactions we get are not a lot.  We do have chairs to sit because of how slow it is.  My coworkers here are super friendly.
good,"While working at chase I received great benefits and very comparable pay however, that is not the reason that it was a wonderful experience. Every manager or supervisor I had was kind, understanding, clear with expectations and objectives. Chase truly helps each person to move forward and develop themselves and take charge of building their own careers. I think that being empowered to own your own career is so valuable not only to the individual but to an atmosphere of professional motivated team players."
good,"This place has utmost respect for every employee working there. The cultural diversity and work environment is the best aspect about Jp morgan. No matter what designation you hold, each employee holds an equal opportunity to stand up for  bringing about a change in the business."
good,I love working for Chase I have been with the company 8 years. I have a passion for nursing and helping people it is the only reason I am looking to move on into a new career.
good,"Work Culture is excellent, hence good place to be for long tem career."
good,"In my time at Chase, I can't remember having a bad day.  I was received into a team environment as a teammate.  The only negative I can think of is the way initial training was conducted.  More emphasis should be placed on the initial training and the agreement between supervisors and front line staff, that most training happens on the floor as on the job training, needs to be understood."
good,"The company provides additional benefit to your health benefit package, and when you do the requirements, you may get extra money towards your co-pays and deductibles."
good,"When I started there I knew nothing about credit cards."
good,A typical day began with an encouraging team meeting to get energy up and positivity. Answering inbound calls in a fast paced environment making sure customer was happy and hitting  and going over daily sales goal. I was promoted to Peer Coach for new hire Training classes.
good,This is one of the best jobs I ever had. The only complaint would be lack of communication between management and employee on certain situations. If you had the desire for advancement the opportunities were there.  Employee appreciation was well displayed.
good,JP Morgan Chase is a great company to work for. Management is great because they really work with you on the floor and assist you during the day when needed. I've learned about the financial and banking industry and the back end of how things are done. The company has awesome benefits and great discounts. The hardest part of the job is denying people funds and not being able to help them with their account. The most enjoyable part of the day is working together with a team to help hundreds of people everyday satisfy their financial problems.
good,Its good and my pleasure working with this company. It has a good salary compensation and benefits. The people are friendly and culturally diversities is open with them. No discrimination.
good,I enjoy working for JPM Chase. Branding is great. Proud to tell people I work for them. Career opportunity is wide internally since Chase is a large organization and has 2 operating centers in my city.
good,I always had too much fun.  Very personalized training.  Excellent people and friendly people in other departments I had to interact with.  Compensation could be better though.
good,My typical day is working with my supervisor with whatever task she needs me to complete. The hardest part of the job is the noise level in the office because there are so many busy people around you working on phones all day. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people. I sometimes meet 2-3 new people a day.
good,"I was supposed to be moved up to Lead Teller, which is a big deal, I got the promotion, told me to apply online and nothing. I never got moved up and it took me until I was moving to leave. Great company otherwise."
good,"The environment is very positive, everyone is helpful and respectful towards others. People work with the highest levels of integrity. The pay is also one of the best in the industry."
good,JP Morgan & chase is really a nice place to work.The management is really supportive. The working envrioment & friends are too good. We used to have very much productive time.

Goal is to generate day-long enthusiasm, and have fun doing what we all do the best to generate the numbers towards our goal."
good,"Responding to customer, investor, or other 3rd party inquiries, researching and preparing documentation, or analyzing requests in accordance with established guidelines and determining appropriate course of action."

good,It was awesome! Great customers and also had someone on the floor to assist you with any problem solving issues.
good,"This started as a Temp job, which turned into 30 years without any interruption in service.  Since I was in various departments, I would go to work with eagerness to learn about mortgage servicing. I enjoyed my co-workers and we had fun, but we got the work done. I knew nothing about mortgages, until I started work in 1983 with Bankers Mortgage, later to become Fleet Mortgage, Washington Mutual, and now JP Morgan Chase. I learned to adapt to change.  The hardest part of this job is knowing that we are all leaving, due to the site closing, as I had envisioned myself retiring from there. I have enjoyed all that I have learned and also taught.  The part I really found a passion for was when I worked in Loss Drafts. That was when I learned I could mix my compassion for people with my job. I worked with the victims of Hurricane Katrina and the Moore, Oklahoma tornadoes. Those were only two of many disasters of which I worked.  My manager helped me develop my leadership skills and I found skills that I did not know I had. The Payoff Department is one I really liked also.  It was in there, that I found a way out of my shyness. My manager was wonderful for helping me. It is hard to say anything negative about my job, as I have always wanted to keep learning and the more I learned, I wanted to learn more. This has been my life and my family for over 30 years. I am grateful for having the opportunity to work with such a great bunch of people and managers, who cared about making the company a place where, now I find hard to say Goodbye to them."

good,"Excellent management & great place to work"
good,"I work in the Deposit Review dept. I started out with Chase in the telephone banking area.

good,"Excellent company to work for, good benefits. great management"
good,"Stressful job but I enjoyed working with coworkers and management was helpful in doing the job correctly."
good,Strong bank that has weathered may headwinds. The CB has cleaned house and gotten rid of many good people whom challenged the status quo. They are replacing them with junior people that do as they are told. New management is making bad decisions and taking a wrong turn. Steer clear for a few years until they learn from their mistakes.
good,"My day starts checking emails."
good,"JP Morgan as a company is terrific, just make sure you hook your wagon to the right team. Unfortunately, I ended up joining a department known internally as a sweat shop. Work/life balance is non-existent, employees are grossly over-worked with most putting in 7 days/week. ""Vacations"" simply mean taking a computer to another city and logging in remotely. The MD/ED are ridiculously opinionated, devoid of human emotion and masterful at deflecting blame. It's a shame because other teams/departments seemed to enjoy their jobs. So if you interview, be sure to ask very specific questions about the job culture and expectations."
good,Overall the culture is nice. Some coworkers are really professional and the remaining are being less than professional.  The employee survey shows that my function has  a much less favorited ratings. Hope we can improve in the years to come.
good,"Only work at JP Morgan if you want the brand as part of your resume. It is a great brand but working there"
good,"I have worked at Chase twice, I am not sure why they just cannot hire well-qualified managers. there are good people at the chase, but if you are an idiot apply for a manager job, you will get it. with that makes the job of the people at the bottom of the totem pole very hard. so many people end up with depression and anxiety over the PTSD caused by working here. The company is great, your manager would just drive you to want to die."
good,All about diversity. Amazing opportunities to advance and grow professionally. Learned a lot in this company that will translate well into future roles
good,"JPMorgan Chase Bank is a great company with endless opportunities for advancement.  Its mortgage banking operation is truly superior to the competition.  "
good,bad training easy work no stable job bad hours overtime lack of hours  not enough breaks to choose from if you have a 8 hour day to far from home pay ok
good,"Job security not there.  Poor management for mature seasoned employees.  Company promotions based on who you know, not what you know.  Talent over-looked."
good,I was new to the industry so I went in blind . If I knew then what I know now I probably would of done a lot better there and would of went to business banking and stayed away from retail.
good,"Although it was a great 1st job, it was easily mastered and eventually lacked the daily challenges that would have caused me to stay longer."
good,"Big company and all that comes with that. A high level of emotional quality is more important then a high level Intellectual quality. Stress is part of the deal in a zero defect environment, so be prepared for that."
good,"The company overall is amazing, however certain departments, their newer ones like Auto are struggling horribly and are not the most pleasant place to work. A lot of horrible systems to work with, processes, as well as often there is favoritism."
good,"Greeting client, answering phone, explain program requirements, working well with other employees, traveling 30 miles each way during rush hour traffic was difficult, enjoy working with clients"
good,"3 years with jp morgan all i can say is it is a very good company. Though they may not offer fun activities,they dont have fun room of any sort. But when it comes to work and life balance, i can say they do not offer much. I understand though that they are a bank with strict regulations, there isnt much family activities."
good,"Good company to work for but need better management and departmental goals. Does not match the pay of other departments and many decisions are deceptively made, causing low morale."
good,"I have nothing to say about this company there turn around record speaks for its self. The Company is a wonderful company , however the turn around rate is due to the  training and poor attitudes of the managers. It is impossible to run a company correctly when the rules change from person to person."
good,Good communication from senior management but there are too often requests for non productive work.  Tech spends their days putting presentations together instead of coding
good,"poor communication skills, Job is EE based . will make EE feel very used and keep you as a team into the don't need you anymore then will dump you like a piece of trash on the streets ."
good,Chase is a very busy and multitasking environment. I learned the essence of computer automation. I had a great staff and the proper tools to properly manager them. Our environment encouraged coworkers to work together. The hardest part of my job was to encourage upper management to follow through with providing approvals and completing their task. The most enjoyable part of my job was constantly learning new things as I headed various project initiatives.
good,Learn a great deal of unix command line and computer builds which help gain employement with Salomon Smith Barney
good,The hardest part of the job was the low pay for part timers.  Other times you were treated as a slave. I learned a lot about communicating with diverse cultures.
good,I was a consultant for 3 months. Being a consultant opened doors for me after my position ended. I am greatful for what I learned and the time I spentn at the company.
good,Ok entry level job. There is nothing special about it. Good training and the people are nice. The location was a little too far from my house and low pay.
good,Overall Good company to work for just need to find where you fit in and get under a manager that likes you and trust you and you will be fine if you do.  Obviously you need to produce at high level and be a low maintenance employee if so you should be fine!
good,I have been with the company going on 12 years and I dont feel my compensation represents those 12 years. The company has great benefits. But they are moving more towards a automated system to grade their workers taking out just about everything personal from the job.
good,I have meet all kind of friends and its so easy and laid back.you can talk to people have non spill container plus you can eat candy if its in a plastic bags
good,Bank with a heart.  Lots of attention to customer and brand perception.  Encouraged employees to donate time for community and health efforts.
good,This was a great place for myself to start and learn the role of an underwriter. There was not much growth though i had to leave the company for that reason.
good,"Chase is a very good place to work, I learned alot of things from there, but its broke my heart that when I needed them the most they let go of me. My mother passed away and I requested to off and they didnt approved it."
good,"good company to work for. However, in my district, there is very little room for growth."
good,When working for Chase For the first year and a half was awesome i enjoyed every bit of it i looked forward to going to work but the las five months of me working there was not what i would have expected they asked my manager to step down and the person they got to replace her have no compassion for others she would not input your time in and would lie to cover up hours that she was not working it became unfair.
good,"JPM offers the opportunity to learn a lot but you need to know to right people to advance."
good,"Now the management is not good"
good,"The job was originally a team lead position overseeing 13 employees."
good,"Culture was very diverse, but company overall is very ""big brother"", meaning a great deal of resources allocated to employee supervision, as the company appeared to be so worried about compliance, that it became more of a focus than actual customer support."
good,"The work was awesome, however, it was not guaranteed. Every day, they asked to be there 30-45 min before the shift started to see if you were 'chosen' to work and sometimes you got sent away. I never got the 40 hrs with them. I would have stayed if they offered more hours but I had bills to pay"
good,Working at JP Morgan is like living in New York City. It will give you the smarts business sense and technology advantages that most of the world does not have.
good,"JPMorgan Chase was formed in 2000, when Chase Manhattan Corporation merged with J.P. Morgan & Co. The J.P. Morgan brand, historically known as Morgan, is used by the investment banking, asset management, private banking, private wealth management, and treasury & securities services divisions."

good,Great company to work for.  Many  opportunities and work/life balance. Benefits are good.  Management requires a bit of work.
good,The leadership had a lot of drama that trickled down into the entire staff. Also COAL has basically no automation. Everything is done manually making it impossible to keep track of stats and important documents.
good,"A typical day at work is very routine. I grab my work supplies and log in, then get to work. "

good,Enjoyed working there. Managment are good.Good place to work. Co-worker are very nice.
good,"The department was fun and co workers were very helpful and i learned a lot the four years i worked the department, the hardest part of the job was getting use to new supervisors, some were good some were knowledgeable some were not, had about 5 different supervisors in 4 years, the last supervisor i had didnt seem to like me very much and made it impossible for me to preform my job, but overall i loved that job, and looked forward to work every day, all my coworkers were wonderful and would support me in everything."

good,"Chase Mortgage provided excellent pay and benefits. However,  there was always a question about job security. The job was very engaging and provide lots of new skill learning opportunities."
good,"Great company to work for with good incentive in earning cash bonus. Some of the upper management lack skills in customer service. When dealing with the public regardless of ones position,the golden rule should always apply  to speak, listen and treat others the way you want to be treated."
good,It was great bc sick time and vacation time were separate; had a pension; they have tend to do lay-offs every year.  The work was interesting and a perfect fit.
good,Job itself was rewarding & great people to work with. Learned a lot about the financial business. The hardest part of the job was manager always being upset.

good,"Having JPMorgan Chase on your resume is always a plus(in my opinion). However, when they DO offer you advancement, they offer your same salary. Virtually, I'd be doing more work for the same pay. Who would want to do that every day? It's hard to make a living off of it. If they offered OT, then maybe it'd be fine.

good,"A typical day would be a lot of phone work, follow up, data collection and interpretation, internal and external customer support. I learned a great deal about commercial treasury products, coming from a bank that did not offer treasury on cash management. The culture from a corporate level was supportive for those who wanted to advance but within departments it was lacking a bit. Management ranged from just doing their time to highly knowledgeable. The hardest part of the job was managing multiple implementation timelines for multiple clients. The most enjoyable part of my job was going on site and meeting staff that would be using the products being implemented, training the end user to the point where they realized how it would help streamline their workflow."
good,"Good pay, great benifits. Health insurance is really good. My job was relocated and I was forced into a position that didn't match my resume and was told I have to stay there for a year."
good,JPMorgan Chase & Company is a company where if you work hard and follow the culture you will advance like any other Fortune 500 company of course you have to play the corporate gane and if you're willing to do that you will advance. You have to perform as long as you perform and play the corporate game you are gravy.

Unfortunately, as others experienced the market crash in 09 that caused several to be adversely affected. I too was one of them, i received another opportunity in which, i never attempted to return. The benefits were great, the hours were decent, and management was helpful in setting career goals and plans."

I took found other opportunities with another lender.
good,"I loved my job at Chase until I was put in a position to violate my own ethics. When I refused, I was told I had a choice.

good,"The days were very repetitive with the type of work we provide. But the benefits and the perks of the job made up for the stress the work also gave the employee. The type of environment JP Morgan Chase provides also makes it easier for one to get through the day. The management, and the everyone in the building was always so welcoming. The hardest part of the job was just dealing with that one rude customer you get a day, and the equipment not fully working sometimes."

Was required to abide by the laws and regulations and to provide disclosures when necessary. I learned how to interact with many different types of people with different personalities and to engage effectively to help with all types of accounts with Chase. It personally helped me to learn how to speak to all different types of people with different backgrounds and moods. My co-workers were easily relatable and were easy to engage with given the job responsibilities. The hardest part of my job was when I personally did everything I could to help them and the answers or solutions weren't exactly what the customer wanted.

good,"A day in the life of a Mortgage Banker does not end.

Every day is spent on my laptop returning emails, calling potential clients, building rapport with agents and maintaining constant contact with my clients.

good,"JP Morgan Chase offered financial stability.  The work environment was a typical worksite for a call center; ie, noisy, busy, but quite often advantageous, due to the fact we could use our peers to assist borrowers.  I learned so much from working at Chase, from a mortgage standpoint.  Just knowing the law and the bylaws of Bankruptcy and Foreclosure proceedings alone, was a very intriguing part of my job function.  I enjoyed my co-workers.

good,this is a productive workplace. I have learned a lot working here. The co workers are great
good,"My managers are all right, but there isn't really a great sense of advancement.  It seems like you have to be there a very long time for you to be considered and even then, you'd have to change positions entirely. If you're starting off at 20 hours, you'll stay at 20 hours unless you help elsewhere."
good,I love it here I just wish they paid more. Being employed here I'm not able to have a 2nd job (its not allowed)  to make ends meet. Management is great!!!!!

good,"i was hired in 4/2007 in Iselin, NJ as a Sr Financial Associate in Finance supporting Subprime Production. I had the most wonderful manger and senior managers in the 1st 7 months. In Nov 2007, my husband had to change job and accepted a position at Bear Stearns (he worked at Credit Suise in NYC). The change was an impact of the subprime mortgage collapse. Fortunately, based on my performance in the 7 month perod, my senior mgmt approved me to work remotely in CA. Until the change last year that eliminated working remotely and WAH in the Finance Teams. There has been several employees impacted by the change in various states. I've been working on temporary assignments since. the change has been very challenging. my career growth has been halted. i'd have loved to work with JPMC until I retire at age 65 (in 20 yrs), however, there's very limited opportunities in my field (finance/reporting) within JPMC in Irvine/OC. I've been open to change career direction, unfortunately, relocating isn't an option for us within the next 3-4 yrs. Our son is a freshman in college in OC. We'd like to stay local to give him not only the financial support, but the moral support as well."
good,"A typical day at work, starts off at 8.00 am to 5pm on a good day, on a busy day around 6 to 6.30pm. I would come in managed my desk/organize and start my daily routine."
good,"The only problem I have with Chase is that they're taking my job away. Because of advances in technology, and the fact that they don't want a ""footprint"" in this area. I really enjoy the work and the people with which I work."

good,Overall Chase does their best to help employees advance in all aspects of life. Chase provides many resources to support a healthy lifestyle for their employees.
good,Great opportunities abound with JPMC.  The internal job boards are always populating new jobs and management is encouraging employees to move up and on.
good,"I highly recommend JPM for those interested, management expects long hours on the job but that often fosters a positive team dynamic. I would highly consider working there again if the right job came about."
good,"See above  "
good,"There was always a lot of work and changes in structure sometimes caused more work, but the company was flexible in terms of time off for appointments for me and my family."
good,I stayed for ten years because of the great benefits and flexibility. Depending on the manager You can have either rotating Saturdays or have to work nearly every Saturday and be stuck in the drive thru with no chance to learn new things.
good,"JPMC is a Professional, Friendly, productive, learning environment. its a multicultural environment with great respect of everyone. Flexible working environment help keep balance work and family time."
good,"JPM Chase is a great Bank to work at.           I learned a lot and career opposers available until they start migrating from Rochester, NY. They are great in providing and facilitating your educational experiences but slow in promotions."
good,"The management team only cares about meeting numbers, they don't care about the people. They do very little to show the employees that they are appreciated. They always say there is no budget. They don't communicate effectively. We have to be very knowledgeable to perform our job and we are not compensated fairly for what we do."
good,"Large bank made up of small communities( departments). Lots to learn, excellent benefits. "
good,"I really enjoy working with this company. The are willing to work with you on schedule, care about your work and home life. Very sales oriented if you are sales driven."
good,"Very large firm, but excellent environment, many opportunities for advancement if that is what you are looking for. The people are great. There is workplace politics so know that going in."
good,"The essence of formal corporate culture. Massive company with excellent internal structures, support, compliance and policies. The size of the firm is both a good and a bad thing.. it has buying power, name recognition and global market presence, however it sometimes moves slowly."
good,I work in a very secure facility. We are a pretty close group of people in the building because its not as large as some of the other Chase buildings.
good,"The truth no one really wants to work for 30 years and retire. Or get up 5 days a week, early and come home late. The hours here are horrible but the benefits are great."
good,Great thing about JP Morgan are its resources. Tons of ways to expand investment knowledge and obtain certifications. My only complaint is that they do not allow you to shift areas of interest too often.
good,"Good benefits, Good Job Work/Life balance. Average compensation, average job security, management changes frequently, good opportunity for training and networking."
good,"Awesome CEO, good mission, nice work/life balance, especially compared to typical tech companies.  Downside is that their whole IT side feels primitive compared to tech giants.  Super locked down, very restricted.  I couldn't even look at designers' portfolios because every external web site is blocked.  About a decade behind in modern software development practices.  It makes doing development like running under water."
good,"I worked at JPMC (heritage JPM) for 30+ years from software development training upon college graduation until my job was eliminated.   Throughout those years I was fortunate to be given the opportunity to be in a dozen different areas across several businesses.  So although I was working in one company, it felt like I had a different job with each one of my experiences.  In most cases, I started each of those positions without the skills necessary to do the  job well, but I was always provided the training and the time to learn what was necessary to excel at my tasks.   Most of my managers were supportive by assisting me to be successful at my job while allowing me room to take the initiative and creatively contribute to achieving project/organizational goals.   I was generally well rewarded for my efforts except as expected in down years for the company.   The best part of my experience were the opportunities to work with some very talented and dedicated individuals.   The company may stumble now and again but there always seems to be a strong desire to  do the right thing.  Even in my job elimination (which is not something one looks forward to) I felt that I was dealt with in an extremely fairly manner by being given 6 months warning and a very fair package."
good,"it was ok, I thought the culture was better, but what can you expect , beware of your colleagues, they can stab you in the back, dont trust nobody...."
good,"Very good place to start work life. There is a work balance culture. Depending on the department the workload varies from job to job."
good,"An awesome place to work, one of the employee oriented organisation which takes care of career aspirations of employees!! "
good,JP Morgan has good  benefits and the salaries are competitive. The management plays favorites with their employees and needs more training on diversity.
good,"JPM has a culture that empowers innovation and ingenuity to combat old, broken processes that seldom lead to optimal results for the end consumer. The prevailing theme articulated by our CEO, Jamie Dimon, is that JPM was once recognized as a financial services company with technologically advanced capabilities, but there is a paradigm shift whereby JPM is becoming a technology company that offers financial services. Our management teams are keen on adapting to the technology innovations sweeping the fin-tech industry to offer cutting-edge products & services to our customers. In this information-rich era, customers want to make well-informed financial decisions and JPM is positioned strategically to meet those expectations by aligning client needs with expert knowledge and technologies that enable a seamless product/service for clients across all walks of life. I am supremely proud of serving for this company every single day."
good,"More trainings and competetive work environment, hardest part of the job is shifting schedule. Most enjoyable part of the job helping other people (outside) like charity works. And team buildings"
good,A great place with a great culture to work for. The company pays for the training and are very patience in making the employees train to perform the job efficiently. The managers are very patience and down to earth. They try to understand the situation and try to resolve it without having any conflict and hampering work. Upper management is very helpful too. During holidays they had specially ordered lunch and snacks for the entire team. My manager was great. Would like to work for him again.
good,Loved company but they relocated from Long Island to Texas.  Benefits were great management except for in the bank branches was good. Had to change careers.
good,"JP Morgan Chase & Co. is an excellent company, the people are great for the most part and the work load is demanding. I like that the work load is demanding because I am a person who likes a challenge. I am known for being well liked, cool, and smart; so this position had fit me perfectly. However, being so young working with co workers who were twice my age wasn't so good for my youth. Without warning I was terminated from my positions only days before my probation period ended and I soon learned that companies do not need a reason for termination in the state of Delaware."
good,JPM Chace provided all of the tools needed to be successful.  They provided the training and the mentor support to insure a successful career.  Compensation was industry average with company stock purchase plan. .
good,"JP Morgan certainly hires talented and intelligent people. I've been impressed by many of my co-workers and those in related fields. Promotion can be difficult and enormously bureaucratic. Conventional wisdom is that leaving the firm is the fastest and more effective way to gain promoted and increase salary. Internal promotions tend to take years and are regimented into small, incremental gains."
good,I loved working at JPM.   Culture has changed over the years in a negative way.   I worked with wonderful folks and learned a lot.   Management needs to pay more attention to mid-level employees.   The most enjoyable part of my job was assisting both internal and external clients using my vast expertise in Cash Management Risk.
good,Chase has been a steady and reliable place of employment. They provided me with learning resources in order to further my knowledge base in my industry.
good,"TBD will elaborate more once new management is in determined. Great Staffers and team chemistry, but changes needed for retention. Growth opportunities and training are best in class."
good,"Large company that has some of the big corporate issues such as disconnect from upper management. "
good,"If you like helping people, you'll love working here! I enjoyed a fast-paced work environment with a relaxed managing staff. The only real cons were the long hours and at times limited communication."
good,Great place that invests into technology. Was there during restructuring so things got a bit confusing. Getting promoted was very difficult unless you have a relationship with the management from prior engagement.
good,Good experience while I was there; however did not see opportunity for growth.  Human resources is in your business all the time and interferes with operations as well.
good,"Every finance professional should once work in JPMC in their lifetime. The company provides steep learning curve, ample opportunities to grow and showcase knowledge and skills. Career continuation is not a problem if a professional is willing to take up new roles internally. "
good,"Great benefits, flexible hours.  I currently work 4x10 hours with Friday, Saturday and Sunday off.  Line of Business is unstable and firm is relocating further from home."
good,"Been here for 9 years, love it. Don’t feel like I get paid enough for all the work I do. I have so many clients I have brought on board over the 9 years and do not get paid to maintain them. We get paid on new customers and new products but I’m an always helping my existing customer because they are assigned to me. On an average day I get 8-9 calls from existing customers that need help or have an issue. Does not leave me with a lot of time to develop new clients."
good,I was hired by an temp agency. I enjoyed working overnight i just never had the opportunity to obtain a permanent position. The pay was great for a college student at the time.
good,Working at JPM demands that you give your best.  It is a challenging yet rewarding work environment.  The company encourages you to think and act as an owner.  It is a large company so there are always possibility of advancement or lateral movement.
good,"JPMorgan is a wonderful company to work for. It definitely has its challenges, but the learning and development opportunities as a result of those challenges are worth it!"
good,Good place to start your career as a fresher. Work pressure is immense but at the same time it improves your skill set and knowledge. Management can be more active in enhancing employee's growth.
good,It is a great company to work for. Our CEO is a visionary and retail banking has made many changes to show us how to cultivate a winning attitude. Work-life balance continues to be an area for improvement and career mobility to other areas of the bank outside of retail banking is also something being currently worked on by Senior Leaders.
good,Good Health Benefits. Great vacation policy. Lots of bank holidays. Lots of opportunities to move to different lines of business. Volunteer opportunities.
good,"health and fitness program is great,"
good,"One of the good company to work with with proper work life balance ............."
good,"Diversity is a staple in the daily life at JPMC."
good,"Love working for chase, wish they had more jobs in the Atlanta area. Tellers don't get paid enough for the amount of work that they have to do in a branch. If you want to promote to a personal banker you have to be with company for at least 2 years, seems unfair if you were laid off by the same company."
good,I enjoyed working at Chase due to friends made but management needed lots of improvement in communication and micro managing. they then moved to Plano which was too far for me.
good,"I stayed with Chase from when the site was Washington Mutual, thru the conversation to Chase and for almost 10 years. I walked out there making only 14.50/hour and that was WITH shift differential.  I don't feel I was paid nearly what I deserved if for nothing more, out of my loyalty to the company for so many years."
good,"...if you can deal with a degree of bureaucracy that slows down any progress.  It is by no means a culture that quickly adapts to change and it is partially due to culture and people who have possibly came up from operations sometimes over the decades and are the same title as younger professionals but ""know the business really well""."
good,Involved with transaction processing and general ledger control. State financials in a concise and neat orderly format so shareholders can understand and interpret.
good,I actually really liked my time working for Chase.  Despite being a formal bank it was a great culture and I learned a lot in my time while I was there.
good,"A day on the job varies on a day to day basis, but overall it is a steady job environment. It has definitely taught me multitasking skills, patience, and how to not let work ""get to you"". The people I work with are great and the customers I interact with are very diverse and each has different needs. "
good,"If you have been in the financial service industry and haven’t worked for Chase yet, you should! You will find it to be the easiest. Cross selling and sales are a breeze here."
good,"Great company overall. Would definitely consider rejoining JP Morgan Chase team again. After being acquired through a merger with Washington Mutual I found myself working there again. I have learned new sales and interviewing skills, as well as uncovering clients needs necessary to provide the best solutions and product placements."
good,worked first shift complete work that was provided be will to complete different assignments at there request very laid back job work overtime when offered
good,"Completed in-depth analyses for business-optimization projects."
good,"I truly enjoy for the company, they make sure that you are receiving a lot of training the allows you to do your job and exceed the companies customers expectation. "
good,"Responsible for branch operations, staff scheduling, performance reviews and supervision. Supported the Branch Manager with daily operations. Worked on the teller line and provided support to the tellers and personal banking staff. Managed vault and teller drawer audits on a daily basis. Managed P&L reports quarterly. "
good,"Decent place to work, just lack of chances to advance. The hours were good and the paid holidays were good.  Co workers were nice, family type atmosphere."
good,"Work wise hands would be full everyday, if no strings are attached."
good,My typical work week involved helping Customers with their everyday banking needs. I am always a friendly person and would like to find a Company that will let me advance and be able to work closer to home.
good,JPMorgan Chase has a great culture and a lot of opportunities for career growth. Most of the management is supportive of their staff and are great influencers of career growth.
good,"As a Private Client Banker, you must bring a great work ethic and a hustlers mentality as majority of your salary will be based on your performance incentives."

good,takes time to execute project.. Need approval through big chain. not much support for higher education..Have every tools you can think of to work with..
good,I started answering phones and worked up to a salaried position. Professional environment. Your job is not secure. Business lines are opening and closing. My job was eliminated and I haven't been rehired yet.
good,My day was spent answering phone calls regarding accounts. Trouble shoot with internet problems. Assist callers in understanding their account and what the current balance is.
good,"Pretty good company to work for, has its ups and downs. Technology is top rated. Great company to learn the business. Bonus and Commission could be better structured."
good,Work satisfaction depends on the commitment of your manager.  Proud to be involved in a company that is so dedicated generally to its employees and to the clients that it serves.
good,"Clients dealing on daily basis, handling money and transactions, loans and processing, communication and collecting documents, follow thru and knowledge of the banking laws and regulations and products."
good,The people I worked with were wonderful.  They were all dedicated to making it fun and safe for the kids.  The day passed by quickly because there was a regiment which we followed to keep the kids interested.
good,"I loved working at chase , we had great management team before they got changed , good environment , good hours , good location , good pay but looking for a full time job"
good,I enjoy my coworkers. We all get along very well. The work company is great. They have wonderful benefits and overall good employees. The company also has plenty of ways of giving back to the communities as well.
good,This job was challenging and I was able to master the skills and gain the experience needed to do an outstanding job in this position. I enjoyed the tasks involved.
good,"10 years will tell you that its a great place to work, but of course politics come into play when working for a business so large.  Great benefits and commission structure."
good,"Try investing more in reskilling of staff with legacy technology skills. "
good,"Great place to work, the people here are all great. This isn't the place for someone that can't handle negative calls especially if you are in the help desk. There are clear advancement opportunities, fairly lenient scheduling, paid vacations, and good benefits. "
good,JP Morgan Chase had allowed me the opportunity to be able to apply with other departments and positions. Benefits are good and they work with you regarding leave of absence.
good,Chase is great company to work for with their compensation and benefits. Be careful just like many banks if the market changes there will be layoffs even to those that have worked with them for many years.
good,i was hired for a contract position at JPMC. i was a great employee with numbers to prove and hard working. i was told if i continued working the way i am i would be hired full time. I was let go due to an unknown reason
good,"Opportunities globally in a range of sectors within the financial industry to gain experience within, whilst developing transferrable skills."

I deal with customers throughout the day solving their problems and helping with their Banking needs.I have acquired strong interpersonal skills and able to communicate with customers with ease.The job has taught me the leadership qualities and build effective relationship with employees within,which inturn helped me build respect, trust and help each other in the aspect of my job."
good,So many products it is easy to build a career. Most departments are very modern work accommodations such as compressed work week or remote work. This department doesn't offer or even consider these options.
good,"Great culture and organizational values, lots of room for growth, and amazing benefits."
good,Chase is dedicated to their employees. The only draw back is that it is difficult to be promoted from within. Most people find that you have to leave the company and then come back.
good,Typical day is sitting at my desk and working on the required items fort he day without being watched. You are responsible to complete tasks without much supervision. The managers really work hard to make sure you are happy and have everything you need. My co workers are great and very friendly.
good,"My employ with this company was a great experience, one that afforded me much growth on different levels such as knowledge of the industry and operations"
good,"I had a challenging and interesting role during my time at JPMorgan. The nature of the role being in the engineering field I was given the opportunity to manage data centres, review technical designs and see them through construction and oversee large scale projects. I also had the opportunity to maintain and developed all JPMC critical systems infrastructure and occasional travels international and national to support location teams."
good,Great company to work with . Amazing culture.Friendly and always ready to learn and improve coworkers and team .A typical day at work  is spent attending meetings and resolving roadblocks and delivering milestones.
good,I pulled and shifted files in my everyday job at JP Morgan Chase. I was always busy which I loved. Management was good co- workers were nice. The hardest part of the job was moving Gondolas by myself they were heavy and hard to control. The most I liked about the job was it was fast paced and I  was always busy.
good,"The company took very good care of its employees.  I was very impressed with many of the people I worked for and supported.  On the commercial lending side, hired the cream.  Can't say enough nice things about JPMC. The best overall financial institution I ever worked for."
good,A great company to work for and very Diverse. My co workers where amazing. The hardest part of the job was the continued change and often lay off process due to the mortgage industry.

good,A typical day at work was awesome. I learned how to appreciate other cultures. My co-workers were fun and very interesting. There was nothing too complicated about the job. I enjoyed learning about the company.
good,"My personal experience was management worked with me when I had personal problems, very flexible. They are not all about sales but more committed to customer satisfaction. Co-workers were easy to work with and help each other when days were busy and crazy. Had company pass a dish day. Well hardest part of the job when you are short handed or when you run out of big or new bill specially during holidays."
good,"Chase hands down has the best computer systems. That is after working for three different banks- Chase's are the best, because they put their money back into their systems that their employees use every day.  This makes the face to face interactions with customers much better since you're never worried about your computer crashing or freezing."
good,"I love what I do , branch is always busy my customers  are nice and I help everybody, my co-workers are fun and teamwork ,my manager is very professional and flexible,my hard part of my job is say no."

good,I have been given many opportunities to learn new skills within JPMorgan Chase. There is not much chance of job advancement where I work but that is because of the size of the place that I work but there is many opportunities to learn lots of new skills
good,"Good place to work but demanding. "
good,"I learned many things at Chase and had several responsibilities, the company has great benefits, the only negative part is that it is really far from my home."
good,"When I first got this job. I had never ten keyed a day in my life. I worked soo hard to prove to my boss that I wanted it to be here. I did whatever she wanted, stayed late, came in early, whatever it took. I eventually got the hang of it and before I knew it I was doing it just like a pro. My first Manager wasn't always patient but she learned how to teach me and for that I am forever grateful. I loved working for Chase. The company was amazing but some of the Mangers and Supervisors they could stand to learn a few things."
good,"The job at JP Morgan was where I learnt a lot of new things. The day was unpredictable, it could be a quiet one (rare) if the market is not too active, and quite hectic if it is active or if it is month end or beginning. I learned a lot of new things, areas which were hitherto foreign to me. The best part was building relations with my colleagues. Some of my best friends are from my office. Despite the heavy pressure at work, we supported each other for our sake rather than for company's. Some days were quite long extending to 12-13 hours demanding a lot of our energy and attention. The best part of work was of course my colleagues and the relations that were built in the process of spending majority of our waking time in the office rather than with the family!"
good,I enjoy my job because I was able to help our customer through a very difficult time.  They rely on me to help them on what steps to take next in order to help them get new accounts establish due to fraud and what they will need to do in order to establish their identity.

good,"Talking to clients overseas and resolving their queries, learned about time management ,professionalism,and teamwork"
good,"JPMorgan Chase & Co. is definitely a great place to work at.  My time there was valuable as I was able to connect with co-workers and learn more of the banking industry.

good,"Company has a CEO and Executive Staff that make J P Morgan Chase a leader in the Finanical Market.  The Facility that I was employed at in Florence, SC did not have the staff/management that could meet J P Morgan Chase expectatio.It is not surprising when the Company made an expected judgement call to close the facility.  The people employed at the Florence, SC location really shot themselves in the foot by promoting employees to management position due to friendship association that did not have the experience, leadership ability, morals and/or educational training to perform a mid-point performance level."
good,"Love this job. Great People, Great benefits..... Lots of overtime.... Just be sure to communicate with management... Open door policy is great. wish i could go back"

good,"Comfortable but professional attire a must.  Very successful company.  Strict but fare management.  All workers divided into family like pods per dept.  Loacated in heart of New Yorks Business District, transportation to work could be a job on its own.  "
good,We were assigned about 250 deposits to process in eight hours.  All money had to match the screen at the end of the day.  Draws had to balance daily.  Avoiding errors at all cost.

good,"Im looking to advance my management career after a successful 7 year term as a Branch Manager with JPMorgan Chase."
good,Everyday you get logged in to the computer and other systems that we had at chase and take calls from customers and had to fallow a strict schedule. Schedule was very strict and every single second was recorded so it was crucial that you looked at your schedule everyday and made sure what time you have to do certain things or you can be docked and it will affect adherence.  Every day you learned something new because there was so many different situations to learn from so you absorbed information everyday. My mangers were really helpful anytime I had a question or an escalated call they were right on top of it. All of my co-workers were fantastic as well we would all have different situations everyday and we would talk about it and just absorb information from each other to become more self sufficient and rely less on our managers. Hardest part of the job was fallowing the schedule right it was always changing. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers and learning new things everyday not just about banking but many other things as well.
good,"Challenging hours and tasks, keeps you on your toes, very rare to have a day without much work. Great scope for learning and career progression."
good,"- Great atmosphere"
good,"Working in the mortgage industry for several years has provided me with the hands on experience in managing mortgage loans, analyzing clients’ needs and proposing and designing programs based on those needs. I have more than a handful of satisfied clients in my list and have been recommended by them to many prospective clients. Furthermore, I have a demonstrated ability to verify information on loan applications and obtain any additional relevant information. Appreciating the fact that service knowledge is not the end all of working successfully in this line of work, I would like to stress on my abilities to be assertive, team oriented and comfortable working in a fast paced environment"

good,"Chase is a good place to work if you are money hungry, that's just my opinion being that I have worked at other financial institutions before. Caring for my customers was my number one priority, but the companys number one priority is to CONVINCE them to buy no matter what"
good,Overall great company to work for with excellent benefits and good coworkers
good,"Best job I ever had til ""T"" the new auto finance CEO came in and ruined the auto finance department nationwide...now it's just another corporation with the wrong people in charge."
good,"As a lending manager your primary role is developing a team and helping your people sell more loans and get them closed, on time.  From recruiting, to sales training, product knowledge training, and pipeline management, there is never a shortage of things to keep you busy. Prioritizing your time and spending time where you get the most bang for your buck is crucial.  I spent most of my time helping my team grow and close loans, and recruiting experienced originators.  I have a passion for sales, and for mortgage lending; being able to combine them both has been one of my best priveleges."
good,"*learn alot about prepper and remittance processing"

good,"I enjoyed working at JPMC.  It is a fantastic company and the people were friendly and helpful, for the most part.  It was also fun to be able to assist people I knew or colleagues I may have never met, depending on the situation. The drawback was, the only way was to move up, in my situation was to take a big step back, financially and join another team, outside of my own skill set.  I considered it but in the end, decided it was time to make a move down to Louisiana, as the south is my home."

Management doesn't micro-manage, but they are very helpful when you realize an area that you may need growth in. Coworkers are very positive and helpful. The hardest part of the job is trying to help customers without over stepping boundaries. The best part of the job is definitely knowing that you are helping at least one person a day."

My co-workers ranged greatly and we were always a part of a team that was encouraged to work and grow together. The hardest part of the job was to stay on top of the every changing policy and procedure guide lines. What I did enjoy each day was the work oriented fast pace environment.

good,"I have been with the company for a few years now and have worked in multiple locations in a few different capacities. Chase as an overall company is a great place to work with great people that really want to see you exceed. I have worked with very supportive managers and co-workers. But there are a few that could care less about you and are out to ""get you"". A few managers will LIE right to your face and try to sabatoge you. With a company this big, you will get your share of personalities. This is why I have moved from one position or location to another. Move is constant if you want to move up in your career. The work-life balance is fair based on what I hear from people at other companies. You have great benefits and paid time off."
good,"Easy to get along with other and love to coach and mentor to help the team, always looking way to acquire and deepen with every opportunity presented"
good,Great benefits. Great management support. Work life balance. Big company to find different opportunities to find your career path. I was personally able to start out at a senior teller and work myself all the way up to Private Client Banker.
good,The training provided at JP Morgan Chase is phenomenal.  Working in retail also provides hands on experience and engagement opportunities with other colleagues with different job titles.
good,Good place to work. Would recommend. Company is client focused. Technology focused and encourages innovation. Provides a wide range of training options for employees. Benefits aren’t bad. But difficult to get promoted and advance in the organization.
good,"J.P. Morgan was a great place to begin my career. I regularly worked with intelligent people who were invested in my career development. Given name / status of the company, I also had the opportunity to work on a number of high-profile, interesting projects."
good,"The 1111 Polaris building is casual, however, not all buildings are and you should always dress business attire when interviewing.  Some departments have a very liberal dress policy, some are strict, never assume."
good,"A typical day at works starts at least 30 minutes early in order to manage my pipeline. Taking inbound calls, writing accurate loans, providing good customer service, answering questions. Listening to customer needs in order to provide good options to meet customer goals. Reviewing my emails."
good,"Depends on what department you work in, "
good,"Good company as it suggested in the beginning"
good,Excelente banco para iniciar tu experiencia laboral
good,Good company to work for. Many locations which makes it convenient. Consistently changing procedures being adaptive is important. Days can’t get very involved time management is crucial
good,"The company as a whole is amazing and I frequently let outsiders know that as well. My department however is still fairly new and figuring things out, which makes it challenging at times. There is also no current room for growth in the dept either. Management has encouraged us to seek growth outside and comeback down the line. I do think the work itself is fairly easy, but they make it complicated. I’m paid well though so I won’t"
good,"Seems like most of their IT jobs are located outside of Chicago as they seem to focus on cheaper labor areas like TX, OH, FL. Good benefits and 401k match"
good,Great company but with the changes in technology they have been going through layoffs. Benefits at the company really benefit employees for personal leave and great allotment for vacation and sick time.
good,I learned a lot of knowledge for OTC counterparty credit risk and Risk weight calculation. How data feeds downstream and how a calculator process these data to generate the outputs. I also got educated about stress testing.

good,"I would definitely recommend this great company.  It has smartest, most ambitious people working for it.  People get rewarded with a promotion for working extra hours and going above and beyond.  There are lots to do.  It is an exciting place to work in."
good,"Honestly I would have never left JPMC had my husbands job not relocated. He was sent to Memphis TN and that forced my resignation.  I loved my occupation / career and work family. After being there for nearly 23 years, I never intended to leave. I enjoyed the culture and responsibilities.  If there was any difficulties it was losing bonuses. Not only did we lose the ability to receive bonuses but our production requirements continued to increase, but our staff decreased. I am sure this was a result of the lean philosophy."
good,"The job was very fast paced and involved working in Securities Operations as it pertains to domestic and global Corporate Actions, Settlements and Income areas.  The management team was very knowledgeable and provided consistent communication regarding job related issues.  Although the job can be stressful, the best part is that you learn different things constantly as a lot of the information is never quite the same thing."
good,"Biased an and favoritism"
good,Very enjoyable place to work. Management is always on top of anything you come to him about. Very flexible. They're always coming up with new ways to boost morale.
good,"I was brought on to assist during a time of acquisition by another organization. While I was a contractor; the experience with my colleagues, is one that I'll not forget. It was fast-paced, yet extremely rewarding."
good,"I  was a member of a great company and team were I was able to consistently exceeds the expectations set. I've been able to demonstrate leadership and effectively adapted to change, and worked under some extreme circumstances yet still performed exceptionally.high."
good,"The type of work was highly specialized in nature, requiring personnel with a niche fitting. Immediate management was outstanding. There was a significant disconnect with higher, executive management. The work was challenging and rewarding, with great benefits. I would work there again and recommend it to the appropriate candidate."
good,You will know what exactly is expected of you from the moment you are hired. Make sure that you enjoy the people you will be working with from day to day because that makes a world of difference! You will be working with the same people for up to 11 hours a day everyday make sure your work environment suites you!
good,I worked at JPM for 15 years. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with on a daily basis and helping clients with their financial needs.
good,"Some branches are busy and some aren't-- mine was so it was fast paced and rarely dull. Company prepares you well and gives lots of opportunities to build new skills or practice old ones. Company culture was great, although not every branch is an example of best company culture-- I'm sure you'd find that among all companies."
good,"Very good environment. I like to work at JPMC"
good,Excellent work life balance.  Remote access supported to meet parental needs.  Employee advancement and training supported by the company and available if management includes it in their employee goal setting
good,"If you're looking for a great job come join the team. The workplace culture are easy to fit, and you will master your job. The on hands training helped me a lot. Come Join the Blue Team!!"
good,"Chase overall is a solid place to work. I've seen the good and bad of working for the company. The annual raises are Terrible. The best way to make money is through promotion within the organization. That being said the time off is really good. At my level, I was able to have 6-8weekd PTO."
good,Check email from clients and colleagues. Response to any questions from clients or colleagues. Check with coworkers for the agenda of the day. Review work for qualities before sending with timely manner.
good,"work day went well, i enjoyed working with friends."
good,"however is understandably so with everything at stake in todays environment. Lots of focus in the last couple years on high performance work environments, agile transformation, and colocation. Work/life balance has in turn diminished. If you are a minority in any sense of societies recent definitions, you will bode well at this company."
good,This job was the start of my success journey so far. Had a huge experience of 10 years with this organisation. Apart from Night shifts all was good at JP Morgan
good,"JPMC offered me the opportunity to learn and grow in the business and financial world. My position is production and quality driven with reports to senior management, as well as federal regulatory agencies. The team atmosphere within my department is professional and independent, but not to the exclusion of assisting peers with difficult analysis. The hardest part of the position is making the investigators who are a part of the inspection and review process understand the why behind the results of an investigation that has been completed, as they are investigators in title only, and would be otherwise incapable of performing the in depth financial investigation that was conducted to complete the reporting. Truly, the most enjoyable part of this position is the freedom and flexibility to take time off when needed or to work remotely (from home)."
good,"JP Morgan & Chase Co. is good company to work with.   Good working culture, you will get good recognition for your work. Lot of trainings and learning modules to enhance your knowledge and skills."
good,"I just wish they paid better! I would never leave if they valued their employees on a monetary level more. I think they really do care about clients, are making advances in banking that is cutting edge, and safeguarding their bank as best as possible!"
good,"Working at JP Morgan Chase has been an enjoyable experience and has provided me with learning and experience that I will always carry with me as I continue to progress throughout my career.  It is refreshing to work for a company that values diversity, inclusion, employee satisfaction, and professionalism as I do in my daily life and career.  "
good,"Chase gave me the opportunity to grown and develop my skills into an exceptional manager. However, due to a growing family and immediate need to work days, I forfeited my 15 years of  service to swap companies."
good,I really have nothing to say about this company. You would have to apply and get hired to fully understand what it is like to work for a company like JPMorgan Chase.
good,"My first year at chase flew by, great co workers, great benefits, great interactions with customers. But as I approached my yearly mandatory qualifications for further advancement everything came to a screeching halt. No opportunities to move up, and after a year of patiently waiting I am seeking advancement elsewhere. They sell it as a career type job, with a bright future for each employee, but it has not met my standards in that department."
good,JP Morgan is one of good companies to start a career with. many things to learn except slow growth. JP Morgan  has always inspired me by the way it grooms and self motivates the employees.
good,"The technology is one of the best in the banking industry. The pay is on the lower side for the entry level positions, but advancement is encouraged. Need excellent customer service skills."
good,"Great vacation and benefits. "
good,"Great company to work for and fun activities. Great medical benefits. I worked for Chase 8 years, unfortunately I got laid off, otherwise I would still be there."
good,"Great benefits, career development and promotions possible if you want them. Salary is great and work life balance a plus in some positions. Good locations for most offices"
good,Great culture and benefits but little chance for promotion beyond manager role. Regulatory pressure is excessive compared to other banks but overall a good place to work
good,I loved this position and the company. I receive great benefits and enjoy my job. The only thing I don't enjoy is my manager. This person regularly harasses coworkers with little to no consequences and often threatens peoples job security.
good,"It's a very busy branch where can help me to accumulate business knowledge quickly. However, I have to meet with some rude customers and keep trying to improve customers' experience."
good,Fun company but unfortunately not secure job. Management is willing to give you all possible training to succeed in your role. Most enjoyable moment was when they provide massage for us.
good,Good place to work and get experience however the incentive pay is very difficult to get and the salary pay is only average. Advancement to higher management or executive positions is very difficult.
good,"A typical day at work was working with clients to  ensure that requirements were met, resolved all errors, maintained all accounts, resolved all problems. Interacted well with all  customers and collegues."
good,"•	Responsible for Enhanced Due diligence reviews of Individual and Non-Individual customers."
good,JPMorgan Chase is really good at listening to the employees and for taking out the time to honor and reward the top performers for all there hard work.
good,Enjoyed the opportunity to advance to a department recruiting within for new skills and to be more valuable to company.  Management in Disputes lacked the assistance for smooth transistion.
good,"process transactions, balance drawers and  making payments. management can be better no overtime workplace depends on your team hardest part of the job is taking in the disrespect from customers at times. most enjoyable paid time off"
good,"the day of work was done my yourself do you job and move on when completed reach out if a co-worker needs help. I answered question for world wide companies like Amazon, Apple and Google"
good,Over all great hours. Co-workers are not very social. Management is not a friendly team of people. Wouldn’t recommend to someone just starting out in customer service. Would recommend for someone who has lots of previous customer service experience. More of a low class laid back employment.
good,"I have learned a lot working for this Bank. I was able to prove"
good,"Working for Chase was a great place"
good,Chase is a great company to work for. They provide excellent benefits and time off.  Advancement opportunities are there you just need to be flexible with working hours and be consistent.
good,Chase was an amazing company to work for.  With all the promotions available. The pay was excellent and bonus was a plus. They benefits were fair at cost as well as the 401k they offered was better than most companies
good,Good place to work..benefits are excellent. Competitive wages and diversity is amazing. Paid time off helps and jeans all year round. If I weren't relocating I wouldn't leave.
good,"Some people are friendly, some are not. Know your stuff. They mostly hire part time employees.  sorry I have nothing more to say. It has been a good place to work at"
good,"The date entry program is very vigorous and fast paced but it's a temporary/as needed position so it balances out well. There are peak seasons where there is a lot of hours to put in and then there is a try spell. The work is easy, they have a nice spacious break room with vending machines, refrigerators and microwaves. They also have lockers for you to place your items"
good,Pay is really good I like working for chase my main reason Im leaving is that ill be moving and wher I will be moving there is no bank close by........
good,"The company is pro-career advancement however, you are required to work extended hours especially in the retail area. There is very little work/personal life balance."
good,Managers encourage growth of employee skills and pursuit of internal advancement opportunities.  Employees are encouraged to participate in business resource groups and company sponsored volunteer activities in the community.
good,"This job is great if you are looking for benefits for a casual job. The job work is not hard, and the health care cost is phenomenal based on the pay you receive. I would 8/10 recommend this job to anyone looking for benefits as well."
good,"JP Morgan Chase was a great company to work for. Decent pay, although less than competing banks. I like how fast paced it is and the opportunity for growth is huge if you make it known to management. Hardest thing is needy customers, but that's like anywhere. only reason I'm leaving is because school and for the program i need to not work Saturdays which Chase will not accommodate."
good,Great environment to work with and coworkers  are very helpful. It was hard to meet selling goals but supervisors were very understanding. We should focus more on helping customers then selling products.
good,"Organized and structured in terms of growth, training etc. Completely supportive in terms of Ethical conduct."
good,"This company will train you so much that if you ever leave the company you will notice the difference in quality of service. I noticed that when I left the quality of service other companies offer was not up to par with the service chase gives. I found myself showing my new coworkers the ""Chase way"" to help them along the way in their position even when we worked in a different office. Great Company, Great Service, Great Training. Always room to learn and grow."
good,JP MOrgan was a great company to work for.  They bought the Retail section off Bankers Trust. Learning and Development was a strong focas for this company.
good,"This is a bank and a call center. Very fast paced changing environment. There are many opportunities for change, advancement, etc. It was difficult to keep the balance of expected time for calls and doing what needed to be done for each customer. I felt it was a great experience doing the job and knowing the company supplied many benefits such as paid vacation, personal time, sick time, 401k and pension."
good,Good work culture . Employee benefits and work life balance. Very good appraisals and opportunities to learn. Gives good onsite experience as the company operates across the world.
good,I was the head receptionist. Loved greeting clients as they came in. The staff was very friendly n always worked as a team. Manager held weekly meeting with staff to make sure everyone was running there pipelines accordingly.
good,I think Chase is a great organization and would recommend this employer to anyone looking to work with one of the best customer focused financial institutions.
good,"Based upon the position I held, a typical work week is 60-80 hours a week based upon high work volumes and demands.  I gained extensive knowledge as a Training Manager and Vice President of Training.  I feel I could work with any large corporation in either of the aforementioned roles."
good,Chase is a great place to work with fantastic benefits. The company is very family friendly but certain lines of business are a lot more stringent about required work hours and mandatory lunch.
good,"Great company to work for however like everywhere else, there is office politics, challenges moving internally.  It seems hard to get substantial raises, it appears that we have to leave the compy and then come back to grow our salary."
good,I worked in the Global Business & Document Service. It was a high production environment that was under deadline restrictions. The job was fulfilling but did come with its own challenges. A moderate employee turnover in the department lead to the need to pick up slack and work hard to meet business demands. The managers and staff were very kind and did all they could to see the employees were taken care of and that the work was able to be completed uninhibited.
good,"Great place to work with good diversity at work place.Innovative products and solutions with customer centric focus."
good,"The Department's expectation is to accomplished our daily BAU as well as move forward with the Innovation and projects."
good,Developing multi-media courses; training on various software products; vendor interaction; acquiring technical trainers; visiting with technical personnel to ensure technical training
good,"After logging onto the phones, check emails to be updated with any changes or updates, from the day before. Begin taking calls and helping customers with high balance accounts."
good,A really great place to work. Good environment. Good people. Plenty of opportunities to grow. I hated to quit but a growing family caused me to change my priorities.
good,Fun staff and relaxed environment.. Every one encouraged you and  everyday was a challenge. Learnt good communication skills . Management was supportive but no room for growth
good,"Work place, Environment and People are really good! "
good,"It was a pleasure working with the team at JP Morgan Chase. "
good,The Market Managers micromanage the Branch Managers and they intern do the same to the bankers. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the customers.
good,"The company is great, the location is good, management is fair, the culture is relaxed and intellectually challenging. most enjoyable part of being there is ability to work from home."
good,"My department is in customer response analytics, and wants you to be a SAS programmer for analytics.  I don't want to be a sas programmer, but I am good at supporting the Medallia application, and my customers like my work.  My bonus has been cut the last 3 years and I have not had a raise in 3 years.  I feel unwanted."
good,"The company has changed a lot due to many regulation changes and industry changes. The incentive plans keeps changing and you are expected to work three times harder to be able to earn what you earned the previous year. They keep cutting commissions from personal bankers and the personal bankers are tellers most of the time. The yearly bonus for relationship bankers and personal bankers is gone as of this year. They keep cutting and cutting, it's impossible to make a living as a banker. Worse yet is the management has gone to trash, hiring managers from Wells Fargo (not all of course) implementing their ridiculous sales tactics!"
good,If I could get an interview tomorrow I would drop everything and go. It was a great place to work at Management was so relaxed and always treated you good.
good,Great place to work!  The people were awesome and were the managers!  Learned a few things while I was there.  It was definitely one of the great companies to work for.
good,"Anyone looking for a fast pace job this is a good place to be. Crossed training in multiple areas. From sorting mail, to opening mail,and processing the work that come in."
good,Great work environment. Unfortunately they went out of business. Compensation was better than average. Work life balance was great. Management was great.
good,JP Morgan Chase was a great experience for me. i experienced a lot of professional growth. obtained and preformed in various professional positions very successfully. its a very fast competitive pace industry that  pushed to me to be the best in my departments. I actually loved the drive and competitive force it provided me.
good,Chase is one of America’s and the world’s most successful banks and its credit card division one of the largest. It’s considered an exceptionally well managed enterprise.
good,pretty relaxed environment started work at 6 am and ended at 2:30 which was great was able to work at my own pace but still needed to meet certain goals. we were allowed to listen to music while we worked and there was always employee appreciation events. the only downside was the pay
good,"The job itself is extremely easy to do as long as you are careful and precise of what you do, the only challenge is dealing with angry customers and trying to make them understand that you are only doing your job."
good,"Sorting mail trays and loading machines to encode all payments received, handeling of high tech machines making sure all work that comes in is processed in a timely."
good,"Chase Home Mortgage is a very diverse division of JP Morgan. I worked with eight different teams over eleven years and enjoyed learning many new software and added skills each time."
good,"Many opportunities exist in major markets:  Chicago, New York, Ohio, Texas, and California but limited opportunities in smaller branch only markets.   For the advancing professional you will want to be able to relocate to fully optimize your career with this company"
good,This company allowed me to build and expand a fixed income trading desk that was within Federal and State regulations!  It was one of the highlights of my professional career.
good,"Great company, great projects, lots of opportunities for internal mobility; however promotions are very limited. Great people to work. Jersey City commute could be challenging if you commute by car"
good,"Very Satisfied With Employer.  Employees, along with customers, were all treated with respect and dignity.  The cultural and the people thrived on honesty and integrity."
good,Great company to work for but the base pay they provide is too low for anyone to be able to live in todays economy. The commissions are getting lower and lower and the company is the only one benefiting.
good,"Firm offers great benefits including health, dental, vision, life insurance, 401K matching, stock purchase option, paid disability leave (16 week paid parental leave) and employee discounts."
good,"Loved this company and management, left to pursue another career avenue. Great place to be, great people, awesome leadership - the best I have seen in a corporation."
good,"I have worked for this company for 12 years and continue to be proud of everything they represent and support. Management is wonderful to work with, there are amazing development opportunities, and resources to grow."
good,Room for advancement. Regular monthly reviews to help improve and give kudo's. Employee's and management are professional and cheerful. Clean and a cafeteria.
good,"I believe that Chase made more efforts to appreciate their employees than recognized for. Granted some efforts were small but as the saying goes ""something is better then nothing"". I would have preferred more opportunities to receive money/bonuses versus luncheons but it wasn't make or break for me. I just think that money motivates people more than anything."
good,"My job was eliminated, but I was not given any notice ahead of time to find a new job. I was given 45 days after I was told my job was being eliminated though."
good,"As a whole, JPMC is a great company to work for. It is such an enormous place that many different subcultures exist, so if one doesn't suit you, another very well may."
good,"good place to work"
good,"If you want to know your limits and improve yourself, I would recommend this position. You will learn a lot and grow, however, I would not advise if you don;t intend to pull your weight."
good,Working with smart people is always different and special. You will learn every moment. Also It is truly chalanging  you may have to sacrifice your life.
good,"While working part time in their call center, It was extremely fast past with a vast majority of you time being spent on the phone with a customer. Due to being part time, Upward mobility was non-existent."
good,JPMC is a great place to work. It creates a very competitive environment for career advancement.It is a place worth recommended for financial services career advancement.
good,"Typical day at work includes a variety of tasks including but not limited to - running meetings, updating project schedules, performing business analysis, updating test schedules, etc. JP Morgan Chase is a great employer with great benefits."
good,I like working with the people I enjoyed working there.very nice company to work for. A typical day at work is opening 700 plus bags for distribution and that was a fun day of open and open bags.
good,"Liked working environment and people. Hi-tech communications. "
good,A typical day involved conducting technical support for credit card customers. It was challenging to meet their expected requests to remove or problem solve their accounts.
good,The organisation provides excellent working environment and management follows and believe in the inherited culture. It provides multiple learning and development opportunities while at work as well as in training sessions.
good,"I really enjoyed working with Manpower reps Josh Davis.  He was a great rep.  Most of the JP Morgan employees were nice to work with.  I enjoyed what I did, kept you constantly occupied"
good,"I hold a Senior Project Manager role within the company.  As expected with PM roles, hours can be long and work can be challenging at times, which is no problem.  It's the constant re-org that's done.  I've been with the company for 7 years and have had 8 different managers and this wasn't because I applied for different positions - it was all due to re-orgs within the company"
good,"Great place to work. Moving up the ladder required much time in company with little pay. Great for high school graduate to begin a career, not ideal for someone with responsibilities."
good,"Productive and fun place to work, been here for 5years now. Everything been great, besides the pay for the work it's sorta hard to get what you deserve. A lot of people say it's better coming in from outside to get better pay, other than that part I love the company."
good,The management style changed dramatically and with that change so did the atmosphere. I never felt like what I contributed was enough. I was with Chase for 6.5 years. I had opprtunity for advancement but I didn't want to go into the areas available.
good,It has a lot of good benefits. A lot of woman work there. They really need there jobs. There is not a lot of room for advancement. The management is good but switches quite often.
good,"Overall a great place to work. Learned a lot at this company. Had some great managers, made a lot of friends. The company is evolving.  I do miss the good old days!"
good,Enjoy my work on a day to day basis with a new learning everyday. Learned about various aspect of Production Mgmt. and client service.Enjoyed a lot he.

good,"It's nice company to explore career and more skills can be learn and growing here.. "

good,I enjoyed my time working for JPMorgan Chase. The pay could have been better but my performance could have been better.  I would recommend if they offer the positions you are seeking it is a good opportunity.

good,"great place to start off career - smart people who are willing to help."
good,"Very repetitive work, fun kind people, management needs a bit more structure especially training. great benefits. i thoroughly enjoyed working with my peers but it isn't everyone's cup of tea."
good,Your advancement depends on the team and Line Of Business you are in. Lack of exposure in back office roles. Mobility a big plus.
good,"i'll come to work 15 mins before my shift starts. Ask the manager where he/ she wants me to work...the drive thru or the lobby.Log in on the computer, fill up the section i'll be working on with all the supplies I will need during my shift. Get my cashbox box then start serving customers with their needs. The hardest part of the job is when the manager tells us tellers one thing and tells the customers another thing that makes us tellers look like we don't know what we are doing. what I love about being a teller is that I get to help clients with their needs. I just love putting a smile on their faces when I help them with their requests. I love my co-workers. We all treat each other like a family."
good,"great place to work, management works with you, lot of area to grow, able to move around to different locations since it is such a big company, highly recomand it"
good,J.P Morgan is a very good place to work hard and get awarded. You need to learn how to perform under pressure and multi task.
good,Really enjoyed working for this company over the term of 5 years I would go back to work for this company. I actually learned a lot from the job and they have gave great references for my present jobs.
good,Loved working there. Everyone I had the pleasure of working with was kind and very helpful when I was training as a temp. Wish it had turned into a full-time job.
good,"This fast paced, culturally diverse firm is a tremendous organization to work for.  Plenty of opportunities to both increase one's knowledge base and share gathered experience with others."
good,I really liked working for Chase.  I worked in a high volume branch with a great staff.  I would still be with the company however I was in a position where there wasn't a pay raise available and there were no open positions in my for me to advance.
good,"JPMorgan Chase was a great company.  Great chance for advancement.  Work schedule balance.  Great pay and benefits."
good,"There are a lot of great things to say about this company, to keep it brief, they care about their employees and there is tremendous opportunity for growth."
good,"Every day at work was a wonderful day.  "
good,"Lovely environment, friendly staff and management. hardest part of the job was the complex system, it was a learning experience."
good,"For me it is a great job, the people make it a great place to work. the culture is awesome and it has amazing people working there."
good,"JPMorgan Chase is not only a large global firm, it is also a fun place with diverse and rich employees from all over the world."
good,"A typical day at work, cover all job duties which enables the workplace to be productive and allow employees to achieve their goals."
good,"Great platform to introduce you to the banking industry. I learned and mastered to create opportunities to deliver the sales of services offered in the branch.  "
good,"I learned a lot from JP Morgan Chase, including SAS and SQL programming skills, strategic analytical methodologies for credit authorizations, fraud, and risk execution. I worked in BCBS team, and learned report automation adoption process, control procedures, and reports from multiple LOB, including Card, Auto Finance and Student Lending. "
good,"Overall, this company is a very good company to work for, however it does have it's regional and departmental differences.  Inconsistencies have developed over the years and upper management is striving for the balance among the different areas. The review of my current department does not give a valid picture of the company overall.  It is best to evaluate the climate of the department you wish to enter."
good,"A typical day consist of making calls to potential clients to set up appointments for either the Financial Advisor, Mortgage banker or  business bankers. In the afternoon I will sit down with previous clients I had set the previous week. Towards the end of the day I will wrap up and set my day for the following day."
good,A lot of turnover. Compensation changed too often. OK management but too much turnover. Make your numbers and you will be fine. Have a bad month and expect to hear from management.
good,"I lead a team of four in the U.S. and worked with counterparts overseas on vendor information reporting and withholding.  "

Just in he past 18 months, there have been management changes and layoffs. What I don't understand is, you lay off good people, but then are still hiring. The group I was laid off with, had employees that were with the company from 10 to 25 years. Longevity is what most are looking for, a place to work, learn and grow. And most of all not fearing everyday your job could be in jeopardy. I've been working since I was 15yrs old, and have never been laid off. So this was a shock to me and a lot of others, and they're still laying off and hiring temps at the same time. This company does not care about people, they gave us 6 weeks to try and find a job within the company and a job agency to help. But some haven't applied for jobs in over 10yrs."

I have learned that the best way to keep rapport with a customer when there is a problem is to say the words ""I understand"" instead of saying ""I apologize.""  Sympathy has a better success rate than empathy.  The management was great when I had started, but then both my branch manager and assistant branch manager had left for different positions in the company and then the new management was a nightmare.  The management would sometimes not know the policies by memory and tried to correct me even if I was right.  My co-workers were great and all of the tellers and bankers worked as a team to help add to the success of Chase Bank.  The hardest part of my job was working with the new management.

good,over all a great place to work. Fun and everyone treats me like family. chase is a great place to grow. this is the first job I got when I moved to AZ and I'm still here.
good,perfect for people who are looking to be in the banking or customer service field. The company really cares about their people and they really do have a great work life balance.
good,"Management experience was exciting, ever changing and provided for a tremendous lift to my work experience.  Chase is at the top of its game within the industry."
good,"Daily Standup"
good,Typical corporate climate.  Don't take things personal.  Good managers and peers.  Great atmosphere to work in.  Had no major issues.  Excellent benefits!
good,"It’s a fantastic company to work for, it’s difficult to get a higher grade and position. Their annual increase wasn’t the best for me. They do appreciate their administrative staff (Assistant’s)."
good,"The company compensated fairly well and depending on the role, the time off available is very good. Advancement is okay, but really based on who you know and not always on your skills."
good,It was fun drinking there. The pay was good no benefits and couldn't become permanent which I felt was wrong. The people was cool and the environment.
good,"Working for JP Morgan was a phenomenal learning opportunity as my first job. There is a myriad of items one can learn from Chase. Money management, investment knowledge, etc."
good,"Obviously, there are a vast number of different jobs one can hold at a mega-corporation like JPMorgan Chase. I can only speak as a developer. In my time there, I was able to experiment, grow and advance. Although the culture is a bit vanilla, you eventually warm up to the fact that nearly anyone can find a place within Chase and make of their job what they want."
good,I currently work at JP Morgan and have for 18 years. The company has served me well and I think it is a good place to grow and learn the field of finance.
good,i enjoy working for the company i feel they really look out for their employees and their own personal development. they help build you up to succeed.
good,Chase was a great place to work. you had different departments you could apply for. lots of opportunity's to grow. wish they did not have a layoff. I miss the people.
good,I have more and more growth prospects are there in this organization with agressive culture not so employ oriented organization but work atmosphere is good
good,Awesome benefits and competitive pay plus monthly bonuses depending on what department you work in. I was happy with the management there.  Don't really have any complaints.
good,"It is a complete package with horrible management, who do not see whether there is talent, they use politics and are partial towards their own giving no regards to the ones who were hardworking."
good,"Good place to work. Management varies from branch to branch. If you meet your goals it will be an easy job. Work in this place was relatively easy, every person has a specific task to complete before the end of there shift."
good,"Fast pace, small office however fun environment. Great management team lay off are too frequent. Excellent customer service, FHA loans, Conventional loans, other as required."
good,"Great company with great benefits, 401K and matching 5%, retirement account, Employee Assistance Program, career advancement, work/life balance oriented."
good,"Great company with great benefits. The opportunities can be endless but without being a favorite of some of the Team Leads/Managers, you'll remain stagnant"
good,"Business as usual. Management try there best to accommodate their staff needs. There are no part of the job that is hard because everything is a learning experience from the work being processed, the colleagues. Waking up every morning knowing that I have a job there is very much enjoyable as it can be."
good,The day was always filled with tasks. Either my own or I'd make myself available to help my team members. The flexibility to work from home from time to time was vital.
good,"Chase has a multitude of thought leadership.  The CEO is passionate about developing leaders in the organization.  There is a lot of opportunity for growth if you are willing to put the time, energy and networking skills.  I left because of my direct manager was highly ineffective and made my experience with the company intolerable.  I would 100% still be employed with Chase had it not been for that experience.  That was a huge disappointment."
good,Excellent company to work for! Has great work life balance and management was great. The most enjoyable part of the job was putting the customer first and being able to go over and beyond for them.
good,"Good company to work with"
good,"Working as a software engineer, technology changes a lot. The banking industry is quite regulated so they are working hard at being able to deliver cutting edge software and remain compliant. With some of the advances made over the last few years, it has given me better work-life balance as I don't have to work overnight doing manual deployments."
good,"JPMorgan overall has a very good workplace environment. Of course this varies by department or line of business as well as the corresponding leadership. However, all in all very good place to work with incredible benefits."
good,great time at chase. I don't want to share anything further. I feel indeed should make this part optional an should not be required to be completed. TY
good,i absolutly love working for JP morgan chase the reason i stopped orking there was because they move the site location and i was unable to be traveling everyday for over an hour but i love the company and the job
good,I learned many different departments while working for Manpower.  I learned the importance of great work ethic and what it means to be a part of widely known corporation.
good,"A good place to work. The benefits are excellent. Pay is above average and commission helps too. Expect to be on the phones/computers 90% of your shift. Being a team player is expected. They will assign a shift for you but after you have been there a while they do offer shift bids so you can bid on different schedules."
good,"Good Leader with strong vision - always looking to the future, improvement, technology, systems, processes.  Quality oriented and good employee recognition programs."
good,"Overall good, nice working in Chase. Lots of learning opportunity and lots of guidance from Senior Management. Good opportunity to improve personally and technically"
good,Great company to work for. Put large emphasis on career development and furthering education for employees. Very competitive pay and compensation packages.
good,"A great lace to work, with good culture, compensation, team support, team members, opportunities and invested in there people. A place where they treat you like family and concerned about your personal and professional growth. Position was eliminated and I would go back if called👍🏽 To duty."
good,"Positive culture with lots of flexibility for mobility.  Positive management overall ambiance, great performance development system.  I've had excellent managers who have supported me, encouraged me to excel and managers that I've learned a great deal from.  I've become a business partner educating myself in the day to day business, understanding the environment I'm supporting and contributing effectively not only at a support level but as a partner.  My managers have afforded me the opportunity to be that business partner, something that probably 30 years ago was not allowed of an assistant.  I've had the flexibility to handle matters with very little supervision with 100% positive results; made business decisions and executed successfully."
good,Loved this job!  Nothing that I didn’t like about it except they were moving. Lots of overtime if you want it and company logo items given away frequently.
good,"JPM is a great company to work in.  They offer great fringe benefits, give you a nice PTO package as well. I would recommend this company to anyone who would think of joining."
good,Left due to they eliminated the Assistant Manager Role in the branch. I had a great team and awesome Branch Manager. I would love to return back to chase.
good,"Pleasure to work for this company always...good environment. Good infrastructure...good benefits for employees working here, transport facility is awesome."
good,"The bank has the best business process in the street. Every aspect of the business is properly documented and the staff often punch above their weight. Due to the size and stability of the bank, many clients have their largest trades with the bank. This results in the bank needed to make sure errors and ommissions are eliminated and the business processes in this bank are geared toward this. Working in this bank is intellectually stimulating and its a great place for a new entrant to IB to learn the fundamentals of investment banking here."
good,The day started out with a motivational pep talk. The training makes it easy to follow requirements. Management is concern on numbers. The workplace culture is great. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers whose family members fraud the bank.
good,"Quality employees, company spends money on needed technology and has a longer term outlook vs. meeting quarterly financial goals.  Enjoyed my time at JPM and learned a lot, many opportunities within the company."
good,"Large company that promotes diversity and inclusion. Like any large company it can be hard to find career advancement opportunities, but manages and colleagues are key and very willing to assist in building relationships."

good,"Meetings with legal and compliance"
good,"I've worked with three financial organizations - JP Morgan Chase is by far the BEST! Your branch is your business, and you handle your business for the most part as you see fit."
good,JPMorgan Chase is a wonderful place to work and learn the underlying business.  They invest the time and money to provide the appropriate training and empoyee resources.
good,"A very good place to work, it was an honor to work in Chase, where the culture, benefits, time every thing was memorable for me ."
good,"All mortgage baking sites contacted our team for Compliance system overrides, guidance, and exceptions."
good,"PCoE was structured , every lead was assigned clear task and resources to accomplish . Location was bit out of town , but on location subsides lunch provided ."
good,"I work on the team getting call center professionals to perform their job from the comfort of their own home.  My day is filled with developing program governance and oversight for the program as well as responding to issues of implementation, forecasting, budgeting, compliance and day-to-day operations.  The firm has embraced the idea and employees love it.  I am also heavily involved in managing our vendor relationships and holding them accountable for execution and billing.  My manager is supportive and allows me to express and pursue my ideas.  I am looking for a position in Austin, Texas because my wife and I are moving."
good,It is one of the best employers in the Philippines because they appreciate the employees and cares about their well being. They also organize activities for the employees to reach out to the community
good,"JP Morgan Chase is nice company to work with. A company with a good working environment,  diverse, a world class and a friendly company. I learned Waterfall and Agile testing methodologies that helped me enhanced my testing techniques and grew in the company"
good,"Great place to work! Very diverse, the hardest part of the job is learning to leave work at work, it a workplace that focus on customer service, so you truly become invested in your work."
good,I worked for JP Morgan Chase about 9 years ago.  I was a teller on  the early shift mainly.  I worked at this job until I was offered a job doing Accounts Payable at almost double the pay.  I really enjoyed the job and the people I worked with.
good,I worked there 18 years and enjoyed every minute of it. I had great managers and coworkers as well. The people made coming in every day enjoyable and I'll always be grateful for my experience there.
good,"I had a great experience with this company. People are so much driven, motivated and very competitive. I am forever grateful for being part of the JPMorgan Culture! We have this monthly activity to recognized outstanding agents who works and exceed expectations with fun and lively activity at the end like dance contest, ball games etc."
good,Enjoyed working for Chase.  Worked at an in-store and needed better hours conducive to family life.  Changed to Huntington Bank at a traditional location and have loved it for over six years.
good,"I have been working at J.P. Morgan full-time"
good,The manager has to be the jack of all trade in the branch. Management of the branch is secondary function. Managers are mostly tellers or bankers in the branch setting
good,Great company to stay and grown in. New opportunities are always available although the turn around time to get contact can be slow. Over all very happy to have the opportunity to work for such a great and strong company.
good,"Great company! Training was awesome and systems were always user friendly.  Compensation was not the best, but the benefits balanced out the compensation.  Unlimited overtime at times and ability for a flex-shift,"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Chase. You was award as well bonusing every quarter for meeting our quoter.  You are always learning new computer systems or software. Meetings all the time, new agenda everyday.Things change from day to day."
good,I love JP Morgan and Chase. They have great benefits and perks. I learned a lot working for this company for the last 10 years right out of high school.
good,"New challenge"
good,"Jones Lang Lasalle is good place to work and the support provided by the HR team is very good."
good,Great Job to be at if starting but it could get competitive depending what department you work for. There is a need of better raises since they stay at the cents but over all its a great company to work for.
good,"Was a blasted working in Chase, the coworkers were great and the field was wonderful. My only complaint has to be, and I know I am not the only one to say it, but the sometimes impossible to please customers, but even then it did much to hurt my outlook on the culture of the office space."
good,JPMorgan Chase & Co. has brought so much learning and career advancement to me when it comes to being exposed to critical thinking and diverse approach on things.
good,"The JPM Treasury Services group has a fast paced and collaborative team culture, where taking on additional responsibilities is encouraged and individuals perspectives are respected"
good,I enjoyed working for JPMorgan several years - I had great managers that took the time to monitor me in my career development.  I started my career as a secretary after a few years I was promoted to Administrative Assistant and than to Executive Assistant.  I would recommend JPMorgan to anyone who would like a challenge and development for their career.
good,"What you would expect in working in an extremely large company in a highly regulated industry. Chase does a lot of things right. I have nothing. It was a good experience, it can be challenging at times. the culture is professional and diverse with a casual dress code."
good,"Nice company! Plenty of vacation, sick time and personal day. A typical day is fast paced and enjoyable. The workplace culture is on of teamwork. I have learned alot."
good,I thought it Chase was a great place to work. Sad to leave. Chase does care about their employees and listens to their suggestion. They offer a lot of learning  opportunities
good,"My experience with Chase has been overall very positive but your experience may differ depending on the type of department you are in and they type of manager you had. I relocated to Florida after being recruited for an upcoming project and was told that my current role and responsibilities would not change. Once I moved, I was involuntarily moved to another department which did not match my skill set. "
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with.  I was giving the ability to train. I would prefer not to comment on the management.  I truly enjoyed reviewing loans everyday.
good,company is focused on taking great care for employees and customer and offering technology and services to make products easy for both to use. Good atmosphere
good,"Amazing company - really loved working there."
good,I have really grown as a person working there at JP Morgan Chase. I have learnt about the different things that a large would have to deal with. I have also trained other workers an I was only an intern.
good,great people to work with. work life balance great. did your job and went home. did not have to bring work home with you. work was environment excellent.
good,"Overall, a pretty boring job, but compensates well.  I happened to work under an awful manager, but that was just my experience.  I by no means, think that should reflect the entire company.  JP Morgan Chase was a great company to work for otherwise.  I left purely because of the manager directly above me."
good,Teletech is a fun place to work with nice people aroud you. However the salary won't sustain a family larger than 3. A good center to start your career on BPO.
good,"Managing the people hand in hand with delivering all the requirements such as Business Results, Customers Experience, Leadership, Leadership. Art of people management was a learning. "
good,It was a great place to work. The people were very friendly and extremely helpful. Their compensation was generous but I recall having to reapply for my job when they were moving my area to Delaware. That was strange.
good,"Enjoyed working for JPMorgan Chase and the team I worked with was great."
good,Daily we handle client accounts under high risk level and protectit from any fraud attempts.  American Culture is observed by each employee. Fun place

good,Excellent benefits for employees and family.  Company is very family oriented.  Understanding bosses and collaborative environment to work in.  Excellent workplace.

good,I enjoy my work and think Chase is a good place to work. The culture at Chase is very welcoming and I enjoy the atmosphere every day I come into work.
good,"Drama free, nice building, promotions are based on who likes you, most of the management cares. Be cautious when applying for a newly created position."
good,"High performance workspace did not provide any strong feeling of belonging; rather, the perception is one that doesn't value employees.  Professionals often sat in areas resembling a call center environment.   "
good,"same as data entry and JPMorgan. I appreciate this company for cross training me in so many areas making it possible to help my coworkers and our process run as smoothly as possible,"
good,i felt like i was well educated in every area of the tax process. From mail extraction to imaging and then of course keying the confidential information. I would highly recommend JPMorgan and Randstad Staffing agency to a friend.
good,"Coverage:"
good,Good management and senior leadership. Good manager and great learnings. Good experience for everyone. Flexible workplace culture. Sometimes too big and red tape gets in the way of decision making
good,Chase was a great place to work with a ton of job opportunities. The only issue was that if Upper Management beyond your direct manager didn't know you then you went no where.
good,"Once you get to work, you have to clock in. You have to go to your where your files will be located for the day. once you have retrieved your files, you have to get started on your assignments which includes, constant communication on the telephone with clients, composing and responding via e-mail, fax, and mailing. You work with other members of your team to ensure that all legal correspondences are done accurately and correctly."
good,"I love the ambiance and the people around you, leaders keep in touch with employees and they even provide their phone number so when we find something bad we can discuss it with them personally and pantry does have free juices and sodas"

good,"Career advancement, lot of things to learn.  Good work life balance.  Lot of room for movement.  Good team environment.  Fun coworkers.  Great help from the team"

good,I really felt that I was a valued employee. I was comfortable in the position and the culture. The employees were supported in all aspects of the job. Performance metrics was fair.
good,"A typical day is a fast paced day involving a lot of moving parts.  I learned management, communication and evaluation skills and used them on a daily basis.  Management was very helpful and motivational.  The hardest part of the job was not being consumed by the job and balance a home life because it is a very competitive environment and I am a very competitive person.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people start a very exciting part of their life in moving into a new home."
good,Chase is very structured and can be a great place to work and it is completely dependent on your management. They put a lot of tools and training in place to make their people successful and have such a lot of opportunities available to their employees.

good,we can gain more knowledge. Gone through knowledge training. Have good fun at work. Good work place with good infrastructure and management.Good learning with growth.
good,Learnt a lot about the finance industry as well as efficiency projects. Daily jobs included working on projects that would increase efficiency for the client on boarding process.
good,"A typical day was opening and welcoming customers to bank, Opening accounts for consumers as well as business accounts, The hardest part of the job was explaining the policies to customers.  The most important part of the job was to greet customer as they walk in."
good,"Everyone was always smiling when starting the day, pulling their pipeline, reviewing the REO closings to make sure they were going to close, addressing any issues with title, value, etc. work closely with realtors and asset management companies who are taking care of the property, obtaining bids when applicable.  Interact with the vendors required to make the property marketable so list the property at fair market value.  Everyone helped the other with 'how to's.  In REO you learned a lot on what happens after a foreclosure sale."
good,"Benefits are good. Pay raises are small so if you come in at a low salary, your salary will be less than the starting pay if you move up. Usually busy at the beginning of the month and then slows down."
good,"A typical day at JP Morgan consisted of supporting my team in all administrative duties, this included managing the phones, expense reports, travel arrangements, booking parties and conferences, preparing monthly client statements, putting together client presentations, calling in all mutual fund trades, managing my teams calendar and all marketing materials.

good,"I enjoy the company as a whole and the opportunities for education they provide but management constantly changes which makes it difficult to develope in a career. No consistancy and lots of change constantly, rules and interpretation of them are always changing, its hard to plan in that environment for ongoing career movement and success."
good,"Typical day at my current role, walk in and log in. start with emails and different activities. Grab coffee and get on various meeting phone calls. Report and or converse with management closely. Culture is getting better as time goes on. "
good,"Proactive, fast paced, constant interaction between both employees and customers, team work, very energetic, less stressful and fun place to work as a whole"
good,I was a contractor so no benefits were offered to me. I would happily work for JP Morgan again. The culture was fast-paced and management was professional.
good,This has been a great place to start my career. I have learned an incredible amount in just my 2 and a half years at the company and will be able to leverage my experience moving forward.
good,"I really like working for Chase, however, there is no opportunity for advancement. They hire a pool of outside managers that wait for months for a branch to become available to them. So getting promoted to manager from within is almost impossible unless you plan on spending 5-10 years with the company.. Additionally, the commission structure has been reduced 2 times and the goals have been raised 1 time since I've been with Chase, making it harder and harder to make money and hit the sales goals. They are reducing the branch staff and adding more machines, which also makes it harder to focus on sales goals because you get too busy taking care of service issues instead of driving sales."
good,"Would recommend to all prospects. Great pay, benefits to full time and part time.  Health, dental, vision, 401k match upto 5 percent. Also if company does well they add bonus some bonus to 401k"

good,The location is very accessible. The workplace is very nice. The compensation is very good. Career growth is supported by management well. Fun culture and co workers.
good,"- Similar Routine to follow everyday"
good,JP Morgan Chase is an Outstanding company to work for.  They are a large corporation and is still very personable. You are able to build great relationships.
good,"Team environment. Likeable people -very helpful and supportive for what I was doing. the team very collaborative"
good,The position I was hired for was not the one that I got. They said it would be temporary but that never happened and promisises that were made never fulfilled.
good,Productive and Fun workplace. JPMC is a leading bank in providing services in banking and Mortgage loans. It has worldwide customers and vendors who will be using the JPMC banking and mortgage Services. JPMC is a fortune 500 company

good,"JPMorgan pays well"
good,Typical days are busy but very productive. Management understands the needs of their employees and does what they can to ensure that work life balance is present.
good,This was a long-term contract to review various home loans for services and fees.  Gov't required home loan review as part of the early 2000's bail out of the industry.  Many teams of 15 were working on this.  The management was quality.  Personal considerations were top priority for all.  People were happy performing contract work.  Highly recommend.

good,Managers were supportive and professional. Schedules were always fair and balanced. Team members were friendly and skillful so easy to rely on and trust.
good,"Tedious work, long days but paid well.  Hardest part of job was avoiding rate/lock breaks, but I had success in this area.  I enjoyed work atmosphere and team structure. Direct Supervisor was outstanding, would love to still be working there but layoffs removed 300+ workers during market crash."
good,Working for Chase has been a good experience. I enjoyed the benefits that i have received from them. I also enjoyed the culture that Chase has to offer.

good,"excellent, i have learnt a lot.our manager is good and  i would like to work again with them and team meeting have been excellent through out. i am very much satisfied"
good,A typical day at work at JP Morgan Chase was very challenging work with a wide variety of customers from happy to angry treated each with the same respect and willingness to exceed customers and management expectations.
good,I worked for them 22 years ago and they where good to work for. we basically answered phone and took care of clients and got change order for businesses.
good,The people and the company make it a great place to work. I was a contractor and they make you feel like an employee. Had it not been for the forced furlough I would have stayed there. Still use my manager as a reference and would return if possible.

good,"My job was to document service member mortgage rate and ensure that all mortgage information was scanned and documented to the system. Failure to do this could hold up service member not getting the rate they need . This undo stress would put the family in financial hardship, causing a possible foreclosure to there property and a ruin to their credit. W e as a team had to make sure that all documents were presented to the right specialist to complete the process.We all failed if this was'nt done this could cause lawsuit to the company if the error wasn't caught."
good,This company is great place to grow and full of diversity.  This company has many benefits and tool that will make you successful both at work and outside of work.  Management does everything to nurture and support growth.
good,Great experience of sales. High spirited job culture. Work timings were us timings and was a difficult start for me but was monetarily  rewarding. Team effort.

good,"They empowered employees to make the right decisions. We treated everyone with dignity & respect. "
good,"The work is fairly easy. There are no sales involved. However, it is some times very difficult to move up or to a position that is not phone based. I felt that the pay was inadequate for the things they wished the representatives to maintain."

good,"I enjoy the work, you are able to run out for appointments with the proper notice as well as work from home. This makes work life balance great.

We do have the opportunity to streamline processes and learn new things each day, which is a desirable trait for any role."

good,"I absolutely loved working for Chase. Had a great experience there and had great peers and managers. When I started there we had over 40 employees in our department and when I left we were down to eight. I finally had to leave because the rest of us were eventually going to be eliminated. Since I left just over two years ago, most of those eight were let go. A few found positions in other departments, but being let  go is so traumatic and difficult when you have bills and a family to support. I wish Chase would manage this process better so there would be less layoffs, and less stress for those who work there.  And by the way most of the work our department did was either automated or was sent offshore."

Quality of management is excellent and in my experience, this is a good place to work.  Work-life balance can be challenging, but not more so than in similar organizations.  There is a framework to support and encourage progression but at the same time, there's no room for people who don't pull their weight."

During the audit I was out in the field, sometimes literally, in the sun, rain and snow in all areas of the country.  I learned how to navigate DataScan, Excel, Microsoft Outlook other internal bank systems.  My managers were always helpful and supportive in guiding me along in my career.  I felt like I was a perfect fit for the workplace culture.  It's all about being your best, always doing the right thing and being respectful of those around you whether you're at work or not...you are the face of the company.  The hardest and most enjoyable part of my job for me was the same thing, the travel.  While the flights and going thru the airports could be very draining, and I don't understand why this is so, I absolutely loved driving, getting out of the office, seeing different areas of the country and meeting customers."
good,"I worked in a tough hard working environment driven by business development and competition in the market and within the bank."
good,Working with different date bases to prevent fraud on customer's credit card account. Reviewing purchase patterns and verify the transactions to prevent possible fraudulent activities.
good,"job consists of inbound calls requiring information gather thorough exploratory questions to determine the ability of the bank to attempt to recover funds from a merchant. Management was great, and training was extensive and thorough. Work environment was lively and engaging. Great company to work for."
good,JPM is composed of very sophisticated business personnel that work very hard to maintain the integrity of the bank. Everyone works hard to keep JPM as the best bank in the world. There are no shortage of very intelligent people at this bank that will all help to progress your career.
good,"Layoffs and company restructuring resulted in the LA Commercial Lending Regional office to close.  Good place to work, good benefits, great team, professional office."
good,It was a good place to work. Learned to grow with a team and interact professionally with customers while maintaining privacy. Co-workers were helpful and team-oriented. The most enjoyable part was dealing with different people all the time and offering help/solutions based on their needs.
good,"I worked at CHASE for 10 years in multiple roles. The workplace culture and management is excellent. Unfortunately, a lot of downsizing is being felt within the mortgage industry as a whole , thankfully CHASE provides a good severance package..."
good,"Managers were very fair and helped you to develop in your role. Not all of them were extremely competent, but if they knew their weaknesses they would develop their team to help fill in the gaps. Very collaborative and a great place to work."
good,"The company is strong, well capitialized, and makes decisions that influence the industry.  it should be seriously considered by new recruits.  eight."
good,"I have extensive experience in the Mortgage Closing/ Funding Division, Post Closing, Recovery Specialist, Investor Delivery Specialist and general office ethics and procedures. JPMChase offers much in my area of expertise. I would like to return again as an employee."
good,It was a fast pace environment.  I had many opportunities to be promoted.  I really liked the people I worked with.  I was very good at collecting money and helping others to turn negative customers into ones that would be able to pay.
good,"As long as you stay out of the office gossip, the job really is great. You're given the tools and resources needed to help the customers needs. Recognition is granted. Managers and leaders are interested in your goals and want to help you meet them (advancement in the company). The business attire requirement (professionalism is a plus for me). Daily Huddles are held, which I believe sets a team up for success and builds work relationships. The interior building was remodeling and is beautiful."
good,"I was employed for 11 years really enjoyed working with Chase, but got layed off sad day.  Yes I would work for them again, but for some reason I am not qualified for each and every position I apply for.  Hmm"
good,Thoroughly enjoyed the people friendly and customer service atmosphere and opportunity to be in a career filed position that could offer lifetime benefits such as insurance and retirement.
good,Busy work flow with lots to. A great team of co workers. Lots of change due to mortgage world but loved that my time flew by. Great place to learn new ideas and just roll with the punches.
good,"It feels good to work for a strong company.  It has over 160,000 employees and it's one of the strongest, if not, the strongest bank in the U.S.A.  It has so many benefits.  An employee is usually making $20,000 more than their salary, if they choose to take advantage of the benefits.  Promotion just seems to take a lot of years.  There are many opportunities to move laterally, but very few chances to move vertically."
good,"As a banker you can make a decent living. Depends on the branch you are in and the branch manager. You never work more than 40 hrs, culture is decent, at the end of the day it is retail, which can be draining."

good,"The best job I've had except for the commute downtown and I have to pay for parking.  The firm is proactive and not reactive, they have a future and practice what they preach."
good,"Good base salary, poor bonus structure for the wealthiest bank in the country. Yearly layoffs based on performance reviews were encouraged by management."
good,"Dynamic learning environment, fast-paced, high expectations for excellence, best-in-class transaction experience, talented people, diverse culture, good technology & infrastructure, fair comp"
good,"Chase is a phenomenal company. I like to consider it as a ‘high end’ employer. The company invests in inself, rather than you. Expect all the resources help you succeed seamlessly. However, do not expect to be paid well or valued. You do recieve great benefits, vacation, and tenure packages. I would work for them again."
good,I managed to remain employed and was promoted from within during a very tumultuous time in the financial industry. Very relaxed environment in the Mortgage/Default business unit. I enjoyed my time there.

good,Chase has created a very relaxed environment at the new location in Plano. Everything you can think of they almost have it. They have done an awesome job there for their employees.
good,"I loved working for chase but i had a bad experience with management. I had been with chase for 6 years and the manager I had was new & felt like I was not trained properly but claimed that she didn’t have the time to retrain me. She said I do not have time to do my job and yours, Worst experience ive ever had with a manager."
good,I was offered above minimum wage starting off to be a teller. I was initially hired part-time averaging 20-30 hours a week. Within a month I was offered a full-time position doing 30-40 hours a week. Most people are intimidated by the thought of working with money but it was honestly really easy. There are many opportunities to move up and/or do extra job roles within this company.
good,"JP Morgan is a good company to work for in the financial sector. Easier to land jobs through headhunters or temp service in my opinion. Working in the treasury area enabled me an opportunity to work with a dispersed team which had odd hours and sometimes made my job a but more tedious. However, knowing this allowed me to alter my schedule to ensure, I made the right connections with the team members during their work hours to ensure my external clients didn't have any delays. Overall, JP Morgan is a good company to apart of."
good,"I was a temp employee, but if they were hiring for full-time permanent positions I would apply.  The atmosphere is wonderful and all employees including upper management are very friendly and very helpful"

good,I learn a lot about the mortgage industry. It is room for advancement with in departments.  Management staff was not the greatest. Some mgrs. need to learn how to communicate effectively with their employees.  Quota base work daily sometimes very stressful.  But we maintain a positive attitude in our department.

good,"Chase was the only place I enjoyed coming to work, as my co-workers were full of fun and laughter. Chase has great benefits and the environment was always pleasant."
good,Chase is a great place to work. What makes the job hard is dealing with customer's issues and government regulations. The C in chase stands for change. Customers of chase do not understand all the time that we are governed by an hierarchy. Management is pretty great there. A lot of opportunities but you have to make yourself known.
good,This company is an excellent company to work for.  Excellent benefits and management is concerned with development of employees.  Also high stress to get the 'numbers' that are expected of you.
good,Not a bad place to work management could have been better but it was fun and the benefits can not be beat I would go back here.  Pay could have been a bit better but overall was great.
good,JPMorgan is an ok place to work. the management style varies from branch to branch. advancement opportunities are limited. days can get pretty redundant.

good,The environment at Chase was really good and professional. There were plenty of opportunities to advance within the company. And they treated their employees fair

good,"it is an excellent place to work, even more if you are young, competitive and proactive. The company gives the opportunity to grow up professionally an personally. A lot of things to learn. As all these very big companies, it is very competitive and you need to work hard if you want to be promoted, but as I already said, if you are young it is worth to work for this company."

good,working for Chase was fun and exciting. lots of extracurricular activities outside of work. the operations center was moved from downtown dallas to fort worth
good,"Chase has a great environment, opportunity to grow and very diverse variety of people. Commission can be better.the day to day depends on the manager since managers are in charge of branch completely and usually you dont get a lot of time with th district manager to discuss concerns."

good,Great benefits at a fantastic price.  Culture is inclusive and collaborative.  Pay scale is average to below average.  Pleasant place to work.  Buildings are a bit run down.

good,I enjoy the company that currently and would like to maintain employment there i have recently graduated so i am exploring options. I would recommend working at Chase to friends and family.
good,"I worked in a inbound call center environment, had a great immediate supervisor who always worked hard for her employees. Upper management was ""out of touch"" at times. You were always treated well if you did your job well."
good,I would have been a life long employee of JPMorgan Chase.  I had to resign because I was forced to relocate due to my son being diagnosed with cancer while traveling out of state.  I wish there were employment opportunities here in RI.

good,Learned so much from my managers here.  Loved this company and should have never left them to begin with.   Huge mistake going to Wells Fargo just for the money.
good,I love working @ Chase. I've met a lot of great people and it is a good working environment. I work the 3rd shift and it is both interesting and fun.  The hours were really hard to get used to and sometimes your days run into one another. 800 pm to 630 am is their working 3rd shift. I've spoken to others that are there during the day and they seem to think it is more stressful. Calls are back to back and sometimes frustrating.  We are empowered to work for excellence and give great customer experience. Your compensated by if your do well and your numbers are good you can get 1st dibs on time off vacation bids and other opportunities. Everyone I work with on my team is great spirited and easy to talk to and we help each other out as a team. So overall a great place to work.

good,I was a consultant for JPMorgan on two different occasions in two different locations. Both times I thoroughly enjoyed working for them. The pass is fast but the Management is fair. You get a good balance of work and down time. Management was always there to assist with problems and questions. I would jump at the chance to get back working for JPMorgan.

good,"Extremely talented peers to work with, great learning opportunities, free and open management culture, fun activities are organised for employee engagement."
good,Everyday at Bear Stearns was enjoyable.  I worked in a busy data center and got along well with all staff and management.  I gained more computer skills while employed at Bear Stearns.  Working a 3 day work week  was the most enjoyable part of the job but the also the hardest part of the job.  Enjoyable because it allowed us to have a healthy family life with 4 days off but hard because for 12 hours a day we were on our feet working in a busy data center.  Eventually most of our job duties became automated and as a result our jobs were outsourced.
good,"JPMorgan is an amazing place to work. Although the work itself is finance and some may find that work to be mundane, the benefits and opportunity it offers is fantastic."
good,"Chase was an incredible place to work. I enjoyed my time there. Fast paced environment ever changing. Would have stayed until retirement, but due to layoffs my time was cut short."

good,Worked here for a little time span but has explore the US banking culture as it is a huge in it's own and learnt about the US internal clearing terminal and also had a chance to interact to client's and other counter parts over the telepresence
good,"Typical day was verifying and releasing wire transfers. Checking that all investigators followed the procedures. "
good,"My time in this company was well spent. Within a period of 10 months i worked several different projects and was trained in many different areas within the compliance department. The work pace was fast yet doable and the expectations were realistic but challenging. The only real downside to working in this company is that you don't really know when your time will be up. There is no spoken word of when the contract will end or, if you are full time, when your last day will be. This doesn't sit too well with most employees and at time many seem a little on edge which makes the work environment tends."
good,We have clients on the production floor and i love to work independently to show them that i am capable of becoming a supervisor someday. It is a very fun Work place because we have a lot of engagement activities every month.
good,"I managed a large outbound collections group and loved working for Chase.  The environment was fun, we were able to recognize our employees for doing a good job with gift cards and other prizes.  A lot of things changed when Chase purchased Bank One, we inherited their policy and procedure which is not necessarily bad but the employee dynamic changed.  The employees just became a number."
good,"This company has taught me a lot in terms of being a good team player, developing my soft skills especially at times of crucial situations and identifying my potential to the fullest."
good,Management was amazing! Would totally go to bat for their employees.  I loved working with my co-workers. They were like family. The hardest part of the job was leaving.

good,It had a friendly work environment that offered job stability and monetary rewards for hard work. I enjoyed interaction with costumers and co-workers.
good,"i was in sales so a typical day was trying to selling the accounts and products "
good,"I was hired at JPMorgan Chase at a very early age, I worked for a broker dealer who dealt with Chase, and later Chase decided they wanted to increase their product line and so they hired some of the employees at the small firm.  I had good times at Chase, they pay your tuition (at least when I worked there).  Employees who completed the classes with grades A,B,C did not have to pay back the bank for their tuition.  In addition to that they offered internal development courses (e.g. how to handle a difficult employee).  I worked long hours on some jobs whereas on others I did not. It all depends on the department and line of business.  Chase is a gigantic bank.  Lots of opportunity to move around.  The only downside with Chase, since I stayed with them for a while, my salary was never as much as people coming in for similar positions.  In a nutshell I felt I was underpaid.  I felt the payroll structure should be revamped.   I liked working there even though there were several mergers\acquisitions."
good,my team and peers are the most wonderful professionals I have had the experience to work with. Learned alot and most importantly I grew with my experiences
good,They have a great work environment. The management is good. The level of learning varies from department to department. Very competitive work environment.

good,Wonderful professional work environment. I thoroughly enjoyed working here and only left because of relocation out of state and this position was not offered elsewhere. This was a career job and one that I could of seen myself retiring from. I found overall the management to be reasonable and the job duties to be well defined and pleasant.

good,"The experience as an intern with JP Morgan Chase was a great experience, gaining an abundant amount of knowledge, and experience. With a great exposure to how corporate culture works, as well as how a banking institution functions on a day to day basis. The management is very hands-on, helpful, and dedicated to their employee's needs. I would recommend an internship with JP Morgan Chase to any young professionals looking to gain experience in the Commercial Banking Industry."
good,"A typical day at work will be helping out clients at the banker and teller side."
good,My time with Chase was amazing i met great people/friends. Their overall banking needs for customers is top notch and the company is great to their employees.

good,I worked there too many years as a part time teller to comment. A very busy bank and I primarily worked the drive up window. My co-workers were all very pleasant.
good,Great company in all aspects. Amazing employee benefits and life work balance. Compensation should be better for the employees at the Branch Level as they are the front of the company.
good,"JP Morgan Chase is a great company to work for.  As an Occupational Health Nurse and Certified Health Coach, I'm able to help the local employees with acute medical needs, Health Coaching and Education, Preventative Wellness initiatives and Travel and Preventative Vaccines.  The best part of the job is the spontaneity of the work day."
good,I enjoyed my time at Chase. Very busy and always changing environment. Allowing for a lot of room for learning and advancement. Management was good at the first level but once you got above that they became frustrating.

good,Great company to work for.  High volume lots of change with great training. Lots of pros working at the Irvine location and always wanted to go into work unlike other companies.

good,It is good corporate environment to work with.work life balance is also very good.management is very supportive and we have good exposure to personality development.
good,Days are usually fast paced with ample opportunity to increase compensation in a comfortable environment while still being able to enjoy spending a few moments with colleagues and clients which are not business related.

A typical day would be logging into my computer and assistant costumers with questions they have about the type of credit card they were calling in for. I learn different things and means about credit cards and how interest is calculated. Management is pretty great.

good,"Great company with great people. So many things to learn. Follows advanced model with unique methodologies."
good,"Working at Chase was a great experience. A typical day consisted of engaging with regulars while performing their banking transactions. Customers were generally always friendly. I learned that regardless of how competent I was, there was little room for growth (as a teller) than I originally anticipated when applying. Everyone told me I would be able to move up really fast, which was not true as there were little opportunities for advancement. The workplace flowed really well, our management was always communicating with each other and trying new ways to keep the team motivated. We did performance contests a lot where there were food incentives! The hardest part of the job was between knowing all the different banking and transaction policies and balancing (for me personally.) The most enjoyable working at Chase was the consistency of work (our tasks as tellers rarely changed) and how we were closed on most Holidays."

I've learned how to be patient because customers are still learning how to do all their banking on their own. I love meeting new people and talking about their experiences in life. I think this is a great part of working for the bank. I also love seeing and working with all the different currencies from all over the world. The bills are really pretty.
good,Leadership does not care about people and morale is low due to constant lay offs. Work life balance is non-existent; expect to work 70-80 hours/week and most weekends
good,"Working in this industry is very unpredictable, everyday is a new learning experience because no two accounts, or customers are the same. Everyone at our branch works together as a family.

What I have learned from this opportunity is how to be a leader, this has helped me build my confidence in speaking to upper level management and  it has also helped me in using my analytical skills to solve complex issues. My management team is very supportive and knowledgable in their role, you can approach them with any problem and if they don't know the answer they will work to find out. The hardest part of my job is giving bad information to customers and knowing you have done all that you can do to help them.

good,"A typical day at work, would be logging into various systems, organizing work reading complaints, processing document, ordering fees and cost, escrow, credit, contacting borrowers, etc. The working environment was great, co-works were awesome, everyday you learned something new which I enjoyed. You were always given the proper training, and people were always willing to help. The hardest part about this job was the fact I was in default, and I had to deliver bad news to borrowers regarding their foreclosed properties. Knowing that after speaking with me we could no longer help them and they would be without a home and that gets hard knowing that people invest their live into their homes, to some people their home is all the have. On the flip side of things, what I enjoyed most is being able to help people save their homes, being able to research and see what we did as a company wrong and turning the situation around.

I had great work relationships with all employees and got along with everyone which was probably the most enjoyable part of the job, along with staying very busy, which I love!

We deal with so much diversity on a daily basis and you meet so many new people who soon learn to grow close to you because they began to trust you. After all you're dealing with a major aspect of their life, their money. The most enjoyable part about my job is helping customers any way I can, wether its helping them make their deposits or giving advice about how to manage their money. My coworkers are such a joy to work with, and the fact that its such a team based working environment makes my job a lot easier sometimes."

The hardest part of my job was not being able to help people and hearing the hard times they were having. The best part is when I helped people and they rememebered me and building relationships. Banking is not easy because you are dealing with people and there money, but with the right approach I made it work for me while I was there."
good,"Chase provides great benefits and opportunites while it also tries to secure job functions.  It will do it's best to keep you working and employed.

I was cross trained in five different departments also, a job coach. A typical day would be to sign-in to your PC-computer to balance accounts for the day (or reconcile an account). Deadlines to meet which were challenging, meetings to keep staff up-dated on changes in banking industry & the economy. On going training, pleasant work enviroment. Q-board meetings to let employees and co-workers measure their progress in each department. The hardest part of the job was when it no longer exist and departments had to close and my job no longer exist. I do miss my co-workers because many of us developed great working relationships. The most enjoyable part of the job was the challenges offered, seeing my co-workers, the pot-lucks, the educational meetings, inservice trainings, great management teams. I learned alot about good work ethics while at Chase Bank as an employee over the years. The benefits were good, the retirement system is reasonable, assistance after I leaving has been great.

good,Great company to work for lots of opportunities to advance.
good,"Learning about the compliance department was an eye-opener. It was interesting to learn what people would do in order to avoid being investigated due to the amount of money they withdrew or deposited into their accounts. If the opportunity to work in that field was to be presented to me again, I wouldn't walk away this time. I can truly say I loved that job."
good,"Loved the company, did not like the politics of middle management. Work out of love not fear and things will get done. The CEO was a wonderful guy and still is from what I can see. My manager was not to thrilled when my dream of meeting the CEO came true."

good,Staff were amazing and the environment was very friendly and outgoing.
good,Helping folks with great customers service on a daily basis. Teaching and experience how to master change management in finance and banking. Learned to build strong relationships.

The hardest part of the job is dealing with the bureacracy and red tape that interveres with you doing your actual job, but it is an overall great place to be employed."
good,"I was responsible for collecting on mortgage accounts, and assisting customer with payment plans that had been affected by natural dissasters. The work place was very cold and depressing.

good,Health Savings Account Representative

good,Profeesional place with professional people.Enjoyed working.
good,"I loved working for Chase. I think that there Manager could use some training on how to work with employee, they don't help the new employee. I learned a lot about loan Mod got alot of hands on experince with Motrtgages etc. I work with very good co workers they was always willing to help out. At Chase we make alot of calls assisting customer with their homes. Trying to save home. we submit reage/ext and loan mods. Had to make 65 calls a day. What I enjoyed about Chase is how they reward you for youe hard work."
good,It was a great experience for me to accomplish new skills. The work was ongoing.
good,"JPM was a fantastic place to work! The training provided to the employees was top notch. It was so good that if JPM is on your resume, getting hired is guaranteed! I learned how big the world really is and developed a professional demeanor and style. My co-workers ranged from young and eager to seasoned and patient and came from every walk of life. The hardest part about the job is seeing how small the paycheck is! Mr. Dimon is a great leader, but he is very cheap! But at least he's cheap with himself and the top execs too! The most enjoyable part of the job was telling people you worked there...appreciation and respect were immediate!"
good,I enjoy working at JP Morgan Chase. Setting up meeting and video conferencing. Doing powerpoint presentations and interacting with other employees in states.
good,"I began originally working for Washington Mutual at the age of 16. When Washington Mutual was bought out by Chase bank, I had already spent two years as a teller. Although there was a high turnover rate at my branch, I still felt at home with my co-workers. I was more of a specialist at the branch then a teller. I would almost always be selected to go offsite and try to obtain accounts outside of the branch; I would always deliver. The hardest part of the job was standing, all day. The most enjoyable part was getting things done and helping clients fit into the best accounts for them."
good,My experience with JP Morgan Chase was a very positive one. My service with them spanned over 5 years and I have been fortunate to cross-train with several departments; creating diversity among my skillsets gained.
good,"More work oriented striving hard to achieve the target and meeting the deadlines, working as a team and motivated when needed, more of a family environment i enjoyed working with Jpmorgan Bangalore, more fun to work as a family.I have been trained in trade finance knowing more about trade , working in a global environment where i had many oppurtunity to work as a team though been co workers spreaded out, was working for Tampa and Chicago.

Was able to meet the expectationand also exceed the expectation, learn to manage my time effectively at work and out."
good,Very good company. Highly culture focused and secured company.
good,"Working at their call center is a lot of fun, but they have very high unrealistic expectations. Managements always push you to do your best and be the best."

good,It all depends on location and position you work in. Each place is ran differently because of management styles. Work life is good. Time off could be better.
good,Great Benefits and Salary with good workplace environment.  Great assistance from Manager with open door policy. Good team to work with. The only down side was the stability of employment.
good,they had a refreshment section and sleeping quarters that benefits a lot of employees.  they also had a fair and good culture when it comes to treating employees.
good,"This leading financial lender is a great company to work for and offers many opportunities to grow professionally and personally.  What I have learned is that you are responsible for your career.  If you put in the work and network, you have the opportunity to move up within the organization."

good,"Great company and amazing culture make JP Morgan an excellent place to launch and grow your career!  They encourage mobility within the firm, so you can have several careers within the same organization!"
good,"I will be honest, there are things to not like about working for the country's largest financial institution. Decisions are made so high up that you could work there for years and never even meet or speak to anyone who themselves has met a decision maker. However, there are so many perks that are overlooked. Great benefits, like outside of a few of the other big banks I am not sure they exist anywhere. The pay is competitive, and people who perform well are rewarded financially. There is some micromanagement, but it is mild in comparison to many competitors, and competitor industries. "
good,"JPMorgan Chase has been a wonderful place to work in terms of workplace culture. Based on my experience, team members are heavily encouraged to take advantage of the firm's social/networking programming and mobility opportunities, and management emphasizes the importance of constructive, two-way feedback."
good,"Fun and competitive as well. Very technical people."
good,Chase only employees the best. Ive experienced a ton of growth with a ton of great people. I am looking outside to see what else is out there. I will only accept a role that has a larger scope than my current role.
good,I don't have much work experience. I have only 3 months of work experience. But what I can say is to work in J.P. Morgan is my dream job. And I will try for that.
good,Solid company that will take care of employees. I wish I could have worked there longer. Part time employees receive significant benefits as well as paid time off
good,"Great experience from day-to-day activities to career advancement. Despite the great size of the company, developed meaningful relationships and work to achieve common goals and success."
good,JPMorgan is a great place to work! The company values diversity and inclusion.  Community and employee engagement are one of the best parts of working at Chase.
good,"A lot of people say bad things about working at chase. However in my experience the starting pay isnt bad, however there, doing  a trained job your not going to make as much as thoughs with a degree. They give you lots of vacation time off the bat, 3 weeks paid, paid maternity, a free 600 towards your medical expenses each year etc. Overall a great place to work  benefits make up for alot of what the pay lacks"
good,I enjoyed working under the managers.  Training was enjoyable and I never felt like I was working an actual job.  I loved the culture at the job as well.  Easy to move up in the company.
good,The organization is one of the best international corporations to work at. I would certainly work there again. I highly recommended them as an employer.

good,I always enjoyed working with Chase.  It is an employee friendly company that always considers the needs of its workforce. It is diverse and awards strong performance while continuing to improve the skills and knowledge of its employees. I would welcome the opportunity to work with them in any capacity again.
good,Chase needs to see what people objectives are and follow through it was very disappointing being offered the Job at a higher rate then informed my contract was not extended because lack of hours to be hired
good,Working in this company is like your working at home.. You will feel that the company gives you comfortable place to work.  They promote work life balance so you won't feel your tired. The management gives you a better compensated salary that's equivalent to your work task assignment. The hardest part of the job is when you need to move out to your current job because of automation process.
good,"They have amazing health benefits and lots of time off! Thus far best benefits I have encountered, the job can be stressful but there are lots of opportunities for growth."
good,"I have performed many reviews over my last 2 years with Chase. Mainly auditing other Chase employees throughout the post-close process, but I have now transitioned into a more analytical role, basically determining if our mortgage loan clients get a refund or not, due to an untimely closing for a Chase error."
good,Great benefits and environment. There are many opportunities there. My manager was not good to me but the company is great and I would encourage anyone to apply.
good,"Helping team lead, very co operative"

good,"I enjoyed working for Chase. They care about their employees, GREAT benefits and family oriented. They provide onsite medical doctors, cafeteria, Cstore, and offer Health Spending accounts. They also offer child care/elderly spending accccounts. The culture was very diverse and I actually enjoyed going to work daily. I had a position that offered remote working sometimes, no real complaints. Only thing I didnt like is that they practically have major lay-offs every year."
good,"I started out at Chase as a receptionist and held many positions thereafter, such as: Loan Processor, Closer, Underwriter, Loan Officer, Admin., HR Coordinator.  I feel these positions broadened my knowledge of the Mortgage Industry and allowed me many opportunities of which I am grateful"
good,"Chase is a great company to work for.  Throughout my tenure with the firm, I always had positive relationships with management and my peers.  The culture is that of family and you always have someone to turn to for guidance or assistance.  The roles I have had where at times stressful, but that did not diminish my drive to succeed.  I would recommend the company to anyone, and would  stress that it is a great company to work for!"
good,I worked for Chase for 13 years. I loved it. They provided so many nice perks. I would highly recommend working there. They are more than willing to work with you to get you where you'd like to be within the company. They are very good about promoting from within.
good,"Very good place to work"
good,"A typical day at work is working in a fast pace, layed back environment answering phone calls in a call center. What I was able to learn was customer relations and how to handle customer complaints. The management is easy to talk to and willing to work to resolve problems and questions. The workplace culture is a cohesive environment were you work in a group or a team but in a individualized cubical. The hardest part of the job was the training if you have never done telephone banking before or customer service but it gets better as time passes and if your a quick learner it doesn't take long to learn. I enjoyed how the company actually cares about the employees and how the CEO's of the company flies in personally to speak with the employees of the company and actually want to hear how to make service better for the company and employees."
good,I have been at JPMC for almost 3 years. It is a great place to be and you learn a lot about the firm and the different business functions in a short time.
good,I enjoyed working for such a a good company. I enjoyed going to work daily because it was a positive work environment. I would go back if it had more full time opportunities.
good,"Awesome place to work."
good,"	Money Handling"
good,"Good 9-5 with solid benefits. Great job mobility. However, some positions become repetitive. Pay is great, and management is open to change. Only reason I left is because my aspirations lie elsewhere."
good,"I enjoyed working with Chase very much. Banking is hard work, you are constantly problem solving and selling all day. The hardest part about the job is just adapting to the changes. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people. The benefits are amazing."
good,"One thing I can say ,Chase is a great place to work at. The pay is great, flexible hours, benefits, matching 401k, discounts, a free checking account, and ect. Overall a great place if you’re okay being at one place. The only thing I don’t like working there is that it’s very  consistent, not very much adventure, sure you meet a lot of people but it’s the same thing everyday. Also it’s very difficult to move up from a teller to a Banker. I’ve been working there for almost three years and they rather hire an outside than promote from within."
good,i Love the people and culture. I wish upper management understood what it takes on a local level to support the sites from a technical support aspect.
good,"Chase was a no frills employer in that as an employee, I had no confusion whatsoever in what was expected of me on a daily basis. Their compensation was more than adequate with annual raises in line with the rising cost of living."
good,Great benefits and I have had the pleasure of working with great people I have been able to work with pay could be better in certain areas/ positions.
good,"you have a set schedule "
good,amazing benefits and help with career mobility within the company. Also the workplace is fun and diverse and everyone is very respectful and kind and flexible

good,Great working environment. Excellent growth potential. JPMC is a leader in the financial industry. Fosters diversity and inclusion. Allows for a good balance of work and personal life.
good,"A typical day at work starting from the time I start to the end of my shift, I would first check my calendar for possible meetings that may be scheduled for that day. I then would go through my emails. I would check for follow up emails and new emails that may came in after my shift ended the  day before.I then would plan my day by prioritizing by creating a list of all my tasks. I then would identify urgent vs. important, from there evaluate the priority standing, check their estimated effort and start on whichever one I think will take the effort to complete. Also allow myself to be flexible and adaptable, remind myself that I may not complete everything that day. Therefore, after prioritizing my tasks look at the remaining estimate work if any, cut the remaining tasks of my list, and focus on the priorities that I know must and can be completed. "
good,"A pleasant and professional and highly  risk-adverse place to work.  I typically started my day at 7:00 am and routinely ended the work day between 6:00 pm and 7:00 pm.  Long days filled with challenging and insightful  assignments (I really enjoy those challenging opportunities).  The most rewarding part of the job was interacting with the people (subordinates, peers and upward) and nurturing and teaching the more junior and the intermediate team members.  I also enjoyed instilling a family values type culture across the my domain. The most challenging part of the job was gaining consensus (regarding influencing  and effectuating change) across the entire enterprise - . at times."
good,"If your want an employer who has a structured and well maintained working environment, JP Morgan would be suitable for your employment. They are very organized in term of management, risk and people development."

I have only been here for 7months and no problem. just wish they could switch you from nights to morning if you need it
good,JP Morgan created a wonderful work environment.  They assigned each employee with a specified Team Lead within the department in order to coach and allow the opportunity for advancement. They were flexible with individual employee hours and genuinely concerned for each individual team member. The Deal Team (group of different employees from different departments) had a minimal of one hour a day to discuss and properly maintain each business account.

good,Chase gave me the opportunity to support the trading desk and gave me the introduction and experience working with the traders and upper management on various levels.

good,"I loved my time at Chase. The managers were great, and my coworkers were all great people, too. Overall, I was really happy working here. The only drawback as a teller is that, during rush hour, we could definitely use more tellers."

My role as Executive Assistant to a Bank Executive was the best ever.  The perks were fabulous and the team work was A1.  My manager was great!  He was supportive in my role, supportive and encouraging in my development and offered me the opportunities to grow and challenge my skills.  He offered his team room  to grow and excel without micromanaging.  JPMC in New York HQ was a great job.  Working as a Bank Teller in Decatur, Georgia was a different experience.  I  appreciate being given the opportunity to work as a bank teller and for my manger having the confidence in me to give me a chance. Thank you JPMC for everything"
good,"Honestly, this job has great hours for retail. Also they really like to move people up and transferring is easy.  I only would rather work in a job that is more active and outdoors, rather than being behind a desk. Otherwise, this is a great company to work for with fantastic benefits and hours. They don't pay as competitively as other banks though, but they claim it's because of their benefits they offer. I'm not sure how their benefits package compares, but I have been told that its is better than most other banks."
good,"Work place is awesome"

good,Overall Working at Chase bank is a very well job. There are many benefits such as health care and life insurance as well as a diverse group of people with extensive amount of banking knowledge. I learned the do's and don'ts when handling your own bank accounts and great ways to save for your goals. The hardest part was the commute and the work hours. Daily I would spend hours going back and forth and missed a lot of time with my family.
good,no complaints enjoyed the work flow.  will advance as long as you are within your guidelines.  their biggest thing is attendance.  just work and you will go far

good,Chase is an amazing place to work and wouldn't have left other than my health was an issue. I would still be working there but my health held me back and I had to take an extended time off of work. The management and culture was absolutely the greatest and could not compare it to any other company. The hardest part of the job was when I had to put in my 2 week notice. The most enjoyable part was coming into work every day because everyone was happy to be there and I don't think there were any cons I can list.

good,"good job. great experience and deal flow.  first class investment bank."
good,"This was back in 2011-2012 with the Dodd Frank act making the bank send surveys to their customers about how well they'd handled their mortgages.  They trained us, gave us printed instructions on how to proceed, and if the instructions changed, we got new packets.  They also had resources whom we could ask questions of.  They even offered us overtime (not mandatory) with time and a half pay.  They were very respectful and nice to their employees.  The only bad thing I've heard is that the pay is a bit below the standard.  But besides that, highly recommended!  (I'd still be working there if my job wasn't a temp. contract...)"
good,"JP Morgan Chase was a friendly, but strict place to work at. but most of the co workers and staff were friendly, and kind. The work load could be a bit intense at times, but manageable as well."

There was gret opportunity for advancement and over the years I did quite well and in my last branch manager roll turned a 26 million dollar branch into a 60 million dollar branch, supported by the most amazing staff in the world.Then with the Bank One merger the climate changed,  High sales goals, for opening fake accounts similar toe another bank I don't need to elaborate,"

good,"Due to reorganization of my division, change is currently constant.  Being hired as a Project Manager and now assuming Business Analyst and Software Architectural projects has expanded my skillsets while my management team continues to support my efforts.  The workplace culture is fantastic, but I do wish I had more time to collaborate with my immediate supervisor rather than feeling like I was being instructed on next steps with an outlined to do list."
good,Loved working for this company.  There are a lot of opportunities for advancement.  Working environment is excellent for anyone who enters in entry-level or management position.
good,"Great work culture, two offs weekly, open work environment, weekly training, meeting ones scores with added benefits if one achieves the scores , employee recognition"

The people in the team were kind and helpful. It was easy to communicate with them. There were obstacles that came, however, I was still capable of overcoming them almost every single time. What was enjoyable during my job was that my QA team and I were able to complete the project."
good,"Management in some areas was excellent, but in the actual work space, need to be review."
good,"Job security is main point for retention and the opportunities for growth however, in terms of salary increase annually & when promotion is achieved, that is were the opportunity is as the rates are not market competitive anymore."

good,"I had a great experience working for JP Morgan Chase, my coworkers were lively and helpful. We worked together perfectly because our Branch Manager was strict, but kind. She really wanted everyone to succeed. She made us all better employees and people. We satisfied most clients with top-notch customer service. Even with all the fun dealing with customers and my coworkers. The workload was demanding and not worth making any errors. Sometimes technology has little mix-ups so if you don't pay close attention to detail like you're supposed to, you can make big errors."
good,"Due to interest rates rising and Prime going up, my department was consolidated into 2 locations out of state. I have children in high school and all of my family is by me so moving out of state is not an option. Chase is a company that I could easily work at till retirement.

good,"This was a great company to work for and a company that has a great potential for growth within. The management teams and structure were ones that would allow for growth and confidence building.

Need continuous team support. Friendly environment. Have to watch what you say and do, someone may take it the wrong way. Perception on the floor is very. uncomfortable. "
good,The overall work culture is awesome. An average work day is very fast paced. You learn a lot as far as banking is concerned such as terminology and proper banking  procedures.
good,"A typical day as a banker at chase would be to show up 45-15 minutes before opening, depending on whether there was a company meeting scheduled for that day. Once the doors opened, you would prospect new clients and service walk in customers. A typical appointment can range from maintenance on an account to estate planning and investments. Would work up to 10 hours a day, due to working a half day on Saturday with a day off during the week."

The hardest part of the job was trying to implement JPM Chase's business model in a market that was almost 80% controlled by locally owned banks that were able to be more nimble and provide a full suite of services from the same department (silo).  The most enjoyable part of the job was winning business in an arena of other competitors when my employer was able to provide a superior product or service structure.  I also took great pleasure in helping my customers achieve market dominance, profitable operations and sustained growth.

A normal work day can start as early as 6:00am (depending on job) or as late as 10:00am. (love the flexibility). Most work days are 8 1/2-9 hours, depending on length of lunch. There can be training classes every week and optional training classes are available and promoted by management. Individual conferences with managers and upper management are the norm. Management wants to know if you are having issues performing your job and what can be done to raise your performance level. The VPs' door are open to suggestions. The attitude of the workplace is to be successful. For those that need or want overtime, the hours are usually available. The hardest part of the job is learning the numerous operating systems.

I learned how to be an active listener and get all jobs done at an accurate time frame. Working for this company I  learned how to manage my times accurately and appropriately, and making sure that I assist members at a certain time within calls. A great workplace culture will be  working  with respecting each other and having a great communication with one another. The hardest part of the job is to make sure that all accounts information are submitted by   5pm eastern standard time those times were pretty hard to submit due to the fact that the calls were back to back  as well.

good,"Throughout the 25 years that I worked in the vault Chase, I wore many different hats and learned many important and useful skills. I learned to strive for excellence in every task and how to be part of a team.I had a great relationship with management and felt appreciated everyday. My favorite part of the job was my coworkers who I looked at as like a family.  The worst part of the job was working at a job for 25 years where Monday through Friday we never knew what time we would be able to leave due to the fact we worked in a production area and were not allowed to leave until all the work was completed each day. Despite this I really enjoyed my job and am very appreciative that I was there 25 years until the entire department was outsourced."
good,Work on an Agile team. All the team members are helpful and nice. It is a pleasure to work here. Everyone is always ready to help with any problems. The only bad thing all the meetings makes it hard to meet deadlines at times.

good,"JP Morgan Chase Bank is a US based financial institution. I worked as Telephone Banker for more than a year and was invited to become a Senior Telephone Banker. Why I love Chase, because of the different values that they teach to all employees. The management is always fair and make sure that we enjoy our work despite of the work load and stress. I received a lot of support from my previous managers. The hardest part of the job was  my health, I tried so hard not to feel the stress and work load, I put my health on risk. The most enjoyable part of the job aside from the salary is the experience of being part of Chase family."
good,"Chase really takes care of their employees, and if you do well you will get recognized and rewarded with pay raises.  In my first year I'd received three pay raises and two promotions."
good,"The job itself is quite easy, you just have to be mindful at all times that you are handling money and also confidential information. Working here can be a great experience, but it can also be a dreadful one depending on management. Most customers are very sweet as long as you treat them with respect and a smile."

good,"You begin your work day assessing the work status, prioritizing what needs to transmit by end of day and moving resources to complete/accomplish this task. You learn your employee’s strengths and you work as a team to accomplish all goals/tasks. As a manager you keep upper management informed on any changes and or risks that may occur, I had a good management team. We had a very diverse workplace, people from all cultures. We respected and embraced differences as well as getting to learn differences. We participated in many charity events, food, school, blood drives are a few and many more. The hardest part of the job as with any production environment are systems issues and working to ensure all deadlines and SLA’s (Service Level Agreements) are met. The most enjoyable part of the job is celebrating successes with the team, knowing all staff by name and a little about all of them."

Monthly mailed out billing curtailment statements & data entry of floors(new/used dealers), payments,transfers, Equity transacitons to Sweep Specialist, emailed acct officer of any floors that took the dealership over their allowed credit line. I learned how to wire transfer funds to manufacturers; learned all about flooring auto dealerships on WMS system inhouse. Management treated us failrly with raises, workplace culture was enjoyable. Hardest part of the job was making sure I didn't wire funds over what was allowed. Most enjoyble part was working with the employees."
good,"I truly enjoyed being a member of JP Morgan Chase team in one of the largest branches on Long Island, NY for over five years. As part of management I was involved in opening procedures and conducted morning huddles on the daily basis when we had discussed staff performance from the previous day, draw plans and objectives for the current one and shared with colleagues best practices to motivate one another. Customer service had always been and no doubt still is a key element for us to keep our clients happy, build long term relationship and consistently expand customers' base. As a leader I had to make sure that my team of cashiers always presented the company's best practices which often resulted in great review left by happy customers or complements. It was the most enjoyable part of my job. In the contrary, the hardest part of my job was to terminate one of my team member due to misconduct. It was not an easy decision but I could not tolerate dishonesty towards customers, myself and the rest of my team."
good,I do not wish to present a review a this time. I Have enjoyed my time so far at this company and would recommend it to friends and family to learn in a good environment.

good,JPMorgan Chase it's an awesome place to work the work can be a little bit tedious learning from Sops instead of training in a class that is the only downfall but other than that I enjoy my job and the people around me I learned so much at one point when I was a temp at JPMorgan Chase I made my rounds and pick up a lot of experience I was happy they kept me there sad when I was laid off.
good,"Long days but it was worth it, learned a lot that I did not know before, the hardest part was the customers some time but you have to understand that their money is on the line"
good,"Open Branch, open registers, count ATM,  assist clients at the teller line, close. "
good,Working with JP Morgan Chase & Co. definitely elevates me in the market as you bring its name wherever you go. It is my privilege to call it my first home as it was a great training ground for my career. I definitely miss the culture and people there!
good,"I loved working for Chase because of my coworkers, didn't like the customers because they were rude. Sometimes management wouldn't really be on your side because the customer is always right."
good,Good place to start you career in financial services and banking. Salary could be higher but the benefits are good even for new employees. Software and company tools are behind where most of the financial services and banking industry is. Management more obsessed with cutting costs than helping employees or clients.
good,It is a fast-paced atmosphere in the call center.  It can be very stressful in a 100% call based job.  Chase will try to make it fun by providing employees with fun activities and paid luncheons to show appreciation for all the hard work provided.  It is a busy work day with a splash of excitement.
good,Good work ethic a must. Constant training is available and mandatory. Company is very strict on how management is to run the branch. Very competitive and offers many different financial solutions. .

good,"Busy work environment, sometimes quite stressful"
good,"I absolutely enjoyed every minute of working at J.P. Morgan Chase. I learned a lot of various tools that I have been applying to my everyday living. If I could return with the temp agency I applied through, I would not hesitate to do so."

good,Great place to work and build career. Environment was great and company has great culture. One thing that is bad it was incentives of the company. Hourly is very law and incentive is mid level.
good,Excellent Organization to work. Lot of support of senior management. People are supportive and it has a work hard play hard culture. Great team to be a part of
good,"J.P. Morgan provides the best environment in terms of learning and career growth. Challenging oppurtunities offered by the job profile and management prepare an individual to shoulder additional responsibilities for advancement in their career."
good,"I always be ready to learn something new, but with JP it was a stereo type work. Which I don't like but for job we don't have any right for the choice, and it was a part time job. I was and I am looking for full time job."
good,"A fun and innovative place to work. Everyone is incredibly smart, and rather than a stuffy typical bank culture, the culture rather is becoming more of that of a new tech firm."
good,"I was a contractor. They rotate contractors. Originally contracted with WAMU. When the Feds gave WAMU to Chase, I continued my duties until no longer needed. Of course it was increased bureaucracy, but hey, this is a huuuge bank, so expect that."
good,"Benefits are unbelivealbe, Work is hit or miss. You can have a day when you take 100 calls and then there are days where you take 50. It is a great place to work. but it's not for everyone."

good,"Motivated work Force ensuring high levels of customer serve."
good,"A typical day consist of opening accounts for customers. Looking for opportunities with customers as you build relationships with them through a personal connection. contacting previous customers for follow ups, while maintaining those relationships as well for any future opportunities."
good,Get your foot in do your year and transfer to where you want.  management will help you where you need it. Also to help you move to next department you also like to go

good,"i had an overall great experience working for Chase. I would return in immediately if asked to come back. relocation was mandatory at the time, and i was not ready to relocate in my personal life."

good,"Great Place to work, Fun, Great environment, Had Awesome supervisors. Great advancement and job opportunities, We were always helping each other as a team. The culture was awesome All my supervisor was great. We celebrated each other. I never would have left. They had  a reduction in Force. My only regret is that they laid of our entire team. I would love to go back there and work."

good,among all my employers i must say Chase is on my number 1 list. from the workplace to the benefits they are the best! they see to it that their employees are well compensated. They also give free snacks not to forget the unlimited free drinks and lunch. the management is really doing their work to make sure our benefits are being paid on time plus the salary is high too.
good,"I was fortunate enough to work in a good department, with a great manager and team. Worked on contract and hated when the contract ended. Currently trying to secure a position there again."
good,"Love This Company, and the direction they are headed. I'm only leaving because I have been placed with a manager who Is harsh and over-bearing to the point in which I dread coming in everyday. This happens from time to time in even the best of business structures and it is a shame I have to bring my talent elsewhere."
good,A typical day runs great as Nothing is hard as long as you trained properly I learned of department I was well cross trained. Management was awesome all the ones I had that's all I can speak for.
good,Its a very good and professional company.  They are very employee friendly and no need to worry about job security. The infrastructure and work culture is awesome.
good,At this job it was pretty laid back and fast paced at the same time. i was relaxed because the supervisor made it very clear what was to be done at the beginning of the shift. It was fast paced because we had to meet a certain quota every hour which means we had to open so many envelopes every hour in order to complete the mail load by the end of the shift. the job included opening and processing tax returns based on the urgency or delinquency of the return and also what type of return it was.
good,"JPM is a great company to be a part of. The CEO is a stand up guy who appears to care about his employees from afar. When you go to JPM in Boston, you are given a chance to contribute right away. There's a lot of work to be done in Boston right now and you will join a team with a lot of talent. The benefits are good. The pay is better than you'll find at a State Street or BNY. The stress level can be there at times but that can be said for any company.

good,Management was wonderful and always helped in job advancement.  The company was supportive and a pleasure to work for.  Problem solving was a group effort.
good,A typical day at work is helping customers with their daily transactions. Listening to and resolving customers complaints or concerns if any. Promoting products and services. Listen and understand customers needs and fulfilling them. Management is awesome! Everyone is a team player. We are like family. The hardest part of my job is not knowing when to stop assisting and making the customers happy as well as my colleauges. Most enjoyable part of my job is making my customers satisfied.
good,Work area is micromanaged.  Must be able to help and service customer's needs within 24 to 48 hours.  Be prompt and accurate with response to customer.

good,People are great here and always willing to help. There are tons of opportunities to learn different things by either moving within the company or using the many resources provided by the firm.
good,Fast paced yet balanced work environment. As with any company your experience with the company will be dependent on the management you work under. This company offers a lot of room to grow and expand your wings. Being a world wide company transferring within is a nice option. As with all major banks you are choosing to work for the brand so the salary will not be as competitive as smaller companies trying to compete.

good,Reviewing closing documents of loans post closed to ensure documents are error free. If errors are found ensuring that corrections are made and sent to customers. Because of this job I better understand the closing process in purchasing a home and what lenders are looking for. The management staff is very easy going and really values their staffs opinion. The hardest part of the job is that the task is repetitive. The most enjoyable part of the job is the employee appreciation. Chase really makes the employees feel valued.
good,It was a great experience working for J.P.Morgan Chase. Highly professional and innovative team I was working with. Worked with the new technology named NiFi for the marketing team to develop a marketing decision engine and provided the back end system support.

Some of the standards they hold us to i feel are not compensated for, especially being hired under the impression it was base pay + incentives and then 3 days before training being told it is no longer offering incentives.

As a mortgage banker for Chase I enjoy having to write my priorities and carried a calendar, basically work independently, make my own schedule for each priority."
good,"A typical day at Chase Bank begins in the morning huddle. In the Huddle is where the team gets to verbalize goals for the week as it pertains to customer service, referrals, and overall expectations for the rest of the day. Customers are welcomed by either greeter or tellers or both. Transactions are quick but very important as they serve as the opportunity for tellers to build relationships with the customers and also introduce them to new bank products that they may want to  further learn about."

good,They pay for performance! If you are good at sales and you are ready to make money you will prosper! This is a very ethical company and they go by the books. Those who don't make it in the mortgage banking field working for this company may have some skeletons in their closet they need to extract. If you are an honest mortgage loan officer you will find that this is the best company to work for. I was in the mortgage banking for 14 years 6 of them with Chase on the East Coast.

Seems like there are plenty of avenues for advancement. "

good,"Working for JP Morgan Chase was a great experience. We had complex loan processing solutions to generate on a daily basis and the pace was very fast. We had tangible goals to strive towards everyday and it was a fun and dynamic challenge to push ourselves to be more productive and assist struggling homeowners. Management and the line level employees had good forums for communication and for the most part, everyone was on the same page. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with many various functions and demands of the business.

First, they would keep saying to people that they are not ready to be promoted especially when some people clearly demonstrate that they are more than qualified to be promoted. Until someone is actually thinking about leaving do they actually start offering the promotion. Second, plenty of corporate politics. You have to go out with management and have drinks/suck up.

They put a strong emphasis on diversity, and inclusion. They always have cultural events and clubs that everyone can join.

What I enjoy most would be the learning experience daily so that I can be great at my job to be able to advance.

It can get overwhelming most of the time because this particular branch is always busy but you can always count on your coworkers to help you out and they dont ever make you feel like you’re bothering them when you ask for help. My favorite part of my job is communicating to my regular customers who have been banking there for years. It’s nice getting to know them well.
