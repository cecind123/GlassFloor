bad,Anthem is one of the worst places I have ever worked for They claim they have diversity but there’s no diversity in this companyI would never offer this company to anyone
bad,Racist company. Terrible leadership. Pay stinks. Lack of communication. No structure. Unable to succeed because of poor team leaders. This particular location just overall sucks
bad,"First off, the hiring process taken by the third party they hire was horrid. It took them three months to hire me on after I accepted their offer. Then the training was awful. Out of the 23 people that were in our training, by the day we hit the floors, we were down to 8 people. The training was inadequate and if you are under the age of 30, you will run into a lot of ageism by the boomers that sit in their cubicles constantly hammering on about you when you're not there. The work environment was toxic, and so was the management. Even if you have enough time to cover an unexpected absence, they will still count it heavily against you. Furthermore, the attendance policy was grotesque. When I was working here, I had a shift from 11:30 am to 8:00 PM. Most of the people were out of the office by 3, and that was including the managers. I was left alone and was the only one in my department from 5:00 pm onward. Meaning that I couldn't ever ask for a full day off without manager approval. If you look at it like this: We take calls from PST to EST and we are open to 8:00 PM, meaning that you are not taking calls for up to three hours in the end of your shift, you can't do any call backs because by 6 PM local time, all of the nations doctors offices are closed. They would hold call-backs against you, when you have no choice but to make call backs every morning because you couldn't help the member. Do Not Work Here."
bad,New management changes left my team with an unqualified people manager. Tasked with completing complex projects the same day and told we were incompetent if we were not able to complete the task.
bad,"I've been told numerous times I am replaceable, supervisors berate you and treat you like you're scum beneath them. I was specifically told Anthem wants your home life to be 2nd to work and overtime is mandatory."
bad,"Toxic environment, people are not willing to help. Training was non existent, you're pretty much set to fail from day one. Management plays favorites!"
bad,This place is by far the worst corporate place I have ever worked in my entire life. There is no consistency in anything.Everyone is rude. It seems that higher ups only care about the bottom line.
bad,Inconsistent training management and pay. Very unprofessional work environment. Management never has answers. Promotions with no raise. Benefits are very expensive.
bad,"If you enjoy you work being held up due to another department needing to do their job but higher ups acting like it's your fault then welcome. Welcome to constant changes for no reason, convoluted systems, wanting production numbers for a job that takes research. They say your work is appreciated but it will never feel like it. If you work here start posting out after 90 days or a year."
bad,Not worth your time to work there. Hr employee at healthsun are really unprofessional. Don’t have any type of curtesy for there employees. They need to be retrain .
bad,"Dedicated all I had for a long time.  They took our jobs and sent them overseas.  In addition, required all of us to work mandatory overtime to help our replacements get caught up on the work.  I heard a few years later though they bought it back"
bad,"Management shows favoritism "
bad,Don't make complaints to ARRT they botch investigations and make you the criminal. Also when you file a complaint Managers will demote you and write you up if you don't discuss confidential complaints with them. Especially if the ARRT manager says to keep this conversation confidential. At the same time they allow employees to harrass and threaten other employees. Managers and ARRT harbor a toxic culture and will not act on the employee threatening to blow up the department.
bad,"Anthem has a sexist and exclusionist environment. Expect men in the same job to be paid more and promoted faster. Don't expect any career development or recognition for your work. Do expect men to frequently mistake you for someone's secretary and for your boss to ignore you. Unless you're a man, then expect a great experience"
bad,"If I could give them 0 stars I would, WORST JOB EVER! Disrespectful managers, toxic work environment, the whole job was just a big mess! It’s just a big playground basically, no structure what so ever but yet they are a “ Fortune 500 company “"
bad,This was the worst place to work. Management was awful pay was bad and it was very stressful. It paid about $5 less per hour than other call center jobs in the area.
bad,Anthem is not a stable place if you are looking for a longterm career opportunity.  Lay offs without due notice....one day you're mewting and exceeding expectations then the very next day you're getting laid off.
bad,"anthem prides itself as a culture of growth and opportunity especially in advancing ones college education. after prior approval of a flexible schedule tho work with school schedule they backed out two quarters into it. yes, my degree catered to the position and they would have retained top talent. they left me feeling cornered and without many options."
bad,"The one thing that the new hires at Anthem can always agree on, is that they were lied to when they interviewed. New Candidates are provided a mental picture of Anthem that promises unlimited potential for career advancement, flexible hours, generous time off, and learning opportunities that can be taken advantage of at any time."
bad,The training was bad. No job security and the pay for the job was horrible. They describe the job incorrectly. High turnover in every department. Very Micro Manage
bad,"Anthem lays off every 6 months.  Even if you do your job, you are still subject to being let go.  They provide ""assistance"" in the form of web help when you get booted, but the help is useless.  Might be a good place to start a career, but not for anyone looking for long term employment."
bad,I do not advise this company to anyone. They are a backstabbing company who does not care about the little guys the chain. Me and a co-worker were called into a meeting at 8:30 AM one morning and by 9:15 AM we were both walked out of the building. We were not even allowed to go back to our desks to get our personal belongings. We  were told our positions were eliminated. We had no pre-warning at all. I had just had my 10 year anniversary with this company. Alot of my  co-workers are currently losing  there jobs as well.
bad,"The management has truly been a nightmare, full of ridiculous micromanaged low morale, overpaid managers with unacceptably incapable skillsets. Some managers never recognize senior associates as valuable assets, and all they like to do is to constantly ill-manage in their own favors to demoralize the team."
bad,Manger is horrible. There is no support.  You are left to figure things out on your own.  Computer and phones are always down.   They promise everything and give none.
bad,Horrible company to work for.  $13.50 an hour to be yelled at by providers and members all day.  Coworkers are not friendly or helpful.  Management is a joke.  Training class was a joke.  No actual training just alot of reading on Medicare policies and listening to the instructor talk about herself and her family.  My advice don't do it!!
bad,"This place is bleeding people, constantly hiring, yet does nothing to keep the staff.  DO. NOT. BOTHER!  They make you question everything, even how health Care is supposed to be financed."
bad,"I left Anthem a few years ago because they treat their employees like a number. Their wages are the lowest in the area and their leadership is very unprofessional and incompetent.... I miss the people on my team, but many of them have left as well. Anthem tends to let people go if they’ve been with the company too long, and replaces them with new people that they can pay less. People feel unappreciated here. I was with Anthem for a few years and as soon as they went public for profit, the employees no longer  mattered. I’m glad I left when I did."
bad,"Very suck place to work ,the manager are very unprofessional all of them,they no have feeling for no ,body they only  puch you to work more and more and never is good for them,i prefered work in a factory and not work again in EASY SCRIPT AT DORAL IN MIAMI.becarefull and do go there"
bad,"No room for advancing unless you know the right people. Climbing the ladder is based on how well you network inside the company rather that how hard you work, how dedicated you are, etc. Its not based on talent at all. If you need to frequently use the restroom just avoid this place."
bad,Management is terrible!!! No one is on the same page so it’s just a guessing game. One of the most unorganized insurance companies I’ve ever worked for!
bad,"I think Anthem is by far the worst place I have ever worked in my life, The pay is ok but the managers need a lot of work , Employees get no respect and managers care nothing about them or what they are going through . I would never recommend Anthem to anyone including my worst enemy . The only thing they have going for them is the gym and that says a lot . there was no enjoyable part of the job ."
bad,"Really nothing positive to say about Anthem.  You are nothing but a number and all that matters is what anthem wants.  Manager, Operation Experts don't know anything. New employees are hired and are thrown out on the floor with little or no training. Stay far away from this company!"
bad,Large company with potential.  Prone to layoffs in multiple departments based on direction of leader at that time. My manager changed 4 times in 2 years. Employees are unsure if will have a job in 3 months or 3 years
bad,It sucks. Short breaks micro manage. Inexperienced managers. They hire anyone that pass the drug test..if you wasnt a part of the in crowd you got treated different. High school atmosphere
bad,I feel their interview process wasn't sufficient after the 4 years I started working there. They treat their current employees that have worked their long term unfair.  They offer better incentives to new hires than to long term employees just to get people in the door. They seem to hire just about anybody with no experience or background on what is required at this company.  I strongly feel that is why they continue to have such huge turn over rates and still continue to have it.  In the end it's not about what you know it's about who you know!
bad,HR VP is an idiot who cares not for anyone had to do a lot of work for low pay Worked like a dog and none of it was appreciated the littlest hing you do bad you get screwed
bad,"Their idea of training is always one to two hours of training, and then throwing you into the calls the very next day. This means you are literally taking calls THAT YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT usually for weeks. It literally takes weeks of sounding like an idiot and getting absolutely terrible surveys (which affects any chance you have of pay raises by the way) and management’s excuse always is that you have a chat that you can ask questions in. So you have a loaded off member on the phone screaming at you and here you are, frantically trying to type a question in a freaking chat, hoping someone will eventually answer a question in a freaking chat, all the while, you have the member on the phone, waiting minutes on the phone for an answer, you, waiting, sounding like an idiot because you don’t know the plan because you had an hour of training and then got thrown on the calls the next freaking day. And do you think your getting a raise for taking a whole ‘nother line of calls? No! No, they will not! "
bad,Mission statement says accountability as core.  This is not true!  The only plus is the location.  It is located near various modes of transportation.
bad,"The mission is to provide excellent care to the members. It is highly dependent on the management team you get as to the nature of your tenure at Anthem. Good managers who can perform your job function and strive to understand the pressures you work under are great managers. Otherwise get used to managers who know nothing, hassle you with questions, and give lousy direction. It is difficult to live a management team that will throw you under the bus to make themselves look good. If you are adept at smooching rump, you'll do great.If not STAY AWAY."
bad,It was a high pressure job with little support. then they moved out of state and I had to drive Uber. I would have stayed with them but they left California
bad,"This is a slave driving company, they ever monitor how many times you go to the bathroom. Your sick time is the same as your vacation time. You don’t get any extra days for sick time. Very stressful environment with no appreciation for their employees. Management is horrible and will ask you for your opinion then take credit for everything. Overall not a great experience."
bad,"Management sucks. The quarterly incentive raises are built on the survey system. But let's say Anthem double bill their customers accidentally, then it counts against the employee and not Anthem. It's Pimping & Hoeing to the fullest how they treat their employees."
bad,"I work 60 - 70 hours a week and they want me to work more hours. My supervisor has no idea what i do, yet she feels she can provide and accurate performance review. Stay away from this company."
bad,They say they try to help you be promoted within but they don't and they blackball you. They hire through temp agencies so they don't have to pay their employees benefits and then they don't hire permanently to allow those people to have benefits
bad,"At the time that I worked for the company, the culture really revolved around who you were friends with, who liked you, and perception/gossip.  Leadership was very rarely around but moreso relied on their favorite right hand people to provide them with information on the day to day.  Pay was low."
bad,"Anthem has transformed to a company that is worried about the Stock Market and not the investment of their Employees. They are starting to purge their long term employees that have dedicated their careers to Anthem. Every year Anthem is looking to reduce Employee Benefits packages and increase their out of pocket. Anthem expects you to work thru lunches, breaks and work many extra hours to achieve unrealistic goals. Anthem's culture has transformed with no Employee loyalty and  a feeling you get let go any day. There is a saying on getting let go, it is not a matter of if you get let go but, when will you be let go. With Anthem's aggressive transformation initiative's, Groups, Members and Employee's will suffer under the plan to show the market how they made money to increase stock price."
bad,"No work life balance, IT expected to work 80 hours and still No thank you or anything."
bad,"Poor work life balance. Fast pace, high stress environment with micromanagement. Poor accomodation and work facilities. Poor human resorce management representation management associate relations."
bad,Nothing was not challenging . There was great people and team but work was not always handed to the right people. sometimes you would get more work if you were good with your position and the boss or manager left early for the day you would have to close.
bad,"I would not recommend this type of job to anyone, there is no diversity in the hiring of minorities it is just a toxic hostile work environment and has a very high attrition rate."
bad,It is a very depressed workplace culture.  Higher Management does not appreciate the work that lower paid workers do.  Lower paid employees are treated disrespectfully by Higher Management.
bad,"•Most days I get into the office early to make sure everything is ready for our first patients. That includes walking the doctor through his schedule and looking through the office scheduling system to check for any changes. I do a similar task at the end of the day, responding to any messages in our scheduling system and walking the doctor through the plan for the next day."
bad,"Anthem is a terrible employer. The  managers  are cut throat,  have  their favorites. This  company really does not care  about patients even though they tell you they do. All that they care  about is earning money and a profit. "
bad,Of you not a favorite they skip over you. The place is a horrible place to work if you’re not white. All the higher people are all white and that’s how they want to keep it. Hire people off the streets to be managers one of the managers friends from her old job Humana it’s very sloppy and unorganized.
bad,"Working at Anthem really increases your stress level. The job itself is not hard, but the expectations are unrealistic in the customer service area. Insurance is a difficult enough subject to explain to people who sometimes have no idea about what is involved. When you have to throw in the expectation of only having the person on the line for 4-7 minutes to keep you talk time low, this seems impossible. Some situations require you to make outbound calls on behalf of the member, this affects your hold time which is another unrealistic expectation."
bad,"The best thing Anthem has to offer is work from home. Besides that, they have very poor management. Lack of autonomy, workers are not respected or appreciated. The benefits are poor. Very high deductible on insurance. Work life balance is very poor. They force you to work over and beyond without paying over time. If you’re full time expect to work more than 40 hours a week without compensation. The company would drop you in a minute if you’re not meeting their unrealistic expectations. They don’t give you the tools needed to win and expect you to figure it out."
bad,"I will never go back to this call center in houston the manager are bias ,crooked, unprofessional management. . Any of the leads have worked under each other at some point and cover each others back..They will blackball you from promotions and HR needs to do a internal investigation...They are more concern about numbers and merit than ethics. Member literally curse you out and are disrespectful..And no matter how many surveys they put out for internal input the staff will not give the real info due to them knowing managers will use it against them. How about contacting the ex employees."
bad,"Can not trust senior staff on any level ever! Especially the concierge department for customer care rep nor escalations department. They will stab you in the back, will try to get rid of you when you do not agree with them and more fun stuff."
bad,"I worked for Anthem Blue Cross for almost 7 years in UR dept Location Atlanta, Ga (Buckhead) Position: UR Rep"
bad,"The work environment was too stressful no the company doesn’t care about its employees like it used to, the policies change according to your manager it isn’t consistent"
bad,I would not advise anyone to work at Anthem due to the management maybe in other areas management is different but in the area I was in management was very cut-throat cruel unkind and not professional.
bad,I would advise anyone to apply at Anthem that is a hard worker. Our work culture was very diverse- I was appreciated for my dedication and customer driven work ethic.
bad,"the worst job ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I would never recommend anyone to work at anthem, worst management the training they provide you sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,There is no flexible schedule. PTO is rarely approved. Everyone of my team has left Anthem in less than 3 years. Management is very passive aggressive. No meetings. If you ask a question for clarification you get punished and put down for asking. They never give you the hours you were promised. And if you're bilingual be prepared to work x5 more than your peers for less money.
bad,"Great training and community feeling, life and work balance. I recommend to work there. There is a lot of training provided to make us successful customer service agents."
bad,"acobus Energy Inc – Milwaukee, WI"
bad,"Anthem could care less about their employees. Overworked, unrealistic expectations, no appreciation, verbally abusive, nonsensical processes and procedures."
bad,Not a good company to work for .Management is very poor and do not care if you want to move up or not . If your not in a click you can hang everything up .
bad,"Absolute Chaos in the Membership Enrollment Department, no structure, and very very poor management! I wouldn’t recommend this position at Anthem at all the pay is horrible; management and their assistance lack communication skills within new employees by making bias decisions because of favoritism within the company!"
bad,"In my 22 years of nursing this was the absolute worst job I’ve ever had.  I’ve never in all of my years been told I had to educate patients by reading from a script and being scolded for using my own nursing knowledge. They falsely promise work/life balance, flexibility and career advancement during the hiring process. They left out the fact that this was a call center and I’d be forced to sit at a desk for at least 8 hours and take back to back calls with only two 15 minute breaks, a 30 minute lunch and be harassed for taking bathroom breaks. Extreme micromanaging.  When I attempted to transfer to a less stressful position I was told by HR that there wasn’t another position that I was qualified to do. Working from home did nothing to relieve the stress that came along with this job.  This position caused several stress related health issues. I started this position with no health issues other than slightly elevated blood pressure. By the time I left, I was on two blood pressure pills, medication for depression and anxiety in addition to my hair falling out in clumps."
bad,Doesnt care if you have a child that has a critical illness doesnt except excuse or allow time to be made up. Manager doesnt know hiw to speak to people
bad,Manager would not allow questions during training. The person assigned to train lied constantly. I did not know how big of a mess I was walking into. Like Lions Den. Very high turnover. Former employees even told me they would verbally fight loud enough to disturb other departments.
bad,This company is by far one of the most unprofessional unorganized companies that I have come in contact with. I was dragged along for almost three wks
bad,Anthem has no flexibility with their employees schedule.  They all about what you can do for them but people have lives outside of Anthem .The training sucks and it really don't prepare you when you get on the floor. Managers are clueless of their job functions but know how to fire you and fine faults.
bad,Management at Anthem was very poor.  The job was not difficult but management was very unorganized.  Most of the time it felt as if I was managing myself.  There was almost no structure making job duties unclear at times.
bad,Very over worked and underpaid. Often times the employees who came to work had to suffer because of the slackers who did not show up on a regular basis. Also had a very high turnaround rate due to salary and work environment.
bad,"It was very unorganized and stressful. Things were forever changing and even management could even keep up. In return, I would never know where to go for answers."
bad,This place was not professional.   To much favoritism.  I felt like an outsider.  No reason for some of the points for employees to view things in the call center.
bad,"Mid level management is under so much stress to perform and achieve such outrageous goals."
bad,Worst job I ever had. Customer Service they treat you like garbage. Get yelled at on the phone all day. Can't leave your desk. Management is terrible. Everyone kisses up to them. If you are smart they don't like you.
bad,Anthem is a terrible place to work. I have been laid off 3 times. It doesn't matter how good you are. I put in over 40 hours and my production was off the charts and Anthem still laid me off. They do it all the time. NO job is safe.
bad,"They cycle though employees, they will tell you to ask for help, but then do no provide the proper or addlt training as requested, Pay decrease after hired on full time. Had a horrid work experience with Anthem and would not recommend them as a future emplyer for anyone looking for long term employment."
bad,"Depending on whom you are your workload would differ, if mgmt liked you you would be given easier work. Most mangers did not care about the employees."
bad,"I was really surprised to have been walked out for asking two or three individual's to quite down. "
bad,"Lack of training"
bad,"You are expected to process a large volume of claims while having limited knowledge to do so. You are  encouraged to ask questions, but are told you are wasting time if you do. I worked for this company for over 3 years with the bulk of it being customer service. I decided to apply for a claims job and got hired for it. I sat through an online training class with the trainer in another state who breezed over what we were supposed to do. After training class is over you are expected to process claims accurately by working your way up to the set standard quota. You are to do this accurately and with zero to no errors. The company makes you feel like a number based on your numbers. The HR team will pick and choose who they help depending on how big of an issue you raise. You are encouraged to go for other jobs with the promise you would be hired and be a great fit for the team only to have that taken away from you because of a manager who plays favorites.  The pay is too low and the cost of the company's own insurance for its employees is too high.  Research this company before you make the choice to apply and work for them. Management is all over the place with so many methods  and ways to do things. Managers have been at  my location for years and years. HR does not want to help at all either.  Workplace culture is a joke, laughable at best. Hardest part of the job was trying to identify the issues at hand with limited help and the best part of the day was leaving."
bad,This company is horrible to work for. They fire employees with out fallowing there guidlines. The managers in my department gave permotion to employees not based on performance but how well they kissed the managers butt. Sulervisors who made nasty comments and talked about things with other employees that shouldnt be talked about in the floor. Not a friendly enviorment. And the pay sucks for yhe amnt of work you had to do
bad,I have nothing positive to say about this company. They promise the world and give nothing. Stay away from this employer.
bad,"Management was very unorganized; furthermore, unable to assist any questions members or employees had pertaining to certain medical benefits. Also, very hard to move up within the company, manager indicated, ' I should be glad I have a position in this economy."""
bad,"Made the bad decision of working here. Don't repeat my mistake. Anyhow, this company won't exist in 10 years because of how old school their technology is. Everything is excel, tedious and built by people that give zero effs."
bad,"Horrible work environment.  Not worth the money.   You are not important, neither are the customers.   The only thing they care about is the almighty dollar and how they can get more of it.   Greedy corporate fat cats leeching their astronomical salaries off the blood, sweat and tears of everyday working class people.  SHAMEFUL!"
bad,"Typical day at work is more or less you either are focused or you are not a lot changes everyday , I learned a lot and wish I had the chance to learn more and better teachers to explain the information, Management was the worst I have ever come in contacted with and I have worked with a lot of management . co workers came and went so hard to make friends , hardest part of the job was the demanding goals every day and good and bad days no enjoyable parts"
bad,"The only thing good about anthem is the cook in the deli, lol... Everything else is boring and cold feeling, its basically log in, do your work and go home"
bad,"Tampa FL"
bad,Great place to work. flexible work schedule in some departments. Work from home options. Over the years the benefits prices have increased. Overall a good place to work.
bad,"Tampa office on Westshore, managers suck. Carmen especially. Unless you speak Spanish she does not talk to you, and people are miserable in the Medicaid dept. Mike the other manger treats you like your in the service and if your not white he don't talk to u. Stay away. Plus they just laid off 30 people. Sad"
bad,"Management is confused, petty, and play favorites. The company does not care about their workers or provide any training or mentoring. They favor male associates. Terrible place to work"
bad,Do not expect a career if you arent on the list of favorites. And expect to be taken for granted and paid poorly while others who are lazy and useless get promotions and raises. Workload is horrendous and they know it but dont care. Bathroom time is by their clock only so expect many medical problems due to the job and forget any ideas of having fun at work. The sweatshops at Anthem will not have any of that! You are nothing but veal in a hutch waiting for your slaughter date and nothing more. Anthem knows how starving the work force is and does everything in their power to exploit you.
bad,"Micromanaged, too strict of policies, training is very tunnel visioned and boring, hard to focus on and they give no room for personal life and work life. It's sad."
bad,I learned a significant amount of information and experience while working at Anthem. A typical day at work was usually really busy but there was always some type of break to breathe between calls.
bad,"Micro-Management at it's worst. Never a good time for time off. No decent raises, no decent promotions."
bad,I haven't had a good experience working for this company. There is NO employee morale and the company doesn't do anything for their employees unless you are an executive. I was never given the appropriate resources to complete my job duties.
bad,"I worked at anthem for 8 months and I found it a nice place to work at. Management sucks, and some of the people there are very helpful. If you are looking for a job with Anthem please do not work in enrollment on the 9th floor. If you want the stress off your back. Dont do it. The communication between the manager sucks. Work for a different person but stay off!!!!!! The 9th floor."
bad,"This job has its likes and dislikes. It's a laid back type of job. But can be very stressful and busy. Some great people, that love to help you. Besides that management ""SUCKS""!!!!! One thing is to have a boss but not another mother. You don't want to work here. If you do try another floor not the 9th floor."
bad,"Not very organized department and salary should be more considering the amount of work that is involved."
bad,They train you for months only to hire you doing something else.  The manager at WellPoint in Billing is very insecure and she likes to make coworkers against one another.  If anyone does not want to conform she will fire you.  She likes to bully employees because she is insecure and bring her personal life to work and takes it out on her employees.  She is not professional and set people up on the job to lose their job by using higher resources in California to fictitiously give you errors.  Beware of an manager with MS initials.  You will have to conform to gossip and be on the bully team or find another job
bad,Call center environment; accepting in bound calls. This company benefits were great along with working around internal customers.
bad,A typical day at work in the big city. The co-workers are great and are the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part of the job is the lack of organization
bad,Family atmosphere learned a lot would work there again high celling for advancement in most departments pay on mid level could be higher but benefit package is excellent
bad,"Very unorganized, very hostile environment. Cant trust management, no policy and procedures in place about the job itself. Everybody is not on the same page. They have hired people who have forged their resume."
bad,"Opportunity for advancement was seldom and most days the environment was negative starting from the Directors and cascading to the customer service reps. The benefit from working with Anthem, was the opportunity to join HYPE which focused on building opportunities for associates to advance within the company."
bad,"It was a not a good experience. I worked with many incompetent people including the management staff. In addition, trainers were not given material and/or accurate syllabi to properly train staff. Trainers were not given the proper support to facilitate classes smoothly."
bad,"Managers do not care at all for their analysts and throw them under the bus with no care. Job training does not exist. Thrown into the water with no guidance and will be fired if not creating an exceptional product right away."
bad,"In all my 27 years of nursing, I have never been treated so poorly. RN Manager had no interest in answering questions, while still on orientation !!"
bad,this company does not stand by associates.  Several employess were terminated as a result of answering honestly on the annual compliance recertification.  these were associates that were acquired when Wellpoint took over Amerigroup.  Not a trust worthy organization
bad,"I enjoyed my job, and my co-workers were fun."
bad,Too much favoritism and malicious director and supervisors. No assistance and job training and extra stress with poor compensation and extra stress for good measure with a dash of discrimination. The systems are old and outdated and the system is constantly crashing and not working properly. That doesn't stop management from blaming all that on you. Run don't walk from this place.
bad,"Process a certain number of claims a day is expected regardless of issues with the claim. I've learn a lot as far as processing a claim; however, a lot of training from management is limited. Most of what I've learn is from processing and/or other team members. Hardest part of my job is trying to produce the amount of claim a day without errors and lack of training."
bad,"hard work, on time schedule, training short not very well detailed."
bad,"Just awful. I've never worked somewhere so stressful in my life for the little pay they were giving. Team leads rarely gave any guidance for any issues or questions you had so you had to bs your way through 30min to 2.5hr phone calls plus the many different programs you had to use to answer questions. Absolutely hated everything about it except my coworkers,  but my mentor was on the verge of a breakdown every day so i hated to ask her too many questions. None of the people I started this job with are there anymore, I only made it maybe 3 months & training alone was about 2. I believe it depends on what department you work in, but this department was h**l for me."
bad,"Contracted temporary work."
bad,"Training is not very good, no help after. They keep changing your hours. The worst job I have ever  had. The turnover is constant. always hiring."
bad,"Managed daily operations of business including budgeting and cost control. Fostered a team atmosphere through improved training, communication and motivation.  Monitored and purchased inventory, ensuring sufficient levels to accommodate demands."
bad,"Complete favoritism, not worth your time. Mgrs and sups are unprofessional, and play favorites. If your not in the group then you are treated as such. They protect one another and could care less about their associates"
bad,"Very high volume of calls with multiple questions regarding insurance and premiums. "
bad,"Anthem was a great business to work for until it became an acquisition. "
bad,"Customer service - call center for small groups"
bad,filled out and completed enrollment forms for businesses to get their employees benefits at the best prices.  
bad,"This was an extremely difficult company to work for due to the high levels of abuse and harassment that seemed to be perpetuated by the company code of conduct and ethics which is worded in such a way that prevents anyone above the position of an entry-level representative from being held accountable for their behavior. As an entry level representative in this company you are at the mercy of anyone above you which means if your working on a difficult claim and need assistance, but your assigned operations expert feels that their personal conversation with their peer is more important, you get ignored and your production suffers. This also means that if you bring this to the attention of your manager and they have a personal relationship with the operations expert, they will defend this person NO MATTER WHAT, they will tell the operations expert you were complaining about them and now, you are on the bad side of both your manager and your operations expert and their ""office clique"" of peers. You may never receive assistance with your work again which will continue to effect your production, you will receive extremely negative monthly reviews which will effect your raise and possibly be harassed and have rumors started about you by the very people that should be responsible for your growth and development. If this situation is brought to the attention of human resources they will talk to your manager and tell them everything that you have said and advise to manager to ""mediate towards a solution"" which typically leads to more workplace harassment to ""remind"" you of who's in charge."
bad,Several services departments have already been outsourced and more are on the way. Dead end job with no opportunity for advancement.
bad,"not a good place to work at all. most empl not happy, management in diff states than the units they managed, therefore they did not care about anything going on in their units. people were very vindictive, back stabbing, etc - mgmt failed to take care of the issues even when informed of problems. no recognition for doing a good job. you weren't trained to do all the functions needed to perform your job. they report they are the employer of choice, but evidently they aren't asking any of the employees."
bad,"Lets put it this way, I can relate to the children who do slave labor for pittance."
bad,"They are liars, they outsource and everyone there is miserable!!"
bad,"During my interview they made the company sound like it was a great place for advancement and opportunities to grow in my position and pay. Upon hire I soon realized that although alot of nice ""perks"" were being promised, that rarely anyone received these perks as they would have alot of exclusions and ways of you not being eligible for such benefits. The upper management treats employees as numbers and it is not uncommon to receive very short notice of mandatory overtime and last minute changes. The pay was awful and promises of future opportunities for pay increases was nothing but hot air. All and all, I would NEVER recommend anyone work here. It is a place for someone that just needs a job, not a place that they enjoy going to or that they want to start a career at. Two thumbs down for Wellpoint."
bad,The company offered good benefits but the job itself was boring and had you confined to a desk. It had many time constraints and unrealistic call goals.
bad,"If you are truly incompetent, you should absolutely apply the the anthem call center in Portland.  You will absolutely  rise into management.  In my 30 plus years of call center management, I have never seen the like.  Clueless management, zero support and poor pay for the average employee."
bad,You sit at a desk all day staring at a computer and take incoming calls from people (often times rude people) regarding health insurance. I would never recommend this job to ANYBODY. Training that was given also wasn't very good.
bad,I was in a class of 20 and within 1 year there was only 3 left !!!  That’s says a lot right there!!   They only care about there numbers .. managers only come to you when something is wrong ..if your adherence was a Little low there right there .. if you need help forget it !!!  I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone!! Your stuck in a  cubicle all day stressing to hurry with each member so you don’t get in trouble!!!  Do horrible place to work!!!
bad,Favoritism runs rampant.  If you get a low survey score one month and over age they let you go. But when you are CSR 2 they may give you a break on a low score month. Anthem is very inconsistent in rules and regulations.
bad,If you need a pay check apply. No room for advancement. Everyone starts off with a different amount. Supervisor is super weird. No one is on the same page.
bad,Anthem when I started was an amazing company compiled of great teams. I had a point of contact for every system we worked with. Now the company is literally all over the place. My most recent manager had no experience with customer service at all. He came to me and the team for assistance learning the systems. This is because the company was not giving him any time to train effectively. I helped assist the new hires in getting acquainted with the new systems. I did manager work with no pay raise or even a thank you.
bad,"The politics of various departments and groups drive how things are done here, not policy and procedures.  People disrespect others freely and there is no collaboration.  This place is suppose to be following Agile, but it's not dedicated to truly following and shows in the delivery of products.  There are a lot of good people here, but their voice is not being heard, which is disappointing and sad."
bad,"Unless you are the type to brown nose your way to the top, this place is not for you. Doesn't matter if you excel at your job, if management doesn't like you then you're not advancing. Management will overlook the fact that you've been there for years and know the ins and outs of the job if you're the type to advocate for your rights or speak up against injustice. Managers don't know how to make things easier for employees, yet they feel the need to belittle the hard workers and come up with ways to make life harder for everyone. Management can't seem to use critical thinking and are stuck in their ways. Also, 1 manager seems to be bringing his best friend, former coworkers and fiance on to work in the same dept and being buddy buddy with them..very unprofessional!"
bad,"New director, manager and team lead are the most incompetent, punitive, retaliatory people I have ever come across in my 10 years of experience. 18+h."
bad,"Micromanage, working here was one of the worst jobs I ever work for. I would not recommend working at this place to my enemy. On one of my yearly reviews I had a meet requirements but did not receive my pay increase"
bad,"Advice to Management"
bad,"Management in Tampa is sophomoric at best, gossiping rules the culture, female managers are constantly at each other's throats,preferential treatment for lackies...worst of all, no support for employees and the starting pay is a joke. Constantly helping the temps because they are not adequately trained, professionalism takes back seat with management."
bad,"Poor management,  rude customers, lazy coworkers,  unhappy environment.  Out of 6 months our team received one email from our manager that was positive. The rest consisted of how to get fired. Mandatory overtime for months at a time.  Team manager never walked the floor or had huddles. Could go days without even seeing her and when you did it was a passing in the hallway. Glad i quit not suprised such high turn over rate."
bad,"The hardest part of the job is low-wages, favoritism to curtain employees, and unfair treatment. Handling unfair client Health Benefit plans with outrageous prescription cost."
bad,"Company wastes money trying to be like facebook or google, but only tries to emulate them by the fun things that google or facebook do .instead of actually treating their people the way that google and facebook treat their employees.   Without building the culture from the ground up they try to build the roof first and hope the building follows.   "
bad,"The company offers work at home positions which allow for a work/balance. However, there is no difference in work at home or the office with this company beyond not having to drive to and from the office."
bad,Very stressful workplace with minimal support from managers. Most enjoyable part of my job were my co-workers who were very supportive of each other and helped each other a lot. The hardest part is doing your job with rushed training and no support from manager.
bad,I was very busy on the phones every 5 -10 min the phones ring you half to be available answer the calls quick. I learned that people can be so nasty at times also and my manager was very mean never debt with that type of person before. But other then that it was a good place to work.
bad,"I have worked with Anthem for 15 years. Team under new manager and director. Too much politics.New manager found ways of getting rid of good employees and kept the bad ones. Director doesn't even get feedback from other employees and just sided on the new manager's testimony. I love the company, it's just the management where I have worked for was horrible to say the least."
bad,"I was involuntarily terminated for making a personal phone call after working many weeks 50-60 hours/week and received very good and positive reviews and 100% accuracy on audits. Very unfair termination, no warning, no option for resignation or action plan. 3 years of service, work-life balance was ""highly regarded"" however, actions speak louder than words."
bad,"Save yourself- don't work here"
bad,Hardly any of the material to do your job smoothly was provided. Things were always changing but the information got to us intake reps very slowly or never.
bad,"management- unprofessional "
bad,"BCBS of Ohio is a good place for someone single to work for.  I have to say the coworkers made the day,because you stay on the phone all day,and it was just not the job for me.  I miss my patient interaction, and knowing I made someone's day the most."
bad,"The company is very disorganized, with poor communication between departments, as well as management and lower-tier employees.  Additionally, the ability to quickly advance is almost non-existant, with experience and education mattering for some, but not all employees.  I would not recommend the company, as I feel that with the new ACA laws in place, in addition to the 2015 security hack and the substantial gaps in policy and procedure are setting the entire organization up for ultimate failure."
bad,"This is a call center. You will be confined to your cubicle for 9 hours a day with two 15 minute and one 30 minute ASSIGNED breaks...you cannot combine them.  Nothing exciting to report about the work day.  All you're doing is making/receiving calls to/from doctors offices while determining the necessity of an ordered treatment (chemotherapy, MRI's, etc). Basically preauthorization screening. The people on the other end of the call are not health care professionals (and the majority of the people reviewing the cases ARE), so you have to speak in lay terms in order to obtain pertinent information.  Most of the callers will tell you they have ""been on the phone all day"", so by the time you get the call, they're less than happy so you spend your time trying to de-escalate their attitude.  You're also supposed to spend no more than 10 minutes on a call and there is a LOT of copying, pasting and editing of information from a pre-printed template that you MUST use during calls!  In the beginning, you could probably type faster than trying to highlight, copy, paste and edit but that's SERIOUSLY frowned upon.  Calls are recorded and will be reviewed for personal audits. In addition to trying to decipher the information over the phone you're asking for, you are typing said information into the computer while simultaneously attempting to follow the ""guidelines"" set forth.  There are also TWO computer screens at your desk with NUMEROUS windows of job related information that you have to leave open in order to proceed with calls. With respect to these ""guidelines"",  it is a plethora of"
bad,"They would NOT  give me time off to reach out for help for domestic abuse. I asked for time off, and was denied it. Looking into a lawsuit against them. It is AGAINST THE LAW to denied the time off for that reason."
bad,"This was not a good company to work for.  Customers were rude, demanding and allowed to speak to reps in anyway.  Management was not supportive."
bad,Very stressful place to work but great benefits if you can get in
bad,"Stressfull, no job secuity; company using mostly temps and shipping jobs off shore, system failures, constantly mointored and pushed for more and more results."
bad,There is no home-work balance at Anthem. Anthem does not care about its employees or their well being. If they are requiring mandatory OT everyday and no usage of PTO for 2 months then regardless of what you have going on whether it be a surgery that you’ve had scheduled for the last 3 months or an emergency surgery that you need to have done immediately it does not matter you will receive an occurrence for it. If your child gets sick and you need to take them to the doctor the next day then tuff for you and your child because you will receive an occurrence for that as well. Holidays with your family? Forget about it! You get thanksgiving day and Christmas Day only and some departments require you to work on New Year’s Day and they’re open on thanksgiving if you decide to work because you don’t have the opportunity to go be with family because 1 day isn’t long enough to travel out of state.....Last but not least don’t expect any type of appreciation for being a valued employee you won’t even get a card for Christmas let lone any type of bonus or gift card or not even a company paid Christmas dinner. We had a
bad,"The work schedule flucuates all the time. No time for work/life balance. Not a good job for parents because work schedule is so unreliable and Anthem will not accomodate for childcare or doctors appointments. Will be pointed for any days off if have no PTO or minimal PTzi, which employees do not have access too for at least 3 months."
bad,"Poor management extremely low pay for what you do all day "
bad,"Managers terminate their loyal team members who come to work, do OT and assist callers. A revolving door. It's a good start if you want to work in a call center but not somewhere you can grow even though they SAY it's a place you can grow at."
bad,"Anthem got people to apply under false pretenses. I was told during my interview that if hired I’d get a $1,000 sign on bonus after 6 months of service and then again after a year, come to find out the people hired in the group before me only got that incentive. We get paid biweekly, which isn’t a big deal until they take out $200 a check for employee heath coverage + 1 child (I pay $400 a month for health insurance and $600 the months we get 3 paychecks). Working for a major healthcare insurance company, I shouldn’t be paying astronomical prices for healthcare! Also they hire people at whatever salary they want and experience does not have that much effect on your pay. They expect you to do so much extra but not pay us what’s fair. They have a high turnover rate and have many seats to fill, people leave because the culture there is horrible and they pretty much allow bullying and unprofessionalism and it reflects poorly on the management team (who are just there for a good time). My advice is to avoid Anthem-Nashville, this company is a joke!"
bad,The company focuses on getting sales and not servicing clients with issues. The sales manager wants everyone to like her and she doesn't solve issues.
bad,Case loads are extremely high and lack of support from executive leadership. Constant turnover and pay is okay. Benefits are great and work from home is allowed a few days per week
bad,"Very stressful,poor upper MGMT & no room for advancement. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work there.When I first started there it was not bad at all but when the company switched CEOs,it totally changed the culture of the company. totally changed"
bad,They do not care about the employees when it comes to your kids and health.  No sick days and if you call out you risk getting fired.  They are on a point system.  You have 9 points in a year.  One point is a sick day.  Tardiness is a half of a point. A point takes a full year to fall off.
bad,Very confusing place to work. After my director left I reported to many different people. Really inconsistent. Was laid off with many other people with no warning at all.
bad,"I’ve had some pretty bad jobs in the past but Anthem is by far the worst. Their attendance policy is so backwards. There was a girl from my training class that was gone for months at a time and still has a job with no consequences not to mention was given a work from home position while I, have to fight for my job because I’ve been sick more times in the past 6 months I’ve worked here than I have in the past 4 years. Also we’ve had mandatory overtime for the past 5 months straight with back to back phone calls all day every day. It’s mentally exhausting working here. I wouldn’t recommend this job to my worst enemy."
bad,"At 1st it sounded like the job of my dreams, then I started to working on the phones and I realized how absolutely terribly ran this company truly is. Besides the absolutely atrocious communication processes, systems almost never work correctly and on top of that you pay extremely high premiums for any benefits(I don't even have the best plan and I still pay over 220 for only 2 people on the policy per month. Deductable is 3000). Most rules are at ""manager discretion"" which pretty much means if your manager doesn't like you the outcome will not be good. The rules here are so strict I can't even go to the bathroom without being penalize on your bonus for not going during you scheduled break. I will be reporting them to the labor board as I don't think they can penalize you for needing to relieve yourself. I am a great employee that shows up on time, does a great job every day and is treated like trash. Stay away if at all possible."
bad,"I watched valued, seasoned employees get laid off like it was just another day. I'm talking about people that had been with Anthem before they were ""Anthem"" (15+ years). They proudly laid of head of households and family providers in the name of 'company re-organization smh. I guess offering a severance made them feel half-human, so it was palatable."
bad,"If this company actually believed their core values, then they would have taken notice just how unqualified the management is."
bad,This is a typical call center. High turnover. They don't care about their employees only about the people calling in.. Its okay if you can deal with EVERY thing being your fault. You could advance however that is all up to your manager. You get in the call center you will be there a while.
bad,I dont have much to say and this thing is forcing me to. Lunch is only 30 mins. Minding your business gets you labeled like you're better than everyone. Management sucks.
bad,"As a customer service rep.  I fee that the training that is offered is not good.  For all the changes that take place within the company.   New procedures and policys were changed on a daily basis with little or no training.  There were at least 25-30 different programs that were used to give answers to diverse questions.  When asking for more explaination of the concern it was as if the management did not have time to help you understand how to answer the questions.   My ""mentor"" was very curt and acted as if she did not want to help me solve problems.  This is a horrible place to work.  The stress is unsurmountable and the attitude of the management is horrible."
bad,If you get hired as an FTE and you’re under 35 you’re fine. If you’re over 40 and hired as an IT contractor...you’re basically “scum”. FTE’s will go out of their way to make you miserable. They’ll exclude you from project meetings (even if you’re primary on the project) and say you’re not welcome because it’s a business meeting and contractors are allowed. Anthem is pretty much a waste of time. If someone calls me about going back now I just laugh. Toxic environment...don’t waste your time.
bad,"Do you want to get bullied by other employees? "
bad,"Constantly rated top 10% retention specialists. Tried to make the job fun/enjoyable with joking when appropriate. Management takes themselves too seriously and frowned on any attempt to make the job better. But they would come around with things for a 5 year old from Oriental Trading Co. (read cheap and insulting) as their sign of ""appreciation"". Stress level hit the roof(not to mention greatly violated professional ethics which clients picked up on)when they cancelled PPO coverage in Colorado and made clients fill out new application for HMO coverage(Anthem Blue Cross could have switched clients automatically but claimed they did not have client's info to do so, the subcontractor did. Biggest lie in the world, they were just trying to force people off of the coverage entirely). They gave ""review"" training for working with insurance brokers in Sept. (never had this kind of training before-even trainer surprised only given 3 days training and not two weeks as normal), did not have us use it until following Jan. by then forgot what training was, struggled to assist brokers. Had worked two open enrollments as a temp/contract rep, applied for regular job doing same exact thing, given very short telephone interview, so in essence they are saying to save money ok to work temp but not on regular basis. Regular employees go around with arrogance. They do not care about clients or employees."
bad,"I like the people I work with,  the benefits are good, however the pay is very very poor.  United Health Systems is also in Roanoke and pays at least $3 more an hour.  Other call centers in Roanoke pay higher as well.  In my department, when I started my training, there was 28.  There were 4 training classes after me, a year later, there are 29 in my department.  We were told that we could post out to other positions within the company after a year, however, there is a freeze on any of us getting out of our area, because we are needed so badly.  People off of the street are getting the higher paying positions, while we are stuck at $13 an hour.  No pay raises either.  People are so frustrated in the workload, low pay, lack of being able to get the higher paying jobs...they just leave the company."
bad,"To be honest, I would avoid the customer care rep 1 or 2 and the pharmacy technician positions. You're forced to take phone calls for 8 full hours. The training sucks as it only teaches you how to use one system, but doesn't teach you the aspects of the job. You have to learn the job through audits, which the audits dictate what you can and can't do. Favoritism is a real thing in this department. If management doesn't like you, don't expect to be able to do anything different. The morale on the floor is bad. Most of the veteran employees are leaving. New employees are leaving within a week or two of getting on the floor. The company doesn't seem to like to hire from within. The managers were hired from outside and gave no idea what they're doing. No matter how busy it is, managers will never do anything to assist. They'll definitely make sure you know when you're not in available to take calls or if something isn't dress code, but they can't even answer questions about the job. I would avoid this place of I were you. It's not worth the low pay. It's a dreadful experience that will have you wondering why you are where you are in life."
bad,"This is a Company that can be driven by destroying positions and eliminating jobs at anytime. There is a culture to discriminate against older workers."
bad,The hardest part of about the work is the director. He has a lot of favoritism He treats people with no respect he makes you feel like your not worth anything.
bad,"Demanding and poor micro managers, orientation is the worst, one may have pto and medical benefits but can't take time off even in emergency situations they call it unexcused. Unrealistic productivity levels, a do more and more and more culture, and then you won't have done enough, be prepared to do a tally of how every second of your day is spent, it could be a great job but with the managers in place forget about that even though they are ""glad you are here"". Your hours will be changed with a days notice, they will not leave you alone during the day to get your job done without telling you to do more.   Be prepared to document everything...you will need it later. "
bad,Working with the company I found out just how corrupt the industry is.management is VERY unprofessional and It depends on who you know to excel at all
bad,"The Associate Relations Resolution Team is poorly managed and understaffed and underpaid. The team is staffed with ten associates to support over 50,0000 employees."
bad,Worst place ever. They treat you like you're worthless and they are better than you.  They pick favorites and don't do anything to them when they cause drama.  Nasty work environment.
bad,"This is a horrible place to work. The management tries at every opportunity to put you down - they may say it with a smile but their meaning is far from nice. They make you work long hours with little compensation. That's for the 'normal' people that work there. If you have any type of medical issue they will take all precautions to make it appear they are accommodating but they always leave these people out somehow. For example, someone who has celiac disease could eat nothing from a management sponsored luncheon consisting of Caesar salad, spaghetti (non GF), and garlic rolls. I understand that they cannot make accommodations for everyone but you gotta make them at least feel wanted if you want to retain people. I do not recommend anyone works for this employer."
bad,Duplicitous management - fear based culture - stressful for even the most seasoned professional - people hoping to be fired. I was asked to return and refused because I like being treated like a professional adult.
bad,"Many days you handle several calls in which the providers are very upset upon greeting of call, and we are responsible to assist the caller with care."
bad,"A nightmare you could not wake up from. You are penalized for doing your job to the best of your ability but they want more than that. They have a thousand rules and if you miss one you get put on a warning. They are breathing down your neck waiting for you to miss one tiny little thing so that they can write you up. It doesn't matter if you have worked there for 30 years under better management and much better circumstances they are ready to cut your throat. The pay was great but it was not worth losing your sanity. I would rather be wearing rags and live on the streets than to work for those slave driving, heartless, power hungry, hateful people again."
bad,"The more you do, the more they expect.  Production expectations are frequently changing and have become impossible.  Anthem is always outsourcing jobs causing massive layoffs and merging with other companies creating many issues.  Management has its favorites."
bad,"I was fortunate to have the manager I had. However, she wasn't there everyday. Most of the managers yelled at the agents. The agents were very stressed. The day depended on the mood of the managers. Plus, when I sold insurance for Anthem, they were asking the agents to lie to members. We wouldn't lie due to the fact that it's illegal for an insurance agent to lie to a member."
bad,"10-12+ hours a day is expected.  The culture is all about who has worked the most hours, has suffered the most and it is very cut-throat because they have lay-offs continuously.  "
bad,"its all about politics can move up there because they rather hire from outside sources them from within.... all in all not a nice place to work unless you like micromanaging, politics, hostile, work environments"
bad,The morale of the work place was very low. Manager showed a lot of favoritism. the merge of the company has not been helpful. the people have left the company because of how the morale has changed. The employees are not happy. The pay is not good.
bad,"Anthem is a big company with big opportunities but you have to get a good start and have great management that will help you advance within the company . If you happen to be hired in a department where the management does not have best interest of its employees or support and celebrate its employees you will become burnt out and feel unappreaciated, overworked, and underpaid."
bad,"The department I worked in treated employees as numbers and micromanaged their daily activities to the point of detriment.  Instead of rewarding employees for good performance, they used them to help stem problems in other departments with a fraction of the training regularly given.  These departmental moves weren't associated with additional compensation or benefits, just increased responsibility."
bad,Would NOT recommend this company to anyone! Hire new people as managers that do not treat employees with dignity and respect!   I have told you the most important part of this job! I have told you the major down falls of this company. What more do you want?
bad,"This is the worst company I have worked for in my entire 20yrs of working, pay was great..but found out it wasn't worth it...unprofessional management and mid management..high turnover..no direction..program was all over the place from day to day, no consistency...management instead of seeking ideas to make the company better, they spent time scheming to make employees life miserable..favoritism..it was just a sad and unhealthy atmosphere to work.."
bad,"Horrible, horrible, corporate company that only cares about money.  Nurses are NOT VALUED here at all.  You are a busy bee, not doing anything a nurse should be doing.  You read off a screen, are told what to do and WHEN.  They keep cutting benefits, PTO, etc.  Management is so secretive, MIA, unorganized, not knowledgeable, and usually not even clinical.  It is a complete joke at this company.  You will regret it."
bad,Anthem didn't give what they advertised.  It was very disappointing.In the position I worked in we were under paid had to do the most work and could promote unless you were unethical with the management.
bad,"New program showed much potential.  Poor upper management.  No work life balance.  Th program was poorly designed and implemented.  It was set up to fail.  Good salaries lure you in..,but beware."
bad,"I have learned how to deal and manage disgruntled people. Some may view working from home a pro and some may see it as a con, just depends on the individual."
bad,"This by far is the worst job I have ever had."
bad,"No work balance if hourly. Do you like a high school environment? Can you say cliques?  The women were the worst. Ran in clique packs.  The men managers were better, but would not stand against the women. Micromanaged to death. Could not send out a simple email message without ""the women"" reviewing, changing it a thousand times.  No creativity. Stifling environment. Horrible place to work."
bad,"This work group treated contractors extremely poorly. They seemed to be lacking project planning capabilities, so chose a totally ineffective way to plan the project.  Contractors with years of experience were treated as if they knew nothing nor were they allowed to have an opinion.  They readily fired contractors and didn't even have the courtesy to tell them.  A contractor might find out when s/he tried to submit his/her time and were unable to; because the work order had been terminated.  I found the situation to be quite ridiculous.  Poor management for this group (Missouri) is a poor reflection on the company."
bad,"I would not recommend working at this company as it was drastically changed when Blue Cross was bought by Anthem. Premiums drastically increased to customers, workload drastically increased to each worker so that the managers at the top could make more profit. People who had been at the company for many years were suddenly no good at their jobs and ""just couldn't do anything right"" after being given 2 people's jobs (with high reviews and excellent attendance). There is no moral fiber in management in many departments, particularly Sales. Very interesting to see a company go from non-profit with strong customer focus both internally and externally to just another corporation driven by greed, and Wall Street appearances."
bad,"I left a hospital that I had been at for over twenty years to work here. They made many promises like flexible schedules to work at home. Not only was that not true, I found management very controlling. Why hire a nurse with many years of experience if all they are going to do is follow a script and have all their calls monitored. I stayed less than a year."
bad,I have worked for this company for almost six years. I have excellent customer service skills.
bad,Worst working experience with a large company ever. I'll never consider employment with them again. They are better known as Anthem Blue Cross of California. They don't care about their members even more so then their employees.
bad,typical day at work start from 8.30 am till 5.00pm with 30 min lunch break and lot of work that you don’t have time to go to bathroom.
bad,Many employees are finding themselves being lead by a key executive leader (not CEO) who makes critical decisions but lacks accountability on her end for poor execution year over year.  This key leader plays the corporate politics well to hang around yet negatively impacts so many talented individuals that are once again very successful at other large companies.
bad,The only good thing was working from home. Benefits were expensive and not good considering you work for an insurance company. Management is horrible all the was from manager to VP.
bad,"This department is ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!!! DO NOT TRY TO GET INTO ANTHEM THROUGH THE PHARMACY CALL CENTER!!!!! Apply to other departments FIRST! I swear I wish I could’ve started in a different department, then I would’ve still been with Anthem. This department is a JOKE and I am surprised they’re not being investigated. Certain employees can do whatever they want, especially the ones that hang out with managers. Everyone is not treat fairly. Management SUCKS and of course there is favoritism.  Management does not help you, they expect for you to be on the phones all day and still be sane. They don’t train you properly on how to do your job. You are penalized for messing up even due to them not training you correctly. They MICROMANAGE you, especially if your manager or another manager does not like you. There is no job security, in our department I’ve seen 5 people get fired in a week and 3 people that had quit. This department has gotten WORSE over the past year. The new managers have made it worse, they want to walk around and look cute versus learning the job and help out. People are stressed out and feel hopeless but need the paycheck."
bad,"all phone calls are monitored.  If mgr or team leads do not like you they are so cruel, cyberspace bullies, trying to make you quite.  Worst employment experience I have ever had.."
bad,Empire BCBS used to be a great place to work. But once we were taken over by Anthem it all went downhill.   The company only cares about the bottom line.  Senior leadership doesn't take the time to do the right thing.  We have lost the human aspect as the organization grew larger and larger.
bad,Manager was inexperienced in the area she managed. She practiced favoritism and was nasty to other workers. She was a bully and there was no one that supported those of us that were not one of the favorites.The environment was toxic and stressful. Workload was not manageable and members did not receive the attention they needed.
bad,Its definitely not what I expected but corporate america as usual. Was hoping to finally find a stable job with growth opportunities but this one isn't it...
bad,"Unfortunately, there is not a lot of great things to say about this company. I thought it was going to be awesome being it's a fortune 200 company, but it was terrible. Management was poor and constantly messed up. They would give us incorrect information, then we would pay the price for doing something incorrectly, or not getting the bonuses we were promised. Things were constantly changing, which would be a great thing if it were for the better, but it seemed to always get worse. There was blatant favoritism, discrimination, and racism and when this was brought to HRs attention or management attention, nothing got resolved. Actual company policies were thrown out the window depending on which managers you had and rules, regulations and policies varied from one manager to the next. I like a diverse workplace, but everyone here is so stressed and is constantly talking about quitting. In the year I was here, I've seen an enormous turnover amount. Unfortunately, Anthem didn't quite make a good fit for me and I was very disappointed in everything that happened on a daily basis."
bad,"I have heard from many people that Anthem is a great company to work for but the pharmacy department is horrible.  This department entices you to stay because the pay is higher than usual for customer service reps, etc. but I hated everything about it. The management is horrible and show favoritism (and i am almost certain racism). My shift hours was horrible, even though I am a great and productive worker. I never got recognized or appreciated for my work. The workplace culture in our department is horrible and there is so much gossip. I honestly cried every single day I had to go to work for this company and I am not exaggerating. Don't work here."
bad,"Little or no feedback given on performance for over a month. Disciplined several times due to bathroom breaks related to my disability. Oh, the icing on the cake? FIRED after less than a month due to gossip on the elevator because I was having an insulin reaction. Stay away from Anthem!"
bad,"This was the 1st company I ever work at that was unprofessional when it came to dress code and i it’s mainly women.. I can could probably count on 1 hand how many women I saw at this company  that really look nice and dress well, the rest horrible they have a cell phone issue that they address however they don’t address the dress code policy they don’t  when A person dress a certain way that let you know they are ready for the working world and it says a lot about that person I seen women walk around with hat on their heads and not for religious reasons just because I seen pink as well as purple hair I see hair not comb these thing are all a part of a personal hygiene but again it’s never address I also blame the management which is funny to me because management it is well dress but not your associates it’s called leading by example and how they look is how you company look!!!"
bad,Upon arriving at anthem they talked alot about flexibility and work life balance. During five weeks of training we were repeatedly told that we were hired for dayshift. Many mom's in my group depended on that. You were expected to learn a crazy amount of information.After training I was given the ten to eight shift with my commute I wouldn't see my children five out of seven days a week. When I asked to trade or some sort of compromise I was beligerantly yelled at by a manager in front of my entire training class. I stayed even after that just to see that those who worked hard for years who gained extensive knowledge were given management duties without the title or pay while managers were brought in with a degree and salary that had to be taught everything from the ground up. Poor management. Go there to watch your dreams die and be used up and spit out.
bad,"They did a pay raise for everyone and gave new hires a huge raise and nothing for us that have been there longer and know more, how is that fair?  I never been at a company where everyone gets a raise company wide, I'm use to you do your time you get paid for it.  There is no room for advancement unless you want to do management or be an auditor.  There is so much politics in regards to it's not about what you know it's about who you know.  Management is the worst they like to hire people that have no background in management or supervising.  I feel they just hire anybody here, probably why there is so much turnover. It became so ghetto had to leave!!"
bad,Anthem culture has changed. Management does not take into consideration opinions and suggestions of employees. Experience is no longer valued. Morale is low.
bad,"VERY micromanaged. Must account for EVERY MINUTE of you day. Poor, minimal training. Production driven, very robotic. Salaried employees must clock in/out."
bad,Stressful
bad,"My experience was a manager who yelled and coworkers who were hostile. The ""transformation"" was never ending. It was difficult to meet 95% documentation accuracy according to the auditors because the auditors were not consistent in how they read and interpreted notes."
bad,fired the entire sales team with no warning after posting the highest sales numbers in years....upper management has no soul they push push and push oh did i say they push
bad,"Anthem has always been said to be a great place to job. I do not... Yes! Do not recommend anyone work in customer service. Broker services, handling calls from group administrators and brokers. This is a extremely high stress position. The brokers are rude, mean, and they are cut throat. The management is the same way, broker services is much like a high school. You can't get much help from the OE's and manager. No matter what you do. The management will ask you ""why didnt you do tha or that"". Training last for 6 weeks to get on the floor and use two percent of what you have learned. If you decide to apply please keep in mind, it will be your worst nightmare!"
bad,Good for Freshers as u need to do lot of jugaad to get the work done. Anthem day is fun concept but limited to only one day in a year.
bad,"The Case Managers are working from a call center, not allowed to make any manual calls, and not allowed to truly case manage. Write ups and corrective action plans is how management is ""inspiring"" staff. Awful place to work."
bad,Not a good company to work for if you are a contract negotiator especially in Georgia.  You will be responsible for working unusually long hours in office or at home up to 2am or 3am.  Training is non-existent and therefore you are not set up to be a successful associate.  They will toss you away like trash.
bad,With over 30 years of nursing experience the hiring process was ridiculous. My credentials were checked all the way back to high school. I had never had so much as a parking ticket.
bad,"I hesitated to write this review because I was so disappointed by this position; I was extremely distressed everyday over this terrible job. NPs MAs and MDs are not valued and are faking their productivity and pt acuity to appease the middle managers of the Caremore division. The clinicians are expected to up code everything. Coding will inbox the clinicians if coding personnel diagnoses a patient based on your notes. ex pt can c/o tingling feet and clinician is tasked to add the claudication code or if diabetic add peripheral neuropathy a/w DM. Worst possible managment team who promotes only friends and other fakers. This company (Caremore division) is notorious for hiring new grad, or work permitted (visa) foreigners to lock in its clinicians for years of torture. The mgmt makes false promises and belittles, berates and micromanages--frankly outright harasses its employees. Everyone except those few who are ""in"" are miserable and terrified of losing their jobs. The MAs do a tremendous amt of work but are consider ""lazy"" by middle managers. If you are desperate for a job-- take this one but continue to look because you will quit. They have a high NP and MA turn over. The MDs stick around due to the high incentives bonuses: 40-60% of their annual salary biannually for ""early discharges"" and/or ""preventing admission"" even in the really sicker individuals. To be fair, their are quite a few very talented and caring managers who found themselves at Caremore and dont really agree with its mgmt style. In addition, the NPs are sisters/brothers (a few men) and are really close. They"
bad,"In all the 18 years that I worked for Anthem, it's not a great place to work."
bad,"This was like a sweat shop. You are literally trapped on the phone for 8 hours. Get 5 minutes personal time to use the bathroom. Thank God there are breaks and lunch. They monitor everything you do. Do not trust the supervisors or managers. Let customers curse you out. Biggest problem is you cannot provide good customer service. They expect only 7 minutes per call and this cannot always be done. If you have to follow up for a customer, it goes into your intake box and can sit for weeks. They have a HUGE turnover. Did like most of my co-workers if you have time to get to know them."
bad,"BCBS provides lots of promises for advancement and salary increases, but all that they provide is a stressful, low morale workplace where employees are treated to low pay, micromanagement, grueling overtime and a constant ball and chain attaching them to their computer screen. Bathroom breaks are monitored and there is no such thing as a balance of work/life.. u must choose between the two or you will lose your job. Definitely the worst place I've ever worked."
bad,when the stock tanked - it was more to save managers and not the real staff. stock was 98.00 went down to 36.00 - get rid of the staff not managers.
bad,Na.... Age and race discrimination is a factor ..... Mangement is very inexperienced ...... Asking co workers to train other co workers due to management lacks knowledge of the job or task at hand.
bad,The money you earn is amazing but it also come.with a price. You naturally have to patient and strong with the job it's self but adding that same needed patience to management and peers can take alot.
bad,"On a typical day I took abuse from those SOB's from that foreign country"
bad,"I had been in customer service and moved into the marketing/sales department and was not trained properly but expected to meet and exceed activities while fellow employees were not even doing minimal tasks. We self reported our activities, which leads to dishonesty with no checking for accountability. I was ignored when I expressed my concerns, even by higher leadership and passed off as bitter employee."
bad,"I have never seen such a large, established corporation work on a day-to-day knee jerk reaction mentality. Throw hiring large groups of people, pay thousands of dollars to train them, work them until the crisis is over and then fire them all. Over 5 years I went through 7 managers, saw vice presidents fired and millions of dollars thrown away on software platforms that ended up not being able to do the job."
bad,"Due to the inconsistency of the company the morale for an employee is very low. In order for you to be satisfied, you would probably need to work from home. Which won't happen immediately. There is a false perception of growth in the company as well."
bad,A change in management caused changes in job descriptions and expectations. Workloads more than doubled.The general morale of the staff dropped to an all time low. The manager of the case managers was completely without any empathy for the staff. She retaliated against people.  She had 2 favorites who walked on water.A number of staff left. I feel I am lucky I got myself out of that toxic environment
bad,Nepotism. Favoritism. Upper management skills sre poor. Evrryone out for themselvrs withput any loyalty to tje organoation. Prejudice against nonl. Hispanics. Don't promote from wothin. Needs to look at turnover and ask questions about it. Human resources is  joke.
bad,"I don’t think I’ve ever worked for a place as strange or as backwards as Anthem. Its a place that, I feel, grossly under appreciates it’s workers. You’re out on the floor with no adequate training, and it gets very old very quickly since you don’t know what you’re doing. Also, there’s no reason that someone that I was training should have been making nearly $2 more than what I was. I knew this was the case because some of the new hires told me they felt underpaid, and proceeded to tell me what they were making. I felt disrespected and like I could not trust Anthem as a company. It was one of two final straws for me. I hardly ever felt like I was valued there. The OTHER final straw for me was how I was treated by the claims manager there. She was one of the worst, if not the worst manager I’ve ever had. She was extremely alienating, cold and not understanding whatsoever. There were l several team leads, managers and operations experts that refused to work with her and I see why. "
bad,"The company does not care about it's employees. No matter how good your job performance is, all they care about are the numbers as a whole. If someone else in the department does poorly it counts against you and the rest of your team. The HR department is the most incompentent I have ever seen, especially for a company as large as Anthem. A mojority of employees are only there because they rope you in with the great health benefits, which are hard to find elsewhere. They also change your schedule every 3-6 months to a schedule that may or may not work for you. If it is a schedule that you can not do they do not care."
bad,"Don't work here! Your micromanaged. You have to account for every minute of every day. No sick time allowed. If you call out sick it's a occurrence, doesn't matter if you have a doctors note. The company only cares about numbers.  Lack of sufficient training, providers upset because you don't know how to effectively do your job. Work culture is very cut throat. Opportunities for advancement are very competitive."
bad,"Working there is so stressful, have team leads who don’t know that they’re doing or talking about half the time. There’s no physical manager for your position if you’re a national rep, manager is in another state and is always busy. 5 min phone calls turn into 15 min phone calls waiting to receive an answer. Train you at the minimal and toss you into the wolves with no real help. Such a drama filled environment team leads gossiping with reps, schedule changes are not a thing unless you’ve been there for some time or are favored. Pay was good"
bad,As long as you are under respectable management you’ll be fine otherwise you are subjected to a high school petty harassment full discriminatory  environment
bad,Company is greedy and going in the wrong direction for a not for profit.  Offshore workers are valued more than onshore workers.  Not looking out for employees
bad,"The managers at Anthem basically just do enough to get by but do not keep up with communication well with the agencies they deal with or employees hired in under contract with a to be determined end date. The work just ended and we received an email from a random manager that worked from home right before the new year that we weren't familiar with stating that we could go home our case load was depleated and if we weren't told to return the followinf Tuesday please don't return to work. I don't know about anyone else but it was very unprofessional, low down and completely wrong to let your employees go in that way. Some of us have kids, almost all of us have bills, we were in between holidays and it our manager was missing two weeks before we were let go. They decided to keep the brown noser who had a older lady complete his work load."
bad,"A typical day involves uncontrolled chaos and being managed by people who don't have the credentials or experience to be in their position. The culture is fake and the ""core values"" are just a pretty piece of paper with words on it - they are followed out of fear not because the leadership is inspiring. The shareholders are large and in charge - as soon as they are not getting the profits they want cut backs and hiring freezes happen... often. "
bad,"I worked for my last employer for 2+ YEARS before coming to Anthem. I regret it so dearly. "
bad,"This is a stressful, unorganized place. There is no opportunity for transferring departments. They have you on a year hold and when that's up you still cannot transfer. The pay does not suffice the duties. After realizing that no one is ever transferred I will seek new employment because its all about advancement and growth."
bad,"This job is for those RNs after graduating do not want to grow as a professional Practitioner. During interview you're sold on managing ""your own pts"" by ""matching care delivered with that desired by our pts"".  However, that's not the case on many levels. NPs do about 5% NP role (write prescriptions), the rest RN jobs/chores (wound care, VS, communication with family and caregivers, and charting, lots and lots of charting. The charting takes HOURS!!! And then, your charting doesn't actually states anything re: dx the pt, your plan, or the care you provided. However, every Nursing dx is looking perfect in the ""care plan"" for billing purposes. "
bad,I worked at Anthem for 2 yrs. The work environment is not professional at all. The moral is very low and management has poor leadership.
bad,"Was hire and did not have experience was told would be train never trained, very stressful job, unfairness practice, much pressure from management, Always the bad emphaise and the good over look. Because salaried can put in 10-11 hour days"
bad,"It's been over a year and to be honest I regret til this day going with this company and leaving my previous employer all because I thought this company actually cared about their employees for all the hard work you put in and would be a great opportunity to advance your career path. In less than one year we were previously wellpoint then switch over to anthem in the beginning of the year. They first train you in member and provider services answering general questions about the members plan and eligibility on benefits and copays then in a couple of months or less you'll be trained in claims. From what i was told from managers you would have a lot more career advancement once your claims trained. Unfortunately that's not the case its really all based on who you know if you want to move to another department even if your competitor has the lower performance than you they'll  get the position before you do cuz of a friend that works in the dept they applied, also being that it's such a small depth on the medicare feels like your in HS all over again because a few people no a lot of people have two many side conversations you can hear it from your desk about another coworker's business and telling it to the whole OE's, Managers and etc. Even the OE's are very unprofessional on how they communicate with the associates and talking about their associates to others in the dept. The Overtime is a joke, they'll offer OT during the enrollment period but if you sign up for 30 hours you'll only get approve for about 10 hours and do they thank you for it NO. The attendance is reasonable"
bad,"I was so excited to join the Anthem team when I first started.  The benefits are awesome, there was an onsite cafeteria and gym, and the pay was exceptional.  Unfortunately, the training was poor, management was inconsistent, and the company is lost in processes.  One hand doesn't know what the other is doing and the company has essentially outgrown itself.  There are lots of internal politics that counteract the company's vision and conflict with it's values.  Everything is outsourced so there is absolutely no consistency and an extreme lack of accountability!"
bad,"I was thrilled to have a telecommute job and worked hard to complete training and get on board. But, soon learned this was a culture of avoid management, do not ask questions, almost bordering on paranoia. Management had disinterest in interacting with our group of professionals and no understanding of our day-to-day concerns.. I became the target of the manager who bullied me, wrote me up with unrealistic objectives and did what she could to make sure I did not succeed, despite her pretending to help. I complained to no avail. I was fired even after improving my work. I and my coworkers knew this was a no win situation. It has been months, and I still cannot get over how I was mistreated. They had no interest in looking at the real problem, and put all the blame on me. I have decades of positive work experience, have ongoing anxiety and depression from this experience, and wonder what their contribution is to my inability to even find a job. Do not work here. I have never been treated so poorly, I worked extra hours to do a good job, but they still got rid of me in a very nasty way."
bad,"Salve to your desk, 15 min bathroom break for the whole day, no career advancement unless you become your bosses best friend, gossip in office, drama, disrespectful managers DM and PL gossip about the employees, bias call coach, performance is not weighted properly, no company sponsored parties, holiday time always closed, office is always dirty, carpets never cleaned, vents are filthy, manager DM micro manages the call center employees and seniors. Verbal abuse from callers is not handled by mangers just overlooked, on the phones all day, no prospect for career advancement. Recently company wide lay offs, underpaid, under appreciated recently demoted because management decided to lay off half of our department. If they begin to hire again don't work here !!!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,"This was the worst job I have ever had. They treat you like a machine. There is no opportunity to give any feedback; your immediate supervisors really have little say in what happens and the expectations come from someone above them, names and titles unknown. Constant change and it is communicated via an email from an unknown source. Very impersonal. Demanding that you focus on about five things at once. Unrealistic expectations. Extreme micromanagement from people who you never see and who obviously have no clue what your job really is like."
bad,"Have worked for Wellpoint for many years and upon relocating to Pomona, Ca I noticed the negativie atmosphere as well as heard nothing but negative comments from other employees regarding not only management but as well as work overall there on a daily."
bad,"The trainning process was not handled well. The benifit package was poor. I had a less costly plan working for other companies. Values and culture were high. Job securiuty, my position was out sourced after two years of working for them. Management I was put down if my work was not up to their standards, I worked as much as they would let me."
bad,"At least 80 percent of the work involved the ""process""  (Meetings, reporting, tracking, meetings, planning, meetings, etc.) than the actual coding and testing part.  My manager was not really interested in the project team at all, spending most of her time schmoozing with HER managers.  They have some very competent workers, but also a lot of ""deadwood""."
bad,Certain departments and managers are great to work for and with but there is very little growth or opportunities. For almost three years it was a great place to work then I changed positions under a different manager and things started not to go very well and there was no further to go in the company. I did grow as a person and loved helping others like our members or other team members but it made it hard sometimes to help them when there were road blocks in the way. I loved my coworkers and the members I helped on a daily basis.
bad,"Worked for Anthem in the early 2,000s in the Creative Department. Operations were being regionalized between Maine, NH and CT. It was awful. Three states posturing for control, unstable management, back stabbing, no clear direction...it was a relief when my job was moved to CT and I was laid off."
bad,Management has no clue about the subrogation process and the systems are grossly outdated. There is very little training and little to no support from management.
bad,"IT jobs are pretty decent and you can be paid well in the higher exempt single contributor positions and really well in Manager, Director and higher levels. Managers did seem disconnected from the 3 I had in 1 year and threat of layoff is constant in lieu of oversees positions being ramped up. Alot of times there was little direction on what to do and it takes to long to make decisions there."
bad,If you go to the bathroom and it’s not your break time a supervisor will be at your desk waiting when you get back.  You are expected to be a robot! A lot of drama not worth the pay!
bad,"The company itself seems as if it would be a good place to work for but being in the Behavioral Health Department it is very stressful my management team does nothing but play favoritism to others and others in my team always see it and if you have an issue and someone goes to HR about it they literally retaliate against you and no one does nothing about it because their all friends"" my manager picks and choose who to give overtime to based on if she likes you or not I wish I was on another team at least .I want to quit everyday to the point I'm depressed . At this time I have to find other employeement first"
bad,"Majority of the managers are horrible,  out of the ones I had to deal with there. There was only one good one and she transferred to a different department. There is no such thing as home and life balance, unless you are a managers favorite then when shift bids come out they get the early shifts and if your not a favorite you get the late shifts."
bad,"Former employee of this company and can honestly say it was such a mess and unorganized place to work for. Management had no idea what they were doing and would always refer us to the reference manual. Management was always in meetings to improve the things around the center, in my opinion they got worse with every meeting they had. There is no room for growth as if you’re not one of the favorites then you won’t be selected. This is a job to get if you’re going to school and only using this in the meantime, otherwise if you’re looking for a career, I would suggest to look elsewhere."
bad,"Poor management that plays favorites. The daily check-in for employees ""Anthem Vitals"" are not listened to. There are petty, childish people that work here. If you do well and do your job and bring up concerns you get the short end. If you f-around, don't do your job and are ignorant you get to get away with murder. So, if you have no brain, no desire for seeing improvement, or are stupid you should work here."
bad,"Responsible for providing advanced customer service support to brokers selling WellPoint products via telephone or written communication. Essential duties to include, but are not limited to: Assists agents and brokers via telephone or written communication."
bad,I choose not to give a negative or a positive response in relation to the office politics and/or mishaps during my time working for this company. Thank you
bad,"I did not like the call center experience"
bad,Department Management was worthless was lucky if I got an email response not sure what his responsibilities were in all the years worked together for simple task turn over rates high
bad,"Good people to work with but management is absolutely incompetent.  Morale is low at this company and while the salaries are higher than some others ... the hassles from management,  the constant back-stabbing and continuous threat of retaliation do not make this a company you want to work for.  Best advice ... apply elsewhere."
bad,"The Med Supp dept was the worst to work for.  the job task were fairly easy, however, most med supp members are 65 and older.  So there was a lot of doing things just to appease the members, that was not necessarily part of Anthem policies and procedures.  The main disturbance with that department was the lack of leadership quality and respect for the member.  I absolutely loathed, and still cannot understand to this day, how, someone...ie, the member, and myself, request to have a supervisor assist and/or take the call.  And I would be told no by team leads and supervisors, figure it out on your own.  So I would honestly tell the member that my supervisors are refusing to assist us at this time.  I mean, who does that?"
bad,"Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield is very unorganized, bad management. Orientation was a waste of time. The orientation does not reflect what you do when you get on the floor. The retention rate is horrible which causes heavy, unrealistic workloads.It is set up like a call center and expect you to call 20 or more patients within an 8hour period. I won't recommend this job. Run the opposite way"
bad,Not my favorite job. I learned a lot about insurance benefits. Hardest part of the job was having to remember every single detail every single phone call with absolutely no room for error.
bad,"I heard a horror story about this company while I was working there. A man shared his umbrella with a female coworker as they walked inside. She fired sexual harrassment charges against him and somehow won. Then it was my turn. Without going into details, a similar thing happened to me and I was fired."
bad,"Anthem has great pay and great benefits but it is very unprofessional. Anthem is all about favoritism, lacks communication through the entire company."
bad,"I would not recommend working for Anthem. They no longer care about their employees, everything is about their bottom dollar. They are sending most of the jobs overseas or outsourcing them so they do not have to pay employees much. Your performance is never good enough, you could perform great with excellent quality and quantity and be among the best and they will say you can do more. Then raise your standards so you have to work and work to try and achieve them, only for them to raise them again and again. At some point you will not be able to reach them and then you are penalized for it. Very stressful and unfair for the processors."
bad,"Typical day of work varied. Some days were high call volume some were not. The workplace culture is very diverse. Management varies from different departments my particular manager was very rude and didn't know anything about the daily job that we performed. The  hardest part of the job was poor training that lead to high errors and non effective follow up, The best part of the job was a possible option to work from home."
bad,"Poor management, favoritism, always about who you know, very stressful, awful systems, high turnover rate, too much expected from employees who have limited accurate information for members."
bad,"Management has no skill set to help their own team. My manager was horribly racist and was able to get away with firing myself and my sister, who didnt do anything wrong but try to help guide me since she already had experience in my position. Their motto states ""When in doubt, shout out""  meaning if you need help ask for it, well they really don't want you to especially if they don't like you.  I got in trouble for asking for help from ied fellow employees that I had become friends with who knew that my manager was doing wrong by what she was emailing me. My manager denied request days off that I had put in for and told me I didn't do the proper procedure to be able to get the days off after I already had confirmation the days off were approved. My manager relied on a lower staff member to do her reports and other paperwork that was her sole responsibility as a manager to complete. I would NEVER encourage employment with Anthem. They encourage ""bullying"" the employees they don't like."
bad,Very few opportunities to move up or around in this company. Salary is very lackluster and only receive minimal wages every year. Does not offer training for other positions in company
bad,"very stressful and no respect for the workers"
bad,"a stressful day at  work, I learn claims processing; not enough time off the phones to distress your mind from incoming class is the hardest part of the job."
bad,Sedentary job in which you are tied to the telephone.  The building is freezing cold and Anthem did not allow heaters.  Everyone is micromanaged.  My direct supervisor was nice.
bad,"I had a terrible supervisor. No supervision, support or leadership and feedback came inconsistently and in a very unprofessional manner. "
bad,"I was a fresh, new NP, who just graduated from the Grad school, when I started my first NP job here as the Touch NP at Cerritos. "
bad,I was given a few hours of training and then put straight on the phone.  Never had a feeling of stability. Never was trained to do the job I was hired for.
bad,"After almost 15 years with the company was Laid Off due to Outsourcing of department  Overseas only to find out it was brought back. But instead of bringing back ALL those that were laid off they hired new people!!!!"
bad,"I used to enjoy my job before we merged with WellPoint.  After the merger, it turned into an absolute nightmare.  WellPoint is one of the WORST companies for an IT person to work for.  I was there for nearly ten years, and after we merged, not only did I not get any new projects, I was having projects taken away from me.  I even went as far as to ask my manager, ""are you TRYING to ruin my career?""  I will NEVER recommend WellPoint as an employer to anyone."
bad,"Majority of the people who work there are great. That extends to upper management. But the lying, backstabbing, territorial p!ssing matches and 24-hour micromanagement are enough to drive you to jump off the roof."
bad,This job will drain you meantally. If you not considered  to be a fav from your manager. Just quit. Lol. No luck for you. They expect you to know everything and they don’t know a thing they’re self (manager). To many huddles and not enough training for calls. .
bad,the staff at anthem are friendly and will assist in any way possible. 
bad,It totally depended on your direct report.  Working everyday not knowing if you would have a job tomorrow was very stressful.
bad,"My typical day was working at home reviewing claims from providers from California, Colorado and Nevada. I analyzed whether the claim was processed correctly or not by reviewing pricing and our policy and procedures. If there was a discrepancy, I would adjust the claim or send a provider a letter advising if claim was processed correctly. My co-workers worked as a team by instant messaging we helped each other, if we had questions, kind of like a buddy system. The hardest part of the job was that I worked in California and my manager and co- workers were in Colorado or different states, so all of my communication was by email, phone, or instant message. The best part of the job was working at home, I was able to finish acquiring my degree and take care of my mom."
bad,Not a fit for me as I found it a company not about its people and more concerned about its competition and getting better sales.
bad,"Wellpoint is a great company and environment to work in. A typical work day includes flexibility in your work hours, and processing medical claims."
bad,"This company will tell you that they value their associates. However, my personal experience disputes that."
bad,The training you get feels like you are trying to cram a year's worth of information in the span of a month and a half. The company overall feels as though they care more about the time in which you can complete loads of calls. As opposed to providing adequate answers to member's questions and concerns.
bad,"The company was awesome to work for, I had a great boss, the environment was great. You had the opportunity to learn a lot, travel and advance in the company. A typical day at work would be answering inbound calls and also making outbound calls. You would interact daily with members concerning their insurance premiums, benefits and claims. My co-workers were phenomenal! The hardest part of the job was learning a new system and adapting to claims, and pharmacy. The most enjoyable part of the job was the QIP and AIP awards and the excellent benefits."
bad,"If you want to work for a company that doesn't care about their employees especially their sick ones this is the spot for you ! At first I liked my job it was a fun atmosphere . Then things get real and many people get laid off randomly all the time ! Management only cares about the dollars they're earning and about meeting numbers to earn them incentive dollars while we're doing all the work getting the pennies . Unfair, unprofessional business that treats employees like dirt . Sadly the pay is efficient so finding another job is difficult ( if you live in California you know how much housing is ) . "
bad,"Don't get the right training need to be your job well, hard part of job there our so many screen you have to go in. And so of the manager don't know how to do the job."
bad,"Typical day was answering calls and making calls on behalf of insurance. Made calls using script, area of interest was managed care"
bad,Anthem expects a lot for a Lil bit. I seen so many people come and go and be stressed out I think it is really a shame the way it is ran. A lot of the employees stay because they feel they have no other choice so they suffer till they get fired
bad,"Anthem cares about its employees overall; however I find that teams/regions are managed differently which can be a bit challenging when expectations from one team differ significantly from another re productivity measures, flexibility with time etc."
bad,"Depending on your individual Manager, the Management is horrible!  They do not promote continued education or personal growth within the company.  After almost 15 years with the company, I was Laid Off due to Outsourcing Overseas only to find out they brought the jobs back but hired all new people!!!!!  HATE ANTHEM!!!!!!   "
bad,"I swear this place is the inspiration for the movie horrible bosses. They do not reward hard work or initiative. They treat employees horribly and when a new manager comes on they can just ""clean"" out their entire department and create a new one."
bad,"Unfortunately, you can find your self working lay days and early morning to get your work complete. I have to admit I worked with a great IT team and we worked together to ensure work was completed"
bad,"Management is a joke! You MUST brown nose to advance. They tell you in training to ask for help but fail to mention that you will be humiliated in group chat. Only positive is you can work from home. "
bad,I can't believe that Anthem would allow this company to be in such a horrible area. The atmosphere is horrible. Every salaried worker that moved from California to Vegas are extremely miserable and will make your experience miserable.If you need employment take it make some money. But stay looking for another job because this place is unpredictable and the insurance is horrible.
bad,Don’t work here. Just don’t do it. Unless you like verbal abuse and hating your job daily. Getting nowhere in the company and staying at entry level for years. Just to get fired for nothing.
bad,"Overall bad company to work for! Underpaid, and overworked. No one knows anything even managers and OE’s. Claims are never processed correctly. Apply with caution"
bad,"your work station is not safe old broken chairs,key boards and computer or not up to date or new the computer leaked some type of red ink.I fell out of my broken chair and tore my rotator cuff.Management had her favorite and would not promote or help transfer to another department. Hardest part of the job was dealing with the manager. most enjoyable part helping customers."
bad,"The company took advantage of financial crisis in 2008 and hired senior level employees with many years of experience but paid junior level salary, but demand senior level services."
bad,hard working and should be very knowledgeable to sustain in the company . fast growing and will have lot of opportunities for the well performer always.
bad,"This is the worst company I have worked for in my entire 20yrs of working, pay was great..but found out it wasn't worth it...unprofessional management and mid management..high turnover..no direction..program was all over the place from day to day, no consistency...management instead of seeking ideas to make the company better, they spent time scheming to make employees life miserable..favoritism..it was just a sad and unhealthy atmosphere to work.."
bad,"Amazing company for Medicare and Medicaid members for benefits, and claims. The information members have and how they understand his/her benefits.  No hard part other than members understanding their plan. Making my customers/providers happy at the end of each call."
bad,Anthem is very demanding with very little opportunity for advancement. You take non stop back to back calls. Sometimes dealing with patients life or death insurance issues. Do not expect any appreciation for your work. Especially if you are not the current ethnicity.
bad,Anthem Worldwide is a disgusting place to work unless you are management. Fear based management and zero leadership. Worst experience of my life.
bad,"As a Sales Agent for Anthem BC/BS Health Insurance for Medicare recipients, I loved helping the senior’s understand the health plans available and helping them make and educated decision to the type of plan that fit their needs."
bad,"I work in a call center that takes on average almost 3,000 calls per day! we are always understaffed, systems don't work, information on system incorrect and not enough support when help is needed. Management is a joke, the pay and benefits are offensive, no sick days only P.t.o. which doesn't work well for a parent you choose to either be sick and stay home or go to work sick to ensure that you have enough time for a vacation. The objection is to not actually help the caller but to get them off the phone quickly enough for it not to count against the ASA. There may be some good managers at Hellpoint, but not enough."
bad,This was a horrible experience.  They didn't give enough training then put me in a really hard group.  They also gave me the hardest auditor.  We were not allowed to talk ..so how could you ask questions??
bad,"Typical day at work- clocking into my system as well as soft phone taking and making phone calls. Reviewing claims,benefits,eligibility and inquiries. I've learned how to how to show empathy toward the members as well as providers. I've also learned how to work in a fast pace environment. The management is okay but i'm looking for more out of management, for example knowledge. My co-workers are very helpful and knowledgeable. The hardest part of my job is know that sometimes i'm not able to help a member because of certain policies. The thing that i enjoy the most is assisting the members/providers and the people around me."
bad,"Anthem Insurance only operated in Decatur, IL, for a year or so until they moved the book of business to Shelby, OH, so over 300 people lost their jobs between 1994 and 1995 out of the Decatur headquarters."
bad,"Busy , I learned how to do alot with the computers alot of systems."
bad,While I was there as a temp the Xerox guys were there talking about manning levels. The place was overstaffed in the department I was in and I got laid off. I believe the permanent employees are next because there isn’t justification to keep them on.
bad,"Not a great manager to work for, nit picks, and harrasement. If you are not part of the ""click"" you wont last. Do not work there"
bad,"It was a very fast paced environment, the head honchos need to address needs of the employees, not the company. The PTO rules are asinine, Mangers are awesome, but the building is all in all understaffed, which makes for long busy days."
bad,Good work environment and associates work together to make it better. Managers give great feedback and constructive critisim in a good way and the feedback immediate
bad,Managers micromanage and dont have a clue on what their doing. It's basically a big high school. Analysts gossip and managers get sucked right into it
bad,This place is a sweatshop preaching work life balance.  The motto these days is do more with less and that means less people.  They will use you and promise promotions that you will never see and you will be asked to do everyone else job. The management has no clue what they are talking about and have reorgs every other month in the name of progress.  I would not recommend this company to anyone as it is a very unpleasant place to work.
bad,"Though I was a temp to hire, there was no way I was staying there. They treat there employees awful. They want you to be a team player but won't give you assistance when you need it. They are hard to work for because you will have 5 different people being your boss and telling you 5 different things."
bad,management did not have a clue how to use data to make decisions.  they liked to get hundreds of pages of powerpoint slides to review each week instead of analysis and never make a decision on anything
bad,As the title says they outsource almost everything. They have over seas people walking in and out of the building every 4 months.
bad,It was a customer service job in the health field. I enjoyed working with the providers and members in assisting them with their medical needs.
bad,"From the beginning, I was disappointed with the lack of support and training. There is no flow to your day or for that matter, any day. Constant conference calls, meetings and emergencies always arise. If you make a mistake, it’s a capital crime. Turn over on the sales side is huge. The best thing there are the benefits sad to say."
bad,A fairly comprehensive training is provided at the beginning. Success is highly dependent on which manager you are assigned to. There can be favoritism shown. How your particular manager is chosen is not clear.
bad,"It is a corporate ran place. Very strict rules that are enforced to everyone except management. And I personally was a manager at a formal job and was hoping to become one for Anthem. Because I was proud to work there and I wanted to help make improvements. However, I decided to just leave altogether. The complete disorganization and lack of follow through became too much. I will say I had a direct Lead that was wonderful. And I have no doubts he will be running things soon. But if you are planning to work here be prepared for a bit of chaos."
bad,"Company goes through Plan Presidents every 2 years.  No clear direction which keeps everyone anxious and afraid for their jobs."
bad,"In-fighting and power struggles between teams."
bad,"The company had a horrible training plan, and then when we gave incorrect info to customers they fired us, instead of explaining to us what we did wrong so we could correct it."
bad,"I will say two words about "
bad,Management did not care abo it anything other than the SLA. My pay for my job role was not in line with the industry. And it was not just mer it was pretty much everyone there at the service desk. There is a very high turn over rate and not many people replacing them. I left on 2 week notice moving onto a contract that fell through after signing the paperwork.
bad,Anthem will take your pay at any given time without letting you know when updates are posted about benefits. When you the pay anthem keep checking your call so you will not get your pay back in which takes 6 months to get back pay
bad,Working with co-workers is very enjoyable.Co-Workers are willing to help you and answer any questions you may have. You learn more from co-workers then you do from management. A typical day can be stressful and other days can be slow. If you know how to be productive then things will run smoothly
bad,"The employees are great, but management stinks. They are lacking in training, little or no college education, and the inability to lead."
bad,company is all about numbers not quality to member. the company wants you to do the work of 6 people and answer calls also. The hardest part of the job was sometimes not being able to follow thru for the members. What I like about customer service is talking to all kinds of people.
bad,I recommend asking all that you need to know before making the choice to work here. Example know if you’re exempt employee because they will work you in excess. Understand that management can’t be trusted with all the lies and withholding information. The pay is okay but not enough to endure the drama and lack of work life balance. This is a place where you will be questioned endlessly but don’t you dare question back or it’s considered some form of combativeness. Overall I wouldn’t recommend working here unless you have better management.
bad,"Management (especially CMOS - Care Management) is only interested in stroking their egos. They are former Amerigroup and “protect their own click”. So if you are not part of that click, watch out! They do not know how to manage people. They DO know how to recklessly spend $$ on a care management system referred to as ACMP which is riddled with literally hundreds of production defects."
bad,"Worked there for a month, during my time there I was NOT included in training discussions, or anything really. Moving up is hard, you’re not allowed to make mistakes or basically have an outside life. My trainer abandoned me, work atmosphere was judgmental. Good pay & benefits though"
bad,Don't work for Justin Knight. Always looking to fire someone. They really don't care employee's. I really don't have anything else to say. Anthem thinks all are expendable
bad,This company is great at looking for what you do wrong and letting you know but nothing good you do.   Members can be nasty and there is nothing we can do but take it   Feel like I’m always doing something wrong. They say take time if needed but then yelled at when you do   Every min if your day is monitored down to bathroom breaks     I will not do this long term
bad,"You are evaluated based on percentage of the work you complete.  One nurse can have 10 reviews a day and be 100% and finished by 10 am.  Another could have 60 cases, finish 50 of them and be put on corrective action for performing below expectations.  Favoritism towards certain cultures is blatant with promotions and expectations.  Salaried employees are expected to work until work is done  while hourly non clinical staff is allowed to refuse work if it gets too close to end of 8 hour day."
bad,The culture is one of being imbedded in it. If you have been there long enough and developed friends in other departments you can seek other jobs but in the Call Center it is hard to get in and even harder to get out. Management doesn't help you unless you are off of the phones already in a support role. NO real opportunity for advancement.
bad,I was with this company for almost 3 years and the pay was low it took us 2 years to get a raise but even the raise we got still wasn’t enough for the cost of living. Instead of them working on it they offered pizza & massage chairs. We have lost great reps because the manager won’t do school accommodation but the company offers tuition reimbursement programs. The Nashville office is all over the place reps are acting like OE’s they play like managers even the managers play favorites.
bad,In mere months I have seen whole training classes terminated. Tenure reps be fired and even others unfairly subjected to disciplinary action due to unfair policies. No consideration for technical problems in metric structure etc
bad,"Temps get treated horribly towards the end of the contract, unless you apply for a full-time position. Even management treats temps bad, not enough to report to HR, but it does make going to work dreadful."
bad,I started out with a very secure feeling about my position and as time passed I have seen many disadvantages working for HealthLink and my manager was very demanding and the team I worked with were not sociable or would even communicate. I am and have been very stressed about this job.
bad,"Be aware of Costa Mesa office, management has their favorites. Usually the daugh/son of a predecessor and those are the people that get the promotions"
bad,"You have way too much work to do for little pay. Calling/emailing members back, calling different host plans, calling doctors, keeping up with inventory deadlines, staying out of ACW. Not to mention the work culture is similar to high school."
bad,"When I was interviewed they really did the hard sell. The job is only about the numbers. The managers and director really become upset if anyone doesn’t make there numbers . If it going to affect there yearly bonus, you get a stern warning."
bad,good company to start off with when you are in between jobs but there are people employed at this company from all walk of life and it can be a little getto at times.
bad,"Poor on-boarding, poor management structure, little to no support of contractors through proper chains of command.  Long hours and a underlying fear of contractor to communicate to management transparently."
bad,Typical call center. Bad management. New Vice President only sees statistics and not a human being. Be prepared to have shift bids and constant monitoring. Different rules depending on call center team. The most enjoyable part of the job was simply surviving the day and going home to be with my family.
bad,This company first appears to be a nice place to work with great benefits but in reality this company is managed by a team of people who show favoritism with low pay honestly this place does not provide enough pay for the work they have you do and it is quite stressful. the overturn rate is extremely high your better off being hired as a temp verses a full time employee. and PLEASE be mindful of who you speak to there because they may get you fired. upside is the benefits are decent everything else is poorly done and managed  you are better off going somewhere else to get a job like this that actually pays you more. FYI if your going for call center they pay 14.00 it may seem nice but in reality its not worth the stress they put you through.
bad,"I was a temp at Anthem and it was such a mess of a department in Agent Support. The overtime was insane like 60+ hours every week so you practically live there. Management is so unfriendly to temps they would reward only fulltime employees. The regional director was especially rude towards everyone.They would not provide you with updates until the last minute. Anthem does not care about quality customer service, they care about quantity on how many calls you get done."
bad,Anthem Medicaid has alot of Providers leaving the network.  There are delays in members receiving needed care.  The Provider Network in Texas is not being updated.
bad,"Legacy WellPoint was a great company to work for."
bad,"I do not recommend this company to anyone. Promises broken time and time again to employees. Confusing literature, lack of recognition, clique environment, and lack of empathy for family or personal matters. Truth bares in comparison to advertisement. Taking care of the people who work for them, and ensuring their success is not Anthem's top priority. Work and home balance is basically non existent within this company, and advancement for opportunity is hard pressed. As well, so called benefits are a farce, with horrible coverage at a great expense no less than obtaining a policy on the Marketplace. Anthem boasts that they take care of their customers and their employees, but that is not something that was witnessed during the time there, in actuality the opposite happened. Anthem as was experienced, does not take care of their people. Even with medical reasoning, there is no understanding, empathy, or exception given that is genuine in nature. The micro management is insane at this facility as well. It even goes beyond your run of the mill micro management. It was definitely a learning experience for me, but in a very negative manner. I excel at customer service and customer reviews show that proof. However, it is made very clear that what the reps do is never really enough or even satisfactory. The company boasts of a belief in taking care of their employees and members as if they are family, and that is in the very least short sided. I witnessed many untruths in the time I was there."
bad,"Nothing is ever set in stone, There always changing your schedule, so its almost impossible to schedule appointments.Each manager has there own ways of doing things, and they pick and choose what rules they follow. You have to know or make friends with management to advance."
bad,I love my coworkers and manager. However I do not like the break and bathroom policy. The on site gym and many perks of the company is a great plus.
bad,"Management does not know anything about insurance, nor do they care enough to learn your name. They tell you they ""care"" about the members and not about stats, when in reality all they care about is your handle time and how long you are at your desk. I was told to cut my bathroom breaks down to twice a day. You will be told you have the opportunity for advancement, but if you go to the bathroom more than twice a day then you won't get a referral for advancement."
bad,"A lot of nurses are leaving for various reasons, but mainly due to change in management practices, & lack of communication. My manager was terminated without warning, and the nurses who have been there the longest are being harassed, or written up or both."
bad,"Great company prior to switching to Anthem. Everything seems as if your walking on eggshells everyday. Management will not listen to you as an employee, they don't care about their employees."
bad,I was employed at anthem only a short time but i felt like overall it was not a place for me to really and truly grow when i wasn't properly trained then thrown to the wolves and forced to meet unreal expectations
bad,If the management would actually look @ the job on the Customer Service point of view they would see how difficult the responsiblity is with the horrible pay
bad,"i was hired as a Nurse Care Manager. All training was virtual which would have been OK had the training had real world application. We were trained on their documentation system that was supposed to be the ONLY one in use after our training period. Come to find out that there were 4-5 other systems that were in use that we had no training on or access to."
bad,"A typical day at work for this company is simple and laid back. Normally everyone is just working with headphones on just trying to stay productive. The hardest part of the job is trying to stay busy when there is no work. The best part of working here is the employees, they are really funny and outgoing.This was the first opportunity I have ever had to work remotely from home. Initially, I was apprehensive because I am accustomed to working in a large office. However, working from home allowed me to be more productive and have a better work-life balance"
bad,"Log into many databases to prepare for 50-60 phoncalls coming in from providers. Mostly claims resolutions."
bad,"A typical day consisted of processing claims, adjudicating claims, going to meetings, verifying information accuracy before distributing to the team. I had a group of temporary employees I was overseeing and training. Assisted the manager with special projects, and engaged in conference calls. Management was unprofessional and much favoritism occurred, and management was never consistent. We ( I ) was promised promotions, pay raises, and bonuses and it never happened. When I was hired on permanently, with the company, I took a $2 pay cut, and never made it back to that point in five years. The hardest part of my job was asking a question, obtaining a different answer each time, and nothing was uniformed. I learned valuable skills such as: working with diverse cultures, auditing claims, training other employees, delegating work to temp employees, sitting in on interviews, understanding of Medicaid, how to read a claim, accurate processing techniques, assisting with writing new procedures, implementing procedures, how to read a UB92/H-1500 claim, and how to engage with providers involving insurance issues."
bad,"My day consists of viewing cameras and monitoring front lobby. Haven't really learned much while working here that I haven't learned from previous security sites. I enjoy my co-workers very friendly and a pleasure to work with. I must say there is no hard part to the job,my most enjoyable part of the job are my co-workers."
bad,Constant fear of job being outsourced every week you are left wondering if you will have a job. Hardly any room for advancement. If you like the big corporate world where you are just a number and have no problem with job security this is the place for you
bad,Opinions that are different from management are not well received and the manager retaliate against the worker.  If you are not in management they do not care what you think.
bad,"work is interesting, but with the constant change of management from VP down, the company has no constant rudder."
bad,"Employee morale is low due to forced early retirements and leadership placing unqualified people in positions to lead without knowledge of the industry and healthcare business.  "
bad,"The company itself is okay, but they are not put together well and their HR department does not work well when trying to get assistance. It was difficult to get some things accomplished when they never respond or never “receive things you’ve faxed several times”"
bad,"I've worked as a software developer at Anthem for over 7 months, and in that short time, I've seen dozens of talented contractors laid off to be replaced with cheaper employees in India. Not all of Anthem is bad to work at, but from my experience, contractors are treated especially poorly, often expected to work overtime without compensation. I do not recommend working here as a contractor."
bad,"I worked for Anthem appeals department as a clerk for 3 years. They seem to constantly be reorganizing staff or they call this restructuring. Managers don’t seem to know what they are doing. You are in a cubicle all day with no Interaction or socialization. When you do ask a question you are treated like a child. The Work is repetitious and overwhelming you are expected to keep up a production level. This resulted in not taking my breaks or lunch to keep up. The claim production become unrealistic of over 130 claims per day.  Which they increased the production level. There are Some claims that are over 4000 pages long that you have to review which can take an hour and this goes against your production level of not meeting their production levels and it is humanly impossible to do. The company seems to only care about numbers making their numbers and not the people.  If a human error is made you were treated like a child instead of them explaining the process in a mature way. They play guessing games as to what to do. Anthem does not adhere to their own ethics and compliance policies. I endured harassment by a coworker on three separate occasions which violated their ethics and compliance policies. I went through their process to report workplace harassment the coworker who caused the harassment was only moved to another part of the department where they harassed an additional three people. This goes against their ethics and compliance policies they state that they have a zero  tolerance for  harassment, but the individual was awarded a work at home program and kept for a production"
bad,Very dysfunctional organization. Noone seems to know their job and management  takes offense to those who do. Documentation us often falsified Bcbs made a huge mistake offering Anthem this contract. Months wasted when training could have been presented and staff knowledgeable of the industry hired. .
bad,I worked there for 3 years. The longer I worked there the worse it got. By the 3rd year management was completely changed. They had no respect for their employees. Shift bids are every 6 months. It based off of your stats so if your stats are low you better believe you’re going to get a late shift. The call volume is completely ridiculous at times. They expect you to break their necks for them for such a low pay. People up there are very immature. Healthcare benefits are pathetic
bad,"Anthem is a good company, but do not expect to retire from Anthem. Once employee get to 20 plus years with them or get up in age Anthem will lay you off.  They are also known to lay off associate while out on medical leave"
bad,"No upward mobility, small yearly bonus incentive if any at all, no autonomy, do as you are told. Lower level management placates to Senior Leadership and forces adherence or you will be let go. They will never attract (or keep) top talent as they are too myopic to deserve them. Would not recommend."
bad,Management doesn’t know anything about the healthcare industry. The management is unprofessional. The job role is unclear.. reps have no help whenever
bad,"It doesn't matter if you excel in every project that was given, if management doesn't care for, doesn't like the way you wear your hair or dress, they give you a manipulating hard time with your position.  Management and other positions believe they have ""superior"" privileges of color to discredit other races as witnessed and as witnessed myself. You'll be more likely to be left alone if you possess a degree versus having years of experiences and knowledge that's NOT defined on a piece of paper that would be pleasing to the eye of the governed regulated stereo-typed standards."
bad,you do the job of 5 people and always putting more on but not will to pay you for all you do and they set goal to high - there is no room for growth unless you are part of a click
bad,"this company does not support its personnel. low wages, and over promise of hours. schedule not flexible. there are better work environments out there"
bad,Can be faced passed at times. It also can be slow at times. this job is not something that takes a lot of brain power. Very micromanaged constantly worried about stats and could care less about someones home work life. THey just want warm bodies in the seats
bad,"Poor management skills compiled with a lack of encouragement for employee growth constitutes stagnant work with not much motivation for the job. With UM 1, expect non-stop outreach, outbound, phone calls 7 out of the 8 hour day. Expectation is 15 calls an hr, xs 7hrs, you would have to make a min of 105 calls a day. You are also expected to process 20 faxes an hr while answering phones. If you miss one of these goals, even just for 1month, you can expect not to be promoted during the following annual year evaluation. Management is very much on top of your every move, from getting up to go to the bathroom to helping a co-worker, it’s an environment where anxiety is thick and trusting of the employee is absent."
bad,"I worked for this company for 15 years. Was hired in when it was call WellPoint. Wellpoint was a great company to work for, but when we merged with Anthem, everything changed and not for the better. Employees treated like workhorses. The best part of this company was the people on my team. Production requirements are unreleastic. Micro managing, controlling manager. In the end there is no job security.  I did really great work for this company and in the end it made no difference."
bad,"A typical day that Anthem for me as a Consumer Care Associate consisted of taking inbound calls and inbound chats from Anthem associates and Eli Lilly associates. .Answering questions about claims, benefits, and advising members about programs that were offered through Anthem such as Future Moms , and Complex Care and Condition Care programs geared towards helping members take better care of themselves by being better informed."
bad,"I dislike the job and management period. Very stressful, Very unorganized. I am done talking about it because it is physically making me sick just the thought of it."
bad,"very poor management , no to little help when your computer goes down,  Computer down most of the working day.  Most of the week computer is not working at all,  IT has no idea how to get the computer to work, you wait for hours to get your computer to work each day,  Most /to all of the department system is down daily."
bad,In name of workplace strategy company is trying to replace resource with modern technologies and not giving the current associates a chance to relocate and learn new technologies on the job. Lot of job is going to outsourcing companies
bad,"As a healthcare worker of 15 years management and employee communication is key. Anthem management does not want to hear what employees have to say even if it'll better the work environment and the moral. At Anthem call center you're not allowed to take breaks which means your timed on using the bathroom and for someone with a disability this is very difficult. They say they care about the customers; however, they ignore phone calls and want respond to their calls. During crisis calls they take their time knowing people lives are in jeopardy."
bad,"I have a hard time somedays. Dealing with irate customers over their insurance or their precsriptions. I wasn't even offered benefits. I worked Full Time, got paid the same, I was even in the first 50 they hired. Yet now they are bringing in new classes and offering them full benefits, while rumors are we are all getting let go soon. It's not the best job I have to say."
bad,There is no company culture because the CEO changes every few years.  It is a very political and old fashioned organization. Almost like working for the government without the job security and don't anticipate a promotion because no matter how hard you work you won't get it.
bad,"Managers play favorites and like to micromanage.  It's rare to get a good manager.  Several associates are lazy and try to find ways to put their work off on others.  Can be cliquish at times.  Too many unnecessary conference calls.  To say it's such a large company, the I.T. infrastructure is terrible, nothing works all the time.  Many associates are on the phone with I.T. on a daily basis to fix equipment.  Management continues to find ways to do more with less (meaning employees) which often leads to employees being overworked and stressed.  Difficult to move to other positions."
bad,I am not recommend my friends to work for this company because they can let you go anytime it does not matter the years you have been with them.   no mercy
bad,"I was not happy working for this company, I would not work there again."
bad,"Coworkers are great to work with despite the fact that interaction is very minimal. Management is very tough on you and advancement is minimal, as well and rate of pay. Hardest part of job is that you are responsible for a lot of information and the job is not worth the rate is offered. "
bad,a normal work day is very hard and stressful and the co-workers are not very nice.
bad,"I process all types of medical claims, Microsoft Office Outlook, Microsoft Office Word, Microsoft Office Excel,Microsoft Office Powerpoint."
bad,I prided myself on being an Anthem/Wellpoint Associate and Manager for nearly 8 years. I had a great team of Nurses and Utilizaiton Management Reps. We were the place to be. Wellpoint over the course of the last year and a half ( or longer) has been sliding. Medical Reviews were being outsourced to Malaysia in an effort to cut costs. This is Private Health Information going overseas. As a healthcare professional and a Wellpoint Customer I really have a problem with this. Not to mention the loss of American jobs.
bad,Org changes all the time. Continual layoffs with workload increasing. No work/family life balance at all.  60+ hour work week is normal.  Would not recommend.
bad,The customer service department does not pay well enough for all of the requirements this job has. They micro manage EVERYTHING from your break times and your after call work to your ability to use your PTO.
bad,"They always hire through temp agencies and even if they do decide to make you ""permanent"" ,they make you resubmit everything like you just walked in the door.Management and corporate structure is ridiculous.The managers dont know how to do the work your doing ,but worried about bathroom breaks.They hire and fire people with a flick of a wrist."
bad,"Manager I had ran everyone out or made them quit. I wish I didn't get promoted because she made me do all the work and with no thanks. Once i expressed my concerns with her she ran me out. I really hope she gets Karma on how she treats her employees. Company is ok, they don't really compensate too well for the work you do. Back to Back calls everyday and when you get promoted it gets worse. You're more a number than a employee here."
bad,The pay was decent but management displayed favoritism and unprofessionalism.  If you are friends with the boss you will be treated fairly. And if you are not their friend then you will be treated unfairly.
bad,Anthem expectations are unrealistic and unobtainable. There is no room for autonomy and work structure changes routinely. As a whole it employment is productivity based and not focused on patients.
bad,Pretty much 8 hours a day of verbal abuse. Get used to members cussing and threatening you. When you first start they promise you the world...when you get to the call center floor it all changes. You find that the training is poor and makes you ill equip to perform the job. They micromanage what they want you to do and policies change daily. If you don't open and close the calls the way they want you to word for word expect a poor review. All you are is a number to them. Management will play favorites and let some people do whatever they want and be absent as much as they want with no UTO's applied to them. But once you do then it's a whole different story.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend Anthem to my worst enemy. If you want to work for a company that doesn't care about their employees or members and only cares about meeting numbers, then this job is for you."
bad,"Anthem is a awesome company with decent benefits but the gives too much power and authority to the management staff. If you had a good manager than your job is great but if your manager is incompetent than you will have a terrible experience. Unfortunately my entire department, pharmacy, was corrupt. Managers were sleeping with associates and showed favoritism. I loved my job but I hated the office corrupt politics. The training is terrible as well and instead of improving the systems and training they kept it the same and watched their employees struggle. Communication was terrible and information was constantly being miscommunication. The attendance policy is outdated as well. Anthem just needs better communication and leadership in certain departments."
bad,When I first started I had a great manager and our team was well staffed with 40+ CSRs. Our manager abruptly quit due to our micro managing director located in Indianapolis at the corporate office. Our new manager has successfully ran our entire team off or fired the staff we had. We are now at only 16 people. Calls are non stop all day. You are ball and chain to your phone. You can only get up from your desk for your scheduled breaks and lunch. If you are one minute late from lunch you automatically get a half occurence for the day. Same if you clock in one minute late. You do get a quarterly bonus and yearly raise but it is almost completely the managers discretion as to the amount you get. Which really sucks when your manager very clearly picks favorites. HR here also sucks as they have had the issues with our manager brought to their attention by more than 10 associates and they have done absolutely nothing. If you are going to work at anthem DO NOT work in provider services. Only go for FEP or sales. Those are the only teams in this whole building that actually enjoy their job. Or med supp as it is not hard and has a good starting wage.  Benefits are not great and you pay for your benefit package. Lunches are only 30 minutes and you only get 5 hours of PTO every check. You also have to fight others for time off as it's based on an online schedule for the year.
bad,Let me start by saying if you aren’t buddy buddy with management you will not get hired on . I was at Anthem as a temp and was placed in the Outbound Dept. I was hired as a Member Services Representative through a temp agency but when I got there I was told I’d be doing Outbound calls. Was shocking to me because I was use to doing Inbound. The pay was decent when working through a temp agency. But you don’t get any PTO or any benefits and they will keep you working as a temp for up to a year before they let you go or hire you on . Unfortunately I was let go called by the temp agency on a Saturday and told not to return to work that Monday . My manager had her favorites and I was not one of them. Till this day there are people there that miss several days a week but still have their jobs because they are close with my old manager . I came to work and did my job I wasn’t there to brown nose or to make friends I stayed to myself and unfortunately that’s what got me let go. I would go back in a different dept doing Inbound if offered the opportunity I think I just got placed in a very unprofessional dept. She also allowed certain  employees to get off the phones for the day and walk around doing nothing. These where employees she was close with which isn’t fair to others on the phones all day. Call flow is very heavy in inbound & outbound dept. And they also don’t like you getting up to use the restroom unless your on your break. Mostly catty females in this dept which made my work day unpleasant at times. But I did get paid weekly and made decent money. No OT offered to temps no
bad,"This is not a company for me.  You are monitored to the minute and are dictated breaks and lunch times which change daily.  You answer phone call after phone call and the software in which you are to use, returns incorrect information, thus you need to search other applications only to return incorrect information again.  You are not given time to answer the questions complete and if you need to research something, you are not given time to call the customer back.  It counts against your productivity because your phone is being used on an outbound call and thus not available for an inbound call.  When providers offices call we only have the ability to give name rank and serial number if you will.  We can only provide them with the details that they already know or send it back to claims to be reviewed only to be told it processed correctly.  They do not work as a team, your coworkers look for ways to run to management and stab you in the back rather then to guide and mentor you into the role."
bad,"Anthem is very demanding and competitive. They expect their developers to spend a large amount of personal time to train. They allow very little time for on the job training. "
bad,"This is a great company to use as a stepping stone to build your skills.  They are always hiring; however, there is not much advancement in certain IT departments.  You are expected to work long hours including weekends and vacation.  "
bad,"This company has low pay. Very unorganized , poor training .Medical insurance for employees is better at outside companies through Anthem. Most of your pay will go back to the company in insurance and fees associated with having it as an employee. Very cut throat, the  supervisor like to try and embarrass and humiliate employees by firing them and then sending emails bidding fond farewells once your already gone . If you go here make sure to give notice and leave on your own ."
bad,"Continually laying employees off."
bad,"The cultural at Anthem is very hard, and lacks simple informational sharing which makes working difficult. Generally, teams re-org every 6 months. The new CEO is trying to change the cultural, but has been met with resistance."
bad,This was the most backward health plan I ever worked with in my 20+ years in this industry.
bad,The typical day at anthem is one that you can ever prepare for.  It is very fast paste and if you enjoy learning something new everyday and things changing by the second then anthem is for you.  Every day is challenging.
bad,Not consisent with anything.  New employees get more pay and better shifts than tentured employees.  Unwilling to work with employees on any issues that may affect  worklife.
bad,"Poor management "
bad,Management was often not in touch with what lower levels were doing. More focus on politics than performance or results. culture was more focused on reacting than planning.
bad,"I give Anthem a bad review. They had associates on medication to just function because they were hard on you but never showed you did a good job at something. It was nervous for everyone to walk in there because things/business changed day by day. Never ever told about your success or encouragement just always negativity. I enjoyed my co workers we were all in it it together w/o them we would have all crumbled. Everyone left due to the chaos. Typically first thing in the morning we have a 15min meeting , being screamed at (all of us ) because numbers dont match and other states are doing better than California. There was always put downs in the A.M. then we had to jump on the phones, never any higher authority to help us associates out during a difficult crucial call. I enjoyed helping others but I never got recognized for it which really made me sad and non valued as a human being"
bad,"The company pretends to care about associates yet repeatedly makes changes that are not appreciated by staff.  Changes to benefits, stock plans, and work rules happen way too often."
bad,"Enjoyed working as a Nutrition Consultant in assisting clients with management of diet, health and exercise via telephonic communications."
bad,"Very unorganized. No researchtime yet inventory must be worked.  Fail 2answer your questions when surveys go toward your stats. Constantly changing!!! Member demanding help, oes demand better stats, your schedule rarely gets changed and manager constantly on you and they wanna know why they are constantly hiring."
bad,"While  training was offered, It is a culture of fear environment with poor management.  Training was a guise to help employee improve but really was showing what issues there were to be set up for termination.  Asking questions and trying to get additional help or clarification will get you fired from Anthem.  Horrible experience."
bad,I found that this company is all talk and no production. the managment has attitude and not warm towards employees the bottom line is the concept....
bad,"I have been working in this department for several months and has been challenging to say the least. The trainer was good but using an outdated training manual verses what you learn from veterans whom have been in this department for 1year or more. The company standards are very harsh to employees whom work here especially when you are getting audited on quality of handling a call, not able to get out of your seat for a period of a time, and not able to have a fun place to work or diversity among fellow employees. I hope in the near future changes come."
bad,"A typical day was getting yelled at by people whose insurance claims were denied. Throw in disrespect from management  when you have a question, backstabbing/disrespectful people under the guise of helping you, and inconsistent flexibility with hours  ""at discretion of management"", a coworker who was actually a tad physically aggressive, and invasion of personal medical medical privacy to get the best insurance coverage, and you know what you are up  against working for Anthem.  In less than a year, half of our beginning training class had left the company.That is something to think about in this economy."
bad,My time at Anthem was overall a negative experience. I went through 2 major job eliminations and had to apply internally in order to keep my tenure. Management did little to keep associates engaged.
bad,Your overall experience will be base on your manager. It can be a easy relaxed place to work or it can be very bad base on your manager. Its pretty much wild wild west there. Its very hard to advance because there is not a set path way for you.
bad,"I verify doctors address and fax numbers as well as making sure that they have availability to see new patients, and send a list to the customer."
bad,"professional work environment, fast paced work environment excellent benefits "
bad,I learned alot about healthcare there. We also were compensated
bad,"Very negative call center environment. On the providers' side, you take about 70-80 calls a day with very little time to even drink water. Management is non-existent unless they pop up to tell you about your numbers. Management is always in meetings and never supportive and will tell you not to make more work for them then they already have. You will be told that ""you're appreciated"" but it's clear that you are just a seat filler and can be replaced if need be. The cafeteria is crazy-expensive. New hires will be given a better shift and better pay. It's possible that other departments function better but definitely NOT provider services."
bad,"It’s a company that I wouldn’t recommend to people at all. They Hiring Manager is mean and pretend to be knowledgeable. They are not flexible with the work , life balance."
bad,It’s a terrible place to work. Management is terrible. No growth what so ever within the company unless your sleeping with management. Remove management and it’s a good place to be employed. Benefits are great.
bad,"•	Able to think quickly on the spot to answer guest questions and team members. "
bad,You only get promoted if you smooze  with the right people  Too many meetings  The current CEO and her management team is destroying the culture and morale
bad,"Discriminatory practices, based on preference and not skill or productivity.  Call center workers not being treated the same as other workers within the company. Very educational, training in the beginning was very intense, however they changed their training style or provided little to no training when asked to do other Lines of Business."
bad,N/A; I have no comment regarding employment at Anthem concerning the Culture pertaining to Workplace environment or Management.  Anthem has good benefits but Management is lacking.  Thank you.
bad,"I enjoyed working for my manager and teammates. Upper management is just running the place into the ground. The direction changes with every new CIO. Received an excellent review one month and was RIFd a month later along with 270 others. Not a place to feel secure in. If they are not making their numbers their answer is layoffs. No loyalty to the employees leads to no company loyalty from the employees.  Used to be an excellent place to work about 7 years ago, not now. I hope it gets back to the way it was for all my friends who are still there."
bad,"It was great when it was Amerigroup. When Anthem bought out Amerigroup everything went downhill. From major layoffs, high turnover rate and very poor management and hiring anyone that could write their name. I left after being there over 10yrs. HR is a joke and sides with upper management on everything and the company itself does not care about their employees at all. It's all about the bottom. Leaving was my best decision line. However my last manager was amazing. He really appreciates his team"
bad,Everyone walks around like robots. Management is not friendly at all. Training only last a week and you’re thrown in the fire. They get agitated when you ask questions. An extremely weird place!
bad,The health benefits were the only good thing about working with this company. They also offered a free Marta card if you took public transportation everyday.
bad,Many RIFs - job security is always in jeopardy.  Compensation is competitive if you can navigate through the RIFs.  Work force consists of older generation (Baby Boomers and Gen-X)
bad,"Can not trust senior staff on any level ever! Especially the concierge department for customer care rep. They will stab you in the back, will try to get rid of you when you do not agree with them and more fun stuff. The pay for SHBP is a disrespectful spit in the face for the amount of work you have to do there. That department should at least start at $18.50/hr minimum. The SHBP is the most underpaid department there and they have the most members, it's truly sad for the pay."
bad,"The Louisiana plan was a great place to work until the leadership changed. Inexperienced people were hired for leadership positions, there were silos, and little career advancement for all people. Training for new hires is non existent. Expect to be on your own. You will never receive answers to questions and the company is the most unorganized place I've ever worked. People are afraid to speak up due to fear of retaliation. I believe Anthem's current CEO is trying to change things for the better. However, Louisiana's Healthyblue plan is a fail."
bad,"Anthem was an excellent company to work for.  Nice benefits and loved my coworkers. However, when it came time to promote from within, they neglected to do that."
bad,Anthem tries very hard to be politically correct. They are very corporate America and it is tough to advance within.  They workplace culture and management are cut throat.
bad,"The company downsized my group, The newer people were let go as a result, myself included.  I did not get a complete picture of the organization or all that it had to offer."
bad,The better you are at your job the move you get to do everyone else's work to make up for their incompetence. Also enjoy doing it for next to no money.
bad,"I worked on contract with an option to be hired. I worked very hard with this company and did everything they asked me to do. I had no experience doing this type of work but by the time my year was up I was meeting all of the set requirements. The manager even had one on one assistance to help me meet all of the requirements. But in the end I was not hired and the manager didn’t even meet with me to let me know. She didn’t even come by to say Bye, good luck, not one word! So my experience was not one I would wish on my enemy. By the time I left I was so stressed out and my work and dedication was not recognized!"
bad,"this place is a revolving door, they didnt train properly and had to hold another training session but only chose a few people. half my training group quit before 1 year."
bad,"There were some good people who worked for the company, but they quickly moved on. Management was not supportive of positive change. There was a lot of micromanagement."
bad,"Anthem is definitely a place of many politics. Although Anthem afforded me the opportunity to learn the healthcare landscape, there isn't much room for growth. Also, Anthem is notorious for having layoffs. Limited job security."
bad,"I have been with this company for over a decade. I used to love it but over the past 3 years it has gone down hill. They are scaling back on benefits and salaries, pushing to do more with less and in general have created chaos. I am honestly worried about the future of the company. They are making a lot of moves that indicate they are struggling."
bad,"Its was a come up position. Gain your experience, network with the right people and do your best to move up in the industry. Great experience/insight in regards to how the whole infrastructure of health care works"
bad,Manager was not engaging. She created false scenario's of your job performance. Would get rid of people without cause  and thought that she was doing them a good deed.
bad,"A typical day consisted of working provider issues, resolving claims underpayments or incorrect payments. Confirming and verifying contractual obligations were held to. Being aware of Title 22, Medi-Cal and healthcare reform updates and polices."
bad,Not the same company.  Toxic environment is how many of my fellow colleagues are still describing their work environment.  It is very hard to get management decision and support.
bad,"false promises of advancement"
bad,Production cannot be met in an 8 hour day and requires at least 10-12 hours a day. Being above average is next to impossible.  They want to keep you in the middle of the continuum from below average to above average.  The better you perform then the more they pay you so they make you work 12 plus hours a day to achieve.    No consideration is given for any illness or family emergencies.  If you need to be out more than a day better contact HR for short term leave.
bad,I did not like working at BCBS the managers was very bias never listen and had their friend they will do favors for. They monitor your ever move and will fire you for no reason.
bad,"typical day at work is ok working with patients however pay increase and room for advancement not so good, no paid vacation and no benefits period good for short term work but if your looking for long term not a place to work for"
bad,I have been with Anthem since 2010 and has failed to progress because the managers will hold you back if you are a strong minded person who takes their job serious.  Its very unorganized and they promote non qualified people that are weak minded.
bad,"Each week of each month is the same.  What I do is make sure doctors received there month payment for taking care of recipients.  My job is take make sure bank account numbers, address, and payment amounts are correct."
bad,Answering phone calls and helping members with their claims and benefit questions.  Researching claims to see if the benefit is correct and processed in the system correctly.
bad,"Management was terrible, poor benefits, underpaid, overworked, extremely strict and stuffy atmosphere. No help from leadership team. Very catty and tit for tat."
bad,Changes in leadership have impacted morale. The Cigna deal has caused people to look for jobs. Over the next two years we will see what changes.  If everything goes well it could be a good place to work in Indy.
bad,"The company was moving in a good direction several years ago but turned for the worse in the last 4 years. There are cultural issues, efficiency issues, and some severe planning problems."
bad,"The job its self is wonderful, I like talking to the members one on one and helping them individually. The most enjoyable part of this job is knowing I helped out at least 10 people a day save a lot of money and still get great health care."
bad,Great culture with work remote facility but due to constant reorg and new IT leadership having no healthcare background people are leaving.
bad,"a typical day here is all over the place, there is no set direction from Management, there is no consistent training.  "
bad,"HR non existent, departments in silos. Management like a dictatorship, this was my experience. In the Louisville office very cutthroat, soulless, hostile work environment between management and consultants/analysts. Not a good experience."
bad,"Anthem does foster a culture of cutover service. It does this by increasing the workload on it's customer service reps. Pressure is constantly put on reps and supervisors to improve performance metrics, without giving resources to do so. Increasing responsibility, without increasing compensation is common. Management above the supervisory level has virtually no contact with the workers apart from an occasional visit to the floor. You would think one of the leading health insurance companies would provide it's employees with great coverage. Not so, coverage constantly decreases year to year, and personal share goes up. Little benefits such as contests, lunches, picnics etc are slowly being eliminated. Employees are constantly reminded that their positions could be outsourced overseas at any time. On the plus side, promotion from within is the norm, the company recently moved to a new facility, with a wonderful cafeteria, and employee fitness center. Anthem does, truly put the customer first, and if I was shopping for a health insurance plan, they would be my first consideration. Maddeningly they leave in place systems and policies that can sabotage the best efforts of their employees. If you can put up with the grueling workload, and being treated like just another piece of equipment, you could find a career here."
bad,"To much change and virtual environment / constant staff turnaround very difficult to work in."
bad,"Advancement is not very common unless its the typical ""who you know not what you know"". Expectations of employees at entry level are ridiculous. Their training program is 6-8 weeks and during the course of this time they only teach you core navigation and some essentials for claims processing. I hear customer service is different. The only way you learn is by making mistakes in this company. Sadly too much ""learning"" will get you fired. Programs, workflows, and overall ethics are all outdated. For a company as large as this one everything is stuck in the early 90's. If you want to make a name for yourself you literally have to give the company all your time and try to learn things on your own on your own time. The tools provided are also outdated. This is a very sink or swim company. I've never seen a company have so many rule changes and ""company realignments"" as this one. No employee handbook so rules change as directors see fit. What could be a rule one day that is in your favor can be changed in an instant to work against you. Employees quit often because they cannot handle the pressure or lack of support to help learn the job. I for one would not recommend working for this company unless it is outside of claims and in a more respectable position. There is opportunity and money to be made here. But it seems that once you're out of entry and into a better position things start to feel better. Most people never try to help those in entry level or improve entry level because once they're out they never look back. The benefits aren't very good and this is one of the leading"
bad,"Anthem buys a company and allows them to dictate the rules that do not follow Anthems way of business?  Weird...No flex time like Anthem offers its other divisions, you have to EMAIL you boss to use the restroom??? WHAT???  I thought I was out of school and grown! You are asked not to talk to the other workers, really not what they stated in the interview, feels like the old bait and switch!  Training has been VERY limited and shortened to get us up and running in this division due to the growth, but it is only hurting the CUSTOMER!"
bad,"As CSR I you get worked to death.  You have to handle inbound calls all day long, and open inquiries.  But management gives you no time to call customers back.  You only get like 30 minutes off the phone a day to call back like 25 people -- that's crazy and it doesn't work.  So your call-back inventory grow and grows, then its your fault that it is growing and customers don't get callbacks on time.  Management refuses to take any remote responsibility for giving you an impossible job.  You also have to work on phones for years to get any promotional opportunities also.  Not a good place to work at all."
bad,"A typical day involves checking e-mail and constantly putting out fires.  Getting new hires set up or off boarded properly, requesting system accesses, expense reporting, participating in several conference calls and/or meetings.  I learned how to become a master at multi-tasking.  Co-workers are pleasant and respectful.  The hardest part of this job is the lack of consistency and accountability among management and leadership with regards to policies and procedures.  Also, technology makes getting work done difficult as there are various networks throughout the company and very few are merged together.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to get a task completed and knowing that I did my best work."
bad,"Poor management; contract work, a lot of lay offs, not enough pay"
bad,Company is ok but not company that you would plan a future with
bad,"Managers tend to sanitize information to their higher-ups. Very little 'care' is taken of their direct reports, they seem overly concerned with how they appear to their managers."
bad,Customer Service is considered a low value position. You are there to fill a position and stay on the phone. No opportunity for input or suggestions. Very poor morale because people are used for the company benefit and have no value as an individual
bad,"So disappointed in the current direction of this company to move I.T. Jobs to Legato (newer Anthem subsidiary in India).  At first they told us our jobs were moving to a hub location (for most that meant Atlanta). Before this, Anthem was mainly a virtual company with associates all across the country.  The CIO who came up with the brilliant idea to eliminate work from home left shortly after setting his plan in motion.  Company has been going downhill ever since.  Culture is awful because there are so many layoffs. It’s sad to watch."
bad,"It only servered the purpose for the company."
bad,"This location has very high turn over.  Advancement is based more on who you know.  Management allowed employees to come to work wearing pungent fragrances.  This was detrimental to many of us with respiratory issues.  The work place is for working, not dating."
bad,"I have to say that the training is really good.  Don't let them fool you, though.  In the intensive Customer Service training, they lead you to believe that the customer is #1 and whatever it takes to get them handled is what you need to do.  I totally agree with this philosophy, and that is what excellent customer service is all about."
bad,This place is really a crazy place to work at. These people have no idea what they are doing. The management is clueless and the people are not open to innovation or development
bad,Management was not good.  The managers were unfair and run like a slave plantation.  They treated the nurses as if they were disposable...awful environment
bad,"To work from home you must not have satellite internet. You must have an exemplary credit score. Don't waste your time applying if you do not meet those expectations. I suggest that Anthem should do a credit check and check a person's internet before hiring.  I could have stayed at my old job instead of being unemployed now.  Digging to find a way to let someone go is ridiculous. You want employees to be honest, how about your managers be honest!"
bad,"If you need a job go for it but you will sacrifice alot if you plan to stay longterm.  Poor IT interface across numerous platforms combined with new untalented managers created a pretty sad situation for a company the size of Anthem.  Since buying Amerigroup which took over government business, failing at the Cigna merger, and security breach work loads have grown and benefits tweaked ie restricting time off policy resulted in deterioration of work life balance. ...It could be a job to use as a stepping stone to somewhere else but I wouldn't move to town to work for them."
bad,"Too many meetings and not a lot of insight from a creative standpoint in supportive truly creative talent. Culture tied to who you know approach. "
bad,Management team leads and managers are very unprofessional. the workplace is not at all a relaxed environment. very stressful due to high expectations on a small given time frame for job completion. Appointed promotions are not practiced to boost employee morale. No solid organizational structure. No proper training are given to new employees.
bad,"Anthem is very appreciative of effective and thoughtful work processes. They strive to be cost conscious in all things."
bad,"It's a giant company with good and bad but IT loved to outsource/offshore and layoff, unless everyone is gone by now."
bad,"This employer has advertised a culture of inclusiveness and professionalism. However, not all managers advere to the maxims set forth by the employer. The manager of the unit on which I am employed has displayed a tendency toward dishonesty and mistreatment. A great number of high-performing co-workers have transitioned  either to other units or to other employers, as a result."
bad,"Very poorly communicated plan for constructing a project and  managing the tasks,  Much depended on the outside contractors and organizations to implement major technical configurations."
bad,"Anthem can be a great place to work with excellent benefits. However, the management that I was under were not suited for their jobs. Many people around me were unhappy with how they were treated by management. "
bad,Not a great place to work.  Very high pressure.  Lack of work/home life balance.  Many very tight deadlines which are almost impossible to meet.  Company is planning to downsize in the near future.
bad,"Anthem, is a job where the only way you grow in the company is if your connected to the correct ppl, you will not progress in this company. Anthem is a Who you know not what you know company."
bad,"The company has a lot of positive goals but the actual inside workings are much less than positive. Leadership is lacking and information sketchy. You may be told by five different people five different ways things are supposed to be done which can leave you in limbo not really knowing the correct procedures. The job is nonstop, which I enjoyed, and during peak season they do require mandatory overtime. There is a lack of assistance concerning irate callers. Finding supervisors willing to take over the calls when members request is an everyday challenge."
bad,This company will lay off their most tenured employees. They have not concern or care for their employees if you ask me. I talked to some of the permanent staff while I was there and several of the employees who had been there had invested a lot of time and loyalty into the company. They had went through several lay offs with anthem but just kept coming back when asked or needed.  I was a temp there twice. i was a temp and laid off the first time after only being there for a short period of time and the second time was a temp through Judge Services and I was fired for something that the manager didn't even come to me and talk about. I literally had no idea that she had a problem with me. she didn't come to me to discuss anything just went to higher management and had me fired. I only found out the reason from asking the man that called to let me go.
bad,"Anthem is a very cheap company.  All of their insurance plans for their employees have high deductibles.  Their incentive plans are a joke.  "
bad,"Words aren't enough to explain my experience. Management has favoritism for certain associates, the merit increase is literally a insult to one's performance and also there isn't sportsmanship at ALL."
bad,"Fast paced, high demand jobs. Much is expected.  Frequent changes make this company dynamic.  Had a setback with the Privacy Breach in 2014 but otherwise moving along quite well."
bad,Company was great in 08-09 then got rid of trainers to save money also let seasond reps go so they can hire temp at a cheaper pay rate after that all insentive gone and for customer service week u get a pen from the dollar store they don't care about there employees al all!!
bad,"Overall ran badly, not enough training for new hires and all about quantity and not quality work. Management was not up to date with new information and made a mockery with someone who tried to express new information or concern."
bad,"Wellpoint was okay until the ""merge"" with Amerigroup. It became a chaotic and stressful work place."
bad,"Favoritism, un fair and unjust  supervisor fare not trained"
bad,"Took on a new line of business on the contingency that I did not end up with a certain manager. They assured me I would not, but I still did. I only lasted a month after that."
bad,"•a typical day at work: hours can vary based on your schedule; hours are WAY more than advertised, leaving no home life"
bad,"I was called by friend who is a co-founder of this company, to join his company when I was in US. I did join and later regretted. A year later I left."
bad,"Assisting members with getting their medication, updating account information, setting doctors appointment, etc. also help providers with claims. Mailing and faxing out information to members and providers as needed. My manager was not very supportive, she did not really know how to handle a call if it was escalated, did not want to take the escalated calls, never gave positive feedback just negative. My co-workers and I basicly helped each other and we had a great work relationship. The hardest part of the job is triying to help a member find a doctor and there is no one in their area that takes their insurance. I enjoyed helping members resolve what ever issue they have especially if they called more than once about the same issue."
bad,"If you are looking for administrative experience in the health care field it's a great place to start, just don't plan on staying too long. Co-workers are great and work really hard. Team in general gets along well and care about each other."
bad,ugh the management is horrible. They treat you like you're nothing and your bound to your seat
bad,Good pay and benefits but work culture is horrible   This company feels if they pay you decently they can work you hours all day and night   The life work balance isn’t balanced    I recommend taking a lower pay and go with the other company
bad,Stressful place to work during peak season. When I started I didn’t finish training they threw my class on the floor because they were understaffed. My manager had never came to visit us at the time I didn’t even know what she looked like. They also show favoritism.
bad,I was really happy and satisfied with the job and environment i had until this day. I was called by the director and said that my position is getting removed so you are no longer employed with anthem. They are consolidating all the work locations. They said this is the reason for it. Very shocking..
bad,"typical day at work come in do your job and go home "
bad,"Tough environment for advancement.  Metrics used against you, managers are not on same page, HIPAA verification is a joke. Love cafe,love PTO, love OT when offered."
bad,"I felt my experience was traumatic where  staffing with different inexperienced managers was very damaging to the employees, who acquired them,The company knew the outcomes were poor and put new managers that did not know how to guide the staff in charge. Then a massive layoff, and people not laid off was left trying to clean up the mess that was made by the previous decision to hire new managers with no experience. Trying out new training techniques, and constant computer problems which interferred with productivity. We were then split up from our teams and put with new teams and more experienced managers who saw what a mess was made who did not have time to care about repairing the damage that was created and you were fired because you did not know how to repair the damage. Work life balance is poor d/t office travel and shift hour with long commute times. The Benefits , compensation, and pay is the best I ever had. Even with the problems , if things were better organized would love to go back and work for Anthem. I like there style and they are the best to work for.  Thanks Anthem"
bad,The company lacked employee engagement & recognition.   Lacked respect for diversity and poorly executed the company’s vision.  Very siloed and a “me” mentality verses team collaboration.
bad,"The environment here will literally have people fighting. And the pay vs work load is beyond irritating. We assume so much for the customers and it feels like you get so little from the company... If you can manage to put up with the managers or lack there of, the high School environment and the low but bias base pay maybe you can career of this place."
bad,"The entire company cannot tell if it is coming or going. There are no set procedures for anything, and yet the employees are still expected to make it work somehow and meet the ridiculous standards set forth."
bad,"- Travel"
bad,I don't have much to say about Anthem.  Ok company to work for and are very culturally correct.  There are several states that require their work to be done in a fast turn around time and other states that require 30 days for work to be completed.
bad,When I started it was slow but our department kept signing new customers but management wouldnt hire anyone new. Constantly being monitored while on the phone. Unrealistic expectations and very rude customers.
bad,"At the beginning of my tenure with the company, the work conditions and benefits were absolutely top-notch. The work was challenging and management afforded ample resources to handle the tasks."
bad,"Anthem is similar to many insurance companies I've been at, in that they are fairly conservative and their internal processes are difficult if not impossible to change in any significant way from any level lower than the C-level."
bad,"My experience at work on a typical day would include me coming in 7:30 AM and leaving 4:30 and sometimes after my shift to ensure I didn't leave work for my team. I've had different managers and some actually took time to learn their employees while others due to not being in the office were only a voice, not a presence. The hardest part of the job a lot of the time can be the people and feeling like your opinion and voice aren't being heard. The most enjoyable part of the job outside of the wonderful health care benefits were getting to meet your extended family called co-workers. Being as though you spend more time with co-workers than family they become your family and they are the ones that a lot of times motivate you and keep you going."
bad,"I worked at Anthem for six years. Overall the pay, benefits and opportunity for advancement were good. The office culture and behavioral issues made for a stressful work environment."
bad,positive in the sense of a new experience but horrible / threatening micromanagement and poor support for representative with an emphasis of learn and research on your own in a system that is not very clear
bad,"National Government Services, an Anthem subsidiary handling Medicare contracts, has stopped providing merit raises to employees. The only time anyone in the company will get a raise is if the SCA wage determinations (the minimum wage federal contractors are allowed to pay for any particular job title) are increased. So rather than being rewarded with a chance to advance within the company for a job well done, you are left waiting for a government hand out. This place does not offer careers anymore, these are dead end jobs where you will make what you are hired at until the government raises the minimum wage for your position, regardless if you've failed, met, or exceeded the goals set for you. If you were an employee making above the SCA wage determinination prior to this change, you will not recieve a raise until the SCA wage determination is raised above your current wage rate. After 5 years of service it feels that the rug has been pulled out from under me. I went from building a career doing work I am good at to having a dead end job literally overnight.  If you take a position at NGS please only consider it a stepping stone for gaining Medicare experience and use that to move on as quickly as possible to another company that will value your work in the way we all need an employer to value us; with respect that a job well done deserves a raise. The only thing that has me holding on is that I was allowed to transition to work from home before the company stopped that as well."
bad,"Anthem provides ample training (nearly two months) and gives you loads of encouragement. The difference from the class to the floor is astounding. Bad attitudes all around and the opportunity for advancement is not as abound as they made it seem. You pretty much have to sell your soul to the company to get ahead and be willing to live there. "
bad,"The lions share of work for a typical day involves data preparation; the data are not well documented and at times complex. This isn't as much a bi-product of bad design as much as a symptom of rapid acquisition of business.   In that sense, I would not recommend Anthem if having to spend considerable time making sense of data is not your cup of tea.  "
bad,Very stressful and hard to advance. All departments are not bad but there are one or two that I strongly believe the president should visit and look into making some drastic chances
bad,"Worked as a an associate who would handle enrollment of new members for companies that had at least 50 employees. Typically I would handle cases up to 400 people for enrollment. Really boiled down to paper pushing, and verifying that that information on enrollment was correct and complete. Not a bad job because each enrollment was different so it wasn't completely repetitive. The culture has become more business minded and less family. I actually had a one year review negative remark because I had three days of sick time, I mean really?? They used to have a few employee appreciation events and by the time I left they boiled it down to nothing. Management is all who you know and get along with. You have my back, I have yours. So if you have a problem with one, you have a problem with them all. No one cares what an employee has to do as long as the sale is made. I really hated that. You also don't have full benefits, not even a plan with co-pays which I find ridiculous as you work for the health care company. So, all in all, I would work there again but it would depend on the position and who I had to work with. I also would want to make sure my spouse had a better health care plan for the family. The 401K benefits are nice."
bad,If you want to sit in a cubical all day and not interact with anyone else this is the job for you...all you do is take call after call and you have peers reviewing you all the time to tell you what mistakes you made there were never really any warm fuzzy comments regarding your performance
bad,Compensation structure is fantastic. Systems are antiquated and need updated to streamline processes and allow sales and retention staff to manage customers more efficiently.
bad,You answer calls and solve problems . Managent is horrible. The hardest part of the job is telling members they owe thousands of dollars. Most enjoyable part of the day is helping members that you can.
bad,"it gave me experience which was nice however, there were a couple permanent employees that treated the temps with little respect and were quite rude at times. Not a very friendly work environment."
bad,"The short story is that Anthem pays great (salary plus bonus).  If that's your top priority, take a look."
bad,"Good company as a whole , managers ,dependent on where you work at incompetent. Great benefits for health care, dental etc."
bad,"A typical day at work would consist of accessing your emails or files to obtain any new updated information or current claims to process.  You would receive approximate 144 claims per day, however you are worked up to that number weekly.  These claims would  consist of Medicare, Medicaid, Hospital, Doctors visits etc.  You would have to access each policy holder and insurance carrier to determine what was available and pay claim accordingly.  "
bad,"Anthem is the result of three mergers in less than ten years.  BlueCross BlueShield absorbed Wellchoice, then WellPoint took BCBS over (retaining the name BCBS in some states).  Finally Anthem took over Wellpoint.  As the company grew, opportunity to transfer all over the country, as well as telecommute were afforded employees.  However, benefits decreased and employee contribution increased, particularly in regard to health insurance.  It became more difficult to advance vertically after the restructure, since many job functions were combined with more experience and education requirements tacked on.  In the final phase of restructure there were massive layoffs with some offshore outsourcing.  This was in 2012 as the nation was recovering from recession.  There were some serious issues with nepotism for years in the Middletown NY site, and stringent productions requirements.  This made the work environment very stressful for those not within the family and friends circle."
bad,"You work in a call center answering calls from people upset that their claims were not paid.  This is stressful enough, but it gets better....management does not treat everyone the same. If you have children and/or are a member of a racial minority you will get away with much much more: rudeness to customers, poor attendance, etc. If you are Caucasian without children everything will held against you. Not sure if that is a pity thing or a fear of being sued for discrimination.  Experienced coworkers will  ""help"" you, tell you that you are doing great, then go tell management something completely different, which is sometimes not even close to the truth. That  is not helping. Management believes the ""helper"" and will not even listen to your side of things.More than half  of new hires leave after less than one year. That tells you something, especially in this economy. There were also employee privacy issues-to get the best of the medical benefits, you had to participate in a wellness program that required giving a lot of very personal information-things that I refuse to discuss with my employer. My manager tried to hint that it was mandatory, so I checked with HR to verify that it was not."
bad,I would start work very early in the morning so I could be off around 12:30pm. Management in the last few years of employment was pretty much non existent. Whenever we needed her she was in a meeting. My co-workers for the most part were helpful and friendly. The hardest part of my job was having questions answered regarding the claims issues. The most enjoyable part of the job was our team meetings in Denver.
bad,"Large health, dental, vision insurance company. Locations found all across the country. I work for DeCare Dental, an organization acquired by Wellpoint 3 yrs ago."
bad,I started with the company twenty years ago. BCBSGA was a great place to work with excellent benefits. We became the most successful captive individual sales team in the country. I trained agents as well as had a very successful sales career. Later BCBSGA was bought out by Wellpoint.Wellpoint did not have a captive model so our sales department was being reduced by attrition. Our sales volume was high but they had no model to fit us into company design. Then we were purchased by Anthem. They had a captive sales model but was designed as an inside broker. I had to develop my leads and pay for an assistant. When we left the company my client base that I paid for and developed stayed with the company. The company's attitude toward the customers and providers changed for the worse. Soon the customers were being taken advantage of and the providers started dropping BCBSGA. I no loner could stand behind the product or company. Anthem is now loosing agents faster than they can replace them. It is not a good environment.
bad,Management sucked  they were not compassionate nor did they care about our home lives. The pay was okay but the work did not match  this job is extremely stressful and is not for the faint
bad,"The job overall is laid back but when it comes to the culture of the job it just went down hill, the lack of communication no pay rate. You have the option to work as much overtime."
bad,"Poor employee appreciation. Most employers give Christmas gifts or recognize Nurses month. Anthem does NOTHING to show employee appreciation. Pays corporate and management very well. Pays line staff poorly. Claims competitive wages, but pays less than United Health, Molina and Centene. Telecommuting is why I stay."
bad,"ok company to work with, terrible work- life balanace. difficult to progress and difficult to get PTO, benefits are good and job security is good, very strict performance measures."
bad,"This company has changed.  The people do not seem to be important anymore.  Seen great, people leave.  I would not want to work at Anthem inc. Before the merger, it was a great place to work."
bad,"Started out as a traveling trainer and quickly became a ""road warrior"" being on the road nearly all year. Allowed to come home every two weeks for the weekend but back in time to teach Monday morning class. Out of 17 months once, I was home collectively only three months. Thinking that if I accepted an FTE position and working remotely would allow me to return home and take care of some personal health issues and my relationship, I accepted a job on the Instructional Design team. Big mistake. Designers are continually behind the 8 ball and fighting to create content against deadlines that are nearly impossible to meet. Extremely stressful to meet deadlines while attempting to be creative and design engaging, interactive materials, activities and videos. The pressure and stress is definitely the hardest part of the job. If you don't care about the details and following AGILE/SCRUM methodology closely and can be happy in just putting out product to meet deadlines, you will be fine. I wasn't."
bad,Claims data was very accurate and reliable to query data from. Enrollment data that I was tasked to work with and identify loss in was full of errors making it impossible to know with and degree of certainty where enrollment losses were from.
bad,"I was hired at Anthem Insurance for the Amerigroup division in Overland Park, KS. The job was your typical customer service position helping out Medicaid members with their problems. From the moment I interviewed for this job, I like many others were either lied too or had the truth hidden from us. "
bad,"Anthem boasts about their great work life balance, flexible hours, PTO, etc, then once you’re hired you find out you’ll be expected to work 10-11 hour days with no OT. PTO can be denied for a month at a time. There are no flex hours. I would not recommend this company to anyone. It’s all about the dollar to them."
bad,Anthem had a huge turn over. People would leave for lunch and not return. Anthem needs 160 new employees which will be difficult to get that many. Management had severe favoritism. Not A good company to work for.
bad,I am currently still employed here but they do not offer much as far as discounts. The training environment seemed unprofessional to me as it was very unorganized resulting in us getting thrown on to the floor and not having all the information we needed. When I got to the floor my phone did not work.
bad,Staff is fun and teach you what you need to know. Other times there is nothing for you to do. You come in as a temp and they end your contract with no notice.
bad,Very low work morale. Felt more like a dictatorship than a democracy. FMLA was approved/denied on a favortism. Human Resources also made employees jump through hoops for benefits that were rightfully theirs.
bad,Great place to work and learn new things..I thought this will a career move for me.  But due to the contract ending I was not able to stay. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to assist many different people with their health insurance. A job were you felt as you were making a difference.
bad,"I found when Blue Cross was a company before Anthem bought them out, the company culture and work life balance was wonderful. When Anthem bought them out there was no such thing as work life balance."
bad,"great place to work at starting off in a call center. great benefit. friendly co workers, great hours. plenty of room to move up in a career path. Great discounts"
bad,"I had a short stay in this position due to that it was temporary, but during my time there I had been given the task of learning and maintaining a lot of information and policies."
bad,"Did not feel could provide great customer service through call center environment because I was not the one to follow through with client request. Other departments slow, understaffed"
bad,A lot of favoritism micromanagement and back stabbing within this company in customer service department. However you learn a lot about working with claims and being able to find out why they did or didn't pay.
bad,"Working tight deadlines with many changes to project schedule was great and collaborative. Decision to relocate team which was remote to Indianapolis, IN was not possible for for many key business partners."
bad,"the reason I get up and go to this job every day is because of the people I work with.  I have worked in the insurance indusry for a long time and I have worked in customer service twice as long.  I have never in my life seen so much dissrvice to clients as I have witnessed at Anthem.  I am mostly embarrassed by their tactics of serving their clients.  As a member advocate here, you work with little to no training, no help from management and you feel like you are constantly fighting Anthem to pay claims or fixing client information. They don't pay well at all and the benefits they offer their employees are questionable."
bad,Plenty of webinars training the providers of the web. Conference calls resolving billing and claims reconciliation.
bad,your production and quality have to be above 120% in order to maintain a satisfactory employee.
bad,"Very stressful and not very cooperative!!! I loved working with the members, facilities, but the work load was at times very stressful. Adhearance was very hard to met because the employees were layed off and some were left to do the same amount of work."
bad,My job was stable but it was not enjoyable for me. I tried to be transferred to a different position and was unsuccessful. I left the position in November 2019
bad,"For the most part, Anthem was not a bad place to work. Being a call center, the work was pretty steady during most of the day, which made time pass quickly, and the work as fairly standard throughout the day. I enjoyed being able to help the callers The quality of the management staff varied, however, and that led to issues overall. Work/Life balance was difficult to maintain when sudden changes arose and required time away. It called into question whether the company truly cared about their employees as they claimed or were just providing lip service to the concept."
bad,Dull Call Center Work with Low Advancement Opportunity. Pay is low but benefit are good. Good manager that recognizes job's limitations and is flexible.
bad,"If you’re not in upper management, all you need to do is keep your mouth shut and produce. Associates are not respected and senior people look down on us.  Caucasians don’t associate with Blacks for the most part.  Some of these employees don’t need to be working for Medicaid bc they don’t even like Black people.  And Anthem is so-called diverse!"
bad,"I work in the call center. I have never dealt with so much micro managing.  Our every second is accounted for. I'm in provider services,  you have to know A LOT about claims,  especially b/c providers know what they are talking about. The training is a joke. You have to train on the job,  which is extremely stressful. Management in this dept only cares about getting promoted."
bad,"Anthem has introduced the Healthcare Industry to me.  And I have developed a  genuine curiosity and thirst  to learn more.  "
bad,I was not trained properly for the job that I do.  They don't pay enough money for all that we have to do and to be accountable for. They have unrealistic expectations for most of their call center employees. It counts against you if you are approved time off and you don't have PTO time to cover that time. They throw things out for you to learn with no time set aside to learn them. And trust me. It's a lot! This place is not what you would expect. I wouldn't recommend anyone working for them.
bad,it was just allright.  nothing great.  another job.  not much cohesiveness other than that that is required to get the job done.  no special comradery.
bad,I found that this company applied antiquated techniques to a heuristic process by applying unreasonable standards of production. The supervising management used intimidation and micro managing To maintain a 10 application per day expectation that would have been achieved regardless. There is a great deal of morale issues within the credentialing team.
bad,"Fast paced environment working on multiple projects."
bad,"Anthem is a very well known company that has many opportunities.  There is room for growth if you get in the right department under the right management."
bad,Anthem environment was great. The some not all supervisor was nasty and not very smart or knowledgeable about the different program. Great place to eat in house. People are friendly and welcoming. Schedule are flexible. Their were some supervisor that were knowledge and friendly.
bad,"9 year veteran.  Projects and Training are excellent but little to no support from management.  They only want to hear that the projects are green without issues.  Stakeholders value your sincerity but management fears the truth.  The Burger King HR VP came in recently and is eliminating all the benefits that have been offered for years like bonuses, merit increases, PTO accrual, PTO sell, PTO carry over, Work from Home, lunches, parking, professional training, license fees, and annual  membership dues.  They are relocating to Atlanta or Richmond and you have to be willing to relocate.  Fall layoffs are annual and only Yes people will keep their jobs."
bad,"Promotion in my department is easy, because nobody stays. The department is IHM. Don't ever get a lead or regular case manager position in this department."
bad,"typical day at work is answering phone calls,member questions  regarding there benefits,claims. "
bad,"I was hired as an Outreach Care Specialist working in the Behavioral Health department. The work was rewarding, but the number of outbound calls you are required to make is quite high. The number of tasks to complete was just not realistic. Team members often did not help one another, and the work was not spread evenly among the team. Repetitive work that is not for everyone."
bad,"It's all about who you know, they get you in a certain position then things change and there is nothing you can do about it."
bad,Was just OK................................................. too much overhead management levels who just didn't care.
bad,The environment was comfortable.  The benefits are great.  The workload changed day-to-day.  The data entry department was an area that required a lot of concentration to detail.
bad,"I was some how surprised by this company's attention to it's employee's, here are a few examples:  At arriving at job site we noticed very little resources made available to its employees such as no access to printers, and common work material as a stapler, pens, or even coffee."
bad,I have a great manager but things change rapidly with tight deadlines. They do not care about your work life balance. The patient load is high and they don’t care about work flows that make sense. They continue to add tasks and the systems we work out of are horrible. Nothing is user friendly. We recently took a rate decrease for mileage and the insurance premium went up. Hopefully we get a decent raise and bonus this year.
bad,Training is never adequate.  They make it so their reps can never be an expert in one area but that they must know a little bit about everything.  This makes the customer service provided inadequate.  I would rather have learned one job and been able to give amazing service.
bad,No job security. Virtual environment. Power politics. Good flexibility. Constant change in strategy and vision. Never sure of which direction the ship is going.
bad,"Everything revolves around the clock and set quotas.  Get them on and off as quickly as possible, meet your goal.  Time is money.  Thats how it feels. Lunch is 30 min, get stuck on the phone with a client and go into your scheduled lunch, it counts against you and you don't get that time back,  Same with the end of your shift.  Go over and it hurts you.  They want you to help caller but don't help too much or it affects the numbers.  Your time effect the team time, pay bonuses, vacation, even your next schedule bid is based on you review.  Yes, you have to rebid every 6 month for a shift.  So don't do well and you'll get the worst shifts.  That really hard on family life.  Great pay and benefits, you can't transfer to a different job until you have been their a year.  High turn around job.  It wasn't for me."
bad,Appreciated the ability to work from home which contributed to a decent work-life balance. Anthem is a solid company with great benefits.  The company has an excellent work environment.
bad,Its a shame you cant get help in a timely manner being that every dept is Production based. Its becoming more micro managed than as time goes on. The benefits are very good. Ive worked in two locations in VA. The managers are moved around within the same dept at times. Ive worked with and closely with approx 7 managers and only 2 have had managerial skills. The others behave immature and unprofessional with some employees that behave the same. Alot of (secret) relatives here and ALOT of 'cliques' and favorites...if youre not one ..you will know it!  One involved has a higher title over dept. Managers and clearly allows the behavior. Many employees talk about it and has even reported it to HR. They need the higher ups to come as employees how theyre being treated. They know no ones ever coming from the outside to question anything they do. As long as the numbers add up for the company...thats all that seems to matter to Corporate.
bad,"Clock in, check fax queue for clinical, complete nurse logs and fax to facility, check fax queue, create inpatient and outpatient authorizations"
bad,"I enjoyed my job and what I did but unfortunately, it became a hostile work environment due to senior staff making malicious and racist comments to me as well as insensitivity to disabilities. the hardest part of the job was definitely working with my senior staff. I also felt that even though I have a degree and work experience, it was almost impossible to move outside the call center even though I was told during interview that it was easy to move outside"
bad,I would prefer not to review the company as I was only there for a year and a half. My experience was only with my current department and not with the company as a whole.
bad,"Working for this company can be extremely stressful. In my opinion, the compensation was not nearly enough for what I was doing. The job began to take a physical toll on me, to the point I was having panic attacks throughout the day. The managers are all very kind and supportive, but the culture feels very superficial and artificial. During training, we were told the job was very rewarding and you get to leave everyday feeling like you've helped and made a difference to people. That was not the case at all. We were also held to mostly unattainable standards, especially as new hires. We're expected to keep calls under a certain amount of time and are told we have all the resources we need to answer any question. By ""resources"" they meant we could ask other people. However, everyone (understandably) was always busy. So when you did have to ask a question, it would take a while. I was fielding calls from people who were extremely upset (another blatant lie they told us during training -- you'll rarely have to talk to unpleasant people). I personally was not emotionally strong enough to deal with that. It can really get to you when you're spending your day getting screamed at for things you have no control over. Not to mention that insurance is often life-or-death and the content of many calls is truly upsetting. I felt so helpless most of the time because I would listen to people's heartbreaking stories of losing a loved one and then getting hit with huge bills due to something as arbitrary as whether or not the ambulance that was sent to them when they called 911 was in network"
bad,I started at Anthem out of high school and saw a lot of changes both with associates and the insurance market and the business environment.  I spent most of my time as an employee in the membership division and started auditing other employees work after numerous changes in computer technology.  When about half of the auditing staff was let go I took an early retirement
bad,"Formerly WellPoint, Inc., Anthem is a fortune 40-ranked diversified health care company that operates Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in fourteen states."
bad,"Forward moving management style company,  No room for advancement for most positions.  Everything you do has to be perfect.  No review of work by leadership to ensure correct information is provided in reports."
bad,I was in customer services and there was no opportunity to advance and move up in the company.   They had their own cafeteria.
bad,"some care, some don't--should be a better experience with one of the largest employers however lacking in diversity.  HR is a joke."
bad,"I enjoy working customer service and interacting w/different people.  I also enjoy challenges and multi-tasking to accomplish a variety of things.  I'm very open-minded, outgoing and hardworking."
bad,High production in quality and quantity is a must. Unfortunately maintaining both of these perfectly with no error is almost impossible.
bad,Great chance to help people and make a difference. This job requires you to keep to yourself though and it's difficult to keep the job.
bad,good place to work no weekends pay could be better..need to incorporate SOP some rules are not consistent..quarterly bonus which could make up for low pay
bad,"Enrollments for insurance program "
bad,"At least 7  1/2 hours on phone and computer.  I learned all aspects of health insurance along with new Healthcare laws.  I also work for Blue Cross from 1998-2004.  My co-workers and I worked well together, I am all about teamwork.  My direct manager was great...upper management was changing constantly.  The hardest part of my job was if I was not permitted to go to the extent I knew we could to help a client.  Also, management was constantly confused about new Healthcare laws which confused us and our members.  The best days at work were when I could help each and every customer  to the point that hey were happy."
bad,"Great job for college students looking to gain work experience, but not for seasoned workers it's like starting from the bottom again."
bad,"While I was with them, it was nice having a cafeteria and a gym in the facility, but not everyone was privileged to those perks. The other problem is that it was very far away from me."
bad,"Good environment to work"
bad,"Clean, neat office environment. Eventual room for advancement."
bad,"I enjoyed my co-workers, the paid was low and micro-managed"
bad,This job is good for someone who likes to sit at a desk for 8 hours or more talking on the phone. It is a demanding job that requires a lot out of you. In a lot of aspects it is a sales job. Employees are the most miserable I have ever worked with in my career. There is also a high turn over of staff and the employer does not seem to want to improve the environment to increase retention. 
bad,"Pros"
bad,The culture is in flux today. The culture is changing a lot due to new leadership with management. There are lots of change at the leadership ranks. It will get better over time.
bad,"Get your running shoes on!  I realize there is a lot of work to be done, however, good orientation is key to success.  This company crams a lot of new things in your face at one time with minimal explanation and expects success with no investment in the employee."
bad,Upper management never gave input on how you are doing in your position. Training was boring and was never followed up. Things always changed and no one was advised of changes.
bad,"i've worked in several different departments within anthem and they have all been extremely stressful environments, in which it is clear that leadership do not care about their employees"
bad,"The work environment is unstructured and chaotic. No one cares how the work gets done, as long as it is done. This company is so far behind time, until it isn't funny. They won't purchase an imaging system. Management is poor."
bad,"The Managers are great, however the pay we receive is not atypical to the job we perform. we deal with claims and benefits for providers that call in, however the information we receive from our client changes so much that its extremely hard to keep up with everything. Client will change their expectations and not tell us that they have changed until 3/4 months down the line"
bad,Anthem is a great place to work if you don't mind being called an idiot everyday.  The pay was great and the manager was awesome but you are really not trained properly for the job you are hired to do.  You get 12 weeks of training on things you barely use once you hit the floor.   The supervisors show unwillingness to help you be successful so it's basically trial and error.
bad,"My job was meeting with internal clients and writing code, spend time on call. The teaching side I loved because it allowed more freedom to do what needed to be done but not something everyone else did."
bad,"Trying to do your best for members seems impossible, between the greed on the insurance company and providers wanting to be greedy it created a difficult time for our members."
bad,A typical day at anthem was a little hectic because the department I worked in would receive other calls that we wasn't trained on there package .  If you had a difficult call after seven the customer would want to speak with someone like the manager but there was only a lead on the floor
bad,"I enjoyed working with customers, but I felt a lot of pressure from the staff. There were also A LOT of changes made daily. One rule would be made and the next day it could be changed. If you did not do the change immediately, you were reprimanded for not checking your emails. You were expected to check them daily for changes. The call volume was so high that it was hard to check your emails quickly. There were at least 20 emails a day. Usually MUCH MUCH more."
good,Call center quota versus customer service.
good,"Leaving soon, my current manager is inconsiderate and definitely show favoritism.  The hours are great can work 630-930 but the pay is horrible compared to the competitors."
good,"After working at Anthem for 4 years, I have found that there is little accountability enforced from leadership.  Decisions that Senior Leadership make are not in the best interest of the members, but in the best interest of the Anthem success as a company in the top ten of healthcare."
good,Anthem was a good place to work for.  They gave me the background with Medicare and how Medicare works.  I'm now able to tell family and friends when to apply for Medicare and the process and I am able to advise about the secondary insurance needed to fit their needs.
good,Anthem is a good company to work for the most par. Employes go far and above to help make this company a success. We work as a tem no atter what to gt the job done.
good,"Lacks morale, needs a major overhaul. The health benefits and 401k are good but not great. The best part about my experience with this company was training new hires. I was able to contribute to their success and even some I've seen move up within the company."
good,"this company for the most part is alright, however with new management has fallen by the wasteside"
good,Typical 8 hr day. I built upon my customer service skills here. I learned to multi task more and build a knowledge of health insurance and the claims process.
good,Very bad upper management. They lay off hardworking and sincere people just because they do not advertise them selves to upper management. Pay and compensation is very bad.
good,"Anthem took on new sub-projects which make the foundation of the IT Support weak. Too many different applications to support, with different names and difficult to keep up to date."
good,12-14 hours per day.   I'm located in Texas and managed the WV Medicaid contract.  My director Manager was located in Virginia Beach and managed the NY Medicaid contract.  Direct manager had no idea of my job duties supporting WV Health Plan. Limited travel budget and non-interest by my manager I was not allow me to travel to WV for necessary State meetings. Limited opportunity to build face to face relationships with the State of WV and the Health Plan.
good,This company mostly seems to use temporary employees. It takes about one year or more to be hired directly if employed that way.
good,The most management teams micro manage. No encouragement and rare kudos but often criticizes team. Managers cater to favorites and do not allow all employees opportunities for growth
good,"Was an ok place to work at first once you got through training, when you got on production all the company worried about was meeting goals, there is alot of favoritism there. The pharmacy member was the worst. And if you did above and beyond they still gave you a bad survey. Quality was always hard to pass and they changed expectations daily"
good,They teach and encourage people to bully. Management is never qualified and always have something to prove. They do nothing about questionable ethics.
good,just ok company.  Benefits are very poor for a healthcare company and pay is not equitable to market. With the right leadership and diversity in place things can shift in a positive direction.
good,But...leaders above Director are IMHO poor and have no real leadership ability.  Management from them is essentially via fear and coercion.  WAY to many projects moving at the same time requiring the same technical staff to be on multiple projects.
good,"Health plan advisors are brought in for a short stint to aid Anthem customers with enrollment to new plans. It's known that the position is temporary, but the end date is literally whenever they want to release you. It's so sudden, you'll be working a normal day and then there's an impromptu meeting where they ask the entire room to turn in their badges and go collect things from their desk and leave."
good,"Anthem is a great company overall, but working for the Medicaid department isn't as beneficial as other departments. Other representatives are great and helpful, but there is a lag with the supervisors and managers. The supervisors run from duties and manager overlook and excuse a lot. "
good,"Not recommended as they make false accusations and don't include you in any investigations. Not a good practice, certain departments are also very clicky."
good,Management is not good at all in the LTSS department. I didn't like the way you start your work with lack of training. Overall I wouldn't work in the LTSS department a all.
good,Anthem has been involved in a lot of change as has much of its competetion. Work that can be sent off shore- from nursing to customer service.lots of management. Sedentary job. Co-workers are hard- working and feel silenced by mint
good,"answerphones .copy, and right fax for the hedis review. We also send mail to offices requesting their  information so the records can get audit for the insurance purposes"
good,"worked Mon-Fri with extended hours at times; no weekends or holidays. learned about health plan managed care. communication poor from management and upper leadership; hardest part of the job was the poor communication and constant clarification via email and lync messenger; most enjoyable part of the job were the co-workers. Many times, processes were clarified through my own inquiries with departments and rarely with management."
good,Great Experience to advance in real customer service skills
good,Too many layoffs. There are layoffs 3 times a year then rehire same positions. I liked the work I did just no security. Lots of projects delayed by bad requirements and overpriced consultants.
good,"The only good about working for AIM is the aspects that are passed down from the parent company Anthem (401K, PTO, Insurance, Etc.)"
good,"The typical day at work is very stressful.  I have learned a lot at Anthem.  Your experience will vary due to who you have as a manager.  Management is the worse, communication isnt good.  Not all managers are bad, not all jobs are bad.  Depends on management."
good,"The new CEO is doing the best she can, however, there are so many top and mid level executives that aren't fit to lead that it's an uphill battle.  Not to say they are bad people necessarily, just that leading is not a skill everyone has or can develop."
good,"ive been here over a year. have good stats, dont miss time, and im always here on time. not only have i never received a raise, but my schedule has gotten worse than when i first arrived. there seems to be more signs of favoritism and ""who you know"" going on. instead of giving the people who work hard their due. Pay is sufficient if you dont have any bills or a life. And if your trying to attend school you might as well quit. because they do not care about you wanting to advance yourself."
good,"Anthem has the potential to be an excellent place of employment however, due to Management, and minimum  room for advancement, it makes it very hard to want to stay and work for a company that you give your all too but get nothing in return. I love helping people & interacting with people of all facets, and I am very good at customer service. However when team moral is low and the enviornment is negative,  it makes it hard to do want to come in a do the job you know you can do!"
good,Anthem was a great career for me but the ACA forced them to downsize their executive team of which I was a casualty.  They also should have taken better care of me on elimination of my role given what I built and delivered for them in the 15 years I was there.
good,"In a typical day, you check the ticket board and emails to resolve users which all of them are servers admin issues. I learned how to work with McAfee ePO Whitelisting. All co-workers are nice and friendly, there is no hard part about this job."
good,Many changes over the years as the company went from being located in Virginia to having merged with companies in 14 states. Challenges with business not co-located.
good,"Micromanaging nurses in a call center environment, the most basic of breaks, little time to interact face-to-face with employees, very political- watch your back or wear Kevlar- reverse discrimination, little to no advancement unless you are ""chosen"" and male"
good,"This job was through a third party company, HCL America, that really did not treat its employees fairly. Also, due to job failures and blatant disrespect to female employees, the person supervising me was dismissed 6 weeks after I left the company."
good,"Nice sit down nursing job if you want to live in cubicle land and answer the phone all day. Nice orientation but supervisors don't want to help after it's over. Callers are usually providers looking for approval for procedures and are not very nice on the other end of the line. I suppose I would be mad too if I was waiting up to two hours to get through to someone. Every thing is tied into the phone line so when you have to go to the bathroom, take a break, or go to lunch supervisors know exactly how long you are gone and will let you know if you are even a minute late! You get report cards to show you how you are doing and there is a quota they want you to reach for phone calls."
good,"Better be part of the good old boys club.  It is very clicky!!!  Get ready to see grown adults act like they are still in highschool.  "
good,"learned the health insurance business in and out. "
good,a day spent checking the balances and making sure the numbers on an individuals account was correct. Co- workers were willing to help with any questions that you may have had. The management had a hands off relationship and wanted you to come to them if you had any questions. The hardest part of the job was keeping track of your breaks and lunches as this was very important to management.
good,"Not a good place to work, over worked and under paid and micro management as well as a very elementary work environment did not allow for growth or opportunity. Not a very good place to work in the long run or was a place you would want to move around in."
good,Had really amazing management until the last couple years of employment. Manager didn't know how to manage employees and wasn't fair or allowing the great employees to advance their careers.
good,I am able to work from home.  Limited opportunities to get to know co-workers.
good,Good place to work. Training was ok. Not much opportunity for advancement.
good,Compensation rather disappointing. CEO's get HUGE bonus's while we are told there is no money in the budget.
good,"My co-workers are awesome, hard working people. A typical day consists of taking phone calls from BCBS members regarding medical benefits, physician and facility bills. Explaining coverage regarding medical procedures. I have learned so much about medical insurance and the processing of medical claims. The most enjoyable part of the day is knowing that I helped someone."
good,"Depending on your current job title and which division you're in, there are promotional opportunities for high performers.  The overall caliber of people working there is very high - I've had three previous employers and there is no comparison."
good,"Production standards and goal were not realistic"
good,They hire managers with no healthcare insurance experiences rather than promote people within that are qualified with years of experience especially people of color.
good,"When I started I was filled with hope and promise. I had an amazing benefit package and was moving through the ranks. Even under a tyrant of a manager I was often given duties that were fun and allowed me to be creative. I also was able to assist in other areas that allowed me to learn and take on new duties expanding my knowledge and work diversity at Anthem. However, the money was soon not enough and I was stalled because I had reached my maximum in my title and department. I had to be promoted and move out of my department. "
good,Decent place to work if you don’t have kids or family obligations. Do not get sick there or you will lose your job. Certain management pick and choose who they like.
good,"Worked as a consultant not full time, so I would not know about the management. The work was stressful in general and tasks were always changing in the middle. Leadership was terrible where I worked."
good,"it was a breath of fresh air once i left, management for provider care will micromanagement every move an employee makes. and will make it known that its there way or the high way"
good,"While speaking with the leadership team, most of them have expressed that advancing with the company is very attainable.While working in the medicaid department, I feel that the systems are too inefficient and complicated to help the members quickly and accurately."
good,"Great place I thought, great location in STL Downtown, you get great insurance and many benefits. They give you free parking for Hocky and Baseball games."
good,When working in a call center for Anthem I felt like a prisoner.  My manager was very sweet but new and did not stick up for her employee's. There were NO exceptions given ever for any type of absences and once you were there if you had to leave you were going to be dinged for it.  Never worked in an environment like that.  There was no career path to follow and you are not given promotions or raises on your anniversary just when they do annual reviews during second quarter. The pay there is below the cost of living standards.
good,management takes advantage  if they see the opportunity . politics and favoritism dont allow you to shine.  you're treated and paid better if your family works there
good,Anthem was decent. I definitely learned a lot. Not a great work environment and management did not really care for you like they said they did. Occasionally you would be rewarded for your hard work.
good,"Management micromanages, and there is little to no support from upper management/department directors. The position is 100% telecommute however management insisted that employees physically go into the office frequently."
good,"Hedis Report Retrieval. A huge learning curve including numerous online medical courses of which personal scores had to be within 90-100% before learning the numerous software programs for Anthem Blue Cross.  Facilitator responsibilities included record retrieval for all California hospital remote access, laboratories, medical facilities, veterans facilities and special situations.  Our team was responsible for record retrieval for 50,000 records at a 98% success rate."
good,"No structure to the organization, MA benefits are investments from stakeholders but no strategic plan to ensuring their investment for long-term sustainability."
good,"A typical work day has become very stressful. Volumes and inventory are high. Management is micro managing, doesn't care about the employee (just the numbers) and their is very poor communication. However, the benefits are great, the coworkers are great, and the job itself is great. It's the management that drives people away."
good,Anthem is very political.  It seems that when someone has VP behind their name they know more than the people who are really doing the work know.  Especially when they have only been with the company less than two years.
good,Anthem is an ok place to work for me needing stability it just cant work as a temp for how ever long they will have you with no paid time off. I need something to call my place of business with job security
good,"Ask for more money, even if you have to ask more than once.  Bonuses are low and quarterly.  Mondays are the busies days and job responsibilities are increasing while pay is remaining the same."
good,"My job was dealing with complaints from provider and members. My co workers were helpful and friendly. My manager wasn't around much but my immediate supervisor was great! "
good,"Very nice place to work but the dept. I was assigned to work."
good,Its Good to work here and culture. A typical day at work  and need to  work hard. Need to prepare the things for  uncertainty. Its like every other company
good,The training you receive for this job in no way prepares you for the calls you will take. Gossip in the office was terrible. If you want to succeed you come to work and mind your own business. Job description changed drastically and was brought in more duties with no more pay and no training after 6 months. I only met my actual supervisor 3 times in almost 2 years.
good,Anthem is a great company with many great benefits to their employees. The downside to Anthem is the advancement from entry level or transferring to other departments is very challenging and management says they promote growth within however that is not what really happens.
good,"On my project, I found that most people simply didn't do their jobs and were unavailable during most of the work day (all worked remotely)."
good,It's a fairly alright contract. Got to learn a few things but not a lot. Co-workers are nice however the project management needs to be improved and more organized.
good,"Overall in the right department, this is a good company to work for. Always new things to learn for career growth. Most managers are fair and professional. Great co-workers."
good,they have lots of turn over at this company. unstable for career oriented person. the co-workers were great. Management was weak. Leadership was weak.
good,"The ""front-line"" folks are some of the nicest, hardest-working, caring, and ethical people I have ever had the privilege of meeting."
good,"Anthem tries to make sure they put the customers first. They have high turn-over because the do not create a positive work environment, "
good,The worst part of the job was watching co-workers being let go while our jobs went to India or the Phillipines...and then it was my turn.
good,"Very clicky and they burn thru contractors. Old style popularity contest in order to get hired permanent. I was warned by many before I went there on contract, now I know the rumors are all true. Heavily female dominated. Not male friendly. In my area upchain, 5 of the 6 VPs were female. 70% of the team was female. run by touchy/feely/emotional types. not a place for a person with a solid technical background. more a place for biddness degree types."
good,"I have not been happy since being hired full time. Tons of work, very little pay. They squeeze the employees for everything and then let them go during the holidays."
good,Ultimately it was an OK place to work...just do have any health issues or emergency situations.
good,"Authorized surgery, procedures, diagnostics. best part of job very casual attire"
good,"I received inbound telephone calls to assist customers with concerns regarding insurance premium payments, benefits, network providers, eligibility, claims, and any additional documentation. Operate a PC/image station to obtain and extract notes; information, activities and changes made to member accounts. Research and analyze data to address operational challenges and customer service issues. Thoroughly document inquiry intakes for accurate tracking and analysis. Develops and maintains positive customer relations and coordinates with various functions within the company to ensure customer requests and questions are handled appropriately and in a timely manner."
good,"Morale is low here. The worst thing going on right now is downsizing, but the company does not hide it's political agenda, and the the practices they are employing are cheap ploys to save them some short term cash for stockholders. There is no loyalty and certain departments live in constant fear. As I was around prior to Wellpoint purchasing Empire Blue Cross, going from a non-profit to for profit has fundamentally changed the focus of what we all do as well as devalued our contributions."
good,"A typical work day would include taking up to 80+ calls from customer service members and working on the required continuing education goals or self improvement goals. The co-workers are pleasant. However, management may seem pleasant but has not gained any trust from employees."
good,Overall good company to work for. Lots of opportunities if you have the right management team. This company can be a great company if they were not so focused on numbers.
good,"I currently work here a TEMP position and the description of my job was very unclear. Once I got onto the floor there were a lot of customer calls that I handled and I didn't even know how to navigate in the system to see how to help customers with their problems. I also had to confide in myn neighbors for answers on EVERY call for the first two weeks, we did have a chat that had managers and O.E's (operations experts) but it was useless with over 100+ agents in the chat and we were on live calls while we asked for help and nobody answered our questions. And members were on hold for sometimes 30 mins or even longer due to the fact that no one would answer our questions. I also have a temp assignment for 3 months, I have about less than a month left of this assignment I have not heard anything from ANTHEM managers or from my agency about if I will be accepted for a permanent positon or whats my next step for finding another job? Most agents are rude when you ask for help. And most agents have insulted me due to the fact I was only trained on the basics (ID cards, change of address and insurance verifications)."
good,"Flexible working hours"
good,I came in through a temp agency. When I did the interview it went well. However when I got there it was stated it was a 3 month contract..cool. I enjoyed much of my time at Anthem but there was a lack of empathy as I was going through a domestic violence situation & I missed 3 days that was documented with police reports & I was still let go. If applying there make sure you have no LIFE & can fully commit to answering benefit questions.
good,"I moved from FL to GA and sought out to work for Anthem. From the beginning the hiring process was very slow. Then the compensation was a disappointment. This Dept did not look at my years of experience nor considered it when offering me the position. Then once starting the job, there was no involvement from management or team mates. You practically governed "
good,"Overall its a great vompany to work for, but I can honestly say that the culture is very much about the people who have put in time their and yhey look down on others even to the point of bullying."
good,I was lied to when I applied for the job. I was told that I would receive much more money in commission due to company leads. This was not the case...
good,"Work from home opportunities.  Decent compensation.  Good PTO time.  Favoritism flourishes, some management not very knowledgable of what departments do."
good,you wont advance if you are great at what you do because there will be a lazy person with 20 years seniority who will file a grievance to get the job. management knows very little about the work and leads are not consistent with their knowledge.
good,"Pay was great. Very high volume of inbound calls. No floor leadership to assist with difficult questions a caller my present over the phone. With a lack of floor leadership, the call duration often id adversly impacted."
good,"The work load was sometimes difficulty to manage. The performance rating system is difficult to complete and understand. I don't feel you get a fair shake on your actual duties. My department is so career advancement goal oriented, but no where to move up to! Manager was terrible and very non-supportive. No feedback given. Only your mistakes are pointed out. The salary is not fair compared to years of experience.  Work at home was great! Hated working in a cube at the office!  This company is so results focused and you are constantly bombarded with ways to cut down on days authorized that is crazy! Very difficult to do your job. Get reprimanded for asking too many questions!"
good,it is an ok place to work.  a lot of unpaid overtime if you want to complete your job correctly.  multistate licensure is often very difficult and they lay off without notice.
good,"The job I accepted was not accurately presented to me. I was a Director in name only but functionally an Analyst. The work was not fulfilling and at times insulting, people were not valued, and I really learned almost nothing during my time there. Our turn over was around 50% due to bad leadership, systems and processes and a surprisingly low potential for career development and growth. I would not and did recommend others to work in Anthem FP&A."
good,"Anthem is a good company to work for if you get the right manager. Unfortunately, I've gotten two mediocre managers back to back, so I am unable to advance any further in the company."
good,There are pros and cons to Anthem. The reorging can drive you mad. You never have the same manager for long. And there are always threats that the WH office is closing and we'll all be laid off.
good,"Typical of days at work Very stress."
good,"Typical work day was slow paced, hours not desirable. holiday time off was only maybe 5 hours biweekly. Overall, ok place to work. Not a huge option to advance in skills"
good,nothing to say about this company. To be honest I find it strange that Indeed requires a review of every company we have worked for. This is obviously information that I do not want to give!
good,"self-paced lack of motivation in between calls, no straight answers from managers overall work environment toxic from backstabbers and employee gossipers management out of loop with staff"
good,"As a customer service advocate, our commitment was to handle a first call resolution to all customers so that they did not have to call back in for issues.  Unfortunately, that was not allowed.  When their were calls in queue, we were available to assist with no time to research customers' resolutions.  It was disheartening.  Also, when a member asked for a supervisor, out policy was to not allow someone else on the phone even if they were ""available"".  "
good,I do not want to bash them but the customers are rude but some how every bad survey or feedback from them is your fault. They record the calls and the management knows how rude they can be but it is still always a bad reflection on you. Not fair in this type of industry.
good,"I was hired to do a special project, when that was completed I was put on Outpatient review team that was being started.  I was then assigned to review all Autism cases for Ca.  The company had no policies or procedures for this.  My supervisor was located in an office in a different part of the state from me.  I was very isolated while in the office and after 3 years I was transferred to a  remote worker and worked from home."
good,"There has been a lot of change and the culture is trying to keep up.  Communication could be better at Anthem as most times, we hear updates from the street prior to any internal communications being broadcast.  Most communications are held tightly at the ELT level and leadership could definitely be better.  Compensation and even our health benefits could be much better to attract and retain talent."
good,"Anthem Medicaid Dept."
good,"Horrible benefits and compensations."
good,Cannot move forward as moves are blocked by Management and freezes are  put in place without notifying staff. Management favorites are chose to go home to work who have not met metrics.
good,"Can be a stressful work environment. Good discount on healthcare benefits. Good health and wellness incentives. Good pto benefits, flexible schedule to align with family life."
good,Average place to work. Upper management is out of touch with workers.  Company holidays have been reduced over the last 10 years.  Low hiring rate for CA employees.
good,"Good Work/Life Balance, but no career advancement, lack of training, and no consistency as to how to handle cases. A lot of incompetency across the board, especially in upper management. Too much oversight from management and not enough autonomy to move forward with cases. "
good,the company is thriving management is condescending and unprofessional. No room for advancement unless you code switch and be disingenuous. Great benefits.
good,"Lots of hard working people in the technology area.  Culture appears to be changing and remote positions are being told to come into the office so if you are looking for a remote IT position, this won't be available as was offered in the past. Please note that all positions require commutes to downtown Atlanta. Offices are described as collaborative, so no real cubical walls."
good,"Health care and health insurance along with the federal implemented laws are changing on a daily basis. You must be the type of person who keeps yourself informed on government legislation, news, mandates and computer software. There is room to grow if you are under the age of 40."
good,"not interested in providing a review "
good,I lasted a few weeks. I can't  deal with cliques and lazy supervisors who play Pokémon  all day.  Now I plan to go to a different  dept no Small Group.
good,"Easy to advance , but layoffs happen every few months and its not easy to get back in. "
good,I loved my job at Anthem.  I am blessed to have been a part of some incredible teams at Anthem.  I have learned more than I could list in this limited amount of space.
good,I would not recommend working for Anthem through a temp agency. I worked for almost a year. The point system is horrible.
good,"Fine to work for.  Just not the right fit for me.  Good manager.  Good job but it was just not the right fit from the start."
good,"The leaders in some of the Atlanta, GA office are very controlling and do not allow employee creativity to propel the company to a higher competitive level."
good,"I like my job and what I do but the company that I work for or should I say the department that I work for is not family oriented at all. I have been there for almost three years with the same schedule. I now have two kids that are in school and I would love to be there to help with homework and get them in bed at a decent  hour but my schedule does not permit that. The only good part about my job is the bonus that we get at the beginning of the year. The pay is ok, it could be better. People think that because I work for a Fortune 500 company everything is all glitter....it's not and my health insurance will be going up about 4% Jan. 2016."
good,"they are monday - friday which is excellent"
good,Not a bad place to work? The company needs more update systems in place. No real diversity and no rom for advancement. All lateral moves through company.
good,"Call center for health insurance in Richmond. The job wasn't a difficult one....it got very busy at certain points of the year but nothing out of the ordinary for the line of business."
good,The job itself is enjoyable. The company needs to be more organized. Management don't have a good idea how to manage.
good,"Was a strong corporation at one point, too many changes in the 2000 decade; all downhill from there."
good,Its was an okay to get by with.....they need to hire a verity of cultures. They bathrooms were nasty.
good,They hire managers without experience for the job they are going to be working. You are a number not a person. They continue to lay off hardworking people and replace them with contractors they don't have to pay much or give benefits to or they ship the jobs to India. No more company freebees.
good,"Answering phone calls, processing claims, and assisted with trainer for new hire training."
good,"Nice working enviorment but stressful at times. i love my job very much, but need more benefits"
good,Typical large corporation whose concern is the bottom line.
good,"From the go it started out nice but then thrown on floor where favoritism  took its toll, people where nice management made you feel disposable and where not empathetic ."
good,A typically work day is filled with employees stressing about rather or not this will be there lass day because of surveys that not gauge the true element of the customer care that was giving or the unrealistic training.
good,They were very good on hiring diverse candidates. I enjoyed being able to work with people from very different cultures. They do a great job of making everyone feel comfortable. I felt like upper management tended to hire friends with no experience from outside of the company over qualified individuals within the company. So the advancement track was very challenging at times.
good,"Good jobs, benefits and pay. Culture is pretty toxic. Hostility, bullying and favoritism is pretty prevalent, so you have to have thick skin  and be able to defend yourself, as senior management doesn’t address the environment."
good,The company has the backs and takes the side of management whether they are right and wrong. I literally brought racism and discrimination to their attention and they basically said it was justified.
good,Poor training process. Expectations are impossible to meet doing a 40 hour work week. Most people worked at minimum 55 hours a week. Very poor management
good,"Anthem has taught me that situations are different for different members. Resolution that is adequate for one member may not be sufficient for another member. There are cut and dry issues, however, I seem to thrive with the difficult resolutions and welcome research and investigation to make sure members get the service they deserve."
good,Nurses sit in a cubicle and a dialer send you calls all day. This is not case management. This is telemarketing! Case management gives you a case load and allows the nurse to manage it. On this job a dialer send you all kinds of calls all day! They give you a 30 min break and the cafeteria is so far away if you want to eat on your floor so you want be late on the dialer you really have about 15-20 mins if you need to use the restroom dont eat!
good,"Very short training it was only one week of training , it was kind of learn as you go. Management wasn't always the most helpful at times but overall it was an okay place to work"
good,"u/r, case management, license renewals for all 50 states, maintain mandated CEU's for position, not enough hours in a day/week to complete all tasks. Upper Management does not support lower management of teams within the company"
good,It could be a whole lot better but they do things backwards. A lot of favortism. Either you're in or you are out. It could be a lot better environment.
good,Its a large It org and comes with all the benefits and issues. Old IBM shop - you either like that or hate it (I hate it). Lots of meetings ... lots of teams spread around the world. Lots of wasted time.  At a time when many companies are having people work from home Anthem is going the other way !!!!
good,"This company is good for a starter, but try not to get wrpped up in the job. After a short while becomes stressful and you are viewed as numbers. Typical day is getting to your desk logging into the phone and start taking calls; socializing or getting to know your coworkers is frowned upon. Some managers are awesome others are non human-like. Hardest part is being able to give great customer service with in time matrix given. Most enjoyable part was knowing you are helping others and the people you may have actually bonded with while at work."
good,"I cannot say anything at this time as I was one of the 962 long term employees whose role was spontaneously terminated.  I can say that the company is being restructured and unstable at this time,  and morale is extremely low.  I wish the old Anthem still existed."
good,"The position I have is okay. Pay is decent for the barre minimum but you will live pay check to pay check."
good,"I had the only good manager there, very corporate, just a number, pay raises are minimal at best, really hard to promote or move positions within the company."
good,"To advance you need to butter up management rather than advancing due to your skills and knowledge. Worked 9 years and assisted the department in every which way: long hours, weekend, even helped other departments yet advancing into management was impossible. The favored reps maintain those positions not the skilled."
good,"There is no work life balance, discrimination and bullying are prominent "
good,Inconsistent with company policies.  I think there is issues with management as far as weather you are their click or not in some departments.  I think if you get to with the right department it is great place to work.  They have some of the best benefits.
good,Great company to work for. I had a great time working there over the last 3 11/2 years. I would recommend the job to others that in the healthcare field.
good,As Clinical Quality Audit Analyst I am out in the field meeting meeting with providers and their staff. I work with them to improve their quality of care and meet HEDIS standards. I also have multiple meetings in the office and try to mmanage both.
good,"Nice place to work, but the hours are long and didn't end until 7PM each night.  The department suffered due to management refusing to replace key positions."
good,"The environment with co-workers at Anthem was very attentive, however, once I was hired there was no one to train the new hires.. The department only provided someone from Human Resources to start the training and then after the first two day the entire class was left to explore there computer system on their own with modules that were never explained and the employees were left to learn the system on their own.."
good,"At Anthem you are glued to a phone 90% of the time taking 75-110 calls per day. The management monitors your computer screen, phone calls and bathroom breaks. If you're gone longer than expected they will send you a message asking why it took you so long to return to your phone"
good,"The most stressful job I've ever had , if you are exempt employee - no question that you must work EXTRA hours every day; very low compensation ;  poor management ; enormous work load"
good,"Anthem is a great company.  They will invest in their employees if you work in the right department.  If you are being offered a position as a Health Program Representative in the enrollment dept, tread lightly.  This position is metrics driven and requires tough skin.  With this job you are harassing their members, trying to convince them into signing up for a program that they don't want.  I can honestly say the pay is above average, but the amount of stress that comes with it might not be worth it.  I would say not to take this position unless you are into clueless management, favoritism, and unwanted or needed stress."
good,Company is undergoing a lot of changes based on changes in healthcare industry.  Changes in state regulations as well as federal healthcare reform require the company to work to position itself in the new market.
good,Just from being a rep here for the past almost three years I have found that this company will slide through the cracks the best way they can. Since I have been here I have had more things added to my title with no type of compensation for it. I do the job of 5 reps and am only being paid for one job. This is a very stressful job that provides good benefits but your deductible makes it hard to use. I have been having to see a psychiatrist and am medicated due to this job. Not a bad company it's just a health risk working here
good,"The offices are very quiet. Once I arrived in the morning, there was a que with accounts waiting to be worked, or claims to be processed, in/out bound calls."
good,"This is the meat and potatoes of Anthem. Keeping Members (insured employees of employers, who are the clients) happy means a lot of pressure one a moment-by-moment basis."
good,Not bad could be better has its moments there is no growth potential for people who do not want to be in management. Company could be better has been a lot of ups and downs.
good,"Entry level positions are not paid at a livable wage. Can take years to advance. Level II paid livable wage, as long as your do overtime. Most of IT are brought over from India. Major outsourcing approx. 2 years ago to the Philippines. Not necessarily a lot of job security with that in mind. Benefits are great and affordable. Decent commuting benefits. Up to $5,000.00 tuition reimbursement. On-site gym at most facilities. Hard to get fired, unless use up your UTO's. A good chunk of the employees have been there over 15 years, have no marketable skills and are living comfortably.  Temps are paid, on average, over $5 more than permanent employees. Starting salary for Cust. Care Rep. I $14.82, no negotiating."
good,"horrible to employees, not considerate. expect you to work Saturdays with a 48hr notice not realizing some employess are not able to come in due to they have children."
good,"At one point Anthem was a really good place to work.  As time went on it became bottom line oriented and turned into the typical ""Corporate America"" where the stock price drove every decision with little regard to whether or not those decisions made sense."
good,The work was not hard but management made it a bad place to work. I loved taking care of the patients and working with the other medical assistants. I wouldn't go back though
good,"I have seen from the ground level to middle management. I can honestly say Anthem has a major disconnect between its departments. Membership has a positive and well structured learning and working environment. As a customer facing department, this was my best experience with Anthem. The internal working departments has little communication with the customer facing, and many of the production based units are driven by a negative inspiration for work ethic. Many of these internal units will impose a metric for expected completion as normal, though the goal is determined by a curve of current performance. This creates a negative aspect for new processors, and establishes an elitism of the veteran processors."
good,"Trigon was a well managed local company.   First 10 years of Anthem/WellPoint started to slip but still good people.  By 2015 people can't wait to leave, all worried about job cuts."
good,Anthem is a great starter job for someone that may be looking to step into the working field or may not know what they would like to do career wise.
good,Working in Customer Service at Anthem had its good days and bad days. The company is unorganized. They offer no training opportunities for college graduates to assist them with career advancement within the organization.
good,Most of the directors and managers are horrible when it comes to building employee moral and lack basic managerial skills. The company is impersonal and only care about the bottom line/profit. A lot of unhappy and stressed out employees along with unhappy consumers.
good,Needs a complete over haul of all levels of management. Concise polices and procedures. and merit  pay incentives based on performance and not just on management approval.
good,"Great starting point for learning about the healthcare insurance. receives inbound calls from members not really sure of what their insurance benefits are, I would educate members on different plans"
good,I enjoyed my position assisting member but not a fan of how the company does bonuses(not really a bonus at all) the attendance policy is a perfect way to get anyone out the door very quickly .50 occurrance for one minute lat coming in on either 15 minute break and lunch
good,This place could become easily stressful depending on the team that you will be working for. The company is technically far behind.
good,Not enough pay for the amount work that is required. No job security and you are promised things that never happen..That is all that I have to say
good,"Anthem is a good foot in the door for insurance; a great place to work if you need something entry level or a little beyond and want to have the opportunity for advancement. Anthem is also a good place to work for more professional applicants: gives you range to work (independently as well at times), letting you make the most of your opportunity with minimal to moderate supervision. A typical day for being paid by the hour includes two 15 minute breaks and a half hour lunch that is not paid by the company. The benefits are excellent as Anthem has a competitive benefits package, and there are cafeterias and perhaps even a fitness area onsite. If you are attempting to rise towards Management within your Department, it may be next to impossible in doing so, regardless of how well you do or how well you are liked. Also beware: in the past Anthem has made business acquisitions and adopted the policies and way of doing things of the brands that they have acquired, causing your Dept to change systems and adopt policies that seemed to work just fine in the past. But overall, I have known quite a few people that have had long careers with Anthem, and you could go far if you really apply yourself, but it may take a few changes in Departments to get there."
good,"You always have help from OE not from your manger really , my manager didnt know much . Wasnt a stressful job although changes were made that they had no notice of and it seem like every week we had tons of members calling it because they were switched to our plan and dr doesnt accept the insurance and was upset ."
good,"Overall the company is great at promoting better health to employees, however management is bad in several areas."
good,"Limited advance for promotion and advancement."
good,"This information will be made available, but only upon request.  I worked in several offices and traveled extensively."
good,Nothing special although if you are good the phone won't stop ringing while those not good get same compensation
good,"managers were not open minded and were not understanding. never received the proper help, no responses to any questions."
good,Generally a good company to work for in terms of life balance.  The Outsourcing of most of its customer services though has  client abrasion which in turn caused a high turnover rate.
good,Alright place to work.  I was permanently laid off after a year and a half of employment.
good,"Don't come here looking for a career, but they have a great training program, nice co-workers, and everybody is willing to help when you need it."
good,Although I love my job or working with people and helping them with whatever healthcare quesions they may have or urgent enrollment issues I feel that it is an unstable place to work.  I was layed off from Blue Cross once and unfortunately it can happen to anyone.  Everyone is expendible no matter how good at your job you are.
good,"Very difficult company to work for, they are very micro managed. You don't have the chance to get to know co-workers or management. No advancement is available. You are expected to give 100% plus but they don't allow the time and training needed to do the job to the fullest."
good,"I enjoyed my job with Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Virginia. When to company merged with Wellpoint, the culture and working environment changed. Employees were loooked upon and treated as the company greates asset. This phrase was listed on cups, posters, and tee-shirts. Once Anthem merged with Wellpoint this phrase was no longer used and employees no longer believed it."
good,This company is outsourcing like crazy. The benefits are GREAT. Management depend on who your manager is. It is very stressfull.
good,"used to be a good place to work but with so many changes, not a good place to work"
good,"One thing I've learned is that although the company enforces a ""non-retaliation"" policy, the truth is that adherence to that policy is dependent upon the associate's manager or director."
good,"Middle of the road employer.  Average compensation and benefits compared to other large employers in the area.  VERY HIGH deductible for all employee insurance plans.  You make your own way as far as job advancement is concerned, but it depends on which department you are working, not all are the same.  Some managers very proactive with employee engagement, some not so much."
good,"Anthem is a great company and employs a diverse group of very skilled people. Management changes frequently which is a constant diversion. Pay and benefits are on the low side, but working from home makes it a good job."
good,Management has no idea what they're doing. The hired people off the hospital floor to do a start-up on the insurance side. These people have never heard of Utilization Management or Drgs.There is lots of favortism. If you do come from the insurance industry and speak on something you are resented and targeted...Run! Horrible insurance.
good,"The manager was mean and not cooperating no support at all."
good,"Hired as a contractor. "
good,I've been working here for over 8 years and was recently told I was being laid-off.  Typical Anthem. Was pretty happy until about 2 years about when my team was combined with another team that had toxic leadership and the manager created a hostile work environment.
good,Most of the managers need training on how to deal with associates. They show favoritism and are not helpful. When you run Into a situation that you can’t resolve with your manager the next step is to reach out to HR. HR always ends up with a resolution that best suits the manager and of course that makes the manager feel like they have won the battle causing many associates to quit despite being right. It is very hard to advance in the company or move to other departments for you have a difficult manager.
good,Working for Anthem is actually not that bad. You’re expected to work and most people don’t like that. But people are human and you determine your experience by understanding people are human. Not just the mistakes they make but the way they handle themselves when they are wrong. Some people have been there so long they are used to a certain way of work life. And unfortunately it  negatively impacts the rest of the workforce.
good,No room for growth and development. A lot of micro-managing. Managers do no support their staff. Becomes too stressful as they do not value their employees and are more concerned with their numbers.
good,Depending upon which manager you get you may or may not be able to maintain a work/life balance. People are very nice and friendly.                                         Thank You!
good,Anthem has a great benefits package and for years it had great advancement opportunities--not so much anymore. Departments seem to be in a state of chaos.
good,Anthem started out great but like with most call centers the information you learn and/or are given don't prepare you nearly enough for the type of calls you will be taking.
good,"While there are efforts to change the culture at Amerigroup since being acquired by Anthem, they have far to go to rid themselves of the toxic management style and become a true learning organization."
good,"Extreme micromanaging. Constant pressure for better results regardless of performance. Everyone is strung tight due to fear for their job. There is no job security as employees are all expendable, there are people waiting for your cube at any time. The turnover at Anthem is probably the highest of any corporation."
good,"The drawbacks are that the top management doesn’t care about the lower level employees, and in the call center with how stressful it is, they micro manage to make sure you’re doing EXACTLY what you’re supposed to do, it’s like you have 0 personal time once you’re clocked in. And the pay for CSRs is not worth the work"
good,"All latest technologies got to learn a lot of new stuff. Still, there was a lot of scopes to improve/streamline to automate the jobs. Management is not friendly to help or promote new products which automate the jobs and cut down the resources. Contract employees were not given or respected their ideas.No proper coordination with other team members. Resources were not properly used.No planning and the technical teams do not possess the right knowledge to implement. I worked extra hours but never got paid."
good,There was nothing special here. Just a regular job. Stress was manageable. I left due to pay and wanting advancement. The manager was new and my co-workers were ignorant.
good,"We multi-task, process admission and discharge. Retro review. Clean up. Detail oriented job. Train colleagues. Handle calls. Coordinate with internal department."
good,"In the earlier years Anthem was a very good place to work.....however as time went on,   Anthem slowly moved towards a alternative business strategy that jeopardized the long term employee of being retained"
good,Prefer not to say at this time. Due to changes at the company I am looking to leave.  The new UM phone intake position no longer provides me with the work home balance I would like
good,"It is an overall great company to work for. However, the customer service department is not the ideal department to be in if you are an individual who likes to take ownership of your work and does not like being micromanaged."
good,"Claims are investigated for potential subrogation.  Contacts are made to determine if there is potential for subrogation. All lines of Coverage . Contacts are made to  insurance carriers , Attorneys , employers and injures parties. After all the information is obtained a determination  is made. It is made bases on the laws, coverage . Once Determination is made , the file is documented and set up for an adjuster to negotiate  settlement . If unable to pursue the file is closed and letters are sent to All parties . If there is a hearing , notification is sent to all parties regarding our interests."
good,"An excellent company, but really lack of people with general vision, and manager with a high level of education."
good,Anthem has awful leadership. No one is willing to develop you to move up. Their work schedules have become very inconvient and they don’t have a great attendance policy. You don’t accrue sick time so if you are absent you get an occurrence and they use your PTO to make up your time.
good,There are a lot of great people at Anthem.  The culture is good.  employees are committed to their goals and work hard to maximize the customer experience. I learned a great deal about customer service and retention strategies.
good,Maintain good working knowledge of claims and product including the grievance of re-consideration process. Understanding and working without significant guidance.
good,It’s a great place that is not stressful but some the way they operate their business is strange at times. I can definitely say it’s an overall great experience for the most part.
good,"fast paced call center environment , not enough hours to perform the tasks that are requested . learned how to multitask. management is nice but over worked not enough time to assist. workplace culture is stressed and sometimes unsupportive."
good,"A typical day at work is talking to doctor offices, some members, initiating prior authorizations for medications for medicaid members. The hardest part of the job was being treated fair by management, I learned a lot about medicaid and medications, the most enjoyable part of the job was working at home."
good,have to stay at your desk unless you are on break or lunch.  No excuses for absences even if you are hospitalized.  decent pay for job. advancement is hard to get.
good,Anthem was a fun place to work for but if you are looking for a decent pay rate that might not be the place to be. The commute is pretty long if you are not close to Newbury Park.
good,"I am not going to talk bad about an employment but really didn't like working here. If the upper management don't like you. You won't go no where. And god forbid you do something wrong and want to move department, they won't let you move. You either be their puppet or go no where within the company."
good,"Typical day at work consists of organizing workflow, conference calls that include preparing for renewals or new business and creating checks and balances for meetings, training and outreach"
good,"Not enough resources, so few people are doing a lot with very little.  Therefore very little work-life balance.  Poor management.  Luckily, most employees truly care about the work they do and those they serve."
good,"Some departments have a direct career path; others not so much.  If you start in Customer Service, you can go just about anywhere within the company.  If you don't, and if you weren't hired for something specific, your job is less secure.  Not a lot of communication from management.  Management plays favorites instead of going by your ability."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was data mining.  Using the data mining tool, ACL, I could find instances of errors that could be corrected in order to save the company money.  In one audit I identified $3 million of incorrect claim payments."
good,"Anthem is a great company, but slow to progress...they are barely starting to take their employees opinions and ideas, as they are fully aware of their slow progression. Management is good, however stuck in non-innovative old ways of doing things. I felt no excitement within it's culture...but I believe they are taking notice and hopefully they will change their culture around."
good,"Not a place to work if you have a stressful tendency. FMLA while encouraged is quietly frowned upon. They tend to either understaff and work you like crazy, pushing numbers or overstaff and then micromanage in order to cut staff."
good,"I would receive telephonic encounters from doctor's offices requesting for authorization, checking clients membership and benefit coverage, assessing the necessity for the doctors order and request, and entering all these information into the computers using two system. I love their work schedule and the possibility to work at home after training. I am not claustrophobic. At time I was intimated with the use of computers because the SNF where I used to work was not computerized. Now over the years I am able to navigate the computer after being taught different systems used in my work place."
good,"Typical call center job. On the phones all day and was mentally exhausting. I did enjoy the people I worked with, but no room for advancement. Pay was ok."
good,Faced paced work production environment with continued changes. Flexible work environment with major room for advancement until you get to management.
good,"Marketing management was hardest to communicate, controlling, possessive. Did not took initiative to know the entire market that Anthem covers, rural central valley area very different from Southern Region."
good,"The actual customer service managers are very competent, however the upper management is very shady. They would deliberately keep their customers in the day about what doctors in the ER are in network to save the company money."
good,"Employees provide helpful information to make the job easier, not willing to listen or change to better production or work environment. Upper management would laugh at improvement recommendations to make the job flow easier and more consistent."
good,"Anthem is BCBS brand company and the company is quite a good place to work there.As in any case, the immediate management should be very employee focused for anyone to excel, which was missing in my case."
good,"The company seems to be constantly changing the organization and direction. This results in lack of direction and focus for employees, which affects productivity. The management seems to take a very reactive rather than proactive approach"
good,"It was a new program with a temp position, training was really good but once we got on the floor we barely got any calls. It was inbound calling, then it position was removed. The management was ok, pretty laid back job."
good,Anthem seems like a great place to work but your over worked and under paid. I like the people that work for Anthem but I do not like the management and the lack of pay that comes along with the job.
good,This was a fun and great place to work. I do not think they are open anymore but the managers were very involved with the staff and did not micro manage. Allowed you to do your work and produce results. At Christmas had party at manager house. Which was very nice.
good,Anthem is a Nice Company but Very High Turn Over. Not a lot of Room for advancement in my opinion. I enjoyed working in the customer service department overall.
good,Management in department hired had no experience processing claims.  Relied on long term staff to answer questions. Department was downsized and sent to offshore company to save money.
good,management was constantly under heavy stress which is passed on to employees. There were some very good managers at the outset which was abruptly changed without notice. The caused a good deal of mental tumbling with the workforce.
good,"unless you are a relative of a current Anthem employee.  Plus performance expectation goals are 99%.  If you can walk on water, this is the place for you."
good,"Typical day at work"
good,"No steady leadership in place, very limited access to information. No path to growth and no open channel of communication. Very heavy top down mangement style and no feedback from management for your work. Poor method of dismissing staff when they are home and not at the job"
good,"The company itself is a good company to work for. The enrollments dept. management is horrible. if offered a position in this dept do no take it. life will be very miserable. very unethical, favoritism, and multiple visits to HR."
good,"This review is primarily based on my experience through Anthem's Minnesota location. During my time with Anthem building the company's dental network through dentist recruitment projects, I was hampered by immediate management's inability to structure a reasonable amount of work into our schedules. Other areas of our division suffered from the same mismanagement, but my area was one of two in need of new management. Overall, Anthem is moving in the right direction with smart acquisitions and financial health, but the Minnesota division definitely needs to be revamped."
good,"Love my manager but the organization there was poor. "
good,I worked there for almost 14 years. I liked the hours. Many good benefits. Work at home program was a nice benefit for many.
good,A very fast paced position dealing with a lot of problem solving on a day to day basis. Can be stressful on a day to day basis. I have learned how claims are processed for health insurance and a better understanding on health insurance.
good,"As insurance costs continue to go up, every medical visit I make someone tells me the horror stories of Anthem refusing the pay claims. As an employee, I do not know how true that is, I do not see that kind of information but if everyone is saying the same thing, there might be something to it. "
good,"Anthem is an excellent place to work to make a lot of money.  Yet, you work non stop, management expects too much, and too many quotas. When you get off work you're exhausted.  There is no work life balance, all you do is work, and think about what needs to be done. You never get to enjoy your success, because Management jumps right into next months goals.  If you want a life stay away from Anthem."
good,Very nice reputable company but the management is not all that nice. Not very encouraging. Not all but some. Not a place for growth so if you want to be comfortable in one position this would be your place
good,"It is a very solid and structured place to work. It is your typical desk job. The people are nice to work for, and the culture is excellent. It is however lacking in motivation and drive to improve all of its employees, and the possibilities for advancement are minimal."
good,"A typical day at work finds me either at the computer providing documentation, completing assessments, coordinating care or on the road visiting my clients."
good,"Heavy workload, ever-changing expectations, unrealistic time frames. Salary not commensurate with workload."
good,"It was a fun and I always learned something new."
good,Anthem was a stable and consistent workplace that offered a flexible schedule which allowed the ability to balance my Job/Work Life accordingly. I enjoyed working with a great many employees who were in turns team-oriented and great to work with. I learned a great deal about the expectations of Medicaid and Medicare guidelines and the hardest part of my job was to remember a great deal of information which was not always readily accessible. The best part of my job there was that I enjoyed working with my colleagues to help write and implement process manuals to help process applications so new employees would not struggle to learn the guidelines for enrollment applications. I was able to use my experience to help be a valuable asset and increase production levels and employee understanding.
good,It was an ok place to work the benefits were good at first.  We had no trouble reaching goals. Then they started out sourcing everything and letting people go.
good,"assisted member and provider with benefits"
good,"It was an okay experience, job duties changed very often. I worked so hard on the HEDIS project and then I was let go after a week later, when I was expecting to get a different position or get a raise."
good,"Typical top-down corporate culture. Management is stagnate, they have had the same leadership for decades and it leaves little room for new voices or innovation. "
good,"Overall a good fit for many people. If you are good at customer service and dont mind office politics from management level down, then this job will be a secure and stable lifetime career with great benefits."
good,A high demanding job that doesnt match the pay. You help members for 8 hours all day on various issues. No 2 calls are the same.
good,"Anthem is a good company to work for. However, they did not not want to work with me on hours. I have nothing else to say about them."
good,"I cant complain about anthem. I enjoyed my time with this company. I learned a lot working at anthem. I met a lot of great people., Thank you."
good,"Managed ticket queue for VA offices."
good,"It was a good experience, however the job security was lacking as well as the overall organization of day to day tasks.  I would recommend it to those who need a job."
good,"I processed checks and paperwork.  It was good to work in a team environment.  HIPPA laws were to be in compliance.  I couldn't work on the phones, because I have poor hearing."
good,Though i am not into the whole nightclub scene it was an interesting job. I learned a lot from my supervisor (production manager) as i was still an audio student for the majority of my employment. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting amazing artists and learning the ins and outs of live sound production. Live sound is my favorite area of music and audio and i thats why i like my job.
good,"This is a great company to work for However, I feel there is no room for advancement. I have been employed with Anthem for years and I have been sedentary,"
good,A typical day at work was basically taking calls from customers about there insurance some of the customers really made your day others ruined it. Managers were inconsistent an showed favoritism. My coworkers were very messy. The hardest part of the job was the customers you just couldn't satisfy the most enjoyable part was the monthly potlucks
good,Quiet place.  Nobody really speaks unless on lunch.  Spent 90% of my time at my desk with ear buds in listening to music as I processed claims.
good,"Anthem was a great place to work until the company merged with Wellpoint.  Benefits were drastically cut and many positions outsourced to ""overseas partners.""  Customer service suffered dramatically and it was obvious the company no longer valued the experience of long-time employees."
good,"Chaotic environment with constant changes of priorities, goals, measurements with little support from management."
good,"Was a great place to work when I started in the eighties. Over time with mergers, lost of benefits, and outsourcing things went downhill. But most corporate jobs are like that now days."
good,"The best part of this job was the interaction with my fellow medical policy analysts, and medical directors."
good,"Wellpoint is a great company to work with!"
good,"Great company to work for in terms of stability and overtime.  Salary is generally commensurate with experience.  Very fast paced environment, and have to be very adaptable to change almost daily."
good,I love Customer Service and giving back/ helping Customers Patients Doctors and Nurses with Claims and Coverage issues
good,"Horrible boss- medicare department"
good,"I work hard, and effective is very good, I learn to work other people.  Hardest part of the job is phone work, and writing,"
good,I enjoyed working there especially working from home. It was a great place great people I like they had a gym in the building you can work out after work if youj worked in the building.
good,"Be very patient with everything and everyone, great challenges, good opportunities to learn, and a good place to get to know different people."
good,"Wellpoint was a fast paced environment, especially in the sales department that I managed. I had a team of 17 hard working agents that met and/or exceeded their monthly sales goals."
good,People work hard. It's a big company. In a scary industry. It appears that there are lots of staff reductions and illogical work assignments.
good,"Overall it was good. I really loved the Flex time which made it possible to keep many of my appointments. Family was put first, which I liked.."
good,I enjoyed working from home. I worked there for almost 14 years. It was very tough when they sent our jobs overseas.
good,"It is a nice place to work, most everyone is friendly, unfortunely they are doing corporate downsizing"
good,"Overall, WellPoint is a great company to work for. Currently, too much uncertainty because of downsizing and outsourcing."
good,"This Monday through Friday position was a very busy, fast paced job. You are expected to know a lot. Training is ongoing. Co-workers are serious but joke around. The hardest part of this job was not being able to take a break when you needed to. The most enjoyable part of this job was the constant learning."
good,"On phones all day long, talking to members about their benefits, the claims. I've learned how to adjust health claims. Management is too busy for any help when needed. The hardest part is the adherence, have to be on the phones, they don't want you to come off."
good,The best thing about this company is that they do allow your room to excel and grown in the workplace but lack the resources for you to do that. Their compensation packages is lacking and the management varies from cubicle to cubicle.
good,When I accepted a position with Wellpoint I was excited about the possibilities although I had heard mixed reviews prior to my accepting. After I was employed I found the company culture to be very siloed which originated with Sr. Mgmnt causing stress and mistrust that rolled down to the lower levels of the comapny.
good,"1.  Check email, attending meetings and review items from various teams to obtain status; which is then reflected into a PPM system for leadership to track."
good,Anthem hires through agency's to handle open enrollment during October to January.  They have good training and the management overall is willing to help.  There are many computer platforms to use for the several states they are in.
good,"Fast-paced environment with critical real-time analysis and adjustments made throughout the day.  Quick, concise jigh-level communication with business leaders is key.  Anthem's culture surrounds it's core values: Accountable, Caring, Easy to do business with, Innovative, and Trustworthy.  The hardest part of the job is maintaining solid relationships with the business you support as well as supporting businesses in many locations across the United States.  The most enjoyable part of this job is seeing service statistics being met which translates into satisfied customers."
good,If you have kids or obligations outside work dont bother applying since they tend to clock all the days missed and they dont accept doctors notes as excuse absent.
good,"It’s a great company, it’s just the people you encounter a lot of times that have worked own way and you aren’t mind readers. I’m appreciative to have a job, but many tactics don’t  make much sense"
good,take in-bound calls- quality is 98%- impossible to reach goals- lots of overtime management more concerned making bonuses and lack of training- calls are Medicaid and commercial and also dealing with members and customer service reps from Anthem BCBS- also dealing with pharmacy medications and pharmacy personell
good,"Typical work day 8-12 hours, always engaged with the customers. Always learning new skills. Direct manager was easy to work for and we worked wells as a team. The hardest part of the jos was working too many hours, no life work balance."
good,The site is brand new and is still being worked on. Management is too busy to offer guidance at this time. The work culture is not the best. People tend to stay within the group they trained with and when someone from outside their group tries to include them within another group they decline. So the place feels very cliquish. It would be a great place to work for if they can get rid of the cliques.
good,"bad management, great benefits, stressful work with no help when needed. would not recommend unless you can deal with stress overload, petty managers, workers who have been there for 10+ years thinking they are managers, adults acting like children"
good,Many different company have different ways of doing things! Ive learn a lot I’ve disliked a lot but they have taken great care of me! It’s a great place
good,incoming phone calls from members about medical and pharmacy reading contract booklets applying correct benefits claim adjustments leaning to work with different systems such as cs90 wgs
good,"Strong opportunities to learn, use newer technologies and develop yourself and your career.  However, new shift to working on-site in specific key hub cities may affect opportunities for advancement.  "
good,Think twice about working here. The pay is wonderful and so are the benefits.  They are unfair when it comes to management.  The weasel their way out of raises and bonuses.  Management told me they are doing it on purpose
good,Lack career advancement when you try to move departments you will be blocked or pigeonholed disregarding your other skills prior to working for Anthem but always asking for your resume. If you are able to know go through that regardless of years being in the same position then it’s okay company.
good,"Typical day at work. Answered calls all day. Customers were very rude. Not enough resources after training. Not all managers, but a few were never available for help. Most enjoyable part of the job is getting off of work."
good,"Good experience, learned much about industry standards, psid well, excellent bonuses. Ability to work from home office,  excellent mansger and tesm leaders."
good,Anthem is a fast paced place to work. They cross train you in multiple departments and you need to be able to multi task in order to advance in your career.
good,Anthem is a great company but when starting at the bottom (CCRI) it can be quite discouraging after seeing your checks. Customer Care Reps should definitely be compensated more.
good,"If your looking for a call center environment and a decent mental and emotional challenge this is the place for you, but not me......................."
good,"No advancement opportunities unless you're  a management favorite. "
good,It’s ok. I don’t mind working here. But they could pay more and they are slow with promotions. Things are constantly changing and questions often go unanswered.
good,"Good management team in the Plantation FL office. You can learn a lot, but the workload is unmanageable at times. Little opportunity for growth in that office. The company offers a lot of remote work opportunities."
good,"Anthem is okay! My manager  unfortunately was not manager material. She was really into retaliation.  I  left  because I saw bias in my boss, she treated people of color unfair, and that  didn't sit well with me.  The company as  a whole was okay  as far as pay  but don't count on advancement to often."
good,"Good Environment to work ! Nice people and nice culture.More over the location is very good it is in Downtown Atlanta."
good,"Good company, bad management for certain Medical Mgmt positions. Need to vet managers and give training before putting anyone in position of power. Common sense would be a great start for managers."
good,"Being flexible to address marketplace is admirable; however, the number of reorganizations and job changes forced on employees is not effective or healthy for the company or it's employees. Reorganizations and realignment of resources occurs so frequently that it is unknown if implemented changes are successful. The lack of job security and stress level within the company is intense."
good,Pay is ok but not great.  Most management and leadership has less experience then I do which is hard at times.  They  don't value experience and talent as much as knowing the right people.
good,"Company hires only at corporate office locations from within. No opportunities for advancement if your not located in Ohio,or  Wisconsin. Constantly moved around laterally with no advancement in pay. Great benefits if you want to be stuck in a position and not advance in your career."
good,"Work culture is always difficult to change. I always begin with it but it is always the last thing to actually change because it ends and begins with people. Insurance, banking, trading are all very deep rooted cultures which are very much set in their ways of management. Leadership must embrace change if an agile adoption is to occur and help their workforce embrace it as well. Change will happen slowly. Anthem is no different. Do not expect change to occur overnight. It will not."
good,Lots of opportunities once you get in the door.  High stress environment.  No overtime is allowed.  Good benefits and discounts.  Free parking and cafeteria on site.
good,"was able to work at home after training, loved the flex hours, and make up time.  depending on who your OE was as to how good or bad your work like could be."
good,"There are constantly changes to management and the order of things.  There are opportunities to move laterally, but not much to move up.  When upward positions come around they usually already have someone in mind.  They pay well and the work is interesting to a point, not much micro-managing however not much direction either."
good,"It's a cash in cash out account. If that is what you are looking for, this is the company for you.  There is no loyalty and they are moving towards move contractors than permanent employees."
good,"Received 40-60 emails form Providers and members in regards to claims and eligibility, answered each email with a resolution. Also Updated providers with with claims issues, including pricing and coverage per plan. "
good,"I worked in IT and the company provided great benefits and compensation as well as excellent bonuses, however, the down side is that yearly reviews were generally very small not matter how good your review was and promotions were non existent."
good,"good benefits but call center stressfull.  Great co-workers but Management was in a different state and did not care about local workers.  Profess to be Customer Focused, yet more concerned with meeting stats"
good,"Anthem is a very, very easy place to settle in and make a living, and they have low performance standards. But the opportunities for advancement are scarce and the pay is laughable. If you have half a brain you can skate through pretty much any role within the company while looking for something more serious."
good,"Managers are put in position with little to no experience. Upper management has advised the poor managers to hire their friends or family. The saga continues. They spend more time playing around and goofing than working. Even though you work hard and get the job done, advancement is only offered to poor manager's friends or family. H.R. complaints don't help."
good,I worked here when it was still BlueCross/BlueShield of CT and it was a relatively small company - about 2500 employees in four locations. Management was hands-on and very collaborative.
good,"The management was not what I expected.  The training was very bad.  There was an intense amount of material but it was not presented in a timely manner therefore, leaving new hires to wonder about the process of a  task."
good,"Anthem is a good company in general.  Anthem provides great benefits. They are willing to work with you as far as work hours.  "
good,Very micro managed.  No time to really relax and stretch.  Must be accounted for at all times.  No real time to enjoy lunch breaks. you only had 30 mins.
good,"Good for beginners and SMEs: You will get 360 Deg scope of the project and flexibility to explore new technologies"
good,There is no grey area with this company. They will give you the choice of either cutting off your leg or your arm. Take your pick. It is one thing to have to adapt to change but it is another thing to be forced into something you did not sign up for
good,This experience was very informative. The department I worked in was extremely taxing in many ways but over all a good way to build the education to move on to other positions with this company or any other.
good,Flexible work life with an onsite gym but due to poor management information was slow to circulate. Been involved in an Agile team that has become more collaborative and the benefits are good.
good,"Over the 14 years I worked there the culture of the company has changed greatly "
good,"I started out working in the mailroom and advanced my self to a trainer, this position was most rewarding, I travelled a lot.  Due to the growth of Anthem nothing was ever stable there, you never knew what management was going to do as in changes."
good,"Large Fortune 500 company that offers many opportunities for growth and advancement. Friendly employees and helpful to one another. Large cafeteria offered to employees for breakfast and lunch. Many health perks offered to employees such as flu shots, programs offered to assist employees to quit smoking and fitness center use."
good,"Busy from morning to evening."
good,"I worked in National Member Services for two years. In the two years I worked with Anthem I had 4 different managers, all with different ideas regarding management. After two years of employment, I received a .25 cent raise in hourly pay. This was after meeting or exceeding all requirements. "
good,"Anthem is a very large company with several lines of business. The culture varies greatly by area and the enterprise is constantly going through efforts to reorganize."
good,A typical day you are on the phone answering 30-60 calls a day. I learned how to be able to give insurance benefits able to teach the provider the information.
good,"This is a call center job. You answer customer questions concerning their medical policies.  Every aspect of your day is monitored on a set amount of time and by numerous people. Calls are reviewed by many different sources. Shift, bonuses, ect.. based on performance. The training is really book work, no real hands until you get on the floor and then your kind thrown in and really lost. Break and lunches (30 min) often are different every day depending on coverage needed.  If you get stuck on a call when it time to go, too bad, you stay until they are helped, which can take minutes to hours. Most people were nice but some were outright mean. This job is not for everyone.  It wasn't for me."
good,can be frustrating to get promote or cross trained.  salary is exceptional competitive. not always even flow of information between representatives and management
good,"Currently, things at Anthem are tension and stress filled.  The company is trying to do things differently, in order to continue to succeed.  However,  despite efforts to engage employees, the culture is starting to shift from one of engagement and cooperation to fear and coercion.  Employees have been given deadlines for projects without regard for resource constraints, projects are overlapping each other, conflicting with each other, etc.  Project owners are pushing for their item in a vacuum, resulting in tensions between employees all trying to do the right thing"
good,"As most company do - this has gone through some ups and downs.   The work / life balance culture is being fazed out and everyone is asked to do more forgoing the work/life balance.  The bottom line is the key for the company right now,  I hope with the customer in mind but we don't talk about the customer that much any more either."
good,"High paced, slow potential for growth, demanding, but good benefits. Environment is your typical corporate environment. But the job itself, was challenging which I liked."
good,I began working at BCBS of GA in 2008. This was durring a time of tremendous change in the insurance industry and was a difficult time to be working at BCBS of GA. Hopefully they have adjusted.
good,"Offers many different work opportunities from entry level call center to executive leadership options.  While they are a national company, they look out for the local community."
good,"Flexible and always busy work schedules. Work from home is a good option. Good benefits to thier permanent employees. Not so good for the vendors. No job security. In the area I worked, the Leadership changes very frequently and so is their long term goals. Big projects always struggles due to lack of long term planning. The middle and lower layers always struggles to meet the project milestones."
good,Its an okay place to start your health industry. As I was offered an position it will no longer be available for me after a global cancelation. I have gotten through the trainning for everything to find out it wont be there.
good,"I enjoyed working for this company...i enjoyed the atmosphere where most of the time in the call center, it was quite but the work ethic  good...no further comments"
good,"I enjoyed working with Anthem. Great Co-workers, but the changes and layoffs were unnerving.  Had to find something else."
good,"Anthem is a fast consonantly changing environment with a great location down town Denver."
good,"uneducated management, good benefits , they pay for parking. understanding higher management, some areas are production, horrible kitchen, friendly environment"
good,"This employer was the true definition of Corporate atmosphere. Customer service wasn't able to attend to a lot of the outside work functions ""holiday parties"" as they needed to be on the phones, managers took power and abused it. It just wasn't good."
good,It was a good temporary job to work. I loved the people that I worked with. The job was pretty simple. Management could have been better but overall my team was managed ok.
good,The point system is horrible and the managers know nothing. They don't accept doctors notes. No one is on the same page. Favoritism is big here and if your not in that crowd it's like your not important. Advancing is hard to do also if you do not kiss up to get there.
good,"Over worked, under paid, and under valued. No opportunity to have a voice in the company. Felt like nobody cared about life outside of work."
good,"You're given a schedule. You have no say-so."
good,"I enjoy my job and I love the people I work with, but the environment can be negative and is unethical. The hardest part of the job can be when a provider wants to debate and rebut everything that you advise them of about the claim. The best part is when I am able to resolve the providers issue and reprocess their claim."
good,"Anthem had really good people, management for broker services was great."
good,Anthem would be a great place to work for if the insurance market was suffering so heavily at the moment. this has allowed for cuts and layoffs nationwide.
good,"I actually started out working with Amerigroup but due to the merger with Anthem things have changed. He has several new people in leader and they are in a total disconnect with reality. They have high expectations that can not be attained in the real world dealing with Medicaid clients.  When you try to voice you opinion their answer is always ""i don't understand what the problem is"". They need to wipe management clean and start over with real world people. The work at home is great but they expect you to work long hours and throw it in your face that you work from home  and are salary. You end up working through your lunch a lot just to keep up with the work load."
good,"This job is good coming out of school. You learn a lot about the health industry. No room for growth. No bonus, like most employers make guidelines impossible to achieve."
good,"A typical of work consisted of assisting Pediatric patients with referrals for specialty care,obtaining  durable medical equipment, providing literacy awareness, and participating in community awareness initiatives."
good,"This job has the potential to be either incredibly rewarding, or incredibly depressing. Unfortunately, as with most jobs, this comes down to leadership. On a typical day, a rep will find themselves on the phones, solving simple to complex problems in order to help members get the health care that they need. As with any customer service position, each call you get daily is different and while you are responsible for keeping a pleasant face, the tone of the caller can certainly alter the overall experience of each call. Culture between reps is fairly nice. For the most part people seem to be helpful and supportive within your unit. There does seem to be animosity between different units, which is problematic because the majority of the company's protocols require things to be passed betwixt units for completion. Additionally, management is problematic. In my experience the majority of the individuals in management positions don't have much, if any, experience taking calls. As such, there is a great disconnect between unit expectations and what is actually accomplishable on every call. Higher up management seems to have an even greater disconnect. For the most part, this can be tolerated. During busier times of year, however, expect to have leadership looking for all the ways you've messed up rather than actually looking at the whole picture of calls."
good,"Great company with great name recognition. However, when they stated losing money because of the new ACA regulations, they started laying people off from the retention department. The retention department is part of the sales department. If you are going to trim the fat to get back to profitability, you start first from the liability side of the ledger sheet."
good,"As a call center employee you're powerless to help 90% of the customer base in which you're servicing. Everything is at the hands of internalized structures, you're simply a representative of the company. The work was interesting at first but progressively became more convoluted as time went on. We were often told to transfer members to separate departments and hope they wouldn't get upset. Each call center utilizes its own customer service platform so god help you if you call the wrong customer service number. They'll not be able to locate you and you could be stuck on the hook for hours. Management was also apathetic to this. Our IVR was awful, constantly being maintenanced when it was likely the least of things needed worked on. Many of my coworkers had been there 2+ years and seemed to be dead inside. They don't pay well and raises are scarce. Ironically, their insurance isn't top-notch for its own employees. Personally, I would avoid them unless you're into getting berated for people not paying their premiums or refusing to understand common verbiage like ""deductible"" or ""coinsurance."""
good,the job was not very exciting but I really enjoyed assisting the customers and making them feel valued. I was nice know that I could make a POSITIVE difference in their day just by being friendly and efficient in assisting with whatever issue they may have had.
good,"With daily changes due to healthcare reform, the communication within the department was unreliable.  Some of this was due to internal interpretation of the new laws.  The work hours were good and had the option to work from home if necessary."
good,"Anthem is a great place to work; however, I find Lincare as a whole to be too corporate for my liking. Anthem has always had supportive management and co-workers along with job security. Allows you as an individual to grow and gain experience for bigger and better things."
good,I learned alot at this company. I started as a nurse consultant. I ended up being a project manager. I recommend that anyone who takes a job there learn and take advantage of all learning opportunities.
good,After 24 years working in the office I was able to work from home which was a wonderful experience and I would love that experience again.
good,Pretty much exactly what you'd expect from a company its size. Decently skilled management burdened with outrageous expectations. Suffocating amount of micromanagement and boring work day.
good,"Changed their name so many times could not keep up! When the heat was on, hide behind a new name. Was much better as Blue Cross of CA before becoming WellPoint, then Anthem Blue Cross , when Anrhem of Indianapolis bought us. Now just Anthem... But for how long. Use to be a fabulous place to work. Until they Outsourced jobs overseas. Lots of laying off of really long time staff to pay very little with no benefits to a person in the Phillipines, Guam, India, and Panama."
good,"Very fast paced work environment with a lot of meetings.  Stressful work environment with a lot of deadlines, sometimes without enough staff to complete the task in an efficient manner."
good,"productive and fast paced environment, the most enjoyable was the pace and new learning daily, never a dull moment."
good,Company was great with a flexible schedule for those with small children and families.
good,Very fast paced.  Wonderful working with customers on issues that truly effected their health and well being.  I loved this job. I love busy days. Employee at this company were absolutely wonderful to work with.  Direct management for all but last 3 months was great last manager very abrasive and poor communicator. Overall great experience would love to work with this company again.
good,"Large company, decent benefits, limited career progression"
good,"Work from home is great"
good,There have been recent changes to compensation and job policies.
good,"When I first started at Anthem in the Treasury Dept. I was exposed to several areas of Treasury. I was introduced to account analysis, cash management, banking relationships, internal customer service and was well on my way to advancing through the Treasury Dept."
good,good place to work - flexible work schedule - great management - great co-workers -
good,The job itself is not a bad job. I am looking for a non contract full time position and this company no longer hires full time.
good,"Learned a lot about Healthcare Insurance Plans, Commercial and Medicare benefits.  Quality customer service at all times.  Constant computer log-in except for (2) 15 minute breaks and 30 minute lunch."
good,"Production first and foremost, work from home, balances life.  "
good,"The hardest part of the job was compromising my home life work balance to ensure company and state/federal timelines were successfully met. My coworkers trusted my solid judgments and consistently turned to me for help, guidance and or advice."
good,"Whether I worked the first shift or the third shift, it was all about taking care of the customers' problems. They didn't understand their EOB's or what their insurance covered and I was able to get those problems resolved."
good,"The environment was excellent,mostly attributed to our team, otherwise it may have not been a good experience. I learned all aspects of marketing and selling by creating the advertisement,selecting the best methods to generate business in order to sell the products. I also learned about the Health Care Reform. In addition,I learned to motivate the people in training."
good,"Employed for 18 years, overall a great company to work for as an employee. A sincere effort to provide the best possible service to customers while maintaining cost. Anthem continued to reinvent themselves to ensure it was a leader in the health Insurance industry. As Manager of Call Center my job was to ensure all employees were readily availalbe to answer calls and provide Excellent Service to our Customers. My Co Workers had strong work ethics and were team players. My direct reports, working along side of them and seeing their commitment to thier job was the part I enjoyed the most."
good,My over all experience with BCBS is good benefit but they are always outsource department.
good,i liked the atmosphere i like interacting with the customers but the management needs to take a class on people skills.
good,Overtime shift was required. Got good SQL skills from this project which helped me to improve my technical skills.so looking for a changeLearned about medicare and Medicaid.
good,Multiple departments with ability to learn about the company through different job opportunities. Managers are generally supportive of providing learning for variety of projects.
good,"not enough training for the job, rush through training. not enough one on one training. expected you to already know their systems. systems weren't explained clearly."
good,Learned a lot about medicaid insurance. Worked in prior authorization department. Worked in cubicles. Expectations are high. We had 30 minute lunch and two 15 minute breaks everyday.
good,A large corporate company with work at home options for several business areas involving health insurance coverages and benefits for individual and group policies.
good,"this was a good company with opportunities, fun people to work with, interesting work.  flexibility with family and any personal issues. support from staff to fulfill job needs."
good,This company has various benefits and multiple departments you can get transferred to. Potential for advancement is great. However the constant changes can be overwhelming.
good,Retired too early.  Good co-workers. Decent management.  Day hours.  OK salary. Good benefits.  Was treated professionally.  Members were treated well and cared for.
good,"I don,t have any negative experiences with Blue Cross. The only negative experiences were do to the mergers with other companies. Specifically Amerigroup merger"
good,Really enjoy the work I am doing. I've learned a lot since being at the company.  I provide support to our claims team.  The hardest part of this job is sometimes the long hours.
good,"okay place to work and fair, new location, new, clean bright, parking, open, cafeteria, new furniture, clean work space, low cubes, people friendly and more conference rooms"
good,"Productive and fun place to work - with a ping pong table."
good,"Fast paced environment, the company does give you proper training for the consent changes that come with healthcare insurance. I spoke with different brokers within the company and assisted with healthcare claims"
good,"I worked with many great people, but upper management constantly contradicts themselves. They lay people off then give the remaining associates the work of 3 or 4 people. Their business decisions cause low morale and unhappy employees."
good,"You cannot move to another department unless your manager gives you a good evaluation. Even if you’re a great employee, your manager will give you a bad evaluation so you can’t leave the department. Change is a constant in that department. The benefits and the pay are okay."
good,Anthem is great place if your on a great schedule. There is a lot of room for growth at this company if your willing to put in the time. However every department and floor is different & and the rules are very different.
good,Poor management and leadership in East Region NY. Does not look what benefits the company but benefits them. Provide all their work for the workers to run while they take credit. Many changes in leadership and don't provide the opportunity for those who know the area and industry speak thier opinion. Company is great is the people who works there.
good,"Anthem offers better than average salaries in some specialized areas. There is lots of opportunity with constant growth and change. Employees often struggle with heavy workloads. The company is always restructuring one or another business unit, resulting in periodic layoffs."
good,"Worked many years and bad to go on ltd"
good,Worked at Anthem for two years. Work was varied. Employees were very friendly. Employees worked hard but helped each other out. Good community feeling.
good,The 4 years i spent at Anthem were a good 4 years. The time i entered the company was transformational. I learned a lot and have a lot to take away with me.
good,This was a project related position that ended with the conclusion of the project. The duration of the project was concurrent with the open enrollment period that year.
good,"Relaxed environment, different shifts depending on your job title. Could work anywhere from 8 am to 6pm Monday through Friday no holidays and no weekends"
good,"I would recommend this job to whomever is searching for work,  with benefits and decent pay. Referral specialists is and great position easy job task and helpful training classes."
good,"My job is wonderful on paper with good pay and benefits. In practice it was apparent that the role was heavily inflated during my interview to make it sound more than it actually is. It was also not shared with me that programs are on a contract basis, so job security is often a concern. Management is unfortunately cliques oriented allowing certain employees to work at a lower standard than others. There does not appear to be any job advancement or a clear career ladder to climb. If you wish to work in a relatively low stress environment with good pay, this is a place to seek. If you wish to have a rich career experience, perhaps look elsewhere."
good,Fast paced work environment. Several leadership changes on an annual basis. Solid pay and benefits and promotional opportunities. Limited communication from leadership.
good,"lots of opportunities for advancement, great work life balance. always involved in community outreach and is really in tune w what the community needs"
good,"Great paid and very flexible.Constantly mentally presured to reach your monthly goal.But whit a nice attitude a lot of travel and medicare knowledge its possible to make some nice money.Sometimes outdoors table tops may burn you and sweat a lot or visceversa depend your state.The bad interaction between coorporate and employees its BRUTAL.This location manager its abusive and disrespectful and loved being influenced by gossips and jealous people for fast growing new experienced employees.I do not know as someone with the same desire that hires you for nesecity that calls you as a service and then wants to destroy you for unfounded personal and work reasons: Because i worked for a competitive company which manifested his hatred in countless occasions.Be very careful with your doubts and what questions ask;Why it may be your last because this market is highly regulated lot of info but not to work with fear just doing the right thing always. Since threats are constantly received from unfounded and unevidenced Complaints and being fired from the sales manager. Not only do I speak for myself but also for ex-companions, Evidenced"
good,This job is not great. I do not like answering phones all day. I am a person who likes to be able to move around and get some kind of exercise at work.
good,"Anthem has multiple, complex processes to run their procedures. Management is focused on maintaining standardization across divisions only. Great Job aides."
good,The employees are very nice and great to work with at Anthem but Anthem is letting many employees go and I worry about how long Anthem will be in this area.
good,"The company lacks a solid training program for the CSRs, after 15 years I was told the things that I didn't excel in I should have ""picked up along the way"", as a result, you learn by failure...not good."
good,Monday and Tuesday is usually the most busiest days. There is no outbound calls placed and usually take call backs. There is no idle time in between the minute your done with your call you get another one right after.
good,"I will first like say I enjoyed working there. It was stressful but not overly to much.  But I was fired for having one bad call. I was told they were going sent it in for corrections action to HR, i was blindsided when I went in for a coaching and was told they were letting me go for that call."
good,The people I work with are absolutely fantastic. There is a close knit environment that kindles professional friendships and a comfortable place for questions and immediate help. Everyone who is currently here wants to be here and it really shows
good,I was hired as a customer service representative and within 3 weeks i was promoted to team lead. Advancement was immediate due to the open enrollment period. Overtime everyday so the balance between home and work was not a great one. The culture was very political. The hardest part of the job was escalations. Being able to solve escalations was very rewarding.
good,"I worked off and on as a consultant for Anthem.  The largest project I was involved in was converting documents into presentable learning initiatives, primarily for the Sales Team.  These initiatives were introduced at a large conference in Las Vegas."
good,"Poor work/life balance, management did not help. working here was great at first but, due to recent changes in upper management the site that I worked at began to be micromanaged."
good,"Typical day at work entails many meetings, discussions etc but the environment is structured and processes are in place. Managements go through management training so they are required to follow certain rules. The ability to work remotely was a plus. Work was challenging but fun. The bonus and opportunities were amazing."
good,Wasn't there long enought for an opinon yet this is requiring me to put 150 characters to review something that I can't nor shouldn't be reviewing. The End.
good,"A very busy fruitful  fulfilling place to work. Learned time management, prioritizing, multitasking..co-workers work together, . Management supportive ."
good,Working for Anthem was nice. They had great benefits including a gym in the facility. There was a lot of overtime and sometimes the atmosphere was very stressed. I did like my schedule it was 6-230 which allowed me to make other appointments after work.
good,Company’s vision is foggy minimal consideration for employees.  Only focused on saving money but money served isn’t reflected back into the company or lower level employees.
good,Great working environment.  The office space is open and allows for much needed interactions and creativity between members. The office location was good.
good,"stressful at time, a lot of repetition  work, a lot of favoritism with management, overtime should be something that is given often. A more positive uplifting environment"
good,"The compensation is great.  The health insurance is surprisingly sub par.  Positions are replaced by contractors and off shore employees.  You do not grow with the position, it will out grow you.  You are only valued if you are involved in a high profile position.  Those positions do not have a work/life balance."
good,"This is a good company to work for however, the office space I worked for was very old and they did not use electronic systems.  Lots of papers stacked everywhere.  No environmental caution as far as wasting paper"
good,"anthem was a very stressful work environment with little opportunity at the time I worked there, to advance. The expectations for quality and production were over rate"
good,"Night shift consists of dropping reports, and completing alerts on members who need to be checked on in regards to caregivers. Tasks consists of research, manual confirmations, as well as schedule deviations etc."
good,"This was my first call center experience. My coworkers are amazing, but the training was extremely lacking. The communication with management is also lacking."
good,My initial experience with the company was positive however the end of my career with Anthem was not so positive.  Position changed from Work from home to Work from office 6 hours away.  Minimal advance notice was provided and I have a contract on a new home and unable to relocate.
good,I enjoyed working at Anthem Inc. The work environment was great and the people that worked there were very task oriented and willing to help.  Definitely a team based environment.
good,I worked both part time and then full time at Anthem and the outsourced companies for their data management.  Great experiences and challenges.  Loved it.
good,"The work I was responsible for leading was great - good experience. Allowed associates like myself to work at home, providing an outstanding work/life balance. Our department leader paid little attention to the team and  investing in career growth opportunities, focusing 100% on his own arc within the company. Very little support and acknowledgement of this internally."
good,"very fast pase , I learned to change pcp check auth reprocessed medication and billing management changes daily love assistance callers its  the most rewarding part of the day"
good,Very good place to Work.  Helpful Manager/Product Owner.  I like to work again in Anthem if given a chance.  workplace culture is very nice.  Lot of things to Learn from the people I met here.
good,"Typical day at Anthem overwhelming, no room for growth. I Learned about claims and insurance. Not enough pay for the work load or cost of living.  Very nice building comfortable space for lunch and there a gym to release stress."
good,Manager was extremely lazy and did not know processes of the department. The manager would try and micromanage and had favoritism. The manager had employees that were not OE's taking supervisor calls and compensation was not up to pare.
good,great company mission.  unfortunate old school  mentality totally resistant to change.  long tenured employees running the business are standing in the way of success
good,"Steady opportunity"
good,"Learned more skills, helpful team, Management is ok but not concerned with the family consultants, working long hrs for delivery of sprints, and billed for 40 hrs only /week fun environment for most of the days"
good,"This is a Call Center and during peak times heavy phone calls coming in back to back handling questions concerning billing, enrollment, claims, medical authorizations, pharmacy issues, renewal issues.  The most difficult part of the job is the stress level that every call cannot be resolved due to processes and procedures and from members to get issues resolved as quickly as possible though this cannot always be accomplished.  Most enjoyable part of the job is when I am able to see a difficult issue to the complete end for a member and the outcome be favorable."
good,"Overall work culture is promising but definitely, they can strive to make it better.  Senior leadership should be open for suggestions and make them part of the decision making process."
good,"The hardest part of the job is constant reorganization.  Not enough time to let processes that are developed to realize full benefit of change.  Example, once you have a process in place and you are moving along in a nice rhythm then a re-org occurs and the people that you worked with as part of the process are no longer there or moved on to another function within the company."
good,"learned about many different health plan clients and their regulations and guidelines"
good,"Pleasant environment to work in, busy day from morning to evening, learned about heath insurance and my manager was a pleasure to work with. The hardest part was the phones."
good,My 20+ years at Anthem were amazing with great teams to accomplish many goals and explore and implement new community programs.  Everyone worked together as a family environment.
good,There was very little management...  My first boss was introduced to me by me....  And he was spending a lot of time in meetings and going to another jobsite..  It was not his fault....
good,Company is very small and unwilling to budge on old habits. They do things a certain way and not willing to change. Change is what needs to happen in order to be successful.
good,I worked remotely from home doing pharmacy claims review as an independent contractor. I really have no idea what it is like to work for Anthem other than my very limited off-premises part time independent contractor work.
good,I loved working for this company.  My day would typical entail generating reports based on business requirement documents.  I learned a significant information while employed there and thank them for the opportunity to have worked there.
good,"The Business Development and Product Innovation teams were severely cut.  Lay offs effective 11-30-18.  Prior to this, WAH was retracted for all Administrative Assistants and Anthem/Caremore, et al.  Many more people being pulled back into the office.  Have been told CEO doesn't like WAH and the culture that exists."
good,"It is about who you know, not what you know with this company.  There is a lot of nepotism and favoritism unfortunately as well.  It is not as associate focused as they would have you believe, or member focused either.  Treating your associates like pieces of property, not promoting due to performance but due to who you are friends with, and black balling associates when they go to HR is not a winning recipe for long term success.  In regards to the members, sometimes the claims paid and how they are paid is determined by their position in the company they work for.  Understanding that insurance companies are businesses and have to make money, there still is a line you just do not cross.  "
good,"Anthem gave me the opportunity for career advancement, learning opportunities as well as tuition reimbursement.  The support and encouragement was a plus."
good,My boss retired after 48 yrs. I miss my job and boss. I loved working for Auditing our team was located in 14 states which I was admin to the whole team. we had a strong code of ethics and conduct. I was always able to discuss matters with my Director.
good,The company is has completely changed the larger they got. They lost site of the employees. It is no longer about the employees and how to better do their jobs.
good,"It was very micro managed.  Rules became very very strict as time went on.  Your evaluated on every single call.  Not allowed to leave your desk, unless you notifed management.  and half the timethry could not be found."
good,Training was okay but could benefit from focusing on most relevant issues that we routinely need to address.  We had two 15 min breaks and half hour lunch tightly scheduled in the day.
good,"Anthem is better than some places but depends on the department and management. "
good,We worked with a small staff. very stressful.  I'm a very hard worker so that did not bother me. Enjoyed my coworkers everyone was very helpful to one another.
good,I do not understand why a review of this company and job are needed.  Anthem is a good job.  I would have stayed longer if situations hadn't allowed a move out of state.
good,"It's a great job to start an entry level position in corporate America. The pay is decent, medical benefits are amazing and cheap, and many opportunities are available for career advancement."
good,"this company lays off employees randomly every year, which poses the biggest concern for job security. The lay off has nothing to do with your performance."
good,"It is a nice place to work, nice building and people are friendly. Somethings are not the right fit for everyone. You have to judge for yourself. That is all I can really say. One of the questions wanted to know if I approved of the CEO, I selected yes because it was a yes of no question but just for the record I don't know the or anything about  CEO, so honestly I should not have been a question that required."
good,recently heard they had another layoff....not considered a secure job my many.. advanced roles allow quality to get you fired...lots of layoffs  almost annually
good,Anthem offered a very nice environment to work and offered very good benefits.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my coworkers and learning new skillsets.
good,"Anthem has embarked on ScaledAgile as a way a life. We are into year 1 into our Lean-Agile journey. Anthem has provided the funding, leadership and forward thinking to continue on this journey since I started a year ago."
good,i received immense training over the 8 year period i was employed. my team and management were excellent. corporate policy and changes were left to be desired at times.
good,"providing review of benefits"
good,"for the most part they seem to care about team members. Awesome benefits. Very engaging with the public. Enjoyed working with the associates on a daily basis, and leading them to a successful career with Anthem."
good,"Job security was ok. They tried and help those who need help. The pay was very low. Nice place to work, just pay was too low. Nice location but the pay was low."
good,First thing is check emails for automation report. In and out of meetings most of the time. Had to work after hours. The work was enjoyable. Great boss. Great people
good,Good company in the midst of major transformation initiative that if successful may lead a reformation and remaking of the healthcare industry in the United States.
good,"Large company, many work from home opportunities. Large IT projects that can last years with many members. Many training classes are offered. Ample PTO time is offered as well."
good,Customer Service is an aquired skill that takes patients and firmness on an as needed basis. It takes persistence and perseverance and fast decision making to help get it done
good,"On my second position with the company.  High stress and long hours, but I am concerned this is due more to the department in which I work than the company as a whole."
good,"being familiar with a computer, I applied to work in Marketing first, until a position came on the board to use my skill."
good,Treated like children in preschool environment.  Had to raise hand to gain permission to use restroom.  Creepy supervisor would constantly listen in to calls and give lousy feedback on a daily basis.  CONTROLLING environment!
good,The people were awesome the pressure management puts on you is unfortunate they have quotas and deadlines to meet and if you don’t do it and do it right you minus well not do it at all
good,Working for Anthem had it's pros and cons. It could be a very stressful job and during peak seasons required no take off and overtime.  I for the most part had good managers and there is room for growth.
good,I was employed here and loved the job. The only thing I did not like was the long commute each day from hampton to va beach. ..........................
good,"I spent most of my career at Anthem in various roles and they empower growth and opportunity. I've had some great bosses and some not so great bosses but that's how we learn and grow in each role. Not everything bad is bad. It's a learning experience and offers growth potential. The workplace culture is good and employees are very friendly and willing to stop and help you, if needed. I enjoyed working for Anthem."
good,There are many changes happening at Anthem and do not feel me providing a review at this time would not be well rounded.  I have not been at the company long enough
good,This company pays well and offers benefits including Paid Time Off (PTO) and has many locations to choose from when seeking employment. Some positions may work remotely.
good,"Everything you expect from a corporate office job, good people and management. just the tendency to get lost among the ranks which makes it difficult for career and personal advancement."
good,The give you more responsibility with the same pay. They don't train you to be able to take escalated calls but you take them. They have chats to help with the calls however there is a slow response in getting assistance.
good,A typical day at work begins with conference calls that go all day. The work was often challenging with stressful deadlines.  The workplace culture was comprised of too many people that gave orders compared to having staff to actually perform the task.
good,"A fast-paced environment, that allows you to be self-geared and motivated for success."
good,I enjoyed working with my peers and also working in a virtual world with members over the phone was also a great experience as well. I would recommend anyone for employment.
good,The job at Anthem was fun and fulfulling. Training was slow paced and quickly moved forward. I felt somewhat unprepared when I started on the floor but had peers and job coaches to assist.
good,"This job was geographically out of the question for me. Two-hour commute one way was outrageous. Otherwise, downtown Atlanta was an exciting place to work. The Supervisor was fabulous. Co-workers were tight... except with new folks."
good,Average company to work for. No real opportunities to advance if you are a manager. Employees are not professional. Overall and average company to work for.
good,Anthem had a very low pay for the type of work that was being done.. Repeatedly stuck in traffic going to and coming from work. Hours were not bad at all. Attendance Policy was horrible
good,The work environment is agile and you would find your team in your office. Collaboration is easy. HR and Management is difficult to reach. Progressive to include new technologies and train the employees
good,"Great time to apply is before open enrollment. After that, you will not have any job security within the company unless you apply to another branch such as the Metrolink customer service department serviced by Alta Resources."
good,Anrhem is a good place to work. I enjoyed working there and I enjoyed doing claims. They have alot of audits and the information that is constantly changing is hard to locate and the script is written in a confusing way.
good,"Great co-workers, but bad decisions coming from corporate make it a tough work environment. Decent work/life balance. Not competitive pay versus other places in the twin cities."
good,"very busy"
good,"This job was so slow, you have to just sit there and wait for calls to come in with nothing else to do. I like fast pace jobs. I did enjoy the pay.I learned how to take my time with the customers and answer the questions as best as I can."
good,"I took incoming calls about questions from customers in regards to their health insurance coverage. Calls about in-network and out of network, what would be their co-pay"
good,"Anthem is not a bad job .. if you get placed in the right department you will love it .. I was only hired as an temp, but it was real messy the mangers did not want to assist us .So they left it to the supervisors. The supervisor had favorite and that’s how they choose lay offs ."
good,"Work in office, 9 to 5, but often will have to work over as business needs required it. Management was stressed, changing goals required constant adaptation, contracts had high level requirements from nursing to meet as do all government contracts. There was a bit of a gossip culture in Indianapolis, but that may have changed as it has been years since I worked there."
good,"It was all about the business not their  employees. They don’t care you. Not enough people to do the job, overworked. Letting employees go and not replacing them."
good,So faced paced and easy for a day to go bye so fast. Lots of people around to help anyone out that needs it.  Very fun place and management is excellent.
good,I worked downtown at the Lyle Center.  Conv parking in Banker's Life Fieldhouse parking garage.  Onsite gym (free).  Onsite cafeteria. Friendly coworkers.
good,Typical day is answering questions from seniors about Medicare Advantage plans. Not overly stressful. Enjoyable work as you feel like you are making a difference.
good,A Large organization that can not be as open to employees. Health care is a very complex industry. I learned a lot in relationship to working on a virtual team.
good,"Very nice place to work in the beginning, then another company bought them and things changed drastically.  People with many years of service was terminated or  their jobs were elimanated."
good,"It has been so long and the area I worked in has been moved and I really don't know what to say about the job."
good,"Wonderful career.  Management indicated that work force was being located to 4 hubs in the US, which my location was not on the list. Peers are great and now have many friends."
good,"I don't like doing this sort of thing on here. So you will get just as much info as i have provided on this website.. They told me i had to fill this out in order to proceed,"
good,great way to make money and they have good benefits if you have a family and calling in was an automated service so you didn't have to talk to a manager or rep.
good,Began working as a claims examiner until they lost the Medicaid contract.  Was retained as a Claim Adjuster adjusting claims company wide until the backlog was reduced.  I then worked as a customer service person until I left to take care of my terminally ill wife.  The company treated me fairly.
good,"typical day at work is : answers calls and assists customers and providers with claims, questions and all types of customer service The hardest part of of the job is to listen to some of the heart wrenching stories of health issues. the best part is when you can assist in anyway in helping them solve their problems"
good,"Workplace culture is balanced. Management is good. The hardest part of the job is our busiest time of year Annual Enrollment Period. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with my co-workers with great, professional and diverse personalities."
good,"Overall Anthem is a great company to work for, if you don't have a social life. There were many nights I stayed late to complete work of a client. The workplace culture is cut throat typical corporate america where you are a number and not a person. It very well may be the team I was on, but I loathed going in to work for people who did not appreciate me or my work. I started stressing out and ended up in the hospital a lot. Great money, but not worth it for me."
good,Decent place to work.  I need more job advancement. I'm currently looking for a career change. Job ecurity is very important and it may be possible lay offs
good,"It was a very face paced environment, "
good,Good place to work.  Depending on the area work can be stressful during peak seasons.  Work/life balance could be a little better.  A good place to learn alot about the health insurance field
good,Okay management. Flexible working hours and work from home possibilities. Location of Vegas office is good. Small office. Most employees enjoyable on the account management teams
good,"Good teaching, a bland but busy environment.  I was impressed by the computer system, chain of command was not always hands on for problem customers.  You had to trial by fire in many situations."
good,"typical day in a call center assisting providers with there claims. It is fast pace and very incentive. You must know how to multitask, and be able to read."
good,"The job was great. Easy to grasp. A day was busy with phone calls, management was good, they try their best to help out when needed. "
good,Anthem is a wonderful place to work. I think I would've been there longer if the contract didn't end. They're a company that hires and lay off quite frequently.
good,"No employee bonding, split divisions, no contact with others outside your group unless in the breakroom.. More team building experiences needed to connect the employees and make them feel valued. The company is so large they may forget the basics of making the environment enjoyable to maintain the employees for a longer period of time."
good,you have the option to work at home if you meet all requirements. you have to be able to meet production and quality goals. work mostly with by yourself. nice entry level job.
good,"Good company with great co-workers. The company offers an assortment of education opportunities and pretty good benefits. Most health plans have employee potlucks, lunches and have events for employees to have fun."
good,Anthem offers many different work options which helps with a working family.I enjoy it because I am able to work from home which really helps out with work and family balance
good,Good company to work for if you are okay with no advancement. The hardest part of the job was learning all the procedures and some of the medical terminology. I enjoyed the most meeting co -workers who went above and beyond to help when I had just started. Great benefits.
good,This position was not what I expected.  You sit in a cubicle taking phone after phone call and toggling between systems trying to assist customers when at times the information provided to you in a system is incorrect.
good,"intake coordinator- retrieving authorizations for medical inpatient and outpatient procedures."
good,Growth potential and advancement is possible.  Employees are encouraged to expand their knowledge base and given opportunities to do so.  High earning potential is a plus.
good,"were not paid enough for the amount of stress and extra work you are required to deal with and preform. the managers on the floor are great, theo ther employees are great people"
good,Overall Good once training was completed. There is a lot of information and not enough time to learn all of it. most of the time was spent hands on. Otherwise good company to work for.
good,Anthem is a major insurance corporation and so must be operated as such. As long as you keep your head down and voice low you will be fine. The culture was very controlled and contrived.
good,The company tended to have quite a few family oriented hires within the specific office sometimes over more qualified employees as well as depending on favoritism without taking into consideration employees with more time and experience when it came to upward training and promotions.
good,"Work was offloaded onto your plate with no training and you were expected to pick up the slack for others."
good,"Managed all aspects of high risk cases in the department of Disease Management within Anthem Blue Cross. I enjoyed the teaching aspect of the job, working with high risk patients."
good,"A typical work day consist of troubleshooting, resolving issues. conference calls and managing projects. I've learned how to appreciate change and multitasking."
good,"No complaints."
good,Anthem is a good place to work. I have some good colleagues who are really a good team player. Overall I like this company so much. I didn't have any bad experience in this company.
good,At BCBS they micro manage their employees you on your own no proper training you cannot ask another manager a question if your regular manager is out the managers is not really trained to assist new employees. Everyone is on their own they give you no  hope is like slavery allover again the hardest part of this job is when you ask your manager a question and she cannot tell you the answer she tells you to find your paper work.
good,Its not terrible working at Anthem. Its really on what path you want to go in your career. The company has one pool for PTO which is strange since there are no sick days and its an insurance company.
good,"Anthem is a great place to start if you are new to the insurance industry. The opportunity to learn from experience pros on company structure, building teams and growth. Management is constant changing due to market trends. The workplace culture is low, could improve."
good,My typical day start with a smile. I was a Customer Service Representative for LAUSD Large Group Accounts. My main objective was to assist member with their denied claims.  I also submitted all Appeals and Grievance request to open up a case as request by member.
good,"Consistently working within a ""firedrill"" status.  Multiple deadlines and limited resources to complete tasks.  Lack of overall leadership and ownership."
good,This could be a very good company to work for. There are certain situations that can make you think otherwise. There are certain situations that they make more difficult than it needs to be. I had a lot of trouble trying to get things situated when I had to go on medical leave as well as advancement.
good,answer incoming calls in reference to major medical insurance. explained to members on how to find Dr. in their network. Reached out to Dr.s to make sure they would accept the insurance. Help members with claims and educating about their plan
good,"Very low accountability. The company is not centralized therefore, many state plans do what they want. From an HR perspective, this makes it difficult to execute a global strategy when resistance is encountered and fostered by the various plans."
good,It was interesting learning from all the different personalities in the company. Working from home is a great benefit that this company gave me. This company was a great learning experience.
good,"Many opportunities available.  Would recommend to recent college grads.  Tuition reimbursement, Very diverse, Seasoned employees with great amount of knowledge. Mentorship programs available."
good,"Not the best place if you want to grow. Management is very unorganized and doesn't know how to take responsibility for an error, rather they blame the newer employees."
good,"Not Providing a Reveiw for this employer, my experience because my experience could negatively effect someone's view of this employer; yet my experience with this employer was very fruitful and pleasant."
good,"My interaction was within my consulting contracting team. The main interaction with the users and management was with the team leads. None-the-less, I found working there pleasant. There were no special perks other than employee kitchens where coffee was amply stocked. I did like the surrounding area or neighborhood."
good,There is no foundation on which to fully understand or learn the task assigned or job position in many departments which can easily result in failure to have the knowledge to be successful in your position.
good,Is a fun work environment to work in. Every one that I worked with was friendly and very helpful. I would encourage others to work at this company due to the great culture that they display.
good,"Management needs improvement, but lots of support virtually.  Most members appreciated their benefits.  Lots of fun working with members all over the nation."
good,Where i meet alot of my food colleagues. Call center was busy but we made it through the day with alot of calls waiting but enjoyed every minute of it.
good,"I do not wish to participate with rating Anthem, Inc.  There is a gym and a cafeteria that is open for the employees.  The gym staff is very helpful"
good,This is where I decided to stake a claim in the PBM industry.  I learned what is need to be successful in the industry and feel in love
good,"Anthem is a call center, face paced environment which assists in helping participants to understand their medical insurance coverage from costs to deductibles, premiums and benefits"
good,our experience will depend on which department you work for and which leadership team is assigned to your unit which will likely vary. The pay is pretty good and you will learn fast with your feet to the fire. Everything is deemed urgent which makes prioritizing work a challenge.
good,"When I first started working here the managers bragged about no micromanagement. It was true at first, but now it's not they are always breathing down your neck about every thing. Managers are often no where to be found, and when they are here they have the biggest smiles on their faces where as the agents and OE's (team leads) are always overwhelmed. The work load is not worth the pay."
good,I loved working for this company. I had the best manager and OE ever. I would love to go back to this company and work awesome experience.
good,The culture at Anthem is one consistently seeking innovations to improve service and create efficiency to maintain ever growing demands by consumers and regulators.
good,"●	Answered an average number calls per day by addressing customer inquiries, solving problems and providing new product information"

good,"good place to work"
good,"a typical work day constant phone calls... I learned medical terminology, HIPAA, ICD 9, ICD 10, HCPCS, Nasco, OBN, Encoder Pro, Customer Service.  The hardest part of my job was helping another team with their calls.  The most enjoyable part of my job Paid time off and benefits..."
good,"could use more information in a typical days work with more work flow interaction with operations experts , learned mostly on my own after the initial training course , cultural of co workers are more of one ethnic group than a fair mix of ethnic groups, hardest part of the job was in meeting production in the highly complex projects where the claims were at the point of intricate capacity due to processing incorrectly from the beginning of the claims journey. the enjoyable part of the job was the fulfillment feeling of having done the job well and to the best of accuracy as possible for the benefit of medical providers and patients in the payment of their submitted medical bills.  a great feeling have done the job well and knowing that it was done right knowing the procedures to accomplish that goal. Management could be better in relation to communication between employee and manager."
good,Anthem is a very high pace high stress company it is not a job for everyone but in the right situation it can be good for some people
good,"an environment where favoritism prevails. this position does require a strict following of policies, regulations, and meeting company standards. it's the only way to advance, promote, and get the shifts you want."
good,work at home associate- auditing phone calls and grading them to ensure that company policy is being followed.having 30+ associates assigned to you a month.
good,I enjoy my job there is just not enough care in the department for this to be a great place to work. ALL the focus is on the members and none towards the people that take care of the members
good,Educating member concerning members about there acct. however I spoke with regular and irate callers because I was Customer Service III. Manager was not helpful at all.
good,"Horrible company!!! Inconsiderate of employees, everything is based around the higher ups. Will never work or apply to this company again."
good,"A typical day at work is comprised of engaging our members, submitting reports, and reviewing new daily job functions. The most enjoyable part of my job in when I engage our members that have questions about their benefits.  Some of our members are not fully aware of the wide variety of services that Anthem (Health Keepers Plus) Medicaid HMO  and the State of Virginia provide to their members, many of which are provided at no cost."
good,"I worked here for 13 years, could not promote. Its a solid company but it has its own outdated culture."
good,I am going to type 20 words here but I don't understand why you make people do this assuming a lot of people just post junk like this.
good,"Too much out sourcing. Loved supported the people and training them over the years."
good,A typical day is consistent of making calls and receiving calls and ensuring information is correct. A non-micro managing environment.
good,"Contract to hire position. Permanent hire was ensured. However, at a moments notice, about 75% of the 80 employees we let go."
good,"All decisions about day to day operations of local department are made at the very top of the management hierarchy and trickle down to the workers who are supposed to implement the decisions. Workers have little input about how work will be done or how changes could benefit productivity. Decisions made at the top seem arbitrary to workers below. There is no feedback loop and no transparency. The culture is very corporate oriented, is very hierarchical and rigid. Questioning why things need to be done a certain way are not tolerated. The culture does NOT reward maverick thinkers or problem-solvers. Better to stay within the box. Or better yet, just stay quiet and keep your head down."
good,"A typical day at work consists of receiving inbound calls from providers and hospitals. The main function of the Provider Services Department is to provide accurate claims and benefit information. "
good,Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield is a good place to work. I like how everyone is willing to lend a helping hand. The place itself is very quiet; I wish the employees were more interactive with one another.
good,It has wonderful hours and ok pay. The customer service reps are excellent at what they do. I feel that they could do better in supporting there employees.
good,"Very tedious work with no reward for achievement. The hours fluctuate weekly, so I can not get another job. They do not micro manage, but it is still a place that needs more leadership."
good,"I did a lot of different duties which was enjoyable so you didn't doing same thing all day"
good,"It is my current place of employment, and I can say that it is somewhere , that you can start to get your feet in the ground with the medical field."
good,"Nice work place. Manager is very supportive and understanding. The best manager I've ever worked for. Company focus on employees and their family health which is a good thing. Compensation could be a bit more, but I suppose one could advance and that would take care of the compensation issue."
good,"Wish there was better benefits and incentives . Management could be more professional. Call volume could improve ,we could use improvement of the systems we use on the daily basis and I wish the lunch break was an hr."
good,"This company has great benefits, you can pick a flexible work schedule and work from home.  At the same time, if you do a great job, they prevent you from moving up."
good,"I do like that fact that I can telecommute except its only ""part time"". And people don't stick to their word, upper management in particular."
good,"Good Company with great benefits, however, lots of changes and more adjustments needed. Members need to know more about the policy before enrolling."
good,"Has great benefits. Rewarding postions within this company. Great people to work with. Awesome gym, and cafeteria. Learned to work hardier than what is excepted of requirements."
good,This company has opened up a vast variety of opportunities in the Healthcare Industry. Medical healthcare will also be  in demand.  This has given me knowledge and opportunities to grow in the  field of Insurance. For that I truly grateful.
good,"Not a bad company to work for, but the culture has changed since I started in 2007. If you land in the right department, you can do well at Anthem."
good,"Good company and good people to work with some bad apples. Best colleagues I have worked so far. I suppose when the company grows with mergers, things change."
good,"Typically assisting our client with all aspects of healthcare, learned about claims, eobs, and about medicare. Worked with great group of co-workers who were always willing to assist as well as the management team.  The hardet part of the job is trying to satisfy all clients and stay within the guidelinnes."
good,A typical day at work is pretty much getting to work.  The environment is production based so you want to get as many claims processed as possible while meeting the Quality standards. I have learned a lot about medical codes and how to read them.  I've learned about Commercial Insurance and HIPPA Guidelines. Management is friendly but can be a bit un-accessible due to constant meetings. Love my co-workers they really care about each other and reach out to each other for assistance. The hardest part of the job is just getting your speed up and making sure to pay attention to all details on the claim. I enjoyed my team and the people I worked with.
good,A typical work day would consist of a heavy volume of calls from potential Medicare customers calling to enroll or dispute situations. Management was okay as well as my fellow co-workers. My job wasn't hard but i loved to help the older customers.
good,"receive, process, and respond to provider inquires, generate letters, prepare cases for nurse review. stay on top of production"
good,"overall good company"
good,There are a lot of opportunities for growth in the company. The benefits are not great at all especially since they own the actual insurance.
good,You have the ability to grow within the company. Great health benefits as well as help with continued education. Overall a pretty good company to work for.
good,Got my management start here.  Supporting staff very cooperative and caring.  Enjoyed my job because it was different every day with a diverse set of people to work with.
good,Anthem is a great company to work for. I have learned to be very independent and work efficiently. I feel that management can be a little more caring toward the employers and a little more organizing within the company.
good,"Love working in a organized enviornment, and look forward to learning new things, flexible, everyone works as a team,, give you the ability to learn new things"
good,"The dept. that I work in is new and constantly changing policies, procedures, and is now eliminating positions, mine being one of them.  I was not assisted in finding another job."
good,"Project meetings to stay abreast on Sales Training needs for CA Individual and Small Group Market. I enjoy working with the people and communicating with them."
good,The hardest part was getting help on a question you had you could sit there all day. It is very independant work and they take your time to make sure you get the proper training.
good,"at the beginning i loved my job. Towards the end with knowing we are to be laid off, seems moral was down tremendously which everyone on edge and very tense"
good,I learn corporate culture from here. I learn how to do corporate tie ups. Did a corporate tie up with NTPC and Ordinance Factories for slat sale.
good,"As I was employed as a Scientist Trainee in this company , my work  with my co-workers helped me gain more insight about the experiments which have a much different practical approach than the theoretical one . As a researcher , I was more delighted and lucky to be here because the kind of projects all of them worked on inside the lab required a strong base in Chemistry and they were brilliant in every concept. For me as a younger scientist, interaction with them and getting a chance to indulge in 3 projects for just a span of 7 months was helpful and remarkable."
good,"Once you actually figure out what the job is that you supposed to be doing its really easy. the only thing is if you don't like doing a lot of research or calling around then, this might not be the place for you."
good,This place of business is not fast paced enough to keep me going. I was in training for 6 mos. and then the company downsized. I found the work to be boring.
good,"Anthem, Inc. offers a host of opportunities for positions with great work life balance including tuition reimbursement and exceptional healthcare benefits."
good,I enjoy my time there. I meet a lot of great people. I made good money but I did not like to be on the phones. A new manger came into our department and she was very rude and mean to us so I decided it was my time to go
good,"I would assistant customers in finding new providers or with their bills and I would also help providers with bills.  The hardest part of the job would be dealing with customers that were upset b/c their provider was changed w/o their knowledge, but I would assure them that we would get it changed back to the provider that they wanted with no problem.  I enjoyed working with my co-workers and I got along with all of them and I also got along with the management."
good,"good company to work for as far as benefits, people are friendly and the work schedule is very flexible, they also have work from home option which is very helpful."

good,"Work at home job, working with a team of co workers to manage a group of Ohio members enrolled in a Medicare Sr Advantage Plan. My position has been variable in my role since starting at Anthem. I was first hired as a Case Manager to make follow-up phone calls after members were discharged home after an admission to a facility. I then transitioned to calling members and family members while the member were in the acute care setting trying to help facilitate discharge planning needs before they were discharged home. I was then transitioned to the role I am now in managing a load of members from 20-35 currently at a skilled nursing facility/rehab/ LTACH. During this current role I work closely with the Medical Director to help coordinate approved days and issuing denial of days from Medical Director while in the facility. I work very close with the facility contact at the facility helping them with the proper discharge planning of the member. At times when needed, I make phone calls to the member or family members when there are concerns about their insurance. I have also been trained in working new precerts to facilities and also handling some acute care cases that are per diem using Milliman guidelines."

good,"It is a good place to work but very interested, The people at Anthem are willing to help people and making sure that new hires are learning and getting the conception of the job duties."
good,Hard working team. Interesting Projects. Working remote model works well but can be challenging. High growth industry leader.
good,"Great company overall, but there's little to no room for improvement. Communication is poor and leads/managers generally aren't on the same page when it comes to assigning work."
good,"Large Company, decent benefits. Local office with corporate headquarters out of state."
good,Locked up as far as movement even coming in as Temp employee. The managers of the department will not write a letter of recommendation for anyone and will not agree for you to go the a new department to work full time.
good,"Anthem was a great family company, with tons of opportunities to grow. Basic phone skills, filing and administrative work. Coworkers were always willing to help. Each year we received a bonus around christmas time, which helped out during the rough times."
good,"Manage and coordinate action plans for daily operations and ensure customer inquiries are handled effectively while meeting cost, productivity and quality goals.  Handle escalated issues, answer product-related inquiries, research broker issues and resolve discrepancies ensuring one call resolution."
good,not employee focused or customer focused....anthem focused.
good,great job benefits and job security . anthem blue cross is also estblished
good,"Typical days at work would consist of 8 hours on the phone, making 60 or more calls. Management was more micro managed. The co-workers were usually fun and entertaining to work with.

good,Typical day at work consisted of fulfilling customers request and inquiries via telephone and/or mail.

good,Great place to get your foot in the door. Interesting and enlightening.
good,WellPoint (Anthem) is an amzing company to work for with room to grow.  I would like to see the company get more involved with prepping their employees to move on to bigger job opportunities. Most of the staff is very friendly and helpful.

good,In the heart of Atlanta very busy with a starter plan. Very busy place.
good,"The project I was on had been in process for 6 - 12 months when I started. I had been hired as a Java programmer but really they were still in design mode. I spent my 3 months there working as a Systems Analyst. "
good,I was working 2nd shift lead Operator and only left this company to persue an employment opportunity with Yale University.
good,"The complaints of the call center made the work difficult, and not having the ability to solve or find resolution, or at the very least manage the process until fully adjudicated, made the process frustrated."
good,To much work to accomplish in 8hrs. Production type work for professional nurses but unrealistic to do within the given work hours.
good,Call center work environment.I learned about the Affordable Care Act. Management was not licensed so they couldn't help with the sales issues. My co-worker were knowledgeable. The hardest part of the job was the low call volume. I enjoyed helping the clients.
good,Good. Cooperative Co-workers. Tight deadlines. Excellent  domain exposure.
good,WellPoint is so big which offers a lot learning and growth opportunities to anyone who wants career development in the healthcare industry.

good,Very high standards on ethics and compliance. You are always a part of a team and everyone is always so helpful.
good,"decent place to work. I needed something different. I could not sit in a cubilce and stare at my computer all day. "
good,"Longer than 40 years, never a dull moment because of very complex issues and limited resources to resolve those problems. They provide great trining resources and ability to move up in posistion. But a lack of upper managment understanding the complex issues is what makes them from becoming a great company. The people who work their are great and it is a good company but it needs some minro tweaks."
good,I don't remember much about my time at Anthem BC/BS. I started with the company as a temp and was eventually hired permanently
good,This was a start up that was started with 5 other girls from Kennesaw State. We were working on a prototype to develop a new healthcare product.

good,"Highly efficient technical leads and developers"
good,WellPoint is an ok place to work.  Like most companies your experience depends on you.
good,"Anthem offers their employees a variety of benefits and also the chance to remotely work from home.  It was a pleasure to work at Anthem, however, at times I felt over-worked and under-appreciated.  Overall, still a good company to work for."
good,"The Major Accounts Reps have multiple duties so being able to multitask is a definite must all while dealing with frequent interruptions.  It is a rather fast paced environment.  In Virginia the reps are responsible for processing group premium payments, membership enrollment applications for active and COBRA participants and processing electronic enrollment files.  Open enrollment could be very stressful periods and the heaviest ones occur at the end of the year coinciding with the holidays so by January everyone is a bit frayed."
good,"I liked the job that I used to have at Wellpoint because every day is a new day to learn and to have the great opportunity to become more knowledgeable.  As the guidelines change, there are always new procedures to learn.  It is okay to work there since they offer great benefits, such as reimbursement for students."
good,WellPoint Inc is one of America’s leading providers of affordable health insurance with more than 33 million medical members. One of every nine Americans is a member of a WellPoint affiliated health plan. WellPoint is a Blue Cross or Blue Cross Blue Shield licensee in 14 states.
good,"I am always multi-tasking and meeting new people"
good,Coming from an IT environment  learning another type of jobs was a great experience s
good,"CSR"
good,I learned so much being employed with WellPoint.  I learned all the products we offered and had the opportunity to learn and process insurance claims.  The hardest part of my job was not being able to reslove all disputed inquries due to timing or certain qualifications were not met.  The enjoyable part of the job was when I could put a smile on someone face for the day or add a bit of relief for their concerns.
good,"WellPoint is well known in the community due to their product/service being that of health insurance.  The company employs many, but the opportunities for growth and advancement are not readily available."
good,"The people I worked with were great.  Learned how to use various tools in performance testing in Unix/Sybase environment.  Manage was fine, but all associates are under constant threat of losing their jobs.  A majority of the IT jobs have been outsourced to offshore companies.  Enjoyable part of the job was thoroughly testing changes that were ultimately successful and readied for promotion to the Production environment."
good,I would like a position where I can maximize my potential along with eligible stability status. 
good,"As a claim processor, I am responsible for making sure the claim processes accurately and timely. I feel that my position reduces the stress for the member and helps in assuring them that their bill has been taken care of. I enjoy being able to help others to be at ease when it comes to paying their bill."
good,"I learned great customer service skills here, and good work ethics"
good,Overall good company to work for in a diverse setting. Great benefits and flexibility.
good,"Typical day: Always busy, unless the system was down, which was seldom"
good,"Wll[point, Inc is a very good copany to work for because they show you how much they value their employees. I had good relationships withmy management and co-workers. The hardest part of my job was working on a project that you can only do so much because its someone else's responibility before the project canbe completed. I work very well as a team player, and find myself at times over extending myself to make sure the job gets done in a timely manner. My most enjoyable oart of the job is when I get to work as a team becaue it allows us to interact and build very good relationships."
good,A typical day at work is not bad. Management tends to show favoritism to certain people which makes it hard to have advancement opportunities
good,scheduling was terrible. I liked the job itself. staff was cool.
good,A typical day at work is being on the phone and assisting providers with claims and giving them the requested information on different insurance policies. I have learned so much at Wellpoint I have sharpened my computer and customer service skills I type 35plus wpm. I have also learned hw to toggle between many different systems and hoe to multi task. I have to type letters and memos for provider on a dailt basis with any requested information. My co workers love me I keep them smiling and I am a very positive individual. The hardest part of my job is to see a customer upset I strive very hard to assist them my their experince much better. Most enjoyable is to be able to provide the best customer service and provider accurate information effeicently to providers.
good,• Researched and resolved pending claims
good,"The company was great to work for when it was Bcbs of Ga now that it's under the anthem umbrella lots of things have changed, massive lay offs have been going on for the last 12 months of permanent employees only to be replaced w/ temps to save the company on providing benefits or giving higher pay. Management was great if your manager was in another state because the managers in the office were all buddy buddy & several weren't qualified to do the jobs they held."
good,This company went from a not for profit to for profit and it changed the whole dynamics of the company. Employees were treated like numbers and they took care of their own.
good,"Not consistent, managment is over bearing and does not work"
good,Busy typical day at work. Billing and membership and dealing with internal and external customers. Co-workers friendly and team players.Hardest part of the job-helping other associates and explaining to them certain steps of the job. Enjoyable part of the job was going to work every day. Job security was there up until a year ago when they started out sourceing jobs.
good,The dompany started out great and I enjoyed it. The best part was the people I worked with and the fact that the company really cared about the employees. Over the years that has changed and the compensation is not enough for the work I do not to mention the unstable job security.
good,"My experience was in a call center environment. It can be a good place to work if you like helping people. The management style is very top down, and when I left there was an expectation that my position would soon be outsourced to Manila. I don't know if that happened after I left."
good,Your conversations are recorded on a daily basis and you have to que every word and detail that is covered on the phone with the customers.
good,"WellPoint is a good place to work, however, improvement is needed in the following areas:"
good,A typical day for me was several meetings a day to work on the projects assigned to; this was my first job in the Health Insurance Industry and the learning experience was great. I had the opportunity to work with great people.
good,I work in a fast pace enviroment that requires multi-tasking. Must be very knowledgable and meet high levels of excellence.
good,"Wellpoint, Inc. is a good place to work. They offer good benefits."
good,"You stay to yourself, easy going and laid back. Take phone calls and send them to the right department for the call. Management was nice and friendly."
good,This was a good learning experience for mutitasking and escalations daily. I worked with 2 majore accounts General Motors and Ford employees regarding their benefits and precertifications. Fast paced and demanding.
good,"The work environment has changed. In the beginning, the culture was friendly and inclusive. Management has changed and things have turned somewhat stressful and toxic."
good,"Working for Anthem was fun, but there is way way way too much red tape to get to simple answers to simple problems.  Zero cross-department cooperation or understanding.  And don't you dare make a mistake or you'll be treated like a criminal no matter how much you proved yourself ahead of time.  Policies and procedures change several times a day and you will be expected to somehow keep up and be accountable for it no matter how busy you are."
good,Company is a national health insurance company. At least one in four people who have health insurance are an Anthem member. Company supports self-starters and innovative ideas. Work from home privilege is great!
good,"Excellent benefits, however from the perspective of the job I performed, management is unfamiliar with how the job is done, therefore leading to an unsympathetic attitude that doesn't allow them to take into consideration intricate details that change from call to call. This allows them to create unrealistic, unattainable goals. This mis-read leads also leads to stress and low moral among employees, leaving them feeling unappreciated and doesn't identify their true capability potential."
good,"I worked at this company for a year . Training is for 6 weeks , followed by a knowledge test. You must pass the test to stay employed here.I left because . 14.00 an hour wasn’t enough. Also it’s hard to take off or stay home sick because you don’t have many days of pto. Work -life balance wasn’t good. Great health benefits and room for advancement!"
good,The people at Anthem are a great group of people to work with. I've established some great relationships and have managed some really talented people... People who have the same goals in mind and put the customer first in everything that we do.
good,"Anthem has a culture of inclusiveness. Fast paced and every changing work environment. Health insurance is an ever growing field, therefore, Anthem, Inc. offers many opportunities for advancement within the company to allow for growth in the industry. Management could be more team oriented, hands on, and knowledgable. I've learned how to read claims in detail, coordinate medical benefits, update verification of health insurance, communicate, via phone and web, with health insurance carriers."
good,i process claims on a daily basis. i have to make sure that some procedures are allowed.  I have to verify that the person is eligible at the time of service.
good,Anthem was a great place to work for awhile the pay was decent you got by. They are trying to take away shift bids so that once your hired on to a shift that’s the shift you are stuck with. I worked 10-7 and we went for shift bids and of course everyone wanted early shifts due to incorrect information being told and everyone thought they would get what they want . They only could pick TWO a people from my entire department to get a decent schedule. If you have kids PLEASE have something lined up before taking the job depending on the schedule you receive. As an insurance company you would think they care about your doctors appointments and things of that nature but of course not.
good,Very independent job reviewing appeals for denials based on coding edits. Requires confidence to stay on Task and meet the productivity demands. You are left to fend for yourself. There is no micro managing because management is too busy to pay attention to what you need. Plenty of great people and beautiful facility but no time to enjoy it. If bad weather or sick you are expected to work from home.
good,"Anthem was a great place to work for the first 5 yrs, they cared about their employees and then all the sudden it went down hill each year after. They seemed to care more about how much work you could get done with the least amount of resources."
good,"Not a bad place to work. But you must be ok with being micromanaged. And you must be thick skinned, as the callers can be very intimidating. Overall a good place...."
good,"Some ""teams"" have a better experience than others. The focus is solely on productivity/bottom line figures for those at the top with minimal concern with a work/life balance (though they say it is). To be an insurance company, you'd think the insurance benefits would be better than they are. Expect a High Deductible plan if you elect their coverage."
good,"Direct Superisor had issues but my Manager was excelent, there was enough work to keep busy which made the day go fast, Completed miner repairs on the Mail Machines, Received bonuses quarterly, Required to stand the entire shift."
good,I am currently employed by this company.  The work balance is tough and could be updated to allow employees to take a  a 1/2 day instead of using a full day for doctor appts. or children's activities.
good,Not a bad place to work. The pay could be better but it's a fair starting rate. Not much growth but you can always apply internally after a year in a role.
good,Learned alot.  Very good with upsklling employees.  They are in the middle of Agile transformation so there is a lot of pressue to succeed and to learn.
good,Position was not challenging enough.  Very little feeling of accomplishment.  My area was adverse to changing processes.  There was poor communication.
good,"Worked morning shifts, the commute there was very exciting. I've learned to have patience in this work., Kept busy and mostly did a lot team work with this job."
good,I was making great money .... They approved PTO quickly...... The people were nice ................................................................... The job was causing me to much anxiety! They would train you but it didn’t really prepare you to go on the floors !
good,I just wished I was not blind sided. I got severance pay but I was the ONLY person laid off in my department. nothing was announced. The manager purposely picked me then tried to throw my sister under the bus in another department with HR. At the end she lost her job but I do not know the reason but justice served.
good,"we get to listen to the artist perform, and even get to cater to them also. we have alot of responsibilities such as cleaning, dish washing, popcorn stand, preping food such as sandwiches, kielbasas,"
good,"I began my day by checking the list of members I was to call and offer the case management services to and then started calling the members to see if  they wanted case management  services. It was fun to talk to the different members, but difficult to help them from a desk miles away from them."
good,"Very flexible and company likes to promote within. Management is highly involved and assist with direction. Expectation are high, but management believes in work/life balance."
good,"i worked 4 different position the 5 years I was  there so my typical day varied from being busy to laid back and relaxed and with all the experience in each department I learned a lot for enrolling member to supporting case manager nurses, the job was very diversed in culture and I guess that would be the hardest part learning a different culture, which can also be the most enjoyable is being able to learn that culture"
good,"I spent a long time truly loving my job. However, with upper management changes, a lot of my essential functions for the team took a backburner and the team stats suffered. There are a lot of great things about Anthem. I just wish my story had a happier ending."
good,Anthem claims department is a stressful work environment. The numbers that they are expecting an employee to kick out can be a little ridiculous. The training was very poor which caused production to be low and the work environment to be stressful. Management felt like she had done all she could do to help and no more help has been offered. During one on one meetings I'm constantly told my numbers are low and that I will be written up and the next step would be termination.
good,"The work was boring and tedious.  though we were treated as individuals there was almost no way for me to  advance from where I was.  This was disappointing as the work i did was better earlier but when we  were required to be, Faster,  it just wasn't feasible ."
good,"I'd worked for Blue Cross Blue Shield for a few years. When I moved to Atlanta, I went from MD's Careerist to GA's Anthem. I LOVE Careerist a lot btr."
good,"Fun environment, hard work. Very good team. Little micro management .Decreased ability for advancement. People friendly, nice building , parking not so good"
good,"Blue Cross has some of the best benefits from an employer I've ever encountered. Although there is room for advancement, management makes it hard to make that possible. The most irritating thing about Blue Cross is the micro-managing. You are always being watched and criticized even if you are the perfect worker."
good,"un trabajo estable, estresante por la cantidad de desafios que se proponian todos los dias, muy buena capacitacion"
good,"Anthem BCBS is the largest Blue Cross Blue Shield insurer in the country with BCBS in 14 states. Locally Anthem purchased DeCare, a Minnesota dental Payer.  Prior to acquisition,DeCare managed dental insurance for several non-Anthem Blue Cross's, Ireland and numerous Delta Dental organizations in multiple states.  Departments work together well to achieve goals and objectives.  Generally communication is high and the people are willing.  If you like a fast paced environment with quickly changing goals this might be the company for you."
good,"Productive and fun workplace.  Most managers are fun and very good to work for. The vacation time is great, benefits aren't that great and expensive. Co-workers are a pleasure to work with."
good,"Good company to work for. Good CEO -good management. I would recommend this company for a person to start out at, trying to develop a career. The staff is personable and helpful."
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company until recently for many reasons that cannot be mentioned on a public site.  The hardest part of the job is having to keep up with constant changes that are created from upper management.  The goals and expectations can be unrealistic.  The best part of the job is being able to work from home as there are much less interruptions, and no time loss on commutes."
good,"WhIle I enjoyed my job, I did not like how the group managers played favorites   "
good,"Excellent benefits, very demanding job, friendly staff.  Hardest part was the daily commute ( traffic and distance) and staying away from family 5 days a week. Learned a lot about health insurance, case management and UR."
good,"I enjoyed working with my team. It was a great group of professional who would always help when needed. However, the company is currently going through a restructure."
good,Anthem is very organized operational and has the capability to be a great place of employment. The culture is comparable to its competitor UHC and which is quite above average. The experience I had was that when I was hired I was told I would have to work weekends twice a year. After 1 month into the job I was told I would have to work weekends 12 - 20 weekends a year and I was the only one in the group that had to do that.
good,"Learned a lot about health insurance. Overall good company to work for. During Open Enrollment, Anthem makes the job fun when it can be intense. Work place culture is very friendly."
good,"Overall, Anthem was an OK employer. They do provide great benefits to you as an employee. They are flexible with work hours. However they are very strict when it comes to taking time off and being sick, etc. God forbid, your sick for a few days and they go into a panic attack. They could compensate better. I should be getting paid way more than what I am."
good,"During the first few years it was an amazing experience. Lots of growth opportunities and raises, after merging with Anthem it became deplorable to work there."
good,"High expectations with not a lot of the tools you need to succeed. A typical day will consist of taking many calls from some rather upset customers. Management is okay, they try to stay engaged. I loved my coworkers, great team culture."
good,"Anthem Inc is a great company. It has taught me a lot and has allowed me to achieve a lot in both, my professional and personal space. The ease of being able to get up and go to work without drressing up, having a fresh lunch most days and see kids go to school and come home happy is a big advantage of the flexibility Anthem provides."
good,"I worked at Anthem Blue Cross for about 4 years."
good,A typical day would include numerous emails about any information that has been updated or changed. If there is a meeting then the department would have a meeting all together to discuss the changes. Employees and management got along very well. The employees listened to their calls and looked at their surveys on how to improve the call time and flow.
good,Anthem is a very productive health insurance company that truly does its best to give the best possible service to their consumers
good,It was a good place work. It was a experience. And the people were friendly. Didn't like when time to get off from work. The traffic was bad. It took up to 1hr to get out on the highway
good,"A typical day at work would be get into work:"
good,"While Anthem has many policies as it relates to conduct, ethics, and like corporate organizational assets and environmental factors; it moves very slowly, often ineffectively, and in a very cumbersome manner in effectively applying those policies.  Much of the operational aspects of its companies then are very bureaucratic,with very rare and little authentic desire and effort to improve among its companies' staff.  The only constant drive is to expand market share in businesses.  Legitimate attention to best practices and those who are striving to adhere to them to better the company all-around are often and continually ignored."
good,Company truly is a great company! The CEO is very friendly and willing to help any way he can. Advancement is hard! Management in certain department is awful!
good,"Company is focused on customer service."
good,Constant updates and training keep staff informed of company goals. Improving managers ability to communicate to staff is needed. Quarterly bonuses and benefits offset low starting salary.
good,"The company seems to always be expanding, which puts its associates in a great positionto move around.  There are lots of opportunities to learn and grow."
good,handled customer service complaints and resolutions. Handled resubmission of claims for payment processing. Worked from 8 to 5:30 each day and oversaw several employees
good,"Working for Anthem has been a great experience. Great place to gain experience in case management, utilization management  and disease management."
good,This job could be very stressful at times. The nature of the work is difficult in itself but it becomes very stressful when having to deal with management.
good,I had a great experience working for the client. The business leads were very knowledgeable and helpful. The tools required to work effectively was provided by the client.
good,"Overall once you become a full time employee the company is great."
good,"My typical day at work is answering provider questions, writing letters and adjusting claims."
good,Everyone there was very professional  and wanted to be there for there students. The management was not so much.
good,"daytime hours"
good,Much just has to do with your immediate supervisor. Try to get under the Anthem side or the Amerigroup.
good,"Still a growing company, but fun to work for. Culture was second to none, and I grew with the company during my time there."
good,This was a difficult company to feel apart of. As a virtual employee they made little effort to include offsite employees. This is a company of great prestige so I hope that it was only the culture of that particular site.
good,**  What's the point in enrolling members into condition care program when their only incentive is to save money on their insurance premiums ??? These members have little if any interest in managing & improving  their core health condition. You might as well hire people who specialize in sales rather than professional well educated RN's.
good,Very comfortable setting. Easy to communicate with other associates in area or through email and instant messaging. Fast pace setting. Enough down-time to work on pended inquiries to reduce the pended inquiry volumes. Able to assist other associates with their researching needs. Always able to learn more processes with self-training systems and reviewing database. Great notification system to stay up to date on pertinent policies.
good,"I work in a call center and all though my manager gives me special projects to do, and also allows me to assist the supervisors quite often, my typical job is to answer calls from the providers to aide in resolving claim issues or confirming benefits for certain procedures. "
good,"I am a senior LVN who has worked here for over 7 years.  I work from home, and are looking for work at home positions only.  "
good,This company was always changing management and CEOs. This was not good for company moral.
good,Anthem provided a good training program to guide us in our duties. The manager was pro-active and stood beside us along the way. A typical day was to review outstanding urgent requests and respond in a timely manner. We also addressed Customer Worksheets for those with questions concerning their coverage. We also entered new insurance for members and their families.
good,"Best parts of job are ability to work from home, hard working co-workers with excellent work ethics. Day shift recently changed to 8am - 5pm Monday through Friday with 1hr lunch break. But, never able to make evening plans due to not knowing when you will actually get off. Have had opportunity to cross train to do multiple aspects of job. Multiple not well defined changes to company procedures have created stress and tension among all staff."
good,"A typically day at work is the phones being busy. Constantly multitasking between customers, emails and cases being worked . I 've learned that in order to have balance regardless of whether it is work or home, Respect and appreciation for the things people do should be noticed and not just assumed since it's the little people that make a good company run. Like a family good bad or indifferent it helps make the foundation run."
good,"I would work for WellPoint again if an opportunity came about, but the opportunities for advancement are few and far between."
good,"I enjoyed learning the various product types, and claims structure, process, billing codes, resolving customer issues and helping them understand their policies."
good,perform pre-authorizations for radiology procedures.
good,"My typical day would begin with logging into various CMS monitored systems to begin my days work of working on the issues brought to 1-800-MEDICARE's attention via CMS' CTM Team database. I would handle all of these complaints in their proper order determined by CMS & Wellpoint such as difficulty in procuring their needed Part D covered medications. When I received notice from Wellpoint that I was to be laid off due to a reduction in force, I applied for the Billing Department in Denver, CO. The Billing position caused me to move 1,000 miles with no company assistance, did not receive complete training for the new tasks I would be responsible for & was terminated."
good,Interact with customers to provide information in response to inquiries
good,"It was nice experience to work there ,got too much knowledge about new technologies and got nice work and a nice team and coo-operative team members"
good,I work Monday-Friday from 8:30 to 5:00 in a call center taking an average of 60-70 calls a day. I work with one of the best managers I have ever had and am sad that they are outsourcing my job because I will not be working with her anymore or a few of my co-workers.
good,"Member service advocate; utilize computer system and software to answer member’s questions regarding their health insurance; billing; deductibles; benefits; provider inquiries; and policy information. Maintain positive attitude, while consistently assisting members with policy inquiries and working inventory. Awarded multiple service hearts for excellence in customer surveys and compliments."
good,"I'm on production, which sometimes can be challenging, but I always put my best foot forward. The most enjoyable part of my day, is getting a task and completing it before a deadline, and that sense of accomplishment. My co-workers are awesome, team work is always shown. Management lacks in some leadership areas, but nothing that can not be an easy fix. The hardest part of the job is watching other team members not strive to be the best they can be, to make the company the best it can be."
good,Productive and great place to work. Love the company. A typical day at work.
good,"The work was stressful, as is any customer service position. Calls from irate or upset clients was a daily task to be dealt with. Generally the management was understanding and fair, however, I felt like my termination was unwarranted. I believe they were downsizing and looking for reasons to terminate employees without having to pay severance benefits."
good,"With this company if you are NOT a permanent employee you are definitely treated like an outsider, they separate you in groups and put you at the bottom of the barrel. As a contractor i was only hired until jobs were sent overseas. Never felt welcomed. i was told i did an awesome job and got paid well. Met some good people"
good,During my time at Anthem I had 6 different managers in less than a year due to the transitions going on internally. I think that without that I would have stayed with them.
good,Everything is money driven and board driven.  Laid off 200 people under the name of restructuring during company's best financial year.  Corporate goals don't even line up with the job you do.  Makes raises and bonus poor.  Local office is great.  Problem is with corporate.
good,Not a great work/home balance.  Management is numbers driven but very involved in the community.  Growth within the company requires higher education.
good,"Fast paced environment requiring multi-tasking and constant interruptions while helping the customer and managing my accounts. "
good,great place to learn about member services and dealing with customers. Learn about computer programs and data bases necessary to complete daily tasks.
good,Didn’t expect much from them as well because it was under contract . Working with women can be catty and petty but I’m always strong enough to handle it . Doing the actual job was the easiest part .
good,"I love my job.  Great hours 7 to 3:30pm, Able to work remotely, Able to assist other departments but no room for advancement and new management is getting rid of my department. I"
good,I love working at Anthem. I have worked here before and came back. Call center work is a job for very positive people that don't mind a lot of change.
good,Anthem is a great call center to work for if you just put the time in and actually work. The calls are nonstop and attention to detail is very important in this job.
good,"Nice place to work, downside is the hours can change every 6 months and you can work as late as 8pm-"
good,"Something it feels like the company does not care about you as a person, just someone to answer there phones. They do a lot of micromanagement.every minute of your is accounted for not much time to just take a breath."
good,"A typical day on this job could be stressful but, I learned to understand what the customers had to go through. Management could be a lttle more involved but, overall the workplace was casual and my teammates were helpful. The hardest part of this job was not always being able to give the customers what they deserved but, the best part was when I could."
good,"Work at home is a great job, however, building a team rapport can be difficult when the manager would like to be contacted for everything you do. Not all managers are in this category. It is a great job benefit wise."
good,"The company values it's associates however the pay does not reflect that. The pay is really bad but the benefits are great. You this is a great place to get your experience, but if you're looking for excellent pay you will have to sacrifice that for the time being."
good,"The phone system automatically connected calls in the queue, so it was nearly impossible to pace yourself or put away any pertinent material used in the previous call, especially if it needed further action. "
good,"worked for the company for 15+ years, but currently looking because my job is being moved to another state.  This makes it a bit difficult, since Nevada is not as desirable for me."
good,"I've learned a great deal with the company. I have learned a new software system, become more well versed on health topics I was not completely comfortable with before starting. "
good,"good benefit, good health insurance, ok PTO amount"
good,"Great laid-back environment. Knowledgeable management who were willing to help out and we're always accessible. Great benefits, wonderful cafeteria and staff."
good,"Telephonic medical management required constant time on the phone and high-speed typing skills. Working on a phone queue was relentless; getting a call, typing a synopsis of the interaction and getting off the call, then have another call drop in, nonstop. You weren't supposed to be on a call for longer than 5 minutes, if so then the manager would send out an email or come to each desk to see who was actually taking calls."
good,goal oriented company basing achievements on quick call flow and average call times. not very transparent on personal score sand tended to have a turnover rate of employees.
good,"I enjoyed working for anthem, It just wasn't a good fit for m, on an average day we answered phones answered questions about benefits and claims, I learned how to research for answers and read how the claims were processed, management was helpful in doing coaching if you did not understand something. The hardest part was the angry members yelling at you,I loved the member's that complemented us on how well we answered the call and how kind I was."
good,"The work environment varies from department to department especially after  the merger with Simply Healthcare and Anthem. With all the new changes and re-organizations, at times, many are unsure about their job security."
good,Anthem is a huge insurance corporation that employees thousands of individuals.  The insurance industry is a very competitive industry and because of the need to keep up with the changing environment there are often times cutbacks and new implementations that eventually eliminate jobs and staff.
good,"Anthem, Inc. is a great company and place to work.  The company offers competitive salaries and opportunities to make a difference in the quality of life for members."
good,"The interview process was really easy (panel interview) and fast (got the job in less than a week from submitting the application to job offer). Paid training lasted 6 weeks. Expect to learn more on the job though. Coworkers were probably my favorite part of the job. Hardest part was being on the phones because I'm not really the type of person who likes being on the phones for 8 hours a day. Management is okay but there seemed to be some favoritism when it came to promotions within the department as well as special projects. Also, occasionally there was mandatory overtime which wasn't always convenient. The pay was decent and they had a quarterly bonus incentive which was nice."
good,"I worked for Anthem in the earlier days of their company. I do not know what it is like now, but I do know what it like to work for a Schawk based company."
good,Great company to work for but it just depends on the department. I learned a lot working in claims and met some great people along the way. Would recommend to orhers.
good,"Anthem is a great place if you're looking to grow into management roles.  "
good,"A typical day at Blue Cross Blue Shield is upbeat, and fast paced. I learned the behind he scene operations of health insurance. Management was great, I had the best manager ever."
good,"It's a great place to work. It has great perks. It has great benefits. Employee car buying program. Benefit hub discounts, Anthem Care Fund, VTO VOLUNTEER TIME OFF"
good,"Confusion is often normal following a company take over, so it is likely things have settled down  and run more smoothly. "
good,Very stressful in the insurance industry.. For those who like to cultivate and retain relationships in the industry however the payoff is fantastic and lots of opportunity to grow professionally.
good,No never ever again . Never again will I ever work for that company.  This company was a strain on my health.  The company rules are too regimented like in concentration camp days.
good,"highly paid ceo and top of ladder employees"
good,"I love working with our customers and solving their issues. They are a large company and well known in the industry.  I just feel for personal reasons that it may be time for me to move on, depending on the opportunity."
good,"This company has many positions to apply from. From entry-level that requires a high school diploma to PHD degree required positions. Most positions have the opportunity to work from home which is great. Also, the benefits are very good."
good,Anthem provides competitive pay and benefits.  Management is generally supportive and willing to help.  Corporate culture and values on paper do not line up with culture and values in practice.
good,"Managers that micro manage make this job suck. Work in this job is not hard very easy to catch on with the different systems they have."
good,My job was to just sit at a computer all day and answer emails and do spreadsheets which was very boring.  As i processed agent on record forms if the form was incomplete the broker would get very mad over email since we needed the form for their commission.  The job did pay very well and had very good hours.  I also felt independent for this job which I loved.
good,when BC was taken over by anthem it changed the culture.  management needs to say what they mean.  Race needs to be non-discriminated.  work needs to be fair.  clicks needs to be stopped
good,"At the time, nurses were overworked and underpaid. The nurse to patient ratio was 7 to 1. They had mandatory on-call to cover the shifts thar were short, not a good thing for someone who works 8hr shifts."
good,It is your typical work day by coming in working hard and they do pay pretty well and have nice perks.  They also have a decent health ins package for employees
good,"not a good environment to work for if you are not experienced in a high call volume company, fast paced.  Short breaks, Operations Experts not all fair"
good,"Working at Anthem reminds me how to be grateful because there are a lot of people out there sick with the same illnesses and when it comes to reading medical records on a baby or a little child, it breaks my heart and i feel it is time to find other employment because it depresses me."
good,easy job to do if you like talking to customers everyday about billing issues. Good company values. Great work locations.
good,"High stress working environment, hard to get time off. They continually change middle management, customer service gets a higher salary and they route calls to us when they cannot find an answer."
good,"Worked in call center environment, handle customer questions about their insurance and claims. Resolved customer complaints"
good,"As a Care Manager, I provided telephonic support to members all day long.  Sitting in a cube with repetition of tasks was unpleasant for me."
good,"Worked there for almost 6 years. Management and co-workers were wonderful and friendly."
good,I use the computer to authorize faxed authorization requests or phoned in requests to help medicare members receive quality healthcare.  I enjoy my co workers.  If someone needs help they jump right in.  I enjoy helping people get healthcare access.  I do not enjoy sitting all day long.
good,I have been working for the company for years and it is not a bad place to work with great benefits.  Supervisors are caring and understanding.
good,Data entry of member and group applications for benefits.  Adapt to change with company training and benefits. Telephone calls to company representatives or members if have questions on applications.
good,"I came in got on the phones and did my job, which was helping the members. I enjoy helping people. You have to have thick skin to be in the phones all day with people. You deal with alot of different attitudes during the course of the day between co-workers and members."
good,"It is a good work environment with with great people to be around. The only thing I did not like was the unrealistic metrics, but that comes with any call center."
good,"Anthem's training program is very helpful in preparing you for the job ahead. Of course there is no way to predict every situation, but the training team does a great job teaching all research paths to facilitate finding a solution to every member that calls in."
good,Anthem is a diverse and educational place to work. Anthem has two locations in Richmond Virginia. The company offers two gyms for employee's and also cafeteria's in each facility
good,"My day consist of working Medical claims and trying to trouble shoot and see why the claims  were not paid, then to do research to  resolve the issue to get the claims paid in a timely manner. I learn things everyday due to the nature of the business and working Medicare Claims which can be challenging at times but then also rewarding at other times."
good,learned from this company got to utilize my skills and was trained to advanced my career as a medical billing processor. processing claims was a great way to meet your goals in production and always try to push on production to excel.
good,"typical day- managing phones and agent production"
good,"Great experience working at WellPoint Inc. management was very helpful and decisive, great working environment."
good,I learned you can retain a lot of information in a short time.  But all my co-workers where very helpful and friendly.  The hardest part was making the audits and productivity to answering the phones and saying the right things to pass.
good,"Only issues is we tend to get overloaded with answering too many call queues and using 2 different system on 1 screen for call documentation"
good,Anthem is a company that is more concerned about it's company growth than providing employees with tools needed to perform their jobs. Management always seemed too busy to be able to assist in any problem resolution and managers very seldom were on the same page in policies and procedures.
good,"Worked on Claims Processing , worked with Facets"
good,Daily reporting for Operations is challenging yet rewarding.
good,"Typical day: Visit hospital of management request to review inpatient clients and review their current care for authorization of services and determination of continuation of stay needs. Help organize discharge planning needs with staff as needed. Organize transfer with staff as needed. Upon return to office, daily meeting with Medical Directors to discuss patients and any issues in question. Letters of approval and denial as needed. Service both private insurers and Medicare insurers registered with Anthem (Anthem had a medicare program). Referrals to wellness programs and community programs as needed. Use of FirstLink in Ohio for various services"
good,Anthem trains its new employees so they are able to go onto the floor and work effectively. All employees had the support needed to answer all questions related to work and to assist with personal needs.
good,Kept busy during certain times of the year. After downfall of economy business went downhill.
good,We were always reminded of hard work and appreciation on a regular basis. They provided extensive training to help us be the best we could be.
good,I loved the money but the stress was just to much. Things change daily and having to remember one account to the next with 35 accounts per unit sometimes. Food is great there but pricey
good,"Learn something new each day, not a boring job"
good,Good Company with strong financial strength.  Typical for healthcare companies in technologies.  Best employee benefits and bonus structure.  Fair leave policies.
good,"Overall it is a good place but there is no job security as they fired a lot in 2019. Also, contractors face discrimination compared to full time employees."
good,"Casual dress code for customer service"
good,"I sought a position with this company because I needed a break from the bedside.  Although, it was great being away from the clinical aspect, I missed the flexibility of having 4 nights off per week. I don't regret my decision to leave because I went to school to become an RN and provide excellent patient care."
good,"So working at Anthem can be great depending on the department you are in. The department I working in was one of those not so great. When it was good, it was good but when it was bad it was horrible."
good,It is very fast-paced and stressful from day-to-day. They sometimes have mandatory overtime depends on how much work is backed up. all departments are not like that depends on the manager and the department that you're in if it will be stressful or not.
good,"W@H positions were revoked for all of IT,lay-off’s are on-going for those that do not reside in 1 of 4 core offices.Continue to lay-off Anthem badged associates and transition the positions to IBM as contractors.Revoked severance 3yrs ago to save $ and only offer supplemental unemployment which mandates u file for state unemployment benefits and u pay cobra rates on day one of lay-off"
good,"The job itself can be rough, because of taking incoming calls all day from customers from various backgrounds. Patience is definitely a virtue with this job. "
good,"Managers are great, but very large scope of work. 30 lunch break and they are not flexible when it comes to schedule. A lot of opportunities, but very competitive."
good,"A nice and fun fast paced work environment. You teach yourself the job, and learn a lot on your own. It is a good job right out of college to gain knowledge in the health insurance field."
good,"Really overall it is a decent place to work. I personally didn't like the ""everything always changes"" motto and that was one of my biggest problems. Very inconsistent."
good,I was a switchboard Operator so I always had to be ready to take a call. Members would curse you out or cop attitudes so it can be stressful and cause anxiety. I liked the people there though. Only get 2 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch.
good,I thought I'd enjoy working on my team however there was very little training provided by them.  My manager showed preferential treatment to the existing workers and again provided no training.
good,It all depends on what team you land. That will determine your path. You can apply for a new role after one year of service on a team.My over experience was good
good,"Depends on which department you're working in. There is culture at Anthem, but there's also a fine line between culture and ghetto, many employees look like their going to the club."
good,"i worked with amazing people, but the job is stressful ! Its hard to walk out of there without taking the aggravation home.... the bosses give you a hard time to get anything off...."
good,"This was a new department for Anthem at the time, I was only there for a few months, and the department was outsourced. The environment was nice, the coworkers nice as well."
good,I enjoyed my time here. My boss was great and fostered professional growth. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people and location of the office. It was in the heart of Soho.
good,There were lots of changes taking place on a regular basis that you may or may not be informed about related to your job. I did learn about case management and utilization review from the insurance company perspective.
good,"My manager was a great example of excellent leadership. My coworkers were ""petty"" and unfriendly. The hours were good and work life balance was good. The health insurance was expensive with low premiums but costly out of pocket prices and high deductables."
good,the job is ok however it seems like some of the people who have been there for a while  are always trying to get others in trouble. some of the supervisors are easy to approach and some are not.
good,"great co-workers, very technical evolved, strict, fast paced, educational"
good,"Worked for company and division 20+ years.  Enjoyed the first 10 but after the large expansions and buyouts employees became more like cogs in a wheel than actual living, breathing people.  Face to face interaction dwindled and management moved out of state. More people began working from home and expectations were that you would then be working all hours.  Benefits and bonuses shrank or disappeared. Performance expectations were lifted to the level of perfection (unattainable of course, so no-one got livable raises or decent bonuses except the top dogs).  OK place to work for a few years but no longer a lifer type job like it used to be."
good,"My teammate made the call center bearable, put our manager was not sympathetic nor understanding."
good,Anthem was overall a good place to work. Good people and ability to advance within your department or in the company. Management however tends to let the slackers get away with not working while being over demanding of those who perform and produce. Outsourcing continues to be a priority in order to reduce administrative costs. Many good people have been let go in the wake of good paying jobs being shipped overseas for cheap labor. 
good,A lot of auditing and follow up with vendors and team members. I learned medical terminology and life patterns. Management was lacking in that it was such a large corporation they didn't take the time to cultivate the employees they had. The team members were limited in contact as the work load did not allow time for socializing. The hardest part of the job was feeling so small in such a large corporation. The best part of the job was learning all the medical information which was fascinating
good,"I worked from home. I learned what it was like working for a big company. My supervisor was wonderful and the people I worked with were great. The job was constantly changing and growing, always learning new things. They were extremely flexible."
good,"For the first year i drove 250 miles a day. Monday thru Friday. Then moved to home as a OPW telecommuting. Typical day was logging on thru VPN, accessing clinical claims via mainframe, medical policies and guidelines. Reviewed Medical Claims, (approximately 30 a day), for CPT codes with edits. Requested medical records or reviewed records for medical necessity against policies and guidelines. My immediate supervisor is a great person to work with. The team, (my co-workers), were a great group of professionals and people in general."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Anthem as a company. They're benefits are excellent and they offer quarterly bonuses based on making your numbers. Unfortunately, it's very difficult to make the numbers they set for you. We were supposed to keep our calls short, which is understandable but often impossible with 75% of member / provider requests. I worked specifically in the CA MediCAL department, and a lot of the ""making our numbers"" requirements were out of our control and depended completely on the member or provider only having one or two simple inquiries, or to fill out a survey via email afterwards (which never happened). The training was sufficient if you're a quick learner, but there is a lot of material so if you have trouble picking things up quickly, take heed. "
good,Good benefits and pay.  Work/life balance is excellent.  Management is questionable and most seem prone to micro-managing.  Often they change for the sake of change and/or to please the latest Management hire.
good,It has a positive work enviroment with job security but in my opinion has no opportunity for advancement but in the 9 years of employment i did learn about the healthcare industry in more detail and how it affects healthcare benefits for its members
good,"call center and took care of all calls, either for RX prescription issues, claims issues, reinbursements, providers if contracted or not, changing PCP primary care physicians. i learned all the industry of ACA affordable care act and all the industry of health care."
good,"its typically a good company just need a little fixes here and there, ir a better opportunity for the temps to get a job with the company instead of using them and throwing them away once the peak season is over"
good,"the company is currently way understaffed. there are 20 workers doing the job of a 300 person job. Mangers are super nice and co workers are great to work with, but the hours are way too long and the work load is just way too overwhelming. you are constantly hit with numbers and statistics that are just unreal. it seems like the company cares more about numbers than their members or workers."
good,"You have room for advancement, however I was laid off due to them shipping our jobs overseas"
good,Managing several projects with major deliverables due can be challenging.  Great team of professional co workers to work with.  Lots of weekly meetings for each of the projects.
good,The company is ever-changing and adapting to changes in Health Care industry.  This can be stimulating and also overwhelming at times.
good,Anthem is an ok place to work..............Great people to work around.................Hardest part is claims.....Anthem is a great company to work for the managemenbt team can be a pain but overall the company is great
good,"Anthem is a very laid back place to work. Management is flexible. Over all, working at Anthem is very rewarding. The people that work there are very friendly and is willing to help with anything. Management is very understanding."
good,"I worked here on two separate occasions and each time was in a different role. I was a captive insurance agent the first time, then I left and returned as a certified health plan adviser."
good,It is a corporate job requiring non-traditional hours. The call center environment can sometimes be challenging but the good outweighs the bad.
good,"Good work atmosphere, great management. Not much room for career advancement.  Loved my time here. Amazing co workers. I don’t love the benefit packages that are offered."
good,"• Fun and challenging work"
good,"As a claims analyst, you review claims and determine if the healthcare provider should be paid or not. Every day you learn something new because things are always changing. Claims must be processed rapidly and correctly. The morale is moderate. The company recognizes many holidays and personal achievements that make the employees feel special. The most difficult thing about being a claims analyst is working at a high rate of speed day in and day out. The best part of the job is learning how the insurance world works."
good,The company has a very prominent name in the insurance field but with many work at home associates the building can feel like a ghost town. With layoffs happening randomly opportunity for advancement is much lower than when I initially started with the company 4+years ago. Work load has steadily increased because of layoffs but pay increases are on a freeze.
good,"There is no such thing as a typical day at Anthem - you would never know what challenges would come up during the day, made it a great place to work and I loved meeting the challenges. The associates were all very helpful even if they weren't part of your department.  I was laid off - reduction in workforce."
good,"WellPoint was an associate centered company that provided opportunities for new work experiences, training and involvement in external company activities. Work life was generally engaging and challenging. A lot of routine work activities interspersed with high profile, got-to-get it done project work. A great class of co-workers and staff. Most were easy to approach, open and candid. I enjoyed working with everyone and the variety of new and different opportunities to work on different projects."
good,"Hard work, but if you do what you have to do each day it can be fun"
good,Too much favoritism in certain departments
good,"i am a therapist that have 3 clients a day, I make sure that all clients intake forms, health history and family development are up to date and contact on a daily,"
good,"The work is ok, can be kind of repetitive. The office is laid back and very ""casual Friday"" every day kind of vibe. The work at home option is great if you don't live near the office. Management is chill and approachable."
good,Productive environment with opportunity for advancement as well as opportunity for health and wellness programs etc. Heavy community engagement with volunteer opportunities.
good,I was in a really great department the fep claims department.the manager is really friendly and helpful i had a bombing coworkers.  Could do good with
good,"Day consisted of providing customer service, claims processing and provider services, learned quite a bit in many positions held during my tenure.  Management was great for the most part and workplace culture was usually harmonious.  Not  a hard job but you were expected to maintain stats and performance standards.  Work environment was somewhat nice with a family like culture."
good,"Great place to work, very laid back, great pay, gives nice amount of PTO, easy to grow within the company, fun place to work. Management is very friendly."
good,Great company to work for other than the closing of departments. Great HR rules and benefits. Allows family time. Works with their employees great training
good,"It is an extremely busy, stressful work environment with no off days, even with more than enough Pto hours nothing is ever approved.  Although I am a quick learner and is very open to change and adjustment, training on new programs  is not adequate training"
good,Stay focused alot of work I think. But you will get the hang of it. Quick. Learner so it was easy for me.
good,"a typical day at work is completing the scheduled work. "
good,A typical work day consist of helping our members and customers with all issues. First call resolution was a primary goal in assisting our members and going above and beyond to satify them.
good,Nice place to work but to many layoffs. They only looked at the dollar amount of the employee and you were layed off. Stated from the top down. Started with over 800 employees when Wellpoint took over in 2009 in the Syracuse NY as of 2012 there are around 200 employed in Syracuse NY an still laying off.
good,"Was a nice place of employment with advancement options, however once they switched Provider service and outsourced those positions the moral hit a low and then they downsized entire departments. We all feared losing our jobs and with good reason. My department was downsized along with a manager who had been with the company for over 20 years."
good,"As a CSA (consumer service associate) I started at $19.81 hourly. The job is easy. The pay is good. The managers really care about you. But it ends there. They promised our whole class we would be able To get a selection of our shift based upon our test scores but our shifts were picked based on ONE test , our last test even though I had a 92% average. They gave me a shift I couldn’t really work. The operations experts thst are supposed to help us are 50% good 50% terrible. It’s the same thing every day, over and over. It’s not everyone’s cup of tea, you only get 2 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch. It’s physically and mentally draining. But the actual work is easy and pays well. It’s a rock in a hard place. It’s not for everyone but lots of people enjoy it. Not for people who need to be up and moving AT ALL."
good,"Very deceitful company. Anthem gives surveys to its members. 90 percent of these express dissatisfaction towards the company and not the representative they spoke to over the phone. The poor scores does not reflect against the company, it goes against the employee and can not be changed, even though the dissatisfaction had nothing to do with said employee. Anthems stays at the top, because the employee takes the blame for the negatives. This review practice really needs to be investigated. It's dishonest to the public and harms the employees work performance."
good,"Anthem is a quick paced, highly collaborative place to work. It is a huge company, but the corporate culture makes you feel as though you fit into something important and worthwhile."
good,"A typical day for me consists of taking calls from providers and members, process member submitted, provider and facility claims, research denied claims for additional payment.  Quote benefits as well as assist other associates when they need help.  The work place is laid back, casual dress attire."
good,Its really fun place to work with and the team is really good .The best place one would get to work. Its been most enjoyable time working with anthem and i suggest everyone take some time to work with Anthem.
good,"While this wasn't the best place for me to be, the environment is friendly and the people are incredible. The managers are very understanding and willing to work with you on any improvements you need."
good,"Worked as a call center representative with good training program. This employer helps train and educate their employees. Job quality expectations are high but pay compensation is reasonable. I learned how to be a professional on the phones. I learned how to listen to the customers needs, soft skills phone etiquette and problem solving skills. Management was structured and encouraging for associate success. Workplace culture continued to grow by connecting people to purpose, accomplishment and each other. This is a team effective employer and positively affects performance. The hardest part of the job was being in a cubic tied to the phone all day, constant policy changes and system changes for local business to national business systems. The most enjoyable part of the job was being appreciated, compensated for job performance and yearly bonus awards."
good,"Loved how encouraging management was and continued to push their employees to advance their careers. Loved working from home full time. Had a great team in my last position and we worked well together, even though our team was virtual/work from home."
good,"They pay well and they offer great healthcare. They offer a lot of PTO and you can usually get off whenever you need to. During the peak season they do black out PTO days though and make you work mandatory overtime. Peak season begins in October and doesn’t really end until the end of March. The training does not prepare you for the job. When I got out of training and got on the phones I felt extremely overwhelmed and unprepared. Your job is to help people with benefits, explain claims, prior authorizations, filing complaints etc. The members are usually very rude and talk down to you. When you need help the OE’s take a long time to respond and when they do they often just tell you to figure it out for yourself. Everything is really unorganized and processes change daily. It is very busy back to back calls, no downtime. The company itself is great. They offer great pay and benefits. I liked my manager and did not feel micromanaged but it is a very stressful environment where you often have no idea what you are doing or how to handle situations with little help from the OE’s. If I had a different job there I would have stayed it is definitely not for everyone."
good,Great place to work at. The only issue I have is there is no upward growth. Other then that I look forward to going to work each and every day love my co workers
good,"I would check in at the main office to see where i would be sent. Then once arrived at the facility we would copy medical records according to the measure(diabetes, BMI, cholesterol, BP) for quality measures to ensure patients were following the recommended treatment for various ailments. Filing and scheduling appointments to copy records, We all had our own carts, copiers, and supplies. We were responsible for stocking all supplies to take with us. I would of liked if there was more training, of exactly what was expected because it felt like they were always bringing up new things that they expected or treated us as if we were dumb and should have known better."
good,A Typical day consisted of answering phone calls and recommending insurance plans to customers.   Management never wanted  to field calls eve when one was asked to be spoken to.
good,i love my job because I do my work and always at my desk but the ones who works hard doesn't get reward because favoritism plays a big part in this company which is unfair.
good,I really enjoyed working for Anthem. Anthem is a great company to work for with many benefits for its employees. They also encourage career advancement within the company.
good,Worked as a senior software engineer. Challenging work and understanding the requirement and develop the code as per requirement and handling the offshore team by getting work done from them.
good,"Pull daily workload reports for team members, I also would process claims on certain projects for the Grievance and Appeal/Rework Dept., I would on a daily basis help team members that were in-house with me when they needed help with claims if they were unable to get the claim to process correctly or if they were new to the Dept. and did not understand how to pay a certain policy. I really enjoyed working with all the team members and they enjoyed working with me because if they needed help with something I would help them within minutes of asking questions. The hardest part of the job was when you would get projects/claims for policies that I had never processed before so I had to go into our internal database to pull policy guidelines and reference to my specific situation, it was just more time consuming than anything. The best part of my job everyday was when I would get team members asking question about something they may not know, if I have the knowledge of something I enjoy passing it along to others. availability"
good,"I was a temporary contractor and do not have enough data to comment.  Moreover, what I did see was a nice environment and complimentary work space and co-workers."
good,Wellpoint is business focused and have an efficient training department.
good,"The work environment and culture were ok. Though the enterprise is a huge corporate entity, the local culture and the various groups around the country are different. This is a good company to work for in general. However, as with most corporate cultures, the management is far removed from the actual workforce in a big way. When upper management makes a mistake in judgement and costs the company millions, they recover by transferring the blow to the lower ranks and cutting the workforce or changing the business model. Most of the work of the upper layers of VP's and their ilk, is to generate paper activity and fluff to justify their positions, this is what their ""advanced degrees"" have served them well to know how to do. It's like a bus being driven by someone while texting or intoxicated. The bus looks great, big, impressive, full of passengers, but the driver could care less where they're going or about the safety of the passengers or pedestrians, as long as there is enough fuel to keep the party going. And as long as our fear rules our pocketbooks, we will continue to be a fare paying passenger of this kind of bus."
good,"A very busy place with many different people, telling you different things that caused you to not meet some metrics. Benefits was great. Just seemed like a lot of favoritism going on in the team I was placed on."
good,I do not wish to give a review. Water under the bridge. Why is this necesssary. Please let me use the site ithout having to give a review. This was not.
good,"Great company, horrible management in this particular department of the government sector in grievances and appeals. Pay is decent, hard to advance unless you know someone in another department who will refer you internally."
good,"Ok place place to work, not great. Management too pushy to make certain number of calls to members. Associates are put in a box. Treat staff like children."
good,"Wellpoint is ok place to work if you have nothing else to do. I would not work in customer service though because people are rude. Also, its sort of strange working for a company that provides health insurance then them not providing any. You would think that they would give free health insurance."
good,"I love working for Anthem as a company, but there is no room for advancement or a real opportunity to advance. My goal when joining the company was to move up, 3 years and 42 applications later I have been promoted once."
good,If you are someone who cannot handle a fast paced work environment this company is not for you. The benefits are great but it can be overwhelming to someone who is not use to time management and stress. It is a great company to move up in an advance career wise but you must put in a lot of effort.
good,"Anthem is fun to work with , Supervisor and Management are good, but a little too much pressure on hours of work and minimal time during work hours to take restroom breaks."
good,"The company is awesome, so I thought. The pay rate for these positions are not brought to support a family and am shocked that it was so low to be such a major company. The way the position is set up is not the problem. The time restraints that are put on you, the micro managing and the antiquated system is what the problem is. You are really stressed to complete calls in unrealistic time frames and when you don’t, you are being harrassed about it. The majority of the time, it’s the system that decides when it wants to work or not that increases the handle time. This position should not be on such strict regulations as each case is totally different! Was also interviewed for an at home position that I found out later was not a possibility. Lastly, people that have been there for years are still in the same place as the new people coming in. No growth at all!!!"
good,"In addition to wonderful colleagues , there were more perks taken away then given, Trust in employee's ability to be timely and use time appropriately was micro managed and intrusive. Ability to form report with outside clients became severely restrictive. In the end, the limiting factors placed little faith in the professionals working for them and became corporate supported rather than workforce supported.  The best employees left the company and perspective replacements came too few and far between which caused increased stress among those that stayed to make up for lack of workforce,"
good,"Very fast passed in the division I worked in. Lots of red tape to move things forward quickly. Higher level positions extremely political. However, working there for 30 years, I enjoyed the people I worked with, worked independently and worked from home. Most managers great to work with except for the political ones."
good,"The co-worker teams were great, but the enterprise team seemed to be loyal to their state only. Many experiences that management would take projects or your ideas and suggestions and assign the project to the person in their specific state. Seemed to be a strategy of colocation in a specified state (VA or GA)."
good,"Very busy, competitive, easy going place but a lot of favoritism.. Prefer not to say anymore. Overall the atmosphere is wonderful. New building. Nice co workers. A lot of opportunity"
good,"Good company only worked there as temp."
good,"I work from home in the claims department, i have conference calls, and process claims"
good,"A typical day was to sign in to a automated phone system, and multiple computer systems, and take inbound calls from other WellPoint employees regarding healthcare claims.  "
good,They are about numbers....no matter if you are on time do your job..it still based on numbers..if you are a temp will use until they don't need you will tell you..you might have a good chance at permanent position. Lies
good,The people at Anthem are well versed in their craft and conduct themselves in a professional manner with great accountability to each other as they grow not only their knowledge but also their industry.
good,Always want you to do more with less.  To many organizational changes in short periods of time.  Lack of communication of what is going on in the company.
good,"Anthem is transitioning in many areas. They are trying to adapt Agile, they want people to work in the office rather than at home, and are trying to upgrade their legacy technology."
good,"As an intern, I am expected to do some basic data work to help data preprocessing, even though it is very boring, I have found a way to understand the importance of data preprocessing in business industry."
good,"Cross training in different department, ability to advance, management was very nice and considerate. They appreciated the employee's,they had grace periods."
good,"I worked in  the billing department, applying payments, reviewing histories of different accounts, research. The department I worked in was small, only about 10 people, half of which were temp employees. Everyone got along great, we were always busy. The hardest part of the job was knowing that it was going to end after 6 months. It was a great place to work, but they rarely hire. They did extend my time from 6 months to 7."
good,"Anthem is a great company to work for. There is a lot of room for advancement, however, it's all about who you know instead of what you can bring to the table."
good,"for the time i worked there as a customer service rep it was great, until the dept closed i was then promoted to do a job that was production based and was not allowed the time to catch on to the assignment, other than that it was ok to work there. the people were nice."
good,"Anthem is great place to work to get some experience in the corporate world. If you network and show up to work you go far. The benefits packages are a little disappointing considering you work for an insurance company, but anthem does offer incentives for staying healthy which helps pay for your overall cost of insurance for the year. Also, I would recommend really networking because if you want to move departments it's all about who you know."
good,Anthem is has good talent - coworkers were the backbone of the company. Lots of opportunity for advancement within. We had good department managers - last manager was poor and untrained- made work life miserable
good,however they are moving people from other areas into jobs there is a reduction in force more at some locations then others
good,Really great company to work for but some managers wasn't really to great to work for. But overall great company. Worked with Medicare part d medication coverage
good,Would differently work for this company again if it were not in NY cost of living to high. Very diverse company language barrier was very difficult at time Spanish was not the second language.
good,I enjoyed the job my boss and my coworkers .Hardest part is when some passes or looses their insurance. Best part of the job was making the member happy with good news .
good,Love assisting the members with insurance claims and quotes.  Learned a lot about insurance and cpt codes. Enjoyed working there and having opportunity to learn new things.
good,"A typical work day would include adjudicating claims for hospital and doctors office billers. Assisting providers with contract information. Assisting policyholders with benefit information, written appeals, and claim inquiries. My coworkers were very helpful and great workers. The hardest part of the job was ensuring payment of claims from out of state insurance companies. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting a claim processed and paid in a timely manner."
good,Enjoyed providing education to members in regards to member specific medical conditions to ensure safety and incorporate member in their own health.
good,I learned to take your time and value every call you receive. Make the most of your time. Put your all in and you will get that back in return. I appreciate all the management who was over me they were great provided me with great tools to advance in my future goals that I want to accomplish.
good,"* Two webinar training sessions on data entry procedures for medical conditions and required documentation for each compliance criteria "
good,there were days we used to spend lot of time in testing for batch completed batch jobs
good,"a typical day in a fast paced call center environment. I learned that even tho you may not like a job as long as it pays well its worth it, My co-workers were great. Just your average mixed crowd. The hardest part of the job was handling irate clients. The most enjoyable part of the job was when it was time to clock out."
good,"Got to know a lot of good people here that worked closely together as a team. However, you had to be in the ""Click"" to get promotions. Benefits for accomplishments were outstanding."
good,"Not enough training and management is non-chalant about what you need to do your job. They want to complain about service levels, but when you throw new hires to the wolves without much support, your service levels are going to continue to suffer."
good,The work hours were flexible as long as the daily quota was met. 30-minute lunches were acceptable in order to leave early. There are multiple chances to advance. This company reimburses school tuition for advancement within the company along with gym memberships.
good,My jobs was to reach out to members with hopes of closing gaps in care.with regards to preventative In order to lower health care cost over all. Members were about  sceptical  the calls because no other Healthcare company was doing that at the time.
good,"every job is a blessing and they all come with pros and cons. I really don't like doing reviews but since indeed is making it a requirement, every job has its pros and cons it is a job it was a blessing and sometimes we must advance ourselves if the job we are working doesn't have it to offer"
good,"great organization, with leadership changes they are trying to move the organization towards latest and greatest technologies. however lot of hassle with work-place strategy initiative which is not going well with employees.."
good,Historically a medical company but recently had become present in the ancillary marketplace.  The medical team runs the show.  There is a lack of work life balance.  Internal communication could be improved.
good,"Undergoing a transformation.  They are looking to have IT is designated areas.  Great people, diverse culture, many opportunities appear to be opening off shore at the moment or down south."
good,"I'm sure the company has changed extensively, I don't feel qualified to give any feedback on this company. When I worked there I enjoyed community relations and all the work we did for the community."
good,"Look through charts, that were out dated for MCR"
good,"Anthem, itself, is fine; however, it's an umbrella organization for smaller subsidiaries, which are not managed well. They are growing as a company, which is positive, but need to do a better job of making smoother transitions when mergers happen."
good,Anthem is a great place to work.  Very relaxed and great people. Managers micro-manage but that is common in the healthcare industry. Great opportunity for younger individuals
good,"This was a great place for me to work at, I would totally be still there if it wasn't for relocation and zero support from management. I was allowed to work on my own pretty much most of the time because I always delivered, that I can say that management recognizes; however they don't use that to assist when as an individual employee you're in need. "
good,"Working for CareMore/Anthem was a great learning experience and helped me discover skills I didn't know I possessed.  In a short period I learned how to train, coach, mentor, and lead by example in a high paced environment."
good,"Much of my work at Anthem surrounded process improvement, including data collection, analysis, recommendations, project management, and implementation.  "
good,Anthem overall is a good place to work.  There is opportunity for advancement however there also is the annual staff / admin reduction exercise that puts your job and your coworkers jobs in jeopardy each year right around Christmas time.
good,"When I was first employed it was a place to be proud to work.  Then as the years went on and the upper management changed the name every couple of years, I was no longer proud to be an employee.  They treated the employees badly and cut our wages and benefits.  That didn't seem to happen with the Upper Management.  They rode the path to success on the backs of the hourly employees.  I don't know what the work environment is today."
good,"not located in the same office, all communication is over the phone or email. Hardly any contact at all. Felt very disconnected. Did not provide the help and training needed."
good,The group you support matters at anthem. I am currently facing a toxic environment but otherwise the company is great to work for. I think the new CEO will bring welcome changes.
good,Organized case pool each morning.  Work oldest cases first and then forward.  Hardest part of the job is we were always under staffed.  Overtime is every week since I have been there.
good,"The really nice thing about your hours at Anthem is that you were able to start work anywhere between 6:00am - 9:00am.  So tardies, at least in my department of Medicare Advantage Claims were pretty obsolete.  I thought that was wonderful."
good,The culture was family oriented and relaxed. Enjoyed my colleagues and the projects I was a part of.  Some of the processes and systems could be updated.  However there is a lot of work but the pay does not match what is expected.
good,"the benefits were excellent, medical dental vision , depending on your manager the stress level could be hazardous to your health. Some managers were completely numbers driven and far from warm and fuzzy"
good,"Pay is good. Upper management are interested mostly on the bottom line and less on the associates, but if pressure is handled then it is not as bad. The company recently brought in new upper management and the targets they are setting are a little too ambitious. I am afraid we are setting ourselves to failure."
good,"it is a temporary position for open enrollment. though i heard the structure has changed, during my time there the training was superb, job culture was fantastic, and though there would be days you would have back to back calls, there were times when you could sit back and read a book with two hours between calls."
good,"i enjoyed my tenure at anthem blue cross/blue shield while working as a team clerk.  i was then thrust into training for a cliams processor (which i struggled with), and eventually lost my job due to not meeting company expectations. - sad, really."
good,typical day at work was basically on the phones with members and providers every now and then the co workers would have pot lucks to celebrate some one but it was jus a busy call center especially Mondays for some reason calls were always non stop. made time go by fast.
good,The environment shifted in the time period I worked here. When I began my employment it was a great place to work and was so focused on proper attention given to the providers we serviced. With multiple managerial changes the focus became just metrics. Meet you number no matter what. There was a shift in attitude from what was being valued. The original management team would be shocked by the change.
good,"The environment can be enjoyable but as new management has taken over there is no team comradarie,as now there is no open communication allowed on the floor. Working at anthem I have learned extreme self discipline, teamwork as well as self reliance. I've learned many different systems and I have learned to be adaptable on the fly."
good,"Very good place to learn new things.And the work is hectic.May be not with all the teams.More dead lines and some times need to work over the weekends,"
good,"Anthem has grown to be a huge workplace and the amount of work is there and competition is always a constant. A typical day at work involves a lot of communication with internal/external clients via phone and email. The culture is about getting the job done and making sure that the job gets done the right way. Workplace culture is one that involves collaboration with a strong focus on timelines and producing results and customer satisfaction.  The hardest part of the job is getting a clear answer around the word no  or declining a request.  It often involves many people input and that can be like chasing a fox. The enjoyable part of job is connecting with people who are  genuine, who care about their job duties and respect the workplace culture."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is the work I do, and knowing that I am helping others.  "
good,"Unless you are willing to clean clients up after they've had an accident or are willing to handle physical abuse on a daily basis, then this job is not for you. While the clients are very sweet the majority of the time, there are several who do not understand kindness."
good,"•	Researching and concluding complex issues for federally facilitated mandated and state based exchanges."
good,"Extremely busy environment, have great co-workers. Management is  progressive. Really enjoy mentoring my co-workers, and enjoy helping my senior members on their insurance benefits and claims."
good,"A typical day consisted of basically taking back to back calls from doctors, hospitals and patients in order to get any medical services cleared through their insurance. Management was unfortunately not as helpful in the training/teaching aspect as some senior coworkers. The most difficult part of the job was explaining to any caller that this process generally could not be completed as quickly as they would have liked, The most enjoyable part of the job was simply speaking to all the different people and being able to go above and beyond to assist and inform the callers."
good,"Anthem, Inc is a very good company. It has great benefits, competitive pay, and good opportunities for advancement. This, however, all depends on where you are in the company--more specifically, which department you work in. From personal experience, claims is your typical, ""bottom of the food chain"" department. As with a lot (maybe even most) of other high-level corporations, the people at the bottom are treated like numbers. There is a very high turnover rate, employee satisfaction is a dream, complaints are never-ending, and job stability/security is pretty much the red flag to a bull. There are unrealistic goals set forth by God knows who and while they promote autonomy, there never seems to be any resolution to the issues that employees have with their job requirements. There is no doubt that claims is a stressful work environment with the constant threat of losing your job when you don't make 95-100% production (even though you are responsible for production AND quality as the 2 go hand-in-hand in every situation, they don't care about quality. They'll say that they do, but the truth is in the pudding.); an influx of mandatory overtime; standoffish, unapproachable, and overbearing management; a crippling lack of communication; and thusly, an almost detrimental lack of cohesion. But, because the way a business of this magnitude has to operate is understandable, I guess there is no real reason to complain. The company has goals that have to be met and oftentimes, they will pull teeth to ensure that they achieve said goals. Either you're willing to be a pawn or you're not."
good,"For a seasonal job it was ok, the way they let us know the assignment was over was very unprofessional. The stress was not too bad, but the training left you very unprepared. overall great experience"
good,"Great company to work for with the exception of poor leadership skills in regards to managers. Compared to some other companies, the pay is pretty good along with yearly bonuses. I would certainly work for the company again however I would not work in the same department if given the chance due to very poor management/ leadership skills."
good,Anthem is a very fast paced working environment. All activities are monitored and logged to determine efficiency. Co-workers are close by and available to assist.
good,"In the current healthcare culture, working at an insurance company can be stressful, to put it mildly. To work at one of the largest names in healthcare, can be brutal. "
good,"good company"
good,"Executive sales management failed to see the need to train junior sales reps.  Bottom 20% of producers continually churned for new recruits.  Commissions and bonus made the job worth it.  However, the book of business that you build and are promised you own is retained by WellPoint upon separation.  You are forced to spend personal money on local marketing or face disciplinary action up to termination."
good,"Very busy, and I learned a lot. Customer service and writing professional letters. In addition, helped create new systems."
good,"If Medicare Bid didn't corrupt the AR for Anthem Health Services to stay open, it still would be a good company to work for. In serving for almost five years, I have grown from being a front desk management to back with the Respiratory Department, working more closely with patients. Front desk enabled my ability to understand all the job functions of each employee and their paperwork flow. Working with the Respiratory department gained more knowledge of insurance guidelines and development of doctor relationships. "
good,"cashier "
good,"Typical workplace for healthcare, typical workday is 8-4:30 with a one hour lunch. "
good,It was a work environment that allowed for an employee to learn information about the insurance business.
good,"My typical day at Anthem consisted of working from my home daily. Start off with the emergency emails to respond to, as there was always those first thing in the morning. Spend at least a couple of hours every other day working daily production work and broken processes. Then working on programming changes and requirement submissions to my internal business partners and external vendors. Then I did my best to keep up with the daily, weekly, and monthly duties that I had such as submitting invoices, tracking my budget and allotting my monthly accruals."
good,"very challenging, innovative work - most work from home all over US"
good,"Little or no job security. Good benefits, no job security. Poor training and no employee developement. Employee parking is far bur free. Hard to get definite answer to work related questions"
good,"I love working for an insurance company but sometimes it can get really hectic, when you have members that don't understand the way a claim has been processed as well as on your end determining if the claim did process correctly"
good,When the work was there it was good. Able to meet numbers and get compensated for it
good,i loved working there. my direct manager was a dream. once they changed management around everything changed. some of the people in the other offices needed to accept the changes but refused. allot of backstabbing going on. couldn't trust anyone really. overall a good company just some of the co-workers left allot to be desired. Abused the good people and let them go or forced them out and kept the ones that didn't do their job at all.
good,"Responsible for profitability and membership goals within large group book of business. Calculated renewal and prospect rates for 50-1000 sized employer groups. Implemented various funding mechanisms including fully insured, ASO, deferred and contingent premium arrangements. Position in Maine was eliminated. Vested time bridged to Connecticut office several months later."
good,"It is nice to work for anthem , however the point system can be VERY ANNOYING ! It is almost impossible to be off when needed . They also are very picky."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Anthem. I worked for Anthem through Concentrix, Inc. and I loved the customers and the job but unfortunately the job is ending."
good,"Managers and above say."
good,Review member and provider correspondence and set them up in a timely manner. Answer emails and help and train others on new systems.  Help with triaging documents and sending out letters.
good,Fast paced and long hours.   Work life balance is not in place even though executive leadership pushes for family time.  Layoffs every other month creating low morale  & fearful team environments.  On the plus...benefits are fantastic.
good,Good exposure on the healthcare Pharmacy Benefit Management workflow and understand the healthcare regularities connected to the other integrated healthcare domains
good,"The pay is great, but the constant worrying about your job from day to day is extremely stressful.  Management has changed so many times in the past 18 months that I have literally lost count, and no one ever seems to know the direction, because with new management comes a new vision and direction."
good,"There is a probationary period where you have a quota to meet. If not met, you will be fired. They call it ""productivity"". You are allowed to go at your own pace and you are trained well. The firing process is not instant. They do offer one-on-one training if they see you are not initially meeting quota for any reason. Communication is key."
good,the calls can get busy and for the most part you stay busy everyday except when the members that live up north go back home when it gets to hot here in Florida.
good,"I love the company it’s a great place, clean and friendly. The employees are friendly and we all are always ready to lend a helping hand when needed. I’ve been here almost a year and will recommend you come to work and do your job."
good,"Good working place"
good,Opportunity for growth with great benefits. Awesome staff. Quality training. Did I say room for growth. Job assistant. Great teamwork and accountability
good,"Anthem was a great company to help start me on my career path. I spent years on the phones answering and helping others understand their medical policies and benefits. This is what lead me to wanting to do more than just answer phones, I wanted to be a profession that would allow me to help the individual and their families."
good,Anthem is a good indicator of a healthy fortune 50 company and offers positions for all levels of professionals. I would suggest Anthem as an employer.
good,I enjoy the workplace culture at Anthem. Anthem is a great place to work with good employees and management. It is a very relaxed and flexible environment.
good,"nice perks: wellness programs, 401k, PTO's, etc."
good,I worked for them for 17 1/2 years and the did a corporate Realignment and my position was eliminated.  I cannot explain how I felt.  I had confined to move up in the company and then boom I was let go.
good,"A day to day activities are very good"
good,"If Anthem had not gone with the policy of eliminating the option of work from home, I would never leave.  After 10 years of working full time from home, having to travel nearly an hour to the nearest office where none of my team or the teams we support are located, just doesn't make sense for me."
good,"When I started at this company I had a great Manager and team lead then I was placed in a troubled area with a manager who quit in the first 3 days of my being placed there, then my mentor quit, then my 2nd mentor quit. Not very comforting."
good,"It seemed like a good place to get started on a career path but it didn't last long as they streamlined and many of us were let go. Prior to that, it seemed like a good company finding its footing in the mn market."
good,"Flexible work environment"
good,"You have the independence to make your compared to other companies and have flexible work hours. Planning could be a little bit better but satisfied overall,"
good,Need to check who are they hiring as managers if they dont want to lose good employees...if u work in the Houston office beware of Virginia she is the worst manager in that office has preferences and doesnt do her job as a manager only when it comes to disciplinary  actions likes to terminate employees...
good,"Anthem is the new company that took over Global TPA. I currently work as HRA Verifier. The job is easy and most of the time is very slow paced. If we do not have a lot of mail that comes in then most of the time we are on the phone all day.  If you do reach 80 hours Anthem will make you use your PTO, so when you submit your timesheet you have to make sure that time is made up."
good,Temporary Assignment either by phone or email contacting providers in California to verify and update provider information for internet and printed roster availability
good,A typical work day begins with identifying priority tasks for completion.  I have learned that everything is solvable.  The management team is flexible and open to new ideas.  The workplace culture is inclusive and promotes work life balance.  The job is challenging not hard and you can overcome challenges.The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to work remotely.
good,"I currently still work here. Anthem is a good company to start a career at any age. Sometimes it is hard to get in, but once you get your foot in the door you can excel."
good,"Good, flexible company, great people to work with. Compatible with family life. Has great benefits with multiple options. Multiple work schedule options, only Monday through Friday schedule, no weekends or holidays."
good,"Great benefits, exceptional training, and great support from management. This is a high stress level place to work, however well worth it. Unfortunately, along with the commute, the stress of position was too much."
good,"Overall was not a bad experience, from what I have seen they hire outside instead of within but it is a large company and I am sure they are not all that way.  GREAT company for Diversity and Inclusion."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Anthem. The people were friendly and so were the manaegment. I was upset they closed our department . I really liked helping members with their Medicare Part D benefits. I loved to get to work as early as I wanted. Great cafeteria on premises, great covered parking. Taking time off for vacations using  your PTO time was very difficult trying to schedule and use your time off  because of workforce management"
good,"The company does not cater to students like they claim for their call centers. Advancement is dependent on your team lead and training is not highly supported. Great team leads, but not treated very well."
good,"Its a very big company and you sometime feel like a small fish in a big ocean. Years pass by dealing with projects in your team and you don't get to interact much with other teams since you are too busy in the projects. Lot of legacy applications and technologies, slowly company is introducing innovation in the projects."
good,Even though BCBS is a great company to work for I would not refer anyone else to the department I work for. Management was so poor and I've seen too many people leave because of the same reasons. Pay was fine but what was being done in the department made most feel like it wasn't worth the headache.
good,Great place to work. Truly a big supporter of the telecommute position. Good opportunities for career advancement. Pay and benefits are really good. Liked it a lot.
good,"Anthem Blue Cross is a good company to work for. The organization is focused in transforming healthcare with trust and caring solution; focused on innovation and takes accountability to deliver results, strive for excellence, and to make a difference in the lives of their customers."
good,"Good place to learn more about the health care industry! It's all about a positive attitude, and making an effort.  If you apply yourself, you can do well and prosper."
good,the training is pretty in depth and the coworkers are great. Hours are not that great. The company was working on upgrading and improving some areas that needed improving for quality.
good,Received incoming calls from members or providers regarding medicare advantage plans. Verified benefits and procedures. The co-workers make the day enjoyable and you had a relaxed environment.
good,Great place to work. Fast pace of utilization reviews. Very collaborative and supportive work environment. Excellent boss. Don't plan on quitting this job
good,I gave eligibility insurance coverage and quoted benefits to providers and members. I went over any and all billing claims from medical procedures performed. I also created pre-authorizations for inpatient and outpatient medical services to be approved by managed care nurses or doctors. This was all being done in a fast paced inbound and outbound call center.
good,Temp job in a dept that was closed. The director was very attentive as was his staff. If the ACA had not come along I would most likely stayed at Anthem
good,"In my department we are good team player, nice lead and Manager they are approachable and helpful. Our Manager is base on Colorado she make sure everything is okay in California."
good,"You have to work hard, be on time, and learn as much as possible to succeed.  You also have to be  team player and have interpersonal skills."
good,"Anthem is a well known insurance company however the customer service environment is not great. Promotions are based on popularity rather than hard work and everything is very high school like. The particular manager I had was very bad at this, the hard workers were not recognized unless you were grabbing coffee and print jobs."
good,I have been working for Anthem for quite ten years now.  It wasn't until recently I started to feel as though the job conflicted with my morals. In my previous positions there was very little interaction with the member and their needs.  As an Appeal Analyst it is hard deny an appeal based on different guidelines and regulations. Overall I would recommend a friend to work here. It is a great place to get your foot in the door and gain experience in the workforce.
good,I am pleased with Anthem & the ability to work at home but my current skill set doesn't match my pay. I am a single mother of 2 & additional compensation is needed .
good,"Performing appropriates medical review against well point medical clinical guideline or pharmacy toolkit processing new claims. Taking in calls, giving authorizations for speciality drugs . Management and coworker were very friendly. Micro management was stressing . Learned new things every day."
good,"Fielded internal and external communications from insurance agents, group administrators and employees regarding various customer service related issues."
good,"Processed claims for payment and followed up for information on pending claims. Learned to deal with all levels of contacts from agents to attorneys. Worked as a team to process claims and had our monthly goals, therefore had to keep up to date on outstanding claims and process new ones as quickly as possible."
good,there's never been a better time to work for anthem.  the culture is maturing from a fragmented byproduct of several merged companies to a more unified organizational model.
good,I feel Anthem paid very well. I did not feel that everyone was treated equal. If you were a manager you were listened to and believed over an employee that was not management. Both should be listened to and if you have facts/proof that you are telling the correct information human resources should hear that information and give the employee the same respect.
good,"Benefits were good, could be better being that the employer is an insurance company. Busy and fast pace environment, depending on education will depend if there is chance for advancement."
good,"ok-lots of personnel changes made transitions difficult. Variability in manager style and implementation of policy sometimes at cross purposes.  Initially direction given in medical case management if conflict arose was ""do the right thing (for the patient)""-this was a very satisfying idea but it changed under a new manager.  New manager didn't track employee requests for days off; didn't ""remember""-phone calls made to her concerning attendance issues--later discovered employee found to be true as phone call was recorded.  I guess this action on my part indicated a serious trust issue with that manager."
good,National Government Services is a company of consistent change.  Evolving contracts and continual regulation changes creates an environment of necessary adaptation.
good,Total satisfaction with my current position. Opportunities for advances within the company. On the job training and learning opportunities. Competitive pay and excellent benefits.
good,"If you like working for a big corporation with a lot of employees, this is the place for you. One of the largest health insurance carriers in the US, Anthem has many opportunities and positions available, so you could never get bored in the same position,"
good,Enjoyable workplace and you are able to move up within the company. Constant opportunity to excel and receive promotions and/or pay raises and bonuses.
good,"Fortune 30 company in dynamic industry.  The phrase, ""it takes a long time to move large ships,"" absolutely applies to Anthem.  That said the company does want to improve and continue to be a market leader. Individual work experiences can carry quite a bit depending on department. Very virtual environment as over 60% of the company works from home part or all of the time."
good,Pay could be better based off of education. The job is easy you just have to be willing to learn multiple systems. Also things change frequently so be prepared.
good,This job can be very stressful you are tied to the phones all day with only 30 min lunch and 2 15 mins breaks. the call volume can be very high which makes stress level sometimes through the roof.
good,Blue cross I would not say its  a fun place to work they do not treat their employees well they make promise they cannot keep telling you that your job is safe and weeks later you are without a job.
good,The company has amazing values. It promotes family health and wellness and I really liked that. The benefits are excellent and the plans are affordable for dependents. I really enjoyed that aspect of it.
good,"Supervisors and Managers were not  trained in the area they were trying to lead.  I was employed with this company for 3 years and we had 5 different supervisors and managers in that time frame."
good,The day is very quiet and lengthy. The hardest part of this job is having no work for hours at a time. Management is frequently unavailable for support for new hires. The office is very quiet yet professional. The most enjoyable part of this job was learning something new with and grasping it so quickly.
good,"- Multiple internal / external client contact"
good,"If you're looking for a stepping stone, this is the place for you. Gain experience to be able to branch out into something else, where you can actually get a promotion. Small office, about 15 people work there. Most people work from home."
good,"Anthem Blue Cross is as an individual insurance claims/client services representative was pretty fast paced.  Dealing with high volume incoming calls, assisting clients with claims, EOB's, changes to insurance, and billing provided for a full work day.  At times, it could be extremely stressful, but rewarding.  "
good,"Handling short term disability claims for major automaker employees. Role as communication hub between claimants, union representatives, employer human resources personnel as well as clinicians."
good,"productive workplace, busy from the  start of shift until the end, taking care of the elderly with dementia and other health problems, high employee turnover rate."
good,large company and it's often difficult to understand how you fit into the larger picture.  pros are that you have a lot of options to move within the company if you choose
good,"Overall, Blue Cross Blue Shield is a great company to work in grow within. On a daily basis, I have to maintain a 90% adherence, service members, quote benefits, take up to 50 inbound calls a day. Also, I have been working with the company 3 plus years, and I had the pleasure of training new hires, being a mentor, and assisting with escalated issues. What I love most about the job? It is a pleasure making a change in a person's life, and knowing that you made them smile in some point of their day. The job itself is demanding, but it is always great to have challenges and be able to overcome them."
good,enjoyed working as a support coordinator the first time I was at this job.  had a wonderful manager.  hated that I got laid off.
good,"Each day I badge into the office and login to my computer.  After loading all of my various applications, I wait until I receive my first call of the day.  I answer the phone and confirm for security purposes who the user is and continue to help the user out with whatever their issue may be and create detailed notes that are added to their ticket.  After the call is over, I wait until the next caller calls in and do the same things over again.  For the most part, each caller is respectful and patient.  So far I don't have any complaints about work there."
good,"Anthem is an industry leader. I really enjoyed working for this company. I liked making a difference in the members lives.  They offer some great services to all the members. Although the expectations are high in term of productivity, the culture is very supportive."
good,It's a great environment with great people. It's nice being close to home and the days go quickly with all the calls taken. Laid back environment with fun coworkers.
good,"At Anthem, I was trained to perform many tasks and enjoyed learning from a select few trainers.  Management and my co-workers were easy to work with and always helpful."
good,"Good company to work for, great company to be a customer with, especially if someone is in the market for individual coverage that they cant get thru an employer."
good,"Very high demanding job. Love assisting customers with their questions and concerns. "
good,"when we are doing night shift.it is my typical day in office."
good,Nice team to work with.  Sometimes there is lack of communication between the management and the team.  Their market niche seems somewhat unstable.
good,"Excellent working environment"
good,"Several Managerial changes within a year. Constant lay offs. Didn't feel comfortable voicing opinions and or suggestions. Lots of cliques. Not what you know, who you know type of thing."
good,You get to learn a lot about the insurance industry.  You are never bored due to the obligations of the job.  Have patience with the callers and they will have patience with you.  Some doctor's offices are easier to deal with than others
good,Typically at work we were in charge of taking care of the customers by listening and handling there concerns and questions. I learned a lot about insurance and how to handle tough situations. The hardest part of the job for me would have had to been not being able to interact with the customers. I like customer service and helping people but I like the face to face interaction more. It is always an awesome feeling being able to connect and build relationships and partnerships with people you get to work with.
good,they treat you like your just a body to fill a seat. no windows!!! and they work with swing shift. the management was no help if you had an issue

good,"I used to write BRD's,FRD's,conduct meeting to gather requirements,worked on JIRA/CONFLUENCE, I can write SQL queries."
good,"I think Heath Insurance companies get a bad rap. The employees are truly some of the nicest people who manage as best they can given certain rules and limitations."
good,"A typical day at work is a steady workflow of defined responsibilities for each team member.  I have learned a lot about process improvement and project management because of my role.  I have been blessed to work for two great managers who were constantly concerned about my growth with the company.  My co-workers are a group of fun, intelligent and collaborative people who are always eager to teach and help me.  Working with them was the most enjoyable part of my job.  The hardest part of my job was juggling projects but through time, became an enjoyable part of my responsibilities."

good,"I enjoyed working for Anthem, they are a good company. I worked on the phones and as well emails with brokers. I handled claims when needed. I learned several different systems while being employed there. Management changed often it seemed like because corporate for broker services were unaware of what they wanted to do with this department. My coworkers were enjoyable to work with. The hardest part of my job was when the systems would go down or freeze I would say."

Not as much fun to work for....more stress to meet goals that weren't necessarily connected to helping patients. Then Anthem acquired Wellpoint LLC and more rules and regulations. Finally, the PBM was sold by Anthem Healthplan to Express Script and department was eliminated.  There is no more Anthem Prescription management.  It is now Express Scripts"

Worked with a great group of people who I could learn information from about products that were offered. The hardest part of my job I would have to state was not being able to help all the members with their concerns about how claims were processed, and out of network providers. The rewarding part when come when I would be able to help get claims re-processed of fees waived that a member should not have been made to pay."
good,Taking incoming phone calls from small business owners wanting to get information about providing health care coverage to their employees. We provide them with information on what the plan includes and the different ones that can be chosen along with the pricing information.

good,"Anthem was a great place to work...I spent several years there, earned 401k almost from day 1, had benefits after 30 days and had an excellent flexibility in my schedule plus PTO. For the first 3 years I had a wonderful manager who I was sad to see go. Her replacement was a wicked, miserable, fake, empty shell of a person who let her outside life affect her decisions at work. She was inappropriate..and that's being nice. She also treated everyone differently and made exceptions for people who didn't really need them but if I or a few others asked for just ONE bit of understanding from her she pryed into our business and declined our requests even if we were in tears. She spend most of the year out of the office working remotely while dealing with a personal issue and we were left to the wolves. Upon her return she came back with full vengeance as though she was taking out her family issue on the unit as a whole. And again, treated many of us different. There was a lot of back peddling and lies on her part and ironically she never once did my job but was to be my guidance when I had an issue...promising to stick by me when any errors came about. She did not...ultimately this lead to my dismissal from my position sending my entire life into a downward spiral of losses including health insurance, ability to pay bills and take care of my children. Lucky enough it did not take me long to straighten things out and find a new job...in fact I had an interview the very next day. Point being she's miserable and as glad as I am to be away from her I do miss the job and wish things could"
good,"Great place to work when trying to balance life outside of work. Great location and people. The culture could be better, however the dress code is vey relaxed."

good,We started the day off with opening hundreds of insurance claims. I learned the many different types of claims. I learned from management the different sources of payment for  paying a claim. The hardest part of the job was when the machines were broken and you would have to check the the empty envelopes for any claims that might been left in them. The most enjoyable part was getting trained how to do any job in the department.

good,the day to day work load is pretty typical of a call center but the people are great. the hiring bar is high which makes for a great work force. managment is effective but at times absentminded. the hardest part of the job would have to be the knowledge gaps between departments and that the departments you work with are not in office or even local making communication difficult at times.

good,A very fast pace productive job.  I processed insurance application for health coverage.
good,"A typical day consisted of reviewing models, extracting data, attending meetings, and so on. Overall not a bad place to work for."
good,"Strong knowledge in Software Development Life Cycle & Testing Methodologies."
good,"* Very professional work enviroment"
good,"Stress job being in customer service for Anthem BCBS"
good,"I worked a call center so my day consisted of assisting members or providers with questions about coverage, claims, membership and options available to them.                                                               I learned a great deal about the insurance industry along with how to problem solve.                                                                                 I always had great management.  My last manager is a person that I have a great deal of respect for.                                                   My co-workers were great.                                                                The hardest part of the job was not having the time to research calls that I was unable to close as a first call resolution due to such high call volume.                                                                               The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help people to understand. "
good,"I enjoyed working for NCPPO, a well-point company…also love my co-workers but had to resign to go back to Nursing school full-time. I thinks this unit was shut down after I left"
good,"I enjoyed working at Anthem and I did for 12 years. However, it became a dead end job and I was relieved when my position was eliminated and I could further my education. "
good,"This company is excellent for nurses. The benefits are great, hours flexible, and pay is above average. "
good,Wellpoint was a nice job to have.  I met quite a few people who I am still in contact with. 
good,"I ran a register,filled stock and worked the deli.  This store was owned by the Petit family it started to get to me,All everyone talked about was the 3 murders of the Petit women.  The customers brightened the whole day"
good,"Typical day is log onto my computer, begin looking at patient files/cases, and contact doctor offices via phone and fax to gather information based on patient. I also IM/message and communicate with coworkers to ensure they having a great day and to make them laugh. The hardest part of the job is nothing really. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to work from home"
good,loved working for this company. lot of great people to work with.
good,The company is a great place to work with nice benefits as well. I like that they have school reimbursement. The staff is warm and friendly
good,"A typical work day would be answering inbound member calls with concerns about their insurance policies and claims. I learned a great deal about insurance and how medical billing is done. Management was very supportive and encouraging, however could micromanage at times. The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers. The most enjoyable was the fulfillment of knowing you have helped someone solve their problem, which at times could have been quite costly."
good,"I am open to any new tasks and applications in my QA Test / Analysis efforts. I have always had success in my work relationships, am well liked, and am always a team player."
good,"hard to advance to higher level positions. key is getting into a department and position where advancing is common, my current job doesnt afford me this benefit."
good,Typical day would be answering about 50 calls a day providing great customer service to customers on a daily basis
good,• Involved in the scope discussions with the Business Analysts and the Business users to identify the technical requirements.
good,"Wellpoint was a well established and excellent company to work for. I would attend annual meetings for national accounts with the Medical account manager and review the cost, trend and high dollar costs. Aside from the annual reviews, I would work directly with the Medical national Account Executive to ensure the account was running smoothly and also fulfill any ad hoc requests."
good,Started at 8 a.m. in a cubicle. Processed paper all day. Had two fifteen minute breaks and an hour lunch.
good,Highly energetic – must be quick thinker and act fast; must be ON at all times; a LOT to do! Must be organized; be able to communicate with all levels; must build a support team...:)
good,I learned a lot working in this company.Especially i learned about health sector and gained a experience working on different platform.I had great team.I t was pleasure working with this company.
good,Loved working at Wellpoint; really enjoyed the feeling I got from being able to help the customers and the benefits from working for a big company are top notch (private 24/7 gym at the downtown office).
good,Nice place to work with great pay and people.
good,"Worked for this company since 2008 great place there is advancement but it depends on your management. Very flexible but again dependents on management and your dept that you work in. I have had the opportunity to work for this company in two different states under Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Cross Blue Shield of GA, my favorite was Anthem Blue Cross, Blue Cross Blue Shield of GA tends to do there own thing and not really abide by Wellpoint HR standards, they seem to have different or own requirments for their HR rules cant really trust HR since HR and your management in the dept you work in are friends, so can be very unprofessional when handling things."
good,A typical work day was 8 am to 4 pm. we were allowed to work overtime. Management was reasonable and coworkers were ok.
good,I would generally get into work at least 15 mins early each day as there were several screens to sign into and you needed to be ready to take phone calls at 8:30 sharp. Bonuses were given quarterly which ws a plus and your breaks and adherence was part of your bonus. It was rewarding giving people information they needed in a timely fashion and hearing their relief that a procedure was covered. Other employees were always willing to help out if and jump on the phones if we were getting backed up. The most tedious part of the job was if someone called and needed 30-40 medical codes looked up to see if they were covered.
good,WellPoint is an overall great company with management support and adequate tools for project management. The typical work day is 10-12 hours. The hardest part of the job was shortage of resources and funding. The most enjoyable part of the job was working from home.
good,"Enjoy the people I work with, overall fairly easy job."
good,Great company. Hard working people. enjoy everyday and leaner something new everyday.
good,"Company offers growth, midlevel management is awesome, able to build friendships, lacking in training"
good,"Working for Anthem has been a great experience. It has afforded me the opportunity to meet and interact with various types of people, from varying backgrounds. I've learned a great deal about the insurance industry and I am expecting to continue to learn and progress, within the health insurance industry."
good,"Being very committed, it's devastating to work for a very profitable company -then to see all your co-workers/friends loose their positions due to out-sourcing. My position to Philippines Dec. 2011."
good,Anthem is a company in the throws of culture shock.  They can’t decide what they want to be.  Upper management has one idea of how to do things and they are not listening to the folks actually doing the work.
good,"Management is awesome. However, due to changes in organizational structure and processes, most of the positions offer relocation in California-- which was not a cup of tea for other people."
good,For entry level folks Anthem provides ample opportunities to learn about healthcare in the public and private sectors. Advancement is possible with significant investment in time by the individual for self development.
good,The focus at Anthem is getting customers off the line to take the next call and not on solving problems and building relationships based on trust and service.
good,"I joined Anthem as as trainee, thee people are cooperative a. Seniors are  are helpful. The laboratory is good and we can know lot of new things. Happy to work  there."
good,"As a contractor, it was a pretty great job. The employees there were pleasant and the management started off nice. You start to notice the shadiness of the management when they wanted to get rid of people they do not want on their team. Other than that the work was easy, there were times when we were flooded with work but that was due to a lack of leadership."
good,"Orientation is long and overwhelming. But staff is very helpful. Hours are good. If your coming in from the city, the drive can be tiresome. Overall, can be a nice change from floor nursing."
good,This company is great if you like to assist others and educate your self regarding the health care industry. I really loved going to work early and assisting members with any issues that could make them less stressed and educating them on they're benefit packages.
good,I cherish the knowledge and opportunity that was provided at Anthem. It was an amazing experience.I learned so much in 5 years with Anthem and thank you again for the experience..
good,Although I had a complete HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE with my manager not all managers are the same. Just wish HR was more diligent in listening to employees complaints.
good,Anthem was a great experience in performing to exceed the company's expectations. Management needs work in being more tolerant of other's difference. Treat the training class like a college course; learn as much as you can so you know what you're doing when patients really need your assistance.
good,"Benefit package isn't good, Working with medicaid/medicare community is very demanding. It is idea place for someone younger. As a 64 year old looking forward to retirement, something with more benefits would be a bettr fit for me. Overall, I've enjoyed my time with Anthem. Anthem is a strong dpendable place to work."
good,This is a great place to work.  Friendly staff here and plenty of projects to be involved in.  Team members are very supportive and always available to assist.
good,"I enjoyed my time with Anthem, but was laid off as part of a corporate RIF after more than 14 years. I was always loyal to my job and the company, and always performed my job faithfully and well. There is little to no loyalty to their employees. There is never any security there, even if you are doing your job well and as defined."
good,"I was at Anthem for only a month because I had to leave to have surgery. However, I liked the company and culture while I was there. I was very sorry that I had to leave."
good,"Anthem Blue Cross at the time of my hiring had very good training instructors and supportive management. the workplace has very"
good,"Overall, it is a good company.   One manager ruined it for me.  I did not agree with her ethic it made it very difficult. I choose to find other  job."
good,"Overall my work experience at Anthem has been primarily positive, though the culture can feel a bit tribal and combative depending on the department. Re-orgs happen frequently and systems, processes, and platforms are routinely changing."
good,"Anthem is a great place to work and honestly one of the best in terms of diversity, inclusion, and compensation. However, the constant change in top-level leadership is a bit concerning. In the past several years, the company has been through several changes at the top CEO spot and I've noticed considerable differences in the culture shift with each. Additionally, there isn't a consistent culture followed across the board in terms of work/life balance. Some teams are more apt to ensure stress is managed for their direct reports and in other cases, stress seems to be heightened with strict and obscenely unrealistic timelines on projects. It comes across as though the focus is on getting as much in and completed as possible rather than the quality of the actual work."
good,Nothing negative at this time. Would be nice if they would allow work from home. Pay is very good.  Training needs some improvement. Many educational opportunities available.
good,"Though the stress level is fairly low, you won't be given much opportunity to learn while on the job and it can get a bit repetitive at times. So if you don't learn and try to advance your skills on your own time you might feel like you're stagnating."
good,"A lot of meetings, hard to find time to learn new stuff or explore different options. Most enjoyable part of the job is free snacks, coffee, and soda."
good,"Everything was ok. I did not have any real issues. The employees were nice. The managers were ok to deal with, tjey were nice buti could tell that pepple got on their nerves very easily"
good,"AT the time I was an employee, there were a ton of leadership and org changes going on in IT.  Kind of ended up being ""who you knew"" as to whether or not you would have to move or be terminated or were ""safe"".  Not necessarily a healthy feeling."
good,"Anthem was an amazing and great opportunity that opens doors for whom seek betterment in their business future. I learned a lot working there and it has been the best job I have had up to date."
good,In some areas management has room for improvement. People are friendly and helpful. Portfolio is nicely set up and updated regularly. Anthem won PMO of the year in 2014.
good,"Good job just wish they offered more pay. Offer decent benefits, would definitely go back to Anthem mainly due to the overtime it offers. Have nothing overall bad to say about Anthem. Great opportunities."
good,Many meetings per day for management and above.  Senior leadership could do a better job of communicating the overall goals the company wants to achieve.  There was a lot of changes at the executive level over the past year and some mid-level management didn't seem to be getting direction from upper level.
good,A great place to work. I would have liked more hands on time during training. The hardest part of the job is not being able to help the customers as much as I would have liked to sometimes.
good,"Anthem is a great place to work. The employees are diverse and Anthem offers a great deal of benefits. Wellness Credits yearly help cover the cost of your health insurance and the insurance isn't super expensive for one person... gets a little more expensive for dependents but still a decent set of plans. The company loves to hire within so if you get hired definitely network and ask to shadow other departments."
good,Very impressed with external perks. Nice discount on car purchase and Microsoft Office was a great buy. Nice 20% discount for cell phone through Anthem. I really liked the managers and director at my site.
good,Great company for clinical staff but if you are not clinical it is very hard to get promoted. Lots of meeting with no decision made in them. You can work from home in some positions.
good,"I was assigned with one other person to coordinate the COBRA insurances for the entire state of Michigan.  The company was in the process of changing over from paper-based records for policyholders, to computer based.  We started with 6700 paper-based records, and when I left we had a total of over 8000 computer-based files on policyholders.  "
good,"Workplace culture"
good,Nice place to work at however the company expects a higher level of working conditions.. management us satisfactory. Dress code is great. Cafeteria on site and parking garage is great.
good,"Anthem has a very good package of benefits and at times the work can be very rewarding. However, sometimes there can be a lot of hours and a real rush to get the job done resulting in many extra hours. Some managers are great, but others so-so. The area that does development for connecting data sources is a mess and totally unreliable while they trumpet their accomplishments. It's all BS. For a PM they are a scheduling and budgetary nightmare. On the whole, however, i really enjoyed working for Anthem and would be there still if they weren't going to force me to relocate to VA."
good,I loved the opportunity to work from home and having all the tools and resources necessary to be successful in my position there. However I would suggest better job placement for employees when a department loses their contract.
good,"Back to back calls"
good,"I work at home right now but when I went into the office, it was a nice quiet place to work. People tended to actually work instead of chatting all day, but you had the option if you wanted to. The building (Norfolk) is very clean, very nice architecture and has a Starbucks, a gym and a cafeteria. There is also a nice walking area outside, complete with a river and a picnic/barbeque area. "
good,I enjoyed my employment with bcbs!! Great management advancement in the company if anyone wants it. The way was decent and pay raises were available if you get in there and work.
good,Management was sometimes difficult to deal with.  Personal vs business was the way decisions were often made. I would return if I could. The compensation was excellent and they had a stellar training department.
good,"I think that Anthem is a great place to work. The benefits are great. "
good,"Good place to work. Not much scope for advancemen tt due to bad managers in some locations. As an employee working on Green card, My manager did not keep his word and I had to move out of the company because of that reason."
good,Lots of opportunities and a good total reward package!  There's lots to learn so it's important that you keep up with any changes and things affecting your job or the overall industry.
good,Position was a contractor working for a contractor.  Expectations were vague and procedures changed daily with little or no notification.  Management agreed to expectations that were difficult to comply with and they were set without any employee input
good,My time served at this employer was fun and served me well.  The employees were pleasant and the atmosphere was kind and sincere.  Management was very solid and concerned about their direct reports.
good,"Anthem BCBS Inc.  / Wellpoint Inc.  was a good place to work, Onsite gym and cafeteria . Modern facility, Security onsite . Ability to move up the ranks if yu are focused and driven"
good,This was my first professional job and I enjoyed my time there.  This was the beginning of my career in the tech industry.   Very grateful for the opportunity.
good,"Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield was as a contractor, an excellent place to work. Management was unusually respectful of my years of experience and treated me fairly."
good,"Enjoyed not being micro-managed which I think helps with production for me, gave assistant when needed, gave feedback on progress, all you had to do is ask to have more avenues of learning new processes."
good,I have learned at this job how to focus on what the provider wants. The company is a great company to work for.I enjoyed being able to communicate with providers on a daily basis.
good,"There is a diverse culture, flexible work schedule and great co-workers. There are lots of changes and you can never get bored of challenges."
good,"management needs direction, the company is diverse but lacks the ability to cross train its employees. Wellpoint's culture is great"
good,The company in general is a great company the pay could be better if I could find a different location and get more pay in my area I would love to saty with the company.
good,"I enjoy my job and the people I work with.  The only detriment is that salary is based more on your physical location (even if working remotely) than experience.  I think advancement opportunities are a bit difficult, depending on what department you are in."
good,"I enjoyed my co-workers and the work, as repetitive as it was. The most enjoyable part was having weekends off. The hardest part of the job was not knowing how much work needed to be done."
good,"Cleaning the facilities and offices."
good,"This is a position I took while in college part time, I was a personal care attendant and is taught me patients, and how to care for others. I know how I want to be treated and I use that to help get the job done,"
good,Good environment for a contractor. Good communication among teams with nice workflow. Very good set of developers onshore but had problems with the offshore team.
good,Fast paced environment with high call volume. There is always something new to learn if willing to take the initiative.
good,"Anthem is a very large corporation to work for.  There are lots of changes frequently, but a great group of associates that work hard but work together."
good,"Good place to work but it's hard to advance in the company. The atmosphere is pretty depressing."
good,"Overall, Anthem is a good company with great benefits and work/life balance.  The pay itself I feel is low considering the difficulty and expectations of the job. I think if I were able to stay there is good advancement opportunity here. My team is great!!  They are all helpful and more than willing to share their knowledge and resources.  I'm disappointed that I am being laid off. I would have loved to build a career here."
good,A typical day at Anthem is very busy. You have to be open to change. I enjoyed being able to work at home. They have good benefits.
good,"A typical day included researching of cases to make sure the customers payments and billing were correct."
good,"Call Center environment. Very stressful. Micromanaged. You are always asked to do more work, but you are not compensated ."
good,Excellent company with continues to change as the Healthcare landscape changes.   Located in multiple states and allows W@H for employees.
good,A very good place to work on Batch projects and to learn the health care business. Good place to learn the designing work and testing of projects.
good,I love assisting my members with day to day task with prior auth.  and drug costs. Co-workers and managers all easy to get along with. Sometimes customers are hard to deal with when they want things done immediately just have to explan to them that our process takes more time.
good,Anthem is ever changing workplace. Lots of movement with growth and changing opportunities. The future looks bright.
good,I start around 8am work till 4:30 pm till 5pm managing a task load of clients. I work in a pod of team members for the Dayton GEO Region. I learned how the Medicare aspect of Insurance is managed. The hardest part of the job it it is a virtual job. The most enjoyable is the flexibility.
good,"I have worked two different positions at this company and they were very enjoyable. The atmosphere is great and your coworkers are the best."
good,"(WFH) I worked from home, would receive work from work force management of claims that was high priority for guarantee pay accounts.  Process, adjust, request refund, send documentation to update member file or provider file on company database. "
good,Very faced paced call center for doctor referrals.   Management was very kind
good,The only bad thing about this place is that when you get stuck in a department you are there for a long time unless you are lucky enough to be recruited by another department.
good,"Typical day of the work will be managing various testing tracks for the program and responsible for the succesfull delivery of the projects into production releases."
good,Lots of layoff do to healthcare reform.   Leadership is diverse
good,"This company is growing rapidly.  A lot of hard work and long hours. Logical explanations were not always offered.  "
good,"I learned a lot with WellPoint in regards to insurance and coding medical insurance.  They worked as a team."
good,"ok place to work, pay is lower than average for the same job type with other companies."
good,"Friendly staff, helpful management."
good,"Great coworkers, cumbersome systems and managers far removed from the processes, Hardest part of job is reacing the right people in any situation.  Most enjoyable part of job is serving internal customers"
good,Calm and cool environment to work in. Laid back Management.
good,You can truly make Wellpoint work for you if you have the right managerial support.
good,Worked daily on audits from various departments to ensure accuracy and meeting guidelines with the company goals.
good,"A typical day was constantly on the phone lines for 8 hours with an hour lunch and 2-15 minutes break. However, supervisors and leads seemed as if they didn't want to help you with answering your questions pertaining to a call. The best part was getting overtime on the weekends!"
good,Anthem BCBS was a great place to work.  The only thing that was missing was good management.  Everything else was wonderful!!
good,Different job assignments dealing with automotive parts.  How dealerships order parts.  Management was good and informational.  Good people to work with.  Locating some dealers for response.  Knowledge of parts.
good,this was a great place to work flexible hours and raises were great if you did the work that was required.
good,It is a great experience working for WellPoint and its subsidiaries.  The company provides you with all the tools necessary to succeed in your position.  I enjoy the interaction the company has amongst the clients they serve.   I think there is a lot of room for growth and professional development from within.  Everyone that I've worked with has raised the expectations of their jobs and duties and they worked well together as a team.
good,"•13 years of analytical experience with WellPoint, Inc. as a Liaison between Business and Operations, Technology, and Government Services where I refined and transformed high-level business requirements into fine-tuned business and technical requirements"
good,Many opportunities to work from home but most are workaholics.
good,"I learned everything I know about healthcare.  loved working there period.  sadly due to healthcare reform they laid off a lot of people. the hardest and most enjoyable part about the job, was getting to help people."
good,"I loved working at BCBS before they became Anthem.  Then it was all about numbers and the individuality of it all was lost. Previously we had felt like ""family"".  I learned a lot about the different personalities joined together to make a department, and how to try and make that work. It is a good company."
good,"Review and process members applications via computer, daily use of excel, word. Communicating to members via phone daily. Clocking in and out for lunch and breaks."
good,I enjoyed my job at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Georgia for the first 10 years that I worked there. I enjoyed talking and assisting the members on their benefits.
good,Login to a 800 line and login to computer and answer emails about products and things that were not correct. The phone would start to ring with the same issues.
good,Provided great customer service. Continued to improve on ways to service the patients better
good,I would still be there if they hadn't chose to downsize. The people are wonderful.
good,The greatest part of working at this company is it allows us to work from home.
good,learned to work with many different types of personalities.
good,challenge of managing a global operations
good,See resume. Worked in all aspects of IT over the years and supervised a very good staff.
good,Turn over at senior management level was higher than expected. Great benefit package. Empowing opportunity.
good,Jobs are being outsourced and not a lot of advancement within the company.
good,Very fast paced and dynamic environment. Wide array of technologies.
good,"Great benefits although the insurance isn’t as cheap as you worth expect. Sometimes the work life balance is a bit difficult but it comes down to the department you work in. The same goes for the managers.  I have had both really good and really bad managers. I believe that the CEO is doing a great job trying to move the company in a positive direction, but sometimes the other top managers do not think about how their decisions affect the average worker at the company."
good,"Anthem has many great people, they struggle with work/life balance. Wages could be more competitive and more growth opportunities. I appreciate the ability to work remotely in most departments and my manager is amazing!! Overall it is a good company to work for."
good,"2 to 3 meetings a week, always able to count on your team, managers were always in meetings and not available to be with there team. Upper management really never new what there teams were doing and always wanted more work with less time to get it done and not enough people to help get it done. Also sometimes they would give us unrealistic goals."
good,"The training did not equip the rep for the job although the training was great and did her best.  Once one the floor you find out that you are actually doing 5-6 different jobs which made me unsure about things.  Also, there was no help on the floor or on the phone.  Sometimes a member waited for more then a day for an answer to their question."
good,This company had extreme and stringent work force metrics to adhere to while always demanding expert and detailed customer service for a national account health insurance provider.
good,Anthem is trying to compete in a very competitive market and the margin is so razor thin that a lot of times we are pressured to chase pennies because that does make a difference. The people working there are nice and professional.
good,"I really enjoy my coworkers and management. They make showing up to work fun! My customer service skills improve everyday, and I am very thankful for that."
good,the manager is a great manager and also gives great feed back and constructive criticism.  Also understanding of personal life.  This place is also not a place where they micromanage ypou.
good,"In the beginning anthem was great ,I was so proud to work there ,now Anthem has changed with the implementation of less than par computer systems that w have to use .Anthem also is setting unrealistic goals with the nonfunctional system we have to use .We are always the last to know something there Not fourth coming with details we should know as employees"
good,"it was a learning experience. if you're able to put your emotions to the side, able to basically take the blame for someones death, or why they're sick. go for it."
good,"I was employed during a reconstructive time for the company. Because of the changes taking place at the time, the chance for advancement was limited. I would however work for the company again"
good,"Agile focus allowed for collaborative work areas.  Recently there have been 3 layoffs in the IT area.  Overall, I enjoyed working there and would accept another position if it was offered to me."
good,"This is not just for me, but ive seen many employees get let go not because of performance but because the company wished to save money by hiring outside of California. Its part of life and business but just be careful, there is no loyalty in this company but has many perks. I enjoyed my time there for 14yrs."
good,"Exciting and challenging.  Never a dull moment. "
good,"I love working for Anthem. The salary and benefits make it difficult to consider leaving. Overall, from my experience her, I would highly recommend this employer."
good,Anthem falls into the realm of other organizations. The executives are focused on maintaining good standing in the market and will eliminate needed positions to do so. Impacting the organizations ability to allow for adequate work life balance at times.
good,"management "
good,"The benefits are great (ex. 401K/401 IRA, tuition reimbursement, discounts) and you have the option to work remotely. It beats having to commute to work, especially if you live in an area where you have a long commute (my commute is a combined hour to and from). One of the hardest parts of the job is staff turnover, especially if you're in a telephonic role with high call volume. I've been in several departments that have high call volumes and it can be exhausting at times. Workplace culture varies by department; some departments are highly dependent on metrics set by performance guarantees and it can be straining because of the pressure to meet those PG's. All in all, if you can take the bad with the good, Anthem is a good company to work for."
good,"Like any corporation, your team environment has a big impact on quality of the job and work/life balance. The leadership has recently been changing a lot of higher level folks but that is also normal. Currently analyst job allows WFH but more and more are no longer allowing it."
good,"There never was a typical day, my job had several different requirements and no two days were the same.  It helped keep from being monotonous, but it was also difficult to keep up with the workload at times."
good,"Great place to work.  Flexible hours and good vacation benefits. "
good,So far it’s okay. Definitely interesting environment. Atmosphere is pretty relaxed in nature. A lot of things to go through and learn and sooooo many diff systems to learn.
good,Anthem in general is a good place to work.  They pay well and you don't have to work crazy hours.  I worked in the Medicaid department and loved the leadership team there.  My issue was with the executive team.  Their vision always seem to be a moving target and they seemed to be clueless that the culture was deterioating.
good,Great place to work.  Good pay and benefits.  work hours were good and plenty of paid time off.  Too bad alot of people lost their positions due to downsizing
good,This location mostly hires African Americans. Pay rate is fantastic however advancement to another department is unlikely. Rules and regulations change often and none of the managers are on the same page. You don't get sick days or vacation days. All Paid time off and sick days are considered to be PTO. I worked as a health program representative. No drug test is required. Must go through a contract company to work with for 6 months before you are up for hire with the company. Hourly rate at start is $13/hr and with the company the pay goes up to $15.50/hr. Start off hours after training is from 2pm-10:30 and the most hours you will work is 34. Once hired on with the company you may be eligible to work 40 hours. The company also has a point system in place. Points take 6 months to a year to fall off and u cannot have more than 9.
good,"They believe in getting the most our of 40 hours and having a life outside of the office. Like a lot of organizations, management is not always as structured as they could be to benefit the organization and the staff."
good,"Good work life balance  Work at home opportunities  "
good,"Good company to work for. Salaried employees work week average of 50 -55 hours."
good,The knowledge that I received from Anthem formally Amerigroup has been great. I have taken on so much understanding of Health Insurance and know this will be valuable in my future.
good,I learned that there are many people that can help when you have questions.  I had many friends there and most people are very friendly and helpful.  Hardest part of the job is too many cases to work on and quality expected.
good,"A Customer Service position interacting with other field offices. Very"
good,"I love my job at Anthem, however the current manager is located in Atlanta, GA, with meant her contact with us was limited.  There were no performance reviews.  she has since been relieved as our manager and we now have an on-site manager"
good,Hard work with good pay to match. Anthem associates are usually assigned work and left on their own for completion. Resources (written and coworkers) are available for assistance.
good,"I believe that Anthem has the tools to build better management skills in the healthcare world. The most important skill I have learned it communication, when the whole department communicates correctly it shows in production value."
good,"Good environment and good working place Good life security company. Working hours also better .It has different departments like QC,Research and Development, Production, QualityAssurence, Warehouse etc"
good,Overall Great job experience enjoy my time there. I learned the most from this job regarding medical insurance and how benefits are processed against a person policy. Great experience.
good,"A typical day consisted of talking to customers and providers pertaining to claims, medical benefits, and eligibility for Medicaid. I was in a management role for a little over a year."
good,"Anthem is a very good company that invests time and money into training their employees. If they could find a way to dial back the amount of blanket emails that you receive on a daily basis, employees could be even more productive."
good,I have added a lot of knowledge that I didn't have before working here. My typical day is problem solving and great customer service.  The only reason I'm looking employment elsewhere is that I'm a contractor and looking for a permanent position.
good,"Nice team culture and a proper management system in planning to deliver the task."
good,Anthem was a fast paced company.  It was lead by great managers and they were all creative out of the box thinkers.  There was a lot of room for advancement.
good,Current team lead/manager work well with having a flex schedule. Yearly reviews usually with cost of living raises but nothing else. Looking for something with room for growth and ability to move up.
good,Anthem Policy Holders calling into Anthem to renew /discontinue policies..The offices were comfortable and the people very willing to help. Management was very visible and always available to help. Very supportive work place.
good,Very challenging. Need to be able to change mind sets for each call that comes though.  Very satisfying work day when problems can be resolve quickly to the clients satisfaction on the first call.  
good,A typical day would include either working cases that needed CSR assistance or taking phone calls to resolve members issues with benefits and or claims. The hardest part of the job is managing the amount of work compared to call volume.
good,"I enjoy the work environment and I have a great manager. The work I currently do is boring, but there are opportunities to transfer to other departments."
good,This was a very brief job for me.  Only about 6 months.  It started as a contract position then I was hired into a permanent position but the position at the WV PCA was offered and I left
good,Anthem is a great place to work. You must be comfortable with change and ambiguity. Provides a very professional atmosphere and a true open door policy. Leaders were very approachable and took time to listen. The people made working there worthwhile!
good,A Good Client to work with.Managers are supportive and learned new skills while working along. Work and personal life balance is easy to manage when people around you are supportive.
good,"Anthem is a good organization, but living in Tampa has severely limited my advancement opportunities. The management team is responsive and tries to be helpful."
good,"Great work environment and quick paced."
good,"When I was employed at Anthem my work shift started at 11am until 6 pm."
good,"Good place to work but hours are too much. Job can be stressful and demanding. Location is great on train line. Manager is nice, but too many case files to review within time allowed."
good,"Worked here as a temporary employee, contract will expire at the end of 2017. Cohesive and pod team concepts. Viable working situation with promotion available."
good,"I would bring up several sites to review claims and based on the information viewed decide if the claim (s) should be paid or were overpaid.    Any wrong information on the documents being viewed were sent to Operation Experts and were corrected then I viewed the claims again."
good,I’ve been with Anthem for almost 10 years. I’ve steadily progressed in my career since joining the organization.  The company offers an awesome learning and development program which allows associates to map out their career goals.
good,"This is a great place to work.  You have the opportunity to attend meetings and be included in the processes."
good,Networking as a intern is a must. I had the opportunity to work with many applications and gain a vast amount of experience. Anthem allows the interns to grow in develop to be great future IT employees
good,It is a big company with all the benefits anyone could be looking for. The benefits were reasonable and they paid for most of them. Fast paced and high call volume. They have multiple positions to chose from and can find a fit that best suits you.
good,i am an java developer looking for a change and able to work on most of the backend coding using java /j2ee and writing API and trouble shooting testing in agile methodologies
good,"I have worked at Anthem for over 10 years.  Overall, Anthem is a great place to work.  I especially enjoyed their work from home opportunity.  As with most companies, after 10 years on a job, you find yourself complacent and with a salary that is not competitive.  "
good,"Grievance/Appeals Analyst II will review, analyze and process non-complex and some complex pre service and post service grievances and appeals requests in the Enterprise Grievance & Appeals Department from customer types and multiple products related to clinical and non clinical services, quality of service, and quality of care issues to include executive and regulatory grievances."
good,"Busy competitive, multitasking. Job security and advancement. Work life and life balance. Competitive and culturally inclusive. Sensitive to employees needs."
good,"At the end of 12 years, the company had to downsize while a lot of people lost their jobs. Unable to find a job making that kind of money when I left ($18 hr)"
good,"I love BCBS of GA. Being with the company for 14 plus years, I am ready to take the knowledge I've gained to apply in other areas outside of the company."
good,This is a great place to work to start out.  I worked in several different departments over 17 years and was very happy most of the time. There are many perks to working for a corp this large.
good,Good Place to work at and at the end of the day you feel like you have assisted with changing that members life. I have had a very good experience with my coworkers and managers.
good,"Great focus on employee health and wellness - health club reimbursement, wellness seminars, etc. I learned a great deal about the prior authorization and post-service appeals process as well as how health insurance companies play a role in providing access to health care."
good,anthem wasn't a bad place to work hard to move around an advance here in certain departments. Some favoritism when trying to advance and grow. This company is team work friendly  everyone is a team player.
good,"Taking calls and solving problems concerning healthcare benefits."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is learning new things and the great attitude and team mentality of my coworkers.  The hardest part of the job is the volume of work with few resources.
good,"Great teamwork, good life balance, good workplace culture, after you earn a degree - only internal training available, co-workers most enjoyable part of the job."
good,A typical day at work starts with sending the sales report from the day before to senior management follow by a conference call with the staff to kick off the day.
good,My department handled all aspects of Medicare part D.  I started in an entry level position doing member enrollment and was consistently promoted every year or so.  I worked in all areas from enrollment to finance.  I helped train and develop the resubmission team as well as the medicare as secondary payer team.
good,"You must know that as being a contractor, you have to meet key metrics for 3 months straight WITHIN that QUARTER to be looked at as a possible full-time, permanent employee with Anthem."
good,"If you dont mind being monitored and micromanaged for 8 hours a day 5 days a week and can talk to the phone you have a job. Pay is good, benefits package is great. My manager was the worst manager I have ever encountered, doing things against the company's/employees/customers best interest to better serve herself, and HR didnt care. Company is not always in the sonsumers best interests either, plenty of underhanded business. Besides that, it was a easy boring 9-5"
good,"Anthem, Inc is a great company to be a part of. I was a part-time employee to a wonderful doctor. I can not believe there are companies that still offer all benefits to part-time employees, including PTO."
good,"Anthem is a Great Place to work, to move into the HealthCare Industry. The Business is growing very fast. The Training has not caught up with the fast past environment, but the business changes everyday."
good,I had the honor of working with some of the most talented and intelligent people ever collected in one office.  Management truly cared about their team.  Hard work with rewards.
good,This job was a temporary job.  Insurance open enrollment. So a typical day after training was taking incoming calls from customers seeking to get medical insurance. The hardest part of the day was when systems where down which happened often.  The fun part was getting little prizes during the day.
good,"Responsible for handling incoming healthcare claims ensuring a high level of customer service and maximizing productivity by processing claims accurately"
good,"At first, trainning was not very successful, since it was the first open enrollment in History.  procedures were not implementede until late in the first year.  overall the work  enviroment was good, and good pay incentives.  a bad side was that it was a temporary Job."
good,"This company is a great place to work. The advancement is not as frequent. It's a well diverse place. The benefits are awesome. The management is approachable, and somewhat knowledgeable of their specific duties."
good,The facility was a great place to work. Gym and cafeteria. Parking area was always plowed and there was plenty of parking.
good,"We would take inbound calls from members and sometimes providers for national group accounts. Help assist our members with anything that they needed as far as benefits, claims or eligibility issues. I learned a lot about insurance and about how to navigate the most efficient way through systems. Management tried to make it a fun and enjoyable work environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to assist the members and let them know that they don't have to worry about anything because it will be taken care of."
good,"I will tell people about BCBS and I will work there again if  had to."
good,"Good healthcare benefits, very huge corporation with two corporate locations, can be very busy environment, good compensation."
good,Positive team with a supportive manger. Company is about having employee meet the productivity so having a positive encouragement  team and manager out weighs the high demand and stress.
good,"Most of the rank and file people are great and know their stuff. Most have been there for at least a decade. The problem with Anthem is they have ""Shiny Thing Syndrome"" Senior management likes to change things at the drop of a hat with no warning and completely change the direction of the company without it seems much thought. "
good,"Loved my job in IT when I started mainly due to a proactive manager, who trusted the staff and wanted the employees to learn and grow. The next manager came in and was very incompetent and reactive. They also lowered the team moral. Was very difficult to work with this manager, but loved working and helping co-workers."
good,"One of the many features/ benefits that drew me to Anthem is their tuition reimbursement program. Here, you can take any 2- or 4- year degree classes (not necessarily related to your current position), and if you make C's or better in your classes, will be reimbursed your main tuition/ book costs."
good,"My overall duties were to provide training and education to our external brokers to help them grow their independent insurance business.  I was their consultant, advisor, trainer, overall go-to resource for agents to assist their existing clients, develop marketing tactics for new business and establish themselves as an expert insurance agent.  I enjoyed using my interpersonal relationship skills to fully understand each agent's needs, and my greatest accomplishment was their successful growth and the relationships we developed."
good,"This job provided a great opportunity to learn the basics of how health insurance works. Most customers complain or don't understand the process, and because they don't listen sometimes it can be challenging to explain it to them."
good,"Overall, the work was rewarding.  Anthem did its best to ensure proper training of all personnel regardless of incoming skill level.  The overall supporting software was glitchy and disconnected making the job much more challenging than it needed to be.  Following the provided flow charts were useful to those who lacked phone skills but management's insistence on following was at best, nominally helpful to those who possessed charisma and was often a hindrance.  The overall goal of retention was supplanted with time metrics not permitting agents to do their best work.  On the plus side, interacting with customers in a positive and helpful way was a daily morale boost.  One cannot walk away from the job without a solid foundation in health insurance policies and procedures.  Overall it was a positive experience with the issues being correctable if corporate implements them.  It is a unique program but any agent will be better prepared for the industry present and future."
good,As a temporary associate it was a great place to work. The employees I worked with were very helpful and very knowledgeable.
good,"Laid back fun work environment, Stress free workplace, great people and managers, also a lot of focus on employee health."
good,"Great company, great location, great work life balance. A typical day at work is always busy and never a dull moment."
good,"Overall, Anthem is a good company. After the recent roll-out of the ACA Anthem has been rapidly growing, which is creating more opportunities."
good,"In an ever changing industry the training was a little unorganized, had to learn a lot of information on the fly.  Management is very good and they know the systems and products as all managers have had several years of experience doing the same job.  Excellent work environment, however you are on a strict schedule as this is a call center."
good,"job allows to assist member with billing issues and researching questions about insurance contract"
good,great place to work. friendly enviroment. the hardest part would be trying to meet goals.
good,"I am currently a  telephonic nurse, encouraging members to take charge of their health. Helping them identify health goals and interventions  to help them achieve their health goals.  "
good,"overall a good company to work for. customer service very stressful, management is ok, coworker's mostly ok."
good,"The reason why am looking for job change is, its a Contract basis job. Am just looking for a permanent basis job in a reputed organization. Apart from that am very happy to work in that company. My Co-workers are very supportive, jovial. Learned alot from my seniors. Me and Co-workers enjoy in every weekends those days are unforgettable."
good,Fast paced enviroment assisting customers and clients with many problems. Great benefits and good pay.
good,"Installed the Refresh Packs and fix packs to WebSphere ND V7.0 /8.0 environment, for WebSphere, plugins and IHS."
good,"Work Environment was fun and co workers were great, there was alot of changes regarding the management team, often not on one accord. The work was often overwhelming if you did not pay attention to detail and listen effectively. The People and clients however were awesome to work with had an enjoyable long 8  years."
good,"As a Customer Care Representative I research and analyze data to address operational challenges and customer service issues."
good,Work on my daily assignment which differ every other day. Very busy during month-end close period.
good,This environment was unique in the fact that you were always dealing with enterprise outages. It was challenging & you never knew what to expect.
good,"This is call center job as a secure job in Customer Service."
good,Good company that is open to professional development and fosters building solid working relationships.
good,"Contract position which included leading a small team of entry level insurance service providers in call center contact techniques, providing staff coaching, and staff mentoring."
good,"Accomplishments:"
good,I enjoyed training new hires and current assocaites as well as the relationships that I have forged.
good,"Great place to work with nice people and great management, good communication and training tools.  I learned a lot about health care which helped me get where I am today."
good,"A typical day at work included making over 1,000 phone calls to many of potential insurance cleints. Also, taking many applications over the phone or through the fax machine. Checking voicemails and emails as they flowed in. I learned how to build a relationship with our clients; there was no better feeling than talking to someone you've never met before and feeling like you all had been best friends for years. My manager was a very driven person who constantly pushed all of his employees to be just as driven. I absolutely loved my co-workers, i looked forward to walking into work everyday just to see them, we were all like family. The hardest part of my job was hearing that one of our clients had passed away; especially after a long battle. The most enjoyable part of my job was definitely the pay check at the end of the week, I also enjoyed the clients I had met via email and phone. I can't forget all the friends I made out of my co-workers. "
good,"Blue Cross Blue Shield was an excellent choice for me when  i graduated high school. I wouldn't mind a job there again. It became mind boggling when they began to their outsourcing, to Wellpoint during my tenure. Jobs were becoming obsolete and personnel w/ 20 or so years were forced with severance pay and unemployment benefits. I left to join a more secure force of work, the military. "
good,"As a Manager of the Call Center I focused on my teams quality and other metrics to make sure that they were in line with the company's goals.  In addition, I would facilitate meetings with my team to update them on our team and the company's progress.  My team took calls from providers and members who had Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance and answered a variety of questions."
good,"Anthem BC/BS is also known Wellpoint.  as I have stated previously, I have processed medical, dental & medicare supplement, accums and have worked in customer service "
good,"Benefits were good, I worked from home which was a huge plus"
good,"I was hired in as a claims examiner after losing a similiar position with a corporation that was going through bankruptcy and downsizing. I was uneasy about working at another company doing basically the same thing. My previous position and company was a horrible experience but I was pleasantly surprised that not all insurance companies treated employees terribly. Then, Anthem (pre-Wellpoint) was a positive workplace environment with great benefits- although the starting hourly wage was low and training was a joke. Management was non-threatening and the stress level was not overwhelming. Overtime was voluntary and there were incentives and recognition for increased productivity. Now the down side- After about a year big changes started taking place- the company became public, new management came in and all advancement and transfers opportunies were gone- no one could apply for open positions within the company anywhere. The company continued to buyup smaller companies throughout the country all business was doing well. The new top management kept to themselves and associated with very few people. After acouple of years of this - there was talk of a merger with Wellpoint and Anthem and that our location could be closed. Management tried to deny it but eventually they called us in to confirm it. The merger not only was eliminating jobs but also benefits as well to remaining employees. Those of us who lost our jobs in July lost our profit sharing ( the last year it was being offered ). I haven't worked fulltime since."
good,"This is a great place to work, but the training is very intensive."
good,"I have taught myself every skill that is listed in my resume and on my linked in page. I oversee multiple reps, and am responsible for assisting the company in maintaining its service goals"
good,Cooperation among employees
good,After being employed at Anthem BCBS for 11 years I would have to say that I enjoyed my employment there and enjoyed the people that work there.
good,This can be a good place to work but they are very bottom line oriented and will not hesitate to move jobs overseas and make cuts in personnel. Some areas and positions have less of a chance than others. They require you to work in a position for almost a year before you can apply for any other positions in the company.
good,Leading Health Insurance employer. Need more opportunities for advancement.
good,"I learned how to persevere in the field of sales. When one door closed, another door would open. I started out slowly with the sales calls and progressed into learning much about the insurance field before I was laid off along with many others. This was an enjoyable experience to sell a tangible product to a consumer compared to my experience of selling a persons skills."
good,This is a good company to work for but you must be able to downplay some of your skills to allow for the company to grow and develop their own translations of skills such as PM and Agile.
good,I liked being there everyday....no complaints.
good,"for the past almost 6 years, I had worked from home."
good,- Starting at 7:30 with two breaks and 30 min for lunch.
good,Wellpoint has given me experience in the Financial healthcare sector.
good,You were treated as an employee and not as a family member. Everyone was treated equal. You were compensated by performance not by who you married.
good,"I work with a great team of people that always put our members first. A typical work day for me consists of resolving complex claim issues, the most enjoyable part of the job is knowing we are helping people."
good,"This company compensates well and has good benefits. Some in management do not appreciate it when you get an education and that hindered me in any advancement in this company. It was all in who you knew, not how qualified you are to get promoted."
good,"The complexity of healthcare is very high, and I continue to learn new things everyday.  At the end of the day though, we do challenging work to ensure that our members have the right healthcare options at the right time and that we simplify healthcare as much as possible."
good,I really loved working with Anthem and wish they had more remote full-time opportunities. Direct managers seemed to keep out of the loop sometimes. But they were very open and receptive when contacted. The hardest part of the job was having to work with and develop content that felt outdated and not engaging. LEDs should have updated professional development workshops.
good,Its good to be in Anthem since it gives you all the perks of being in a good company. Work culture is very good accompanied by the flexibility you expect to be needed when you work.
good,"Every department or unit can be different. Every manager is different. The position and all it entails can be rewarding, depending on your unit and manager."
good,"With proper training and better pay/benefits this would be a great company to work for. The managers are and district managers are great people, I just believe improvements are needed."
good,"Best benefit is working from home, all weekends and holidays off. Direct manager is very easy to work with. Flexible schedule. Great work life balance. Lots of paid time off"
good,I loved working as a case manager for Anthem.  We were mostly able to work from home with the exception of field visits to check in on our members and the occasional meeting at the office.
good,I am still actively employed here and have nothing negative to say.  Ive been employed here 20 years so Im loving something! The best part is the ability to work from home.  The worst part is virtual training.
good,"Left for substantial pay increase and better location "
good,"Anthem is a caring company with great work life balance. If you like an open office floorplan with free snacks and soda, you will be happy. Although it can get too loud at times, everybody is very friendly."
good,I have worked for Anthem the last 14 years.  I have learned various job functions and have gained many  new job skills. I have had the opportunity to grow with the company both skill level wise and monetary incentatives.
good,"Competitive work environment but the company has great benefits-many jobs are work at home, flexible schedules, medical, dental, vision, life, and tuition reimbursement."
good,"Very large organization with a lot of movement, have to be able to adapt to high levels of change quickly"
good,They truly had some of the greatest managers out there. Very helpful and truly did have an open door policy. Could have used a little bit of work on the work/life balance though.
good,Great director and wonderful company to work for. Benefits are excellent. One of the highest paying jobs in Hampton Roads. They invest in an employees growth.
good,"I have worked at Anthem for 12 years.  It is a constant  incoming call phone center .  The hardest part is dealing with non-English speaking reps from other companies.  Many hospitals and medical offices hire out their billing and collections, and they use off site companies, which makes it difficult to understand when English is not the first language.  MY office has recently started supporting a mental health insurance coverage which has been difficult.  Management has tried to be supportive but the client has been known to make changes mid year, which has been hard to support."
good,I learned a great deal working at Anthem. The people were fantastic to work with. Large company with ability for advancement. Overall a solid company to work for.
good,Anthem has a professional culture that promotes accountability from employees.  They do a nice job of educating employees on the company's mission and goals but could improve in a few areas like training and career counseling.
good,"I will say that this job did a good job of illuminating office culture.  "
good,"AIM Speciality Health mission is  to promote appropriate, safe, and affordable health care. As the leading specialty benefits management partner for today's health care organizations,AIM helps to improve the quality of care and reduce costs for today's most complex tests and treatments for many health care specialities."
good,I would recommend anybody to seek a job at Anthem.  Great environment with challenging and rewarding tasks working with a diverse group of people from all over the world.
good,"Anthem offers market standard benefits and work opportunities.  Like all health insurance companies, Anthem faces market factors to  innovate the health care delivery model.  Based on market demand, 4th Quarter will demand extra hours."
good,schedules could be better because you work what they give you . I would really recommend this place for singles and individuals with no children for the entrance in the door.
good,"Worked from home in IT.  Job was eliminated when Anthem decided to consolidate all nationwide IT staff to Richmond, VA and Atlanta, GA.  Frankly, it seemed like a typical management method to rid the company of older/senior workers who would not be willing to relocate (even if offered) and save the company on salaries."
good,Anthem can provide a person with long-term employment but not everyone has opportunities for advancement. Overall a nice place to work. Great benefits.
good,"Good place to work, culture isn't as welcoming as expected but over a great place. "
good,This was a great place to work.  Everyone worked well together.  Overtime was optional but available if wanted.  Stock options were great.  I learned more about insurance there than with any other company.
good,They offer good benefits and it is easy to keep your job/low productivity standards. Depending on your department it can be stressful and lacks ability to develop internally.
good,"I was recently a Contractor, but wasn't given enough time to exercise the main 'hands-on' experience that I sought, but feel as though I would as a perm Full Time team member"
good,"One of the best part of working at Anthem, is their commitment to encouraging everyone to learn and continue to educate ourselves.  "
good,"I work from home. I have learned A lot while working at Anthem, but I have also learned the difference between good management and bad management and what it can do to employees. While i have been at Anthem I have earned my Bachelors degree, in which Anthem helped pay for. That is something that has been great about Anthem."
good,"This company offers unlimited opportunities for promotion, unlimited resources and training, great morale with lots of team building and great people!"
good,very fast paced as a referral coordinator you are spending time doing out bound calls to healthcare entities.  There were a lot of cases that were tasked to the CM and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit  Nurses on a daily basis
good,"Field phone calls and emails from members as well as team members."
good,Very support team members working together for excellence.  My manager was the best.  She  was very supportive and always push you to be your best.  I enjoyed my job very much.
good,Like all large companies it can be a great please for professional growth and advancement. Blue Cross Blue Shield/Wellpoint is a national company so you can transfer all over the US.
good,"Enjoyed the very short time that I was there. It's a relaxed environment, managers don't micro manage and they let you do your work without looking over your shoulder."
good,"Anthem was a great company to work for.  Yes, it's a big company with a lot of rules, but most of the management team and peers were some of the brightest people I've been associated with.  They challenged us  on one-hand and were incredibly supportive on the other."
good,"Overall great company to work. Anthem is a conglomerate of healthcare companies located around the nation. They offer remote positions, flexibility, and good benefits. I would recommend to a friend."
good,"Consumer service associate-"
good,"Great culture, great people to work with. The only down side is if you are on the frontlines on the phones, be prepared for a fast paced environment. Lots of information to take in, and no room for error. Also once you have used your ""Unexcused Absences"" that they give, and have an emergency they are not likely to approve or excuse it."
good,"Overall great company to work for but management not in tune with staff needs quite often."
good,"I've enjoyed working for Anthem -- and I've come to appreciate that having a good manager makes all the difference.  I've worked in different departments as an administrative assistant, and I've met and worked with very capable and accomplished associates.  The people here care about their work, which is important to me."
good,Enjoyed my 16 years and 7 months in service with the organization.The growth is available within all departments. Working with the organization for a long period of time allotted knowledge in all areas of the health care insurance business.
good,This job is an entry level for college young adults. this is not a typical work environment for people that do not like the type of telemarket type of environment.
good,"My overall time with the company was wonderful.  However, as changes were happening company wide there was a lot of micro-management and duplicate, sometimes triplicate reporting processes of the same information which takes away from productivity."
good,I would begin the day by collecting the tips from the rooms I am scheduled too I would then make sure my cleaning cart was all stocked and ready to use. I would go down the list and go room to room and clean every single room that was used I would eventually take a break then start back up until all jobs were done. I would then go tell my boss I was done and clock out
good,Develop a network of subject matter experts in all areas with which your position will deal. Maintain open lines of communication. Learn as much as you can about all aspects of your area of responsibility & remain current in your knowledge & contacts. Changes happen quickly & often!
good,"They provided flexible working hours and offered benefits. Also availability, upon meeting requirements, to work from home which I did for almost 10 yrs."
good,"My time at Anthem was rewarding. I was often promoted and my job duties changed regularly, which was good for me. Work/life balance is encouraged, although the workload dictated how this would work for the individual. "
good,"Not Bad.  Not great.  Good benefits.  Mediocre management.  Customer service.  Pay is below average.  Parking is a nightmare. Alll and all, It was a great experience."
good,"I enjoyed working for Anthem, however, within 6 months there was a Reduction In Force that I was part of. "
good,"Convergys, like many other call centers, has its upsides and downsides. An upside is that its garenteed 40 hours a week if your stats are at par. A downside is that the area at which the call center is located at, has a high crime rate and cars get broken into and the security officer there doesn't do anything about it."
good,Good place to work  with a positive workplace atmosphere. Teams were formed and there was great comrade within the team members. There was also a positive engagement  of both personal and professional development.
good,Employees treated like adults but for that reason attendance policy is very strict. Raises given every year and advancement is possible. Holidays are paid and hours are great.
good,I have been working here for almost a year. Recently did a shift bid. Top of the line got the bad end of the stick. Newer people got the better shifts
good,Worked in a call center.  Learned a lot about Medicare and Medicaid.  Diverse workplace culture.  Colleagues treated you with respect.  I enjoyed educating members with health and prescription benefits.
good,A typical day began with daily stand-ups. I learned quickly how to shift directions according to client requirements.Senior management has an honest open door policy to share recommendations and express challenges.
good,Anthem is a great company  to work for. With the merge a lot have changes are set in place. Adapting to them have been challenging. But overall a decent place.
good,I like the benefits Anthem offers its employees.  They try hard to take good care of us.  The management tries to help people improve themselves so they can go for promotions.  Anthem offers PTO which you accrue every month.  The hardest part is sitting at your desk for 8 hours.
good,Typical corporate setting. Worked several positions for this company. Gained a vast knowledge of the health insurance business. Lucky enough to work from home.
good,"Typical day of work, flexible hours from 7am-6pm. Management is hit or miss. Low opportunity for advancement. Low pay. Hardest part of the job is staying motivated."
good,"I was hired as a seasonal contractor to assist with production of marketing materials. As a contractor, I had access to the appropriate training and was treated well by my colleagues. Except for the brevity of my assignment and lack of benefits, I was treated well - like any member of the team."
good,As a case manager the job was ever changing. I worked from home with equipment they provided. I enjoyed working with my clients and helping them to move forward towards being more healthy. I worked evenings.

good,"Great people to work with.  Managers vary from great to very poor.  I have great until the final manager.  Work load is reasonable except during open enrollment when it will sky rocket."
good,Work from home is great. Job/workload is constantly changing. Managers and upper executives are very transparent of what is going on in the company. So far agree with CEO vision of the company.
good,I've been employed at Anthem Inc. for almost 17 years. I've learned a great deal in my years of employment. I've worked in several different areas and obtained a great deal of knowledge in my years.
good,Great pay and compensation.  This was a temp position so I knew it would be ending in 6 months.  The management staff and co-workers were very supportive and fun.
good,"I enjoyed working for Anthem. The pay was decent, but my position was an ""at will"" job. And when it came to job layoffs, I was one of the unlucky workers."
good,"Company with a lot of technology change. Fast Pace always moving forward."
good,"Good benefits, interesting projects, perfect carrier opportunities. The company had two merges in four years and seven lay offs/downsizing processes. A lot of classes what company paid off."
good,Large insurance company that is trying to keep up with the Affordable Care Act.  Due to ACA lots of changes in the past and with the new presidency even more changes in the future.
good,"Overall, I have been very happy with my time at Anthem.  I have had 2 managers in my tenure and both provided the support and resources that I needed to thrive.  The company does a great job managing complex work-at-home environment"
good,"The supervisor was very supportive of me and she was glad that I joined her team- CM. Telecommute was not working for me."
good,"Very flexible as far as work hours. Most managers are very relaxed and easy to work with. I am only an intern, so I don't get PTO, WFH, etc., but the full time employees seem mostly pleased with working here."
good,"Anthem is a wonderful company to work for with the benefits, tuition reimbursement, and the ability to grow with the company. I learned so much about health insurance policies and understanding how medical claims are processed."

good,"Great opportunity fast paced, professional environment. Great training. Wish there were more opportunities to go from contract to full time employment."
good,Really enjoyed working with the RC&A team. Great firm culture. A lot of friendly people. The job required a lot of learning but the team was very helpful in getting me upto speed.
good,Anthem is a leading healthcare organization. Much can be done to refine their process of choosing management. But overall great company with advancement potential.
good,"Learned how to improve listening skills and attention to detail as well as ethical practice. Co-workers were team oriented, punctual, and motivated."

good,"Working Anthem is great the employees are hard working, and some of he management team is very active in insuring employees advance in their academic and  professional careers."
good,Working in such a large company gave my opportunity for advancement and help to establish a mindful experience that hard work really pays off
good,"Part of the IT team. Large number of contractors, and no unity in the team. Management not able to keep track of fast-growing team."
good,"A typical workday may last longer than 8 hours to really complete all that is expected. I enjoy the team approach to managing the workload. The culture has been wonderful. I have met some of my best friends here. I have been working for Anthem for 2+ years. The benefits are phenominal with the medical insurance options, 401k, and Time off. The managers that I have had have been ok. I feel that they should offer a little bit more leadership training classes to keep everyone on the same page."
good,"I worked in management unit in call center. took calls from members, doctors office, hospital. talked with them about medications, authorizations and benefits."
good,"They had many good benefits to working there. A 24 hour gym, a full service cafeteria, good location to reach other restaurants. I like how I stayed busy and we were able to alternate between departments every 2 hours. I was hired on as a Pharmacy Technician and we would type data, do math related to dosage and medications, and then send to the next department for billing and customer service. Also worked in Data Entry for just typing in customers personal information, insurance, and scan documents into scanner to automate them. In the packing department I would pack medications for delivery. It was very important to always be alert and pay attention to details, names, and product safe handling instructions. Some medications require to be kept cold."
good,"Worked on projects, audited claims and phone calls.  Mentored new team members, trained team members.  The flexibility was the best part of the job, being able to  work from home when necessary.  The co-workers were awesome group of people.  We worked well together to meet weekly and monthly goals."
good,"Very friendly, nice people, job not challenging. Not enough promotion within company. Seemed very political, but overall management staff was knowledgeable."
good,"IT personnel are globally disperse and most work from home. Must be self-motivated and reliable.,  IT systems are supported both internally and outsourced which can make management or finding information about systems challenging."
good,"Good consistent work, nothing unrealistic expected of you, and as long as you show up on time you are good. The only bad thing about my time there is how upper higher management changed so frequently the ""new"" way of doing things would often reflect poorly on how things have been done successfully prior to a new ceo or department head being introduced. At the time Anthem was laying off everyone and sending the work overseas to the Philipines and let go of everyone except a few select departments. The warning is that no warning is given when they feel you are unnecessary and let you go. Things may have changed for the better in 10 years, but again just my experience while employed there."
good,"Anthem is a good place to work but no room for advancement.  I worked for company for two years and I still can't get into another department. Our department is closing down. we only got three weeks notice, which I thought was horrible"
good,I was at Anthem 21 years and was laid  off due to job elimination. I really have nothing bad to say. People have said there is no room for advancement. In 15 years I went from temp clerk to Underwriter with no college degree. It is what you make of it.
good,"For the most part this company was great.  They treated the Member Services Dept to lunches, events, care packages, etc.  A very high volume of calls that reached the dept on a daily basis and a lot of pressure was put on the reps to perform and daily reach a certain overall percentage of calls handled so that management can be sure to get their bonus.  Not a large raise opportunity unless you were moved into a different position.  Overall this was a good company to work for despite the usual politics and sneakiness"
good,Very friendly place that is supportive and offers many chances for advancement. They offer great training and job assistance.
good,A mature and stable organization.  Good Benefits and an orderly environment.  Many areas of interest.  Lots of vertical and horizontal room for advancement.
good,Good place to grow technically. Strong management support for associates decisions. Not a good place for work life balance. Overall good one.
good,$20hr to be hpa during oe.  train really well.  can be a little too hectic at times.   customer service needs to be trained better. lot of putting members on hold or transferring.
good,"A typical day at Blue Cross Blue Shield, was production inspired, which was a Medicaid/Medicare PPO, environment, where processing claims was involved with quality and production/numbers, the hardest part was transitioning out of the claims world, the enjoyable part was repetition can produce excellence , which leads to perks. I didn't have much supervision, which was an enjoyable part of the job, being I was an individually rated  on performance and production was an enjoyable part."
good,"I enjoyed working in Children Services division. This place had great benefits, wonderful place to work!"
good,"I have enjoyed my time with Anthem they are a company striving to get better and changing with the changes in healthcare. Unfortunately My contract has ended and now, I'm searching for new employment."
good,fun workplace. diverse work environment . I enjoy the people i work with which makes a stressful day easy to deal with . I learned to deal with each call as if it was my own family member seeking my assistance. I love working with people and solving their healthcare issues.
good,Working at ABC was a very life changing and somewhat good experience. The first two years working there were very fun and I felt like I was a part of a team. After my second year I saw that things were changing differently. I would start noticing that a lot of people would just start to let go due to lay offs. I only worked for three and a half years and I too was a victim of their lay offs.
good,"Throughout the day I would take anywhere from 50-90 calls a day.  That would depend on the amount of calls coming in with questions to reference dental health care or health care reform.  People would call with several different reasons; order ID cards, look at claims, go over payments, review explanations of benefits and also request information on the providers that were in a particular area.  I learned that customer service is really the front line to any company and that being on that front line can make any company successful.  The management at Wellpoint was exemplary.  They cared for the employees and made Wellpoint a leading company to work for as far as people with families and women in the workforce.  The hardest part of the job was the amount of information on health care reform.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the satisfaction of being able to help people make informed decisions on health care necessary to benefit a family or a single member."
good,"Typical day at work includes taking inbound calls from providers and offshore vendors, to provide information about medical benefits, provider contracts, and claims help. During taking calls I work on multiple screens and in multiple systems to assist with whatever questions are being asked and document the inquiry into a call log. We do have certain goals that we have to meet not only individually but as a company.  "
good,The 5 years at Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield I learned various medical operating systems with the changes in Medicare Advantage plans.  The knowledge of processing the difference in PPO & HMO plans.
good,"This is such a great place to work, unfortunately there is no hire-on oppurtunity starting from a temporary position. A typical day consist of assisting seniors and disabled members with benefits,claims, premiums, prescription cost and educating members about their plans. I enjoy helping the seniors every day because many of them don't understand the language of insurance and because Medicare changes so frequently couldn't always adapt, its nice to be able to help. My management team is always so helpful whenever necessary and provided so much support for issues that would come up. The hardest part of the job is the fact that Medicare is always changing but there was a lot of refresher training and updates that management would keep employees informed about. My co-workers are mostly great to work with they understand how the position can be so they are always willing to help and share information."
good,Most enjoyable part of the day was helping others succeed and advance in their careers. Helping resolve questions/concerns from internal and external customers.
good,As a contractor outsource from Vendor - just heard about the fun but not directly experienced it
good,There was always a project or faciltating that was in sessions to keep me productive in my job. I took responsibility to ensure that my performance was above and beyond which in turn increased my job security.
good,A typical day for me consists of reviewing medical vision and dental claims for payment or denial. The most challenging part of my job would be the extensive research however it's also the most enjoyable part of my day because I love a challenge. My co-workers are fun and very knowledgable so that helps because we sort of teach each other and the management team is very enthusiastic helpful and encouraging.
good,"Anthem Blue Cross was a great place to work. Nice tall executive building with professionals working on all twelve floors. Fun filled and fast paced and the position allowed me to grow as a customer service agent because somewhere along the day, a new challenge always presented itself. I wanted to work for Anthem for many years and it took a while to accomplish finally getting in. But once I did, I was exposed to great and ever lasting friendships with coworkers, personal satisfaction, and great job rewards. A typical day would be taking 50-65 incoming calls per day helping our members handle their issues. I was used to an exciting, fast paced day. Every inbound call was important and called for my undivided attention as an agent. I had many demands to meet and deadlines to beat. The hardest part of the job was knowing that not every caller was satisfied with the answer they received."
good,"The company offers good job security above all else. I have only been with the company for a short time, that isn't anything negative i can say. They offered me the opportunity to provide for my family when I needed to."
good,a great place to work but you have to be disciplined. the supervisors are great to work with as well as other reps
good,Overall Wellpoint was a good fit for me because the opportunities were there to advance in my career path.
good,Enjoyed Anthem so much would appreciate the opportunity to return for employment.
good,I like the fact that i can work at my own pace.  I also enjoy meeting new people.
good,Work here many years!  Sorry that the dept I worked in move to the Atlanta office.
good,My first position was a mail clerk. BCBS was a family based company then. Upper management praised there employees. We had appreciation days. My second position was Letter Clerk. My first production job. I had to prepare 1200 letters a work day. I used Word mail merge function for 8 hours. My third position was a DMS Clerk. I sent incoming documents to their appropriate departments. This position had a high accuracy rate. One error and you didn't meet your goal. I was afraid with every document. Employees had health trouble because of stress. I remember the paramedics visited our job on the regular. 
good,"I worked for Wellpoint for 24 years until I was laid off in September 2012.   I worked from home for the last 9 years which is an incentive  that Wellpoint offers.   Working from home requires time management, organization and discipline.  I also have processed Medicare Supplement claims and worked with accums.     "
good,A regular day at work for me was logging into my headset and multiple programs on my computer to assist with the best customer service possible. I interacted with providers as well as members on a daily basis. I was also backup for two other departments within the company. I helped my manager set up workstation and computer for the newer trainees. The most enjoyable part of my job was providing excellent customer service to avoid multiple callbacks and satisfying the providers and members.
good,Productive and challenging days. Learned how to be a team player. Best co-workers to be with five days a week. Best part of the job is knowing what you are doing is going to make a customer very happy.
good,Productive and challenging days. Learned to be a team player and to take responsibility. Best co-workers to work with five days a week. Enjoyed making the customers happy.

good,Fast paced office environment with good chance of advancement. Friendly hard working people.
good,"i answered phones, assisted clients with information and billing issues. i also did data entry, filing and set appointments for clients."
good,great work/life balance atomsphere in the company. Worked as off premise remote worker for several years.
good,I enjoyed my 8:30-5 schedule Monday-Friday as it is the ideal time frame to work. I enjoyed interacting with all of my co-workers and thoroughly enjoyed speaking with as many people as I was able on a day to day basis over the phone
good,"In my opinion management should be trained in the area of soft skills, emotional intelligence, communication, etc.  The professionalism among all associates need to come up."
good,Great co-workers and interesting work but very rigid and political company. Great work life balance! Very large company and will get lost in the mix.  Difficult to navigate the waters and build relationships with teams outside of your group.
good,A day at Anthem is very fast-paces and full of challenges. Digital is going a mile-a-minute and in many different directions.  Strong leadership at the top.  Conflicting messages from middle-management.
good,"My job changes consistently.  I am responsible for ensuring that the Medicare Part D formulary is compliant with CMS.  We have a team of pharmacists and we have been together for several years.  Although our job description may change, we seem to work together well."
good,You can not beat the wages at Anthem hands down. In the Rancho Cordova call center it is Union which allows for job stability! The company/employee engagement leaves much to be desired. Advancement is limited within the union environment however there are more opportunities outside the Union. Overall I like my job I just wish there was more employee moral boosting activities and engagement.
good,Upgrading call center pcs from Windows XP to Windows 7. Decent place to work for that project which was a bit more than 1 year. The call center representatives appeared to be content enough with there jobs in a collegial and diverse environment. Management appeared too be supportive.
good,Easy access from highway and lots of parking.  You can get free coffee if you don’t want to go down to the cafe.  There is a lot of variety and the staff is friendly. From time to time there will be vendors selling items like   clothing or jewelry.
good,"A typical day at Anthem is very stressful. There is lack of ownership, accountability and sense of urgency. Departments are siloed and do not work together to resolve issues."
good,Anthem is a GREAT place to work. The job can be stressful at times. Anthem offers a Wonderful Work/Life Balance. Final thought..Anthem is Great place!
good,"There were busy times during the year, but you were compensated by having time to balance work and life when the workload decreased. I was not micro managed in my role and management was polite, supportive."
good,"Learned a lot over my 10 year career there. The culture is great. Depending on the position, there is no true typical work day. Everyday presented it own challenges."
good,"Anthem is at the intersection of all innovative parts of our healthcare system - population health, new payment models, value based care, predictive analytics - the opportunities are boundless here at a large company if you have the energy and tenacity to share your ideas and keep pushing against the status quo."
good,"Anthem is very flexible, but you need to make sure you keep work/personal life balance. Many responsibilities can eat up your time and have you checking in at all hours. "
good,"A fast paced job with the potential for growth, certain aspects may feel like they value quantity over quality, keep up with the fast pace or you'll find yourself on the chopping block."
good,Great place to start a career. The company offers flexible working conditions. There seems to be poor management and employee relationships in some divisions but great and supportive relationships in others.
good,"This was a pretty decent company to work for. No complaints other than the parking lot for the employees being too far away from the actual building. Other than that, no complaints."
good,"I think it's a great place to work. I worked with a great team of people. And I loved the job, very fast paced but enjoyable.  What I didn't like was outsourcing jobs to other countries."

good,Start my day early and usually started with e-mail issues.  Work through those and then start on with any system issues that occurred over night.  Set up conference calls about any system issues that I needed to talk to other departments about and through out the day do e-mails in between everything.  Also would work on new group implementations and attend implementation calls and discovery calls regarding benefit changes the group may be requesting.
good,"Bring your ideas and you will be rewarded. Many opportunities for advancement, great work environment with challenging projects. Great work life balance.  Potential for work at home opportunities."
good,"It was a good 16 years working at Anthem. "
good,"Salaried work at home employees are expected to  keep work load current with limit resources. Point being expect to work a lot of weekends and 8 to 10 hours a week."
good,"Position required multi-tasking, time management, customer service, ability to prioritize, excellent communication skills and the ability to work in a fast paced and high pressure environment."
good,A typical day at work is by organizing and starting  the Packages for LAB testing. Reviewing emails received by SME'S that already start Package testing. Perform troubleshooting for failed testing in order to assist the Package team in the resolution of the issue. I love to work for the SMEs and resolve the issues that arise because you learn some new everyday. The most enjoyable part of the job is when i move the Packages to Production. Also i enjoy working with the Testing team.
good,"Anthem is a good company to work for overall. There is free indoor downtown parking, security, and a cafeteria, which is way over priced. I am in member services where the people are nice but the technology is lacking. The work week is m-f for most people with 8 hour days."
good,"There is never a dull moment at Anthem and I have always enjoyed the ability to work in several different areas of the company.  I never wanted to have a monotonous job, so this has been great for me."

good,Lot of learning and advancement. Helps with learning new technologies in a supportive environment. Good workplace culture. a lot of scope for growth and advancement.
good,"Good place to work depending upon the department that you're in.  You get in a department where the boss is constantly over your shoulder, it's not fun."
good,Anthem overall is a great company to work for. Pay could be better but the benefits and discounts offered are great. Anthem has a “ We are one Anthem” slogan. Yet different departments get different treatment. There is an on sight gym with lots of fitness classes.
good,The unassigned community seating takes some getting use to. Free snacks and drinks helps allot. Departments try to work openly together for the greater goal. Communication is free flowing and resolutions are the main focus of the environment.
good,"Helping members with claims, filing grievance and appeals, issue medical ID cards, helping members understand their healthcare policy. The most enjoyable part of the job was coming to work everyday."
good,"Good compensation package, good employment advancement opportunities you just have to wait for the opening (which may take a long while sometimes).  Corporate culture is good, executive leadership team is mostly good.  All in all I would recommend working here."
good,A very clear vision of work ethics. A fun and productive place to work. Flexible schedules are available to balance work and home life. Great perk that no weekend work is required.
good,"Anthem is a great place to work.  Anthem really specialize in work team dynamics, organizational leadership, and strategic and organizational planning."
good,Anthem was a great company to work for and the people are very supportive. There is a bit of disconnect between senior leadership and middle management regarding culture and innovation.
good,Still employed with the company. Noticed a lot of favoritism with in the company. Give a lot of training so that you can perform your job properly. If you can deal with stress than this job is for youl
good,Nice productive environment with a touch of fun. Had great people to work with. Fast Paced environment. Huge projects some with Agile and some with Hybrid methodology.
good,Work day was different everyday.   Client needs are based on their needs.  Anthem is always changing workflows to streamline customer support.. Anthem National Accounts services the needs of our clients
good,Work - life balance.  Rewarding but begins to leak into your home life.  Not a typical 40 hr work week.  The demands of the job make it where you end up working after hours to meet pass the monthly audits.

Its good if you want to keep to yourself, do your job, and go home for the day. you get a lot of  calls a day some are pleasant some are not. the managers treat you pretty well but you do see some favorites as in most places. the medical benefits are some of the best that i have had in a real long time very affordable. "

Anthem provides the opportunity for education and advancement in many different career paths.  The focus on personal development has been appreciated throughout my career.
good,This company is great for a long-term career. The managers are typically former employees in the same unit.  I worked from my home which helped with time management of over 175 clients who lived in San Antonio area.  They give regular evaluations and have a graded point system which is attainable.  I would reapply if I lived in the area.
good,The job itself was pretty boring unless you love insurance which who loves insurance? But it was a great paying job especially for the work that you do. Great hours too.

good,"Anthem is highly competitive with aggressive business goals. The new CEO of Anthem, Inc. is dynamic and knowledgeable of the health care industry and trends."

good,"Anthem is a good place to work.   The company is nationwide and depending on what state you work in, remote work is a possibility.  New CEO seems like a seasoned go-getter"

good,This is a fast paced environment where you are on the phones for 95 percent of the time on an average day.  There is a 30 minute lunch break and to 15 minute breaks one in the morning and one in the afternoon.  If you prefer a job that allows to you to sit all day and answer phones this would be the perfect job for you.  You spend the entire day day quoting insurance information to the members.

The organization provided a great work environment, opportunities for advancement, good benefits, and retirement package."

good,Anthem is a good company.  The management in my department is where it is lacking.  The Director is not someone that I can be associated with any longer.
good,Overall it is a nice place to work decent facility and fairly close to places to go for lunch and/or shopping. The people are nice and the environment is pleasant.
good,This was the best job I ever had. I had a poor manager. When you have a poor leader it tends to make your job 10 times harder. I was a work at home employee. It was great but I had to travel a few times a month to our vendors office. I managed a pretty detail oriented process with little help. We had a lot of work-around processes and over time began to take a toll on me. I had no support. The rest of the job and people were amazing and great. I loved my job. The environment is very fast paced and stressful but I tend to thrive on this type of environment. I would recommend working here if you ever have the opportunity.
good,"Working for Anthem is challenging and rewarding at the same time. Depending on the area in H/R you have a variety of skill sets to learn, Payroll, LTD, Retire, HRIS and Active Benefits."
good,was a temporary associate and it was an amazing experience!! The job was slow at first but after a couple of weeks the call volume tripled. Its a great place to work if you do not mind talking and sitting for long periods of time. you should also be comfortable with computers.
good,"Great company with good benefits, flexible scheduling and work from home opportunities.Very fast paced and extremely stressful environment with little support."
good,My day started off as a typical work day.  I learned alot regarding the system that was used and the company.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know coworkers as well as manager.
good,Great company to work with as well as individuals. The compensation package is pretty good. One area I think they could benefit in is training of new employees.
good,Contacted members to ensure they understood their benefits. The atmosphere was pretty relaxed and management was not looking over your shoulder. As long as you meet daily production you had no problems.
good,I think lunches should have been free to 50% off for fulltime associates.  Lunch was EXPENSIVE!!! I really enjoyed meeting wonderful people at Anthem. Not everyone was happy but I think it to be expected in such a large company.
good,I worked at Blue Cross Blue Shield of SC. I worked 16 years for this company and enjoyed my work environment. There was opportunity to advance and expand in your career. Education assistance was offered for those who were interested. Health programs were offered to all employees. Employees were recognized with bonuses and incentives for their accomplishments (meeting department quotas/standards).
good,"The culture at Anthem is very diverse and always promotes synergy between companies and individuals, which is very intriguing and encouraging.  The work itself while a bit convoluted at times, is challenging but gives you a sense of accomplishment at the end of the day. "
good,"Loved working a this company, great training, managers pushed you to succeed. Hardest part was meeting quota when working new systems. Enjoyable part staff meetings."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of running reports for management to track inventory."
good,I am a former employee who worked in Claims Processing and was promoted to Sales Assistant.  This is a great place to work.  The only thing I didn't like was the massive lay off in 2009.
good,"The company itself is great. They have teams and the teams frequently have friendly competitions. The work itself is easy to learn. You may have a few bad calls here and there, but overall, I had no complaints. The only issue here is management. Calls are audited, which is to be expected and understandable. However, the grading scales make working there extrememly stressed and it is unfair."
good,Overall I had a great experience working there. I learned a lot about processing medical claims after not knowing anything about the industry when I was first hired. The hardest part of the job was the training. I think they could have done a better job in training me then they did. The most enjoyable part of the job was doing adjustments on claims. You really had to investigate and make sure the claim was done correctly the first time it was submitted.
good,"I am very thankful for having entry level opportunity five years ago to work here. I process claims. If you are a detail person, have good math skills, and can do well with the training and testing required at the beginning it is a great job! I would highly recommend it to anyone with ambitions for advancement to check this out. I came in as a permanent new hire, vs a temp to hire. Now they hire mostly temps in claims first. If you do well with accuracy, they do offer permanent positions at times. Many offices around the country too. I work at home now, and I Love that!!! Many excellent benefits, very good health insurance at reasonable cost, which is priced according to your pay grade or salary. I have never worked anywhere else where Paid time off accrues each Pay period either. Nice corporate discount and tuition reimbursement programs. Training is top notch, they want you to succeed!  Flexible work hours."
good,"Anthem was absolutely great at training us on how to understand the various types of insurance (PPO, EPO and HMO). We were properly trained on how to understand the needs of the members in order to find the best plan option for them. Anthem is the only company that hires licensed agents.  The training as specific guidelines on how to handle members during calls (we are in a call center environment)."
good,"It's super company to learn, They provide all type of treanings before giving any responsibility... "
good,"It is a very good account. where I have learnt lot of things."
good,"The hardest part of my job was the sloth-like crawl of the bureaucracy. Overall, a very rah-rah, self-congratulatory management style and corporate culture."
good,I loved working for Anthem.  It made me understand the importance of insurance to a family.  I loved to explain the benefits they had.  I made sure they understood what they have.  That is what gave me satisfaction.
good,Absolutely loved my position at Anthem. Management and team leads are great. Plenty of room for advancement in the company. Departments are willing to train the right person for the job.
good,"Anthem is a woman owned company so it is also very diversified, family oriented and flexible. Many learning opportunities and plenty of room to grow if you are willing to take control of your personal growth."
good,"Great training , great people, great hours.. wish the did more work at home. All in all I feel it was a great place to work. Everyone pulls together, and helps each other. It was a rewarding place to work."
good,I worked for them twice.  I think that tells a lot about the environment and the culture that they have.  It is a great place to work.
good,"Learning platform for me. It was a great opportunity to start my career as  Java Developer."
good,"Loved this place, great environment. Not enough promotion within, but it was a good place. I worked with a very good group of diverse individuals."
good,"Busy so day goes fast; nice, good and hard-working people, fair management, fair compensation and benefits."
good,"Thorough 2 week training and excellent trainer. Location was in in Bulkhead and floor plan was open, spacious and light.  Management readily able to talk with you and assist.  Bi-weekly reviews on performance and how to improve."
good,"Very busy place to work, with job security. Anthem struggles to provide home/work balance - but is aware of the struggle. Great flexibility on working at home verses the office. Great benefit package."
good,This company has a great reputation and lots of room for growth. I believe with persistence and business knowledge you can go very far in this company. It is very diverse and has great family life balance.
good,"Anthem exhibits the precise definition of diversity and inclusion within a company. I enjoy the culture that is presented at Anthem, there is a great deal to learn and always opportunities for advancement."
good,I answered calls for patients regarding their hospital bills as well as medical bills. And information regarding their benefits.
good,"The management at Anthem BCBS is very good.  They appreciate your feedback, ideas and support you.  I always got along with all  my coworkers in the 27 years I was employed.  As a corporation they are on cutting edge with implementing such things as flex time, job share, free fitness center.  The compensation is comparable as the benefits are really good."
good,"Learned a lot while working there"
good,"This is a rewarding position for someone who can multitask and work efficiently under little supervision.  Loved working here, and probably would have still been employed here if my position was not outsourced."
good,"As a full time well compensated associate, I often worked 6-7 days a week and 9-12 hours per day."
good,"Respond to Provider calls on claim issues."
good,"I have rated Anthem as a good company to work for. I have been with the company for a little over 2 years and I have had nothing but a good experience. Although Anthem has great advancement potential, I feel I need to grow more on my level of expertise within the medical field."
good,Anthem overall is a GREAT company to work for. You just have to do what you are supposed to do. there's not much more I can say.
good,"A typical day for me consist of assisting multiple members with questions and concerns in regards to their healthcare needs. I assist with members being aware of their healthcare coverage and eligibility, also establishing relationships between the members and their health provider, scheduling appointments, and just providing overall outstanding customer service. What I learned in my role is that you can daily make a difference in people's lives by being a active listener is regards to their needs and that empathy goes a long way. My management was proactive in providing set goals and monthly performance feedback. My co-workers are team players we assist each other on a daily basis to accomplish our teams metrics. The hardest part of the job is if their was a service that I could not provide to the member because they didn't qualify, and the most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I have helped a person towards better health and wellness."
good,"A cohesive and healthy culture where one can grow, get educated, and charged to be a decision maker. The best part is consulting with clients to improve there lives and families."
good,The job can be demanding but the environment is neat and clean. All departments work together to provide great support to assist patients.
good,"I miss Anthem, they have a lot of perks that other companies do not."
good,"come in take calls"
good,"Every day is monotonous working here which was actually perfectly fine for me. It is a call center environment. I take calls every day from doctors and nurses asking for authorization to get CT's. PET Scans, MRI's and MRA's approved. I have to ask lots of clinical questions to make sure that the procedure they are asking to get approved is actually needed for the patient. I have learned a lot working here."
good,This position was very fast paced.  Working with insured customers was rewarding.  Management was professional.  Co-workers were pleasant.  The hardest part of the job was adjusting to contract interpretation and paying claims.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the insured customers and hearing in their voice just how happy they were with the customer service they received.
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was working with my nurse as a team to help make a difference in the peoples lives that we served. I enjoy reaching out to people and helping them make a change for the  better for themselves.
good,"Room for advancement. Great opportunity w/ a very stable company in the Roanoke Valley of Virginia.  Good Benefits, Love that their is a gym on site."
good,"I would typically come in and log right into my computer and take the two or three minutes before I have to be auto in to heat up food or take a quick bathroom break. I would auto in and immediately take calls and assist member with payments and help members understand their plan. Once the last call that was in the queue is answered I would log out and head home. "
good,"Anthem is a great place to work, and the pay and benefits are on par with industry standards.  I would gladly work there again, if I can find a position that needs my abilities."
good,"I enjoyed working for such a great company, great atmosphere. I also enjoyed that everyone showed geniune concern for how you are feeling on a day to day basis."
good,Answered calls all day to customers calling in bout medicaid program. Types of calls pretty nonstressful since I have worked phones for other companies much more difficult. Manangment could train employees better.
good,"I am lucky enough to work from home with my current postion.  It does get boring, and I miss the personal interaction sometimes. I have learned so much about claims processing, new ways of thinking and honed my orginizational skills."
good,Great company many oppurtunites and places for advancment call center enviroment great energy and chances to learn and better yourself
good,"Anthem is a great place to work, great supportive team and manager. Life and work balance supported. Work at home after training is a plus. A typical day is triaging the members on your task list who require calls, assess needs, referrals to different resources if needed, follow members from hospital or rehab to assure smooth and safe transition to home, work with co workers or team lead on diffilt issues or concerns with members. Communicate with MDs, SWs, hospitals. Review medication and compliance with members. Assure members can manage their health and care on his or her own. "
good,"The open enrollment period that I was hired for was a great opportunity to participate in the healthcare industry.  The training was awesome.  I attained eight additional state life and health licenses and the co-workers bond together as a team willingly answering questions, sharing their knowledge and collaborating their ideas and thoughts.  It was the best work environment that I have ever experienced."
good,"I was a temporary contractor during Open Enrollment Period, but for me, it was great. It was close to home (less than 10 miles away), great people, great food in the cafeteria with chefs and a wide variety of things to eat, a gym on campus, a walking path around the building. It was a beautiful place to work."
good,"Negatives: Constant changes, no more than any other corporation though.  Management is allowed to stay on even when they are getting bad reviews for way to long.  Sometimes job and work balance is not good, but the company makes you aware of this possibility. "
good,"Meeting and greeting the company's target audience is the best. having the opportunity to see new faces each day is what motivates me. Ive learned so much since my time spent with the company, as well as having the ability to utilize specialized areas of skill sets. The management team is by far the best Ive even encountered, hands down! I work with an excellent team, the support and encouragement is always prevelant. The hardest part of the job thus far has been understanding the process of follow up with community partners. I had to learn that people will say one thing and mean another. The best part of the job has to be seeing the smiles on community members faces after attending one of the events I have assisting or coordinated."
good,"Very good management team and coworkers. From my responsibility as Director of Facilities and Security for Amerigroup Corporation, I assisted WellPoint leadership through an acquisition of Amerigroup and its Corporate Services Administration team."
good,"Good, solid company with talented people.  The advancement opportunity is vast due to the number of internal departments they house in the Denver office."
good,This company is a great place to work of you would like the opportunity for career advancement and them ability to try new things.
good,Overall I learned many things in my 8 years of being at Wellpoint and worked with alot of great people and even made a few friends that I am still good friends with till this day. I would say the most difficult part of my job was to solve each customers issue with a 6 1/2 minute phone call but we had alot of tools and resources and for the most part as long as I brought it up to my manager he'd make I wuld have time off the phones to get my follow up work done.
good,Challenging but rewarding atmosphere with helpful and friendly co-workers.  It's truly a great way to understand insurance and medical terms.  The management has many training tools to help you improve your performance.  The hardest part about the job are the changing laws.  The most enjoyable part is when you know you have a satisfied customer at the end of a call.
good,I usually have a cool day at work and learn a lot every day since I handle five different states. The management is ok and my co workers are nice and very easy to get along with. The hardest part I think would be handling the multiple states since every state has so many different rules but it works out. The enjoyable part is learning the different systems and helping the members out.
good,"Overall, it is a good company. However, I work in the call center part of it, so there's not much that I can review about the whole entire company and everything it has to offer. I can only rate the department that I work in."
good,I love working with the different associates and making sure we were following company and Medicare guidelines.  I assist the associates with processes and guidelines as well as attends meetings regarding issues and how to solve.
good,"High call volume, The co-workers are very friendly and willing to assist."
good,"Typical day involved high production of reviewing applications for possible enrollment for health insurance. Very challenging reviewing medical chart notes in determining financial risk.  "
good,"overall a great company to work for. Wish I had never gotten ill and lost my job because I loved it but my health had to come first and it ended up in having surgery and I am no longer ill,"
good,"Working at WellPoint was a great learning opportunity. WellPoint is a great company to work for and offers a fantastic benefits package available to all full time employees almost on the date of hire. The calls a extremely fast paced in most departments which is great as it makes the day go by faster, however, a person can and does get burnt out easy when there is nothing else to do. Most of the managers are fair as long as you do what is expected of you. The hardest part of the job is that if you do not have the right connections within the company or the right words to say, you will not make it out of customer service to a more professional position, regardless of your skills. You can be the best CSR in the company but if you don't say the right things, you will always be just a CSR. It takes a certain finesse to be able to advance."
good,Pretty good place to work I am a contractor there. starting early in the morning because there are a lot of east coast employees.
good,"Busy on the phones all day helping people get life substaining meds in a timely manner"
good,"If you enjoy working in a large company with many people and don't mind moving floors every other year, then you'll enjoy this environment."
good,I love and enjoy working with Wellpoint also known as anthem bluecross. The healthcare business is a growing business and i am willing  to grow and venture out more within the business. I am a friendly people person and enjoy working with others and also helping others with information that my next door neighbor may not know that can benefit us in our peformance and also in meeting department goals.
good,Work for Wellpoint 37 years. I was given a package and early retirement.
good,"On a typical day, I will come in and run the inventory reports for everything that we have for OHI and TPL departments. Send out emails to those who are required to have them. Then I will go about delegating work and seeing where I need everyone to be. I then go about answering emails and doing other duties assigned. Mid day we run inventory reports again to see if we need them to make a change in their workflow. Answer emails from associates that work for the department.  Communication is a bit factor and something that lacks here at this company in our department. The workplace for the majority is women, which often is a bit much and petty. The hardest part of my job, is learning how to deal with grown people who act like children and treating everyone the same with no bias."
good,"very hard and demanding position. worked at a call center answering incoming calls concerning BCBS insurance, billing, enrolling, prescriptions etc"
good,Great place to work. Great people. I enjoy speaking with members on a daily basis and being able to assist their questions.
good,"Working in a call center can be very challenging at times but it can also be very rewarding. No two phone calls are the same, so you never know what to expect when the phone rings. Nothing feels better than being able to help a customer with whatever problem it is that they are calling with. Also everyone must work as a team to ensure a productive and successful call center. So you make many connections with a lot of great people."
good,The company is productive in collections but not a really great place to work when it comes to pay.
good,"Started the day with log in and retrieve work from database and start the provider’s application process. The experience that I accrued throughout the years with WellPoint was very valuable to me. I had some of the best supervisors and managers; stern, but at the same time caring and looking out for their employees. Excellent co-workers we were team player. Transitions between one database to another was always the hardest part of the job, but as a team we always did it on time and effectively. The most enjoyable part of the job, I would say for me it was bonus time, but as job was when we became paperless."
good,"I was able to lead large enterprise-wide multi-functional project (business, legal, compliance, testing, IT, operations) across many business lines across the WellPoint enterprise."
good,Basically a good company to work for but they have been reducing their workforce by outsourcing and downsizing. This makes job security an issue.
good,The company afforded me to acquire strong customer service skills and in depth insurance knowledge. I was able to meet a lot of great new friends. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping others.
good,"I was a customer service representative, I assisted customers over the phone, through written correspondence and emails. The management was mostly hands off as long as you completed your assignments. I worked with so many good people that we will be friends for a long time. Hardest part of the job was leaving it do to being affected by a mass layoff at the company. The best part of the job was knowing at the end of the day I assisted people and made them happy"
good,Coded and verified claim form information. This is a great company to work for but with the economy and the threat of Universal Healthcare the job security is just not there.
good,"The company has many great benefits and usually has a long history with it's associates, but has recently started downsizing it's staff and I hope it does not effect the quality of service it can provide to it's clients."
good,"I enjoyed my time here. The only issue was the inital pay as an office Clerk, which was only $11.50 an hour, which didn't exactly come eye-to-eye with the expected day-to-day asssignments. Killer benefits and job security though."
good,This is the second company within the Blue Cross Blue Shield family I have worked for and overall it is a great place to work.
good,Very nice place to work with excellent training available. I learn a lot about working as a team member and that management work as hard as the core staff. The hardest part of the job is that you can''t help every one.
good,Good place to work; flexible for working at home occasionally.
good,Worked closely with a couple doctors and a bunch of clinical nurses and they were the greatest group of women I ever worked with
good,Anthem prescription was a fun place to work. The team is a very friendly group which lends to a happy working environment. Everyone was very supportive of each other which is not always an easy thing to find in a job market that can be very competitive. Each member was encouraged to challenge themselves rather than each other.
good,The department I worked in is a call center. Day to day is answering phones and helping people with their health insurance. It is just like any other customer service job in that you will have good and bad days.
good,I enjoyed supporting my team of Project Managers and supporting the leadership at Anthem.  A lot of changes in healthcare and Anthem is doing their best to be competitive.
good,Your salary moves up quickly when you first start then dwindles to very low increases once you have met the medium pay for job.  They dont care about the employees like they use to
good,"Good pay, good benefits, and easy work. Schedules are okay.. management was fine. Overall, not a bad place to work. Can be overwhelming at times with a high call volume."
good,"Best place I have worked in 19yrs as a Nurse. Management very supportive,  lots of teamwork.   Four stars because I think health insurance for employees and their families could be better."
good,"Worked there for 10 years for fed employee program. Managers were friendly and supportive. Good team players. Decent pay but not great."
good,"I liked my boss, my co workers. They had a great trainer & great back up when you needed another pair of eyes. If only I could take the job w me, I would've when I moved!"
good,Interesting place to work with a wide variety of projects that are designed to improve the experience of members.  Ability to work remote is a nice perk.
good,Manage $502M program budget. Monitor venod work orders and SOWs. Compiled data reports to manage budget. Quaterly/Annual forecasting. Financial analysis.
good,This was one of my beat opportunity working for Anthem. I was able to understand the insurance world on a different level.  First manager position was offered to me at Anthem
good,"From day 1 I was provided with excellent leadership, tools and resources to make a very positive impact in the healthy outcomes of our Membership and Medical Programs alike."
good,"Work culture was good along with a great work life balance."
good,work is great and the company is changing to maeet the new chanllenges of today.  the new technology mixed with old makes this an ideal work place for any one
good,Anthem was a great workplace.I had the opportunity to learn alot in my 6 years there. I never really had a problem with the company. If i were able to go back I would.
good,Great benefits good place to work. Some areas pay not as competitive as with other companies for the amount of work. Could have a better work life balance.
good,"Anthem was an great place to work.  I worked there for 18 years and had many advancement opportunities, given the size and growth of the company.  Decent work life balance, with remote working options available and welcomed."
good,Great atmosphere training and team leads were great. Training was about 6 weeks and a ramp up period to ensure you will meet your metrics. Sadly left for very unexpected personal reasons.
good,Great company to work for. I have been with the company going on 4 years this November. Great company to work for and promotion from within once you have been on the job atleast 1 year.
good,"Great place to work, many opportunities to advance, career development tools, associate resource groups, regular management meetings, follows mission of the company"
good,"Good work culture and work  environment. "
good,"the atmosphere is dreary and people are not friendly.  i feel this is because not many people at anthem enjoy their job.  If you work hard, i mean really hard you do get raises if your manager favors you."
good,"I enjoyed working for Anthem.  This was a contract position so, it did not last long.  Everyone there was always willing to help and guide you if you required any assistance.  I was able to work from home Monday - Friday.  And, if you needed to the make up any days they allowed you to do so on the weekend.  I only had to go to the office for training.  After, that I strictly worked from home with the option of coming into the office to work if I wanted to."
good,Working on production support tickets and enhancements to the claims system. I enjoyed my job and the people I worked with. My manager trusted that I could complete my tasks on time and without incident.
good,"Pros"
good,This is a great place to work. It's an all inclusive company with great medical benefits. The staff are friendly and competent. I love the flexible hours and competitive salary.
good,"Good team ethic. Privacy important. A typical day can be stressful, micromanagement can be an issue. I have learned a great deal about case management. The most enjoyable part of the job are the members, the benefits, the salary, working with a great team of nurses."
good,"positive work environment, good benefits and ability to work independently and remotely when necessary.    experience and knowledge gained by working with various teams throughout the organization."
good,Great place to learn and grow. I wish I had gotten a job here full time but only worked as an Intern for 6 months. Learned a lot and was exposed to many departments and my manager made sure I was allowed to sit with other departments if the area interested me.
good,I worked under a fair yet demanding management structure who encouraged forward thinking and pushed for overall quality to make sure our customers came first.
good,"Anthem is a leader in the healthcare provider industry and as a result, it is a dynamic place to work. Anthem is involved in the community, in a major way, which is very admirable to me, and they encourage diversity and inclusion, within and without the organization!"
good,Good company to work for. Working environment is great and so are the employees. Pay is decent but could be better with cost of living raising in most Colorado areas.
good,My co-workers and I are part of a highly cohesive team. An organization that places people first. I am treated well. The managers are highly skilled. I highly recommend working at Anthem.
good,"Anthem blows its workers to work from home. This provides good work, life balance. In addition, Anthem provides a gym which helps provides it employees an opportunity to work out stress in between meetings."
good,I have been provided with a wealth of opportunities to learn and advance within the organization. I have taken on a variety of roles and have been well compensated for my initiative.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Anthem. However, it put me into a mental funk. I was diagnosed with depression and was always nervous for each call. You're dealing with peoples lives and when you have to hear what you hear about someone's medical issues it's tough! I tried to stonewall it, but it got through. If you work as a customer care representative, you must be able to take your heart out of it. Anyways, the pay was fair and good for the field. The benefits were there and they had good people in the company. The team I was apart of was what kept me going sometimes."
good,It is a very relaxed work environment in which you sit behind a computer for 8 hours a day. I learned as long as you meet business needs for the company and abide by the policies and guidelines you wont be micro-managed. The hardest part of the job is making sure you don't make any errors on claims while meeting production goals. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to work from home if you qualify.
good,"While working for Anthem, I was promoted within the company 3 times in seven years.  I'm grateful for all that I have learned with this company.  The values and culture is the best I've worked for."
good,"Great place to work, people were knowledgeable. Going through an Agile Transformation Journey, learned a lot about Agile methodology. Leadership was very technical and knowledgeable, training programs were sufficient for full time staff members. ."
good,I love this company its great..Has awesome benefits people you work with are nice and helpful great chances to grow within company and flexible schedules
good,"Working at Anthem was good, however for being one of the largest insurance companies in the country the benefits were not that great. The management was inconsistent across different departments so people did not have to follow the same policies as others did."
good,Call center for inbound calls. It is stressful at times when it is busy. Flexibility with the hours for appointments or family emergencies. They offer great benefits including a 401k.
good,In this case the management was new and I was new. The company downsize the company. The company should have kept all the employee. I had been with the company 15 years and had a lot of knowledge.
good,My pay is not very good but I like the work that I do and the people I work with.  I have learned several computer programs that are specific to Anthem.
good,"Pay is great for someone just starting out. A lot of room to move in between departments. If I would have started there wouldn't leave. The accruing  of time sucks, but manageable. Goals are attainable. Can get really busy if you don't get placed with the right accounts. Stock options are nice as well."
good,Being I had never sold health insurance this was a great opportunity to learn and grow as an insurance agent.  Great training to set you up to be successful.
good,"Enjoy working at Anthem. Supportive environment. Many perks. Can be challenging, but there are many opportunities to get involved in projects. The company offers a fair benefit package. ."
good,"Anthem was very welcoming and supportive from day one. I was on contract and worked from home, but still felt part of the team. I enjoyed many opportunities to learn new skills as well as improve upon my existing skills."
good,Adjusted claims and bills for member with Eli Lilly account; verified benefits and quoted rates for new or current plans. Customer service for retirees.
good,"Somewhat busy, depending on the time of day. "
good,"working at home options is a plus, hardest part of the job is working 12 hours every  weekend becomes hard to balance work & family responsibilities.but you continue to learn."
good,Significant job growth potential if seeking a career in health insurance. The company is eager to promote within and encourages this regularly. Job advancement is high.
good,"The ability to work independently with minimum interference from management, in order to get the job done.  Becoming familiar with other department and understanding  their role in what it takes to make the company a reckoning force in the business world."
good,"Worked at AmeriGroup for 10 years, where I obtained my Health Services experience.The company offered room for advancement, great people to work with."

You can also get some help in tuition assistance, continuing education hours, and volunteering PTO. The work environment is forever evolving so it can be hard to keep up with changes but the benefits outweigh any areas needing improvement. "

good,Anthem has a fast paced and innovative atmosphere. Allows professional development and room for growth. A diverse community with opportunity available to all.

good,all of the leadership was helpful and wanted you to go forward within the organization.  Leaders were very motivating and encouraging.  Would allow you to work on special projects to better your knowledge skills.
good,"In summary, this is the best job I have ever had. I enjoy the call center environment because it allows me to always keep my mind busy. The calls are always coming in steadily. The only negative things that I can think of is that since most days are really busy we usually just get 30 minutes of lunch time instead of an hour. On the bright side of that it means that we get a little overtime. Another thing is the lack of career advancement. I have been applying internally for a while and usually they find another candidate or I'll get no response at all. Other than that i can't complain since this current job offers great benefits and of course since it's a desk job it offers working in an air conditioned environment. My coworkers, team leads, and managers are usually available when I am doubtful or need a question answered. They are all great."

good,"This job can be stressful at times, but very gratifying when you can assist people during stressful times of their lives. You will speak with people from all walks of life.

I was actually learning the job along side my soon to be supervisor.  This gave me a work perspective that I had never seen before.  I actually got to participate in making our workplace culture be a friendly, family-like atmosphere. Coming to work was enjoyable & doing the job was technically the hardest part.

Everyone in our department had a bond and worked great together, we had a wonderful time in our weekly meetings and team building outings.

Since the insurance industry is so highly regulated, the business is always changing. Not only does the industry have to change to meet new mandates, but the leadership changes frequently as well.

good,"I sit at my desk all day. First thing I check my work load and decide which members have to be called immediately and who can wait for a telephone call.  I accept members in the states that I have acquired, and speak to them about the program that their company has opted to cover.  I talk to them about ways to improve their health, and inform of the resources and professionals they have available and offer consultations that pertain to their needs.  I learned speaking with members on the phone regarding their health. Management is very regimented and follows the rules in some aspects and no rules in other  aspects.  The hardest part of the job is sitting behind the desk all day and not being able to move around. The most enjoyable part of the job is laughing with the members."

I have trained new groups in Atlanta and the Phillippines as well as a new trainer hired in St. Louis to train HPRS.  I have been instrumental in revising materials, updating the training program and right now we are in the process of ""flipping"" the cirriculum for the HPR training.  Anthem was voted the #34 in the top 150 training organizations in Training Magazine last year partially for our work of flipped classrooms.

good,"It a great place to get experience and learn.  I learned a lot about life and work balance, easy to do business, learned a lot about branding and project coordination.  I like be busy and applying my skills. I would say the only thing I had a difficult time was the lack of flexibility.  I am accustomed to companies want you to be flexible; however, my department was not as flexible as what I'm use too, but I understand why."
good,"I would have stayed in this position, but I was in a severe MVA, and I was unable to continue working full time. I am on Medical Disability, and I am allowed to work part time, and not lose my Medical Insurance Disability provides."
good,"It was a great work environment with wonderful Management.They treat all the employees as valuable members of the team"
good,Good company to work for. The work loads can be extremely varying in customer service and go from mind numbingly boring to extreme amounts of work in the blink of an eye depending on what the issue is. Very high turnover but if you can hang it is not that bad. I would recommend the job to anyone outgoing but it will wear you down after a while.
good,"I enjoy working for Anthem because they are passionate about our customers and the services we provide."
good,"My original position was as a claims processor. Then it evolved to a multifunctional position as customer service representative, claims processor, and correspondence work. A typical day would be answering an inbound call from a customer wanting to know medical benefits. Or a call could come in asking why a claim was paid a certain way and you explain the benefit. Also a customer could call to ask why a claim was not paid, if the claim was denied in error, then you would adjust the claim for payment. Correspondence work came in daily as well. You would have assigned time to get off of the phone to research and reply to the correspondences that would come from doctors, hospitals or customers."
good,"Overall Anthem is excellent to work for, the training is detailed and they do everything they can to make sure you succeed inside the company."
good,Development and support of enrollment systems.  Worked with business area and other IT teams during implementation.  Enjoyed working with the team and management.
good,"Although it's been a while since I've worked there (approx 15 yrs), I hear from current friends that still work there that this is still a good place to work.  The growth of the company seems to have opened more opportunities for new technologies and new internal job opportunities.  When I worked there, it was a great place to work and upper management tried its best (and succeeded) to help you feel valued.  They made work/life balance a priority, and it was a 'healthy' corporate culture.  The only downside, for me, was that it was difficult to get a raise, even when the U.S. economy was in a good place, and I was performing at a level above my peers.  They had an annual incentive program where everyone got bonuses, which offset the lower pay package a bit, but raises were few and far between."
good,Comfortable place to work with management allowing you to work as independently as you want but always available to assist and support you. Flexibility to work extra hours when time off was needed. Job could be repetitive at times and closeness of the desks could sometimes be an issue  Teamwork definitely a plus with coworkers willing to help if someone's work was behind.
good,Good training and management.. They set the bar high and allow you to grow with experience. Can at times be extremely stressful.
good,"I would resolve issues with member's insurance policy, payments and claims. I learned how health insurance works and the policies that we have to follow as a company to ensure privacy. The hardest part of the job is resolving the high complex situations and not spend to much time fixing the issue. The most enjoyable part of the job is the tools and resources that were provided to make it less stressful resolving the issues"
good,"I currently work at home so I love it.  They have a good work life balance.  The most enjoyable part of my job is when I can make a member happy because their appeal is approved and interacting with the physicians which I did at Kaiser also.  The hardest part of the job is how the work load has really increased since Health Care Reform and they are not hiring anyone else, so we have double the work now than any other year."
good,This job was very learning full.. i got to work with older people and help to enroll them into a medicare supplement plan and explain to them the type of polices that they are getting
good,"In my time at Anthem, I have enjoyed working with the team I joined. My manager clearly lays out her expectations for what I need to do. If someone's particular workload gets to heavy, my manager is adept at moving things to different capable members of the team. Work life balance is pretty good. Compensation was very fair."
good,Good overall experience of the healthcare industry. Management is very good and work life balance is great. Compensation is as per industry but you have to maneuver yourself to advance your career.

Loved my great co-workers, even the practical jokers.  No matter what their rank they were all great to work with.  I was a second shift pharmacist who locked up at nice and it was so nice to hear the silence after a busy day."
good,"As a telecommuter, the company has provided a wonderful work/life balance. My direct supervisors for the past few years have been very understanding and professional and really strive to keep their teams operating smoothly. Compared to other companies, their benefits are competitive, although medical could use improvement, like many places I'm sure. Their salaries are much better than market average. This is the only company I have worked for where there is very little turnover, no revolving door issues for the most part, but very high level of internal career growth and development. I work a flexible schedule M-F, with opportunities for OT, and unlike what other work at home professionals experience, I do not get micromanaged with my time and tasks. If you have good time management and meet your numbers, they will reward you. If you fall behind a bit, you get opportunities to improve yourself and they support you."

good,Responsible for assisting customers with their Medicaid issues and concerns.
good,Manage and handle provider refunds and reconcile them.  The team was very effective on delegating responsibilities and easy to work with.  Accuracy was more emphasized than speed and my manager promoted patience and effective communication skills when explaining problematic issues to the provider community.  The most rewarding part of the job was being able to be trusted with the more challenging outstanding refunds and completing them.  The hardest part of the job was being laid off when the position was off shored..
good,"Wellpoint is a large company with many departments.  Interdepartmental relationships can be strained at times, but the people and ""gogetit-ness"" of the employees is excellent."
good,Myself I like to stay busy so with this company it was never an uninteresting  moment there. Have a chance to advance within the company by taking up classes that may benefit myself within the company. Co-workers were just like family work together.

good,Great benefits and amenities. Performance bonuses. Remote work opportunities make for great family-life balance. Free onsite covered garage & walk-way to office; free gym.
good,it is a considerate co-worker but can also work well independently. it does not seek out additional professional growth and should consider this for the next review
good,Sometimes the training isn't the best. They do a lot of self teach plans but if you can do that and just jump into things you will get it. They do a good job of having chats available in case you get stuck. I like it but it can be stressful!

good,I really love the career ladder and various job options within the company. They have pretty outstanding benefits such as work from home and helping you pay for college.

With the raising cost of health care service and medication, when a member call the service center they sometimes can be very frustrated. but if you know your job and the company products you can minimizes you and member level of frustration."
good,"First I would like to start off saying that the managment is great. I have nothing but the best to say about my managers they always help when I have questions that need answering. Also my fellow coworkers are the best that I have ever worked with and we help each other all the time. This is the best company that I have ever had the pleasure of working with. The only reason that I would consider leaving is for the lack of advancement. The position that I want to apply internally for, provider relations, is rarely available."

The  calls could be stressful and the hours could get a little long, but the pay and benefits make up for it."
good,"a typical work day was steady, the hardest part of the job was having to sit thru members calling in yelling, screaming and cursing at you about nothing you did. The enjoyable part of the job was having your own desk and space and the great break rooms and rooms where you sit to yourself"
good,"being a call center place, you could get 10 calls in 20 minutes, or 10 calls in 8 hours. "
good,Training and on the job skills could have been improved based on the job requirements. It was a good place to work for however having gone through 3 different managers during a short period of time made it difficult to become familiar with each manager's wants and needs.

Don't let repetition stop you.... Its a very nice company with lovely and interesting people. Managers are very professional and are always willing to help.
good,"Great company values with opportunities to grow!"

good,I enjoyed working for WellPoint Inc for the majority of my employment. I had wonderful people to learn from and the education compensation was very helpful. The work enviornment could at times get hostile which made for stressful days.

Management was supportive and helpful and provided the right amount of guidance for each associate. Great team environment where everyone was willing to help each other out. Hardest part of my job was not being able to see all the people I worked with even at annual sales conferences which helped with having a stronger, better working relationship. Best part of my job was the work/life balance, not having to ""clock in and out"" as long as I'm always available and doing the best I can.

good,Underwriting is crucial in the insurance process!! Anthem makes it quite enjoyable!
good,Productive and a fun workplace and people it was a easy going place to work
good,Favoritism is shown and only management is heard.  Employees aren't heard fairly. I was sent home because a manager did not personally like me. I can't speak for all Anthem locations but beware of the Atlanta location in Buckhead. I was sent home wrongfully and nobody came to my aid. I will NEVER work for such a company unless they revamp the whole management team in Atlanta.

good,"Great company to work for. The benefits are very good. Company offers a lot of employee incentives. Great friendly atmosphere. Management does not adhere to verbal agreements.

The members are usually ill with a chronic disease and looking for a healthier way or living.  I am the first responder to get them into a program that will help them live knowing about health and wellness and having a balance in getting well.
good,This was an ok company to work for except for the fact that the managers would act like high school aged children and talk about there employees to where you could hear it and also they played favoratism a lot.
good,"Training was hit and miss, if proper training in documentation is addressed. Proper documentation for Nursing @ bedside is different  from documentation for Insurance documentation. You don't get to see the member so you have to ask every question layer by layer and know how to assess different condition  in a blind eye. Some nurses are able to do this others are not , it all depends on your training. Nursing assessments @ very indepth and you will need to talk and type, move quickly thru computer screens and have extreme workloads."
good,"The company cares more about stats than the employees. The company ""Anthem"" does not show value to their front line employees. Managers show favoritism"

good,The most difficult thing about the individual sales department is all of the uncertainty there is because of the ACA law. It is hard to work under very uncertain conditions.
good,"Good place to work. Great benefits. I learned about the ACA, and how to read, and adjust medical claims. The job was very demanding. I learned how to control the call, but keep a polite manner. I am trained on the rules, and regulations of the ACA, pharmacy, membership, and claims processing. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the members."
good,The most enjoyable part is seeing when a child has learned something I taught them. also enjoyed being able to see my daughter when I felt because I worked in the facility .

good,The people there are awesome. Training is very detailed and informative. Great schedule. Unable to tell you about benefits I was a temp when employed.
good,I do not want to write a review but the website will not let me continue without some kind of sunbmission. I think it is bad business for this website to force job seekers to sumit an opinion in order to use the job board.
good,Good job to work at. Great benefits. Great people. Room for advancement. Remote opportunities. Great leadership and open door policy. Diverse work place

good,This was a work at home position and my director was very accommodating to adjust our hours as needed. Always learning and improving our job skills and had easy access to other co workers and management. Hardest part of the job was working difficult cases in a timely manner. Most enjoyable part was the great co workers!
good,"Case review of the appealed. Review against Medical policy/guidelines and Milliman guidelines. Worked CR, NY. and ACA cases. Very stressful due to working a huge variety of cases, you need to complete 4 cases/day and stretch to 6 case a day. Some cases take longer than others due to the length of the records that were sent in as well as the complexity of the case."
good,I felt my employment at Anthem was a positive experience.  The reason I left Anthem was to broaden my experience with Medicaid/Medicare.  I enjoyed flex days and the opportunity to work from home was the reason I took the job.
good,"You handle many different things during a regular workday. I like the idea of having to ""stay on my toes"" because you never know what each phone call could entail. Which is why you have to utilize everything that you have been given in order to be successful in this position."
good,"I think overall Anthem is a great place to work.  As with any corporation the respective management is what makes a job and also is the major determinant in your career growth within that area.  Anthem has one of the best training programs that I have seen.  In addition to tuition reimbursement, they give monetary awards when one receives certifications.  They also give access to a multiplicity of online courses which can help you grow in almost every area that you desisre."
good,"I work from home doing audit on telecom bills.  Through the years working in this department, I learned more about telecom.  Management needs a lot to be desired.  Working from home is a plus, no stress in commuting.  The hardest part of the job was to catch billing errors/fraud.  The most enjoyable part of the job is to be able to work from home."
good,"The job is great, but the workload is very high. They want you to do the work of 4 people. The benefits are great and the outlook going forward is great, but they need to hire more people."
good,"good friend, work from home, good pay, college repay, provided equipment and paper work, poor management, great human resources, good dental, vision, and medical"
good,"Good place to work - allows certain areas to work at home; good people to work with, great benefits.  401K, PTO, discounts, all great - excellent management."

good,Great company. Fun environment. Great benefits package. Flexibility is good. Management was nice. Coworkers were easy going and nice to be around. Excellent
good,Anthem is an awesome place to work and build a career. While I have been with Anthem for the last 6 years I have learned a lot. The hardest part of this job is accountability. Everyone is not accountable for their own. The most enjoyable part is I enjoy what I do and they have room to grow with the company.
good,"Most difficult company to transition to; medical benefits.  Great management, very professional, department worked as a whole and very helpful towards new employees learning the business."
good,just like any company it has its pros and cons. One of the main cons that i would say would be that it is hard to advance and it is also hard to transfer to a different department.
good,"I loved the environment, the management staff was great. I liked the culture of the work place. I was able to learn how an insurance call center works."
good,"Good company, we both changed over the years and this was a good time for both of us to have departure from each other. "
good,"There was always a full day of work.  All the resources needed to do the job were readily available.  The employees stuck to themselves, didn't develop any relationships.  Didn't like my manager."
good,"over all , I enjoyed working with anthem . however I had difficulty applying to other departments within the company and I was ready for something new."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is getting into the field visiting providers and listening to how we as a health plan can assist them in servicing our members better.  Assisting the provider offices in closing the gaps in patient health care is very important."
good,"I was very happy working here working with a lot of techs to solve different issues with the phones, tablets, computers, etc."
good,"•	Creation of Oracle database and PeopleSoft Applications on Unix"
good,A typical day at Anthem Blue Cross would consist of sitting in a call center receiving inbound calls from customers that questioned their bill. What I learned was to be patient and put myself in their shoes and to give accurate billing information to the patient. The management team was effective in handling in irate patient. My co-workers assisted each other if there was a need. The hardest part of the job was to listen to sad stories why a patient could not pay their bill. The most enjoyable part of the job was to provide them with resources where they could receive help.
good,"Overall it has been a good experience, I enjoy helping people. I enjoy going over and beyond to ensure each member understands their benefits"
good,Was able to assist the sales teams and management in setting up presentations and events.  Enjoyed working with the sales team.  The hardest part of the job was when we had a presentation to make and there were last minute changes.   We needed to insure that the changes were accurate.
good,"company and culture were great. Left only because of family or else i would still be there. They have immense talent, great capabilities and are growing in size all the time."
good,"Great place to work, would love a full time position there."
good,"Overall a great place to work. Good benefits, opportunities to advance within the company. Environment for customer care reps could be a bit less stressful, with more in depth training given before being moved to the floor to take calls. There is a lot to learn in this position and most don't feel fully prepared before the transition. In all, the pay is decent and there are opportunities if you do your best in your position."
good,A typical day would be examining claims before entering data.  I learned medical terminology and ICD-9/CPT coding.  My co-workers were friendly and worked as a team.  Our department had production goals and required to meet quality control.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting our goals and quality control.  The hardest part of the job was not having proper height desks.
good,WellPoint is a secure well established company. They are diversified and offer a good benefit package
good,This job had great compensation and very comfortable to be at.
good,Fun place to work and many opportunities for growth. I also enjoyed working for a diverse workplace.
good,"My typical day at Anthem involved processing claims involving some research and getting necessary information needed to process the claims.  Management was great, they believed in treating their employees well to make for a happy work environment.  My co-workers were also great to work with and we all worked together as a team.  The hardest part of the job was running out of work.  The most enjoyable part of the job was that in the beginning we kept very busy.  Also great environment to work in with a relaxed atmosphere."
good,"Overall I Loved working for WellPoint-BCBS-WI truly a great company to work for, if there were no layoffs I definitely would have still been an employee with this company."
good,"I enjoyed Anthem BC/BS very much. If it was not for Medicare cut backs at the government level, I would have made the company a potential place to give my work years to. Enjoyments were based a lot on my position that challenged me and the values of the company in general."
good,"I started the day at 7:00 AM and worked till 5:30 PM. I worked four ten hour days. I worked from a folder of work that was given to me daily proofreading provider applications, then entering their information into the database, to be printed in the directory, and viewed online by members. I used the following tools to perform my job daily. They include phone, fax, computer copier, and printer. After my work was completed it was audited then given back to me to file."
good,Management was mindful of your private life and very team oriented.
good,During the typical day the IT team attends 3-4 meetings on a daily basis focused on the delivery of innovative projects which support the business model. The management team is focused on operational excellence and is committed to the goals of the company.
good,I give all my previous employer an overall rating all of 5 as they were all top Companies.
good,"-In 12 years, went through several phases. Initially keyed incoming claims, advanced to paying claims, both jobs simultaneous with telephone customer service. Most recent experience involved sending State mandated acknowledgement letters within 3 days of receipt of hospital and doctor appeals regarding payments to avoid $25,000 fine per appeal. Sorted and re-directed other receipts to appropriate work sections."
good,"Productive, fast paced environment. Team work with dept co-workers. Prices when we manage to finish all work assigned."
good,"I loved that their was lots of room for growth and that you could learn so much in a very short amount of time. However, federal standards makes for a long drawn out process. I learned a lot about health insurance and the hardest part was being layed off."
good,Enjoyed working in a customer service setting. It was fun interacting with different people everyday
good,This company has the best benefits packages that the marketplace can offer. They have high retention in most departments. I have re-applied for rehire multiple times. Great nursing opportunities.
good,"Worked with systems such as, People Soft, Microsoft Works, Microsoft Outlook, Lotus Notes, commercial e-mail as well as internal company systems. Responsibilities included benefits, account management, claim adjustments, complaints, supervisor calls, internal auditing and other requests. Special projects including assisting with training classes, senior level assignments, and mentoring associates."
good,Anthem is a great place to work. I have learn a lot work at Anthem. I went in to anthem not knowing anything in the insurance or medical side of it. With great management and training I have learn so much.

As a Contractor I have been able to work remotely and many of my project team members are all around the country. 21st Century work environment."
good,Had easy access to manager and team members. Given the ability to learn the health insurance industry. Loved the flexibility to work from home when needed.
good,"Amerigroup merged with Anthem Inc. Honestly, this was not the best move the company could have made. Good people, great environment however management is not held accountable for anything and can pretty much do whatever they want without knowing policy and procedure and how it will affect employees."
good,"I enjoy working at anthem . For me it’s the perfect position being able to work from home. Being from home opens up so many more personal pros such as staying home to watch children saving money on daycare, getting house chores done or getting a head start on cooking. Of course you have to finish your work but with the workload not being strenuous on most days this allows a lot of free time! Perfect job for people in school or needing a full time and part time job. The only cons is the insurance plans aren’t that good"
good,It was one manager that was clearly unaware of work and professional ethics.  Everyone else was family friendly at the workplace.  I enjoyed my work environment.
good,"Fast paste environment,  very friendly and family like. Computer programing was taught very well, more then one screen, but it wasn't bad at all. Training was good!"
good,"l love the pay at Anthem, business is changing and my children are growing up and I would like to find something closer to home and start new chapters. I have been commuting for 19 Years over 150 miles round trip per day."
good,"I loved that what I did on a daily bases made a difference not only with my teammates but our members. I learned BCBSA regulations and how to manage a team of 26, how train new hires, how to adjust all kinds of medical claims from office visits to transplant claims. I also learned ICD-9 and 10 and HCPCs codes. I learned to read and understand medical records for pertinent information related to specific claims, escalations, or appeals."
good,Great job and company to introduce me to the pursuit and abstraction of HEDIS. The training was short but I learned rapidly and excelled from a pursuit employee to an Abstractor. Employed 3 temp seasons and was able to train others
good,"A typical day consists of taking inbound calls , and using several systems at once. Should possess the ability to multi task . Fast paced environment and team oriented . Good people ."

good,All the free coffee you could want the calls coming in were fast you have to know the information and where to find it or the callers get upset. I tried hard but failed
good,Anthem is a very good company and getting better each day.  The Blue Cross Blue Shield brand is very strong in all of our markets.  We grow more focused on execution every day.
good,"Productive and fun working there.  I strived to learn at least one thing per day, and that opportunity was usually presented to me every day.  There were some major issues that I came across, but the ATS team did very well in helping others when there were in a position where they thought that they would fail."
good,"I absolutely love working for Anthem. Training was amazing from start to finish, you actually have support from other team members along with management being just an instant message away. This has been the best company I have worked for. I will dearly miss working for Anthem."

good,Anthem is a great company to work for. I plan to retire from this company. There are great advancement opportunities at Anthem Inc. and the benefits are affordable.
good,This job is perfect for someone who is ok with staying in the same position and are not interested in advancement. There are minimal opportunities to advance or create a career in the Colorado Springs location. They are professionally biased when doing internal interviews. If you don't mind the extent of your career talking on the phone then this is perfect because you can work at home or in the office.
good,I would recommend working here. It's a friendly environment with decent pay.  The overall workload is manageable. I would recommend managing your time well.
good,"I have nothing but good things to say about Anthem.  I actually worked for WellPoint between 1999- 2003 and left to complete three internships for my Master's Thesis.  After graduating in 2004, I worked on two contract projects as a project administrator and then as a Jr. Project Manager for a systems platform change in IT. I returned to Anthem (WellPoint) in 2006 until I left for personal family reasons in 2013. Great company, loved my director, team members and others in the company I was honored to work with and my position.  With benefits my package was valued at $109K annually."

good,Great place to work and has a generous benefits package. Pay and compensations is above par. I've been with Anthem for 17 years and it is the best place I've worked.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my position was the understanding of how important the functions of my job were, when it relates to the member experience.  My job required efficiency and succinctness. Since the health of people was what was at stake, it was important to carry out the duties of my position with the upmost care and concern with each decision I made."

good,busy a lot of information to learn but you get used to 70-120 calls a day great place to work good managers can get stressful every now and then good benefits
good,"Anthem is a nice place to begin a career. I started off in the customer service field. I felt i was successful there and felt i was able to move up BUT, it felt as if some of the managers would not like to see certain people succeed. It seemed as if if you weren't sucking up to them they wanted you fired or would do things that made you want to quit.It is a nice company and some nice people are there, but it can be very unorganized from time to time."
good,"Assisted professional staff  in departmental projects and assignments.  Handled all administrative duties for the staff, maintained the copier machine, ordered coffee, tea, and office supplies."
good,"You were kept very busy but still had time to talk with a co-worker, Very good company to work for. I would recommend this company to anyone who asked."
good,"Typically only 8 hours shifts, overtime optional. I learned a lot of patience working with customers at some of their roughest times. The management at Anthem was helpful and resourceful. The hardest part of the job was being on the phone for all of the 9 hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting all kinds of new people."
good,"Stressed callers needing coverage and stressed people need cobra coverage."
good,"I've been working here for several years, it's a good place to work. Management isgood and a typical day was spent completing reports and other assigned tasks."
good,"Anthem is a nationally recognized organization and they offer the stability of a well established company. Compensation is more in the health benefits and the resources for education and certifications. The managers are approachable and do their best to make themselves available to help. The leadership seems to take a genuine interest in finding ways to reward employees with food, snacks, company sponsored outings and opportunity to participate in community service. "

good,Fun place to work.  Management was great and helpful. A  typical day at work was helping seniors enroll in healthcare plans during opening enrollment. I learned different application to complete enrollment process.  The workplace culture was very professional and clean.  The hardest part of the job was the actual enrollment process could take 45 minutes which is across the board.  The most enjoyable part about the job is helping seniors get enrollment in their healthcare.
good,"Everything about Anthem is amazing. The people, culture, work environment, absolutely everything. However, unfortunately I am contracted to Anthem from HCL for IT Services and HCL is one of the absolute worst companies I have ever worked for."
good,"Great company to work for.  It had a very effective executive team who had a clear strategic vision.  They not only had great strategies, but they also executed on them."
good,It was a wonderful short experience. I learned a lot about insurance and customer needs with insurance. The position was always kept challenging and interesting.
good,I was only there on various temporary assignments . There are always openings posted on the company website and you are encouraged to apply. The company is pleasant enough to work for and the experience into healthcare is invaluable.
good,Overall I enjoy working for Anthem I would like to move on to pursue more avenues in my career. I like the idea of helping people try to get health insurance and doing a great job at it.
good,working was great and to help members....in good issues and bad. down fall is the timing of breaks and also receiving help from management.
good,"Anthem Blue Cross is dedicated to creating a comfortable work environment. The persuasion is to always be competitive in the market while taking the lead in sales of vision, life, HMO's, PPO's and Tier Marketing for placement in Healthcare Market."
good,A typical work day I would go in run the alert report. I would drop the report into excel and assign the alerts out to myself and other team members. After I assigned the alerts out we would go in health star and check and see if the caregiver clocked in for their shift. If not I would call the member to see if services was performed and reach out to the agency if need be. I learned how to work a new system that was put in place 10/1/2015 which is called health star. My manager would push us to learn all that we could. My co-workers was fun. However there will always be someone on the job that just don't get alone with you for some reason. The hardest part of my job was when I could not get alt staffing to go out and services the member. Knowing that the member really needed help and it was nothing I could do but pass it on to another team. The most enjoyable part of my job was going home and knowing that I made a difference in someone's life.
good,Huge corporation. Stressful environment. Great immediate Manages. Laid off 3 different times. Excellent pay & other fringe benefits. Great co-workers. All were Nurses including managers. Job was all telephonic. I was only SW on the Senior Care team for the entire Northeast section of US dealing with Medicare. At time of lay off starting to deal with Medicaid.

good,"Enjoyable place to work with a very supportive case/management. The company has many pros to it but the one thing that may be a con would be project target live dates would change in a very short notice. Overall, the company is very laid back and supportive to everyone."

good,A typical day would involve handling an extremely high call volume assisting clients with options involving medicare while following all policy and procedure. I also reviewed medical insurance claims and provided accurate information to members as well as medical providers. My experience on this job as well previous jobs has taught me a great deal of patience. The constant system issue/failure made it very difficult to assist clients accurately while be forced to call borrowers

I learned so very much about Insurance, our Health Care system and how most everyone in our country has been effected. My co-workers were so eager to help when I asked them for advise and we had a mutual goal of signing on new clients and making them comfortable with their Insurance choices. The hardest part of the job was learning how to understand some of our computer issues and to feel comfortable applying what I learned without asking for help. It was very rewarding. The most enjoyable part of the job was hearing the happiness in the voices of people that were helped on the other end of the line."
good,"Excellent Place to Work"
good,"A typical day would consist of answering inbound telephone call from brokers, needing assistance with passwords.  Completing emails to update information for brokers.  I learned new technical items, and new in house programs.  Management is wonderful! and my co-workers have become like family to me.  Hardest part would be not to make any mistakes at all.  Speaking with the brokers and interacting with my co-workers."
good,Anthem is a great place to work it was always something new to learn or implement. It was a great atmosphere because co-workers  show a team effort to get projects completed.The hardest part of the job was not knowing if your job would be outsourced or not.

good,co workers were easy to get along with on an every day face paced large incoming call volume providing members and providers with information regarding claims and benefits.
good,"However, I went back temp for a while in 2011, its not the same  place it once was. they have pretty much gotten rid of the vets to save $ and bring in the young ones (like they did me) and pay them way less.  But a company has to do what a company has to do "

My manager is very fair and flexible, especially when an emergency happens and I may need to leave work or come in late on a certain day."
good,"I enjoyed working for bcbssc. Recently they lost a contract therefore I was unable to get my contract extended. I worked in Provider Enrollment so I was lucky enough to have had a great supervisor who was truely the perfect boss. No pressure from him at all. In our Monday and Wednesday meetings he would advise us of our goals, and thats what we all did. He had a way of making us all work together as a team to get the job done but somehow maintaining a calm and cool personality. I liked that. I respect that. A person who is under stress at times but keeps his emotions under control to still guide his team is respectable. My daily duties were to verify tthrough multiple date systems to insure that a provider is able to be set fup legally in Railroad Medicare. I did have to pay close attention to detail but overall an easy job. Honestly the only thing that was hard about this job was today being my last day."
good,"A great place to work with many career opportunities. Going through alot of layoffs and management turn overs in the last year, however the 401K package and medical benefits make up for the risk."

good,Anthem was a great company to work for and after several years of working there I moved out of state for have a better quality of life. I do see many of the positions at Anthem being automated and out sourced to other countries.
good,Anthem Managers strive to ensure you have a work life balance. Starting PTO is 19 days/year. Difficult to move up the ladder. Anthem provides many benefits that are average to above-average.
good,Anthem is a very place to work and values their employees. I worked for the Government Business Division and it has been the best job.  The only reason I am leaving is because my husband and I are relocating to Texas.
good,"I loved the benefits that came with working for Anthem. I just didn’t like some of the policies, but that’s Corporate America ya know. I would go back."
good,The company has a very strong company culture and vision. I worked in field sales department. I enjoyed with management and team members. It is a great place to work.
good,"Liked my job as Care Manager, worked remotely.  My manager & TL were great. Good team support & collaboration.  Benefits were good especially stock options. I recommend company highly."
good,"Anthem is by far one of the best paid employers in this area. Not the best but definitely top three for an entry-level position. There is a lot to question and read over before accepting a position with this company, some of the rules are set to make employees fail. It is a fairly high volume call center with many different positions available. Managers do there best with what little they have to engage their associates and try to keep them happy, especially with how hard they work. The culture is centered a lot around employee engagement and making the employees feel like they are appreciated, but a lot of that is result of direct managers who understand how frustrating it can be to manage your workload with everything else you're being asked to do."
good,"Anthem offers great opportunities for nurses. It is a big company with diverse nursing areas and a great place to work. Offers work life balance , will definitely recommend"
good,"Loved the job but it was hard to advance and move up in the company. Also I am not a huge desk person so I did not enjoy that very much and I love working with a team face to face, not working in a cubicle by yourself with very little actual team or people interacion"
good,"Great environment.  Friendly people, professional yet relaxed. The managers are all helpful and has the attitude of motivating their team to advance in the company or strive to be a better agent."
good,"Good company, flexible hours, managers are not micro managing, great benefits like medical, dental, vision, life, disability, 401k, stock options, discounts"
good,Anthem is a wonderful place to work. They allow you to work from home and advance in the company as well. The Managers and co-workers communicate well
good,Anthem's culture is competitive and fast-paced.  Changing initiatives requires responsiveness.  Job security is not the best as yearly work-force reductions are common.
good,benefits/coworkers/managers make this place fun! and has decent hours to choose from and great benefits. I would recommend working here because they are very flexible to work with you for daily issues that may arise
good,This a great place to work. I was only with the company for a week and was unfortunately laid off. Apparently lay offs are common. Company provided a decent severance package.
good,"The training was approximately six weeks long. It was paid training. A weekly assessment was given which required no less than an 80% to pass and remain in training. HIPAA and it's requirements are one of the most important components in training. The trainers were respectful, knowledgeable and very efficient."
good,"a learning environment and workers are readily responsive to challenges."
good,"OPW with strong management support"
good,"I had a great career at Anthem. I worked there for 15 years, and was promoted 9 times.  It's a great place for a go getter! Great opportunities to grow, good pay, recognition and lots of collaboration of all employees.  Always looking for ways to do better by our customers and employees. The only con would be working many hours/work/life balance but they rewarded so greatly, it didn't matter."
good,"A typical day is processing claims for me at Anthem which can be somewhat hard as I am more of a customer service person who likes talking , explaining and educating."
good,"My experience at Anthem has been a good one, I recently received my Masters and would like to work different hours.  I inquired with my past manager and there were no openings available on days, I have also reached out to another department and have not heard back at this time.

good,"It is a great place to work. they are downsizing and cutting back on employees. it's a fun place to work. its centrally located in the valley. the pay is decent,"
good,"I absolutely loved working for Anthem. I had a fantastic manager, great coworkers, and great benefits. Although I wish the pay was higher for the amount of work performed, the benefits were hard to beat. I received great insurance and even discounts on my phone bill. Every 2 weeks I would receive almost 6 hours of PTO and it is available to use at anytime, and it keeps building up which is nice. So if I wanted to take vacation, I would just need to let my PTO build up for a little and use it at my discretion. There is free parking on site which is a huge bonus as downtown parking can be expensive and a nightmare. There is a cafeteria located in the building with lots of options and had good tasting food. There was a gym on site which was free for employees and was very nicely equipped. They had fun activities and company sponsored events. They had other fun benefits to the building such as a ping pong table, Foosball, air hockey, health stations, filtered water stations. The building is also conveniently located within walking distance to a lot of eating options."
good,My manager elda was amazing and she was hard but I felt it was more genuine which is hard to come across. I just wish I could work more in the morning
good,"Fast paced, needs training, people are often very busy.  Workplace was supportive but I felt cut off from the culture of mental health in a clinical way."
good,"Most days we have 20-30 calls a day. Resolving claims issues when providers do not billed correctly."
good,Anthem is a good company to work for . They is growth to advance. Benefit are competitive. Working with people and making there medical claims are being billed correctly and members are paying the correct copay.
good,Great place to work. Only thing is like I’m any other job there is the stress from being micro managed and some times it becomes difficult to deal with. Then you get your commission check and it will bring a smile to your face and make you forget.
good,"Productive results of training  and dedication  to work ethic  produces successful customer satisfaction."
good,"I had a great boss, very fair. I worked as a Temp and learned a lot, excellent work experience. I hope to get a full time job their in the near future."

good,"My typical day at work was very relaxed.  The managers were there to help, but you weren't micromanaged.  I learned the difference between disability and workers' compensation.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting positive feedback from the claimants."

good,"i would like to work in this place again because the work assigned is distributed and followed up daily in regular meetings by interaction with different teams, in this way the output  delivered has very minimal defect."
good,"Virtually unlimited opportunity.  Opportunities to relocate are common if desired.  Unpredictability of the commercial market can be a negative, but that will be true at any national payer."
good,I learned how to take care of our members from the cradle to the grave.  I started out in the mail room scanning paper claims the quickly was promoted to data entry.  I was offered a promotion that offered me to relocate to Atlanta and become an Claims Examiner I after about an year and a half was promoted to Special/Complex  Claims Examiner and began working from home for the last 7 years there. The most enjoyable part of the job was working from home and teamwork.  Time management and multi-tasking is a must for me.
good,This company is a great place to work. You can advance and grow with this company and the benefits are great. Management is great and  want you to advance.

The rest of the day would consist of checking up on other claims i had pending to make sure i was staying on top of those claims to get them adjudicated as soon as possible.  The hardest part of the job was making sure i knew where all the information was.  Making sure i knew what tools i had to help myself.  The most enjoyable part was knowing i helped the person on the other line and i was able to give them accurate information that will help them answer questions they had.
good,"I liked working for Anthem. they are a good company, the continued education was great. I enjoyed that i could always talk to a co worker or a supervisor or even a manager if i had questions.  i liked going to work. and i enjoyed the overtime."

I am happy working here; however, everyone in my department will be laid-off.  I have learned in depth E/M Coding here at CareMore.  The people I work with are very friendly and helpful.  I enjoy coming to work everyday because I love the people I work with and at the same time I find my job challenging and fulfilling.."
good,"•Supervise Sales Representatives"
good,"WellPoint is an amazing place to work. I was a contract employee for a year there, so I didn't get to partake in all of the employee benefits, but they were plentiful. It is a competitive environment and a place for elite performers to thrive."
good,"Good Pay!"

good,"Answering phones and sending out drivers. I learned so many different lessons about customer service, management, and how being fair with employees can make for a great work environment.

The most enjoyable part about this job is the things I've learned, taken, and use at other jobs"
good,"I like being busy at work."
good,"A typical day at work consists of:"
good,Flexible hours and great team of people.
good,"This was a great company to work for. They really seem to care about their employees, and employees seems to care about the company in return. I worked from home, so I didn't have a lot of experience with co-workers, but what I did experience, made me feel welcome and a part of the team. My immediate supervisors were great. They were almost always friendly and willing to help with any problem, usually business or personal. The hardest part of he job was pressure from upper management to go faster and faster, but keep your work to no less that 99.5% accuracy or face disiplinary action. The most enjoyable part of this job was to be able to work from home and be there for my fanuky when I needed to be. I would still be there today except that after I was downsized with most of my department, I was unable to find a new position with the company that allowed me to work from home. I couldn't drive form home to Indy as I used to because I live 95 miles from the office and gas prices are just too high."
good,"My last employer was a fun and productive working environment an typical day at work was reconciliation of major accounts such as Kia Motors Inc and Board of Regions. Worked will with management team and co-workers. The hardest part fo my job was leaving the workforce on a daily basis ina timely manner. I enjoyed meeting and engaging with coworkers, team members, brokers and other busness groups as i reconcilied their payments daily."
good,"I start work at 7:30 go straight to my desk and proced to meet my daily quota. I was on the morale team and we would meet 2 times out of the week for about 1 hr. to find out what activities we would do for the department. I learned if you work hard you could move up in the company. Management was flexable and fair. Working with my co-workers was great. The harderst part of my job was not being employed long enough due to outsourcing, to continue to grow within the company. The most enjoyable part of my job is doing the job I love to do in which is Data Entry."
good,arrive promptly at 8:00 am ready to take a fast-paced inbound call center environment. I've learned plenty of Anthem's policies and procedures and received valuable training with the company. Management has done a fantastic job in my development especially when it came to advancing through out the company. Hardest part of job was settling and complacent.

You have the opportunity to learn a lot and use the skills you are learning for bigger and better positions. I look forward to the opportunities I will receive while working at Anthem."
good,"I’ve worked at Anthem for 8 years off and on. There is plenty room for advancement if you work hard. I love the tuition reimbursement as they cover most fees and textbooks. Management is approachable. I am of the mindset that an employer’s culture may not be for everyone. I’ve held many positions throughout my lifetime. Anthem is one of the best places to work. Only negative is the potential for layoffs. But hey, that’s a fear with any job."
good,Great opportunity to support our communities and to build a career! This position also provided an opportunity to learn more about the benefits of affordable healthcare!
good,"They go out of their way to help you succeed in your role. The management staff help to get you past any areas you need help"
good,"They definitely believe in a healthy work/life balance and are accommodating of special needs. The training program was very unorganized and incomplete. Most of what we learned was on the job and was only if you asked the questions did you receive the answers. Other than that, great place to work"

Anthem is a GREAT company to work for & I am pursuing a position with them in my new location once settled. This is a fast paced work environment & not for everyone, but I found the day passed by quicker that way."
good,Great place to work if you really put your mind to working hard and showing you are worth a promotion. Managers willing to work with you on any issues you have.

good,typical job with coffee in the morning. I learn to sale insurance to elderly people. Management are amazingly fun to talk to. It is a nice place with a nice view to walk in the park on your break time.
good,"A typical day would be monitoring 3 -4 projects at a given time.  Chairing team meetings, updating project plans, communicating to senior management, managing risks and reporting on project financials."
good,"An average day at Anthem was very micro-managed from start to finish recording every activity that I did.  I learned quite a lot of IT there.  My peers were very supportive & great to work with daily.  The hardest part of the job is that it is so scripted that as an RN you don't get to use your own knowledge from past experience but what the company insists you use.  The best part of the job that if you met the company's requirements & outcomes, you could be set up to work from home."
good,"excellent company to work for. "

good,Appreciate being able to be given the chance to come into a Customer Service role after being gone from the company for some time.   They are like family and was given opportunity to learn or add on skills into different products offered at the company.
good,"This company understands and is emphatic towards the balance between the ""job and family"". They encourage taking time off as this increases productivity."
good,"I found Anthem a great place to work for at first. The compensation was salary + compensation for sales. I was earning up to $80,000 a year. After 4 years, the company reduced our salary in half, raised our compensation for each sale, but increased the amount of sales before the new comps kicked in. Nobody in the department reached these unreasonable goals."
good,"Anthem is a wonderful company, i would go back in a heartbeat.  Unfortunately I became ill and they let me go.  I truly wish I could go back to work there."

good,"The positive experience that I had was being trained internally for Information Technology. Due to this training I was able to be promoted multiple times."
good,"Configure new machines, reconfigure older or broken machines.  Provide software, network and hardware support.  inventory and record equipment changes."
good,I was a customer service rep II and I really enjoy my job. I loved working with the people and the management was great. I loved my callers and it was a pleasure to go to work.
good,I was part of a unique team that was being tested in the market.  I think Anthem is a great company that truly believes in work life balance.

good,Sr. Tech lead for all high priority outages that take place with responsibility for reporting directly to senior leadership.
good,"The company was great, Great trainers and teacher, the training is long but it is all worth it. the managers are great but they often change them."
good,"I found HealthLink/Anthem a great working environment.  Employees are generally knowledgeable, communicate/collaborate well between one another, Being easy to do business with and caring about the impact of their contribution to members, providers, business partners and the like are paramount.  Innovation is shown throughout the employee's daily work meeting the business needs/goals of the company."
good,typical day is to log into informational systems.  taking calls from clients to explain their health insurance benefits.  took Spanish calls from clients as well. assisted with claims and verified procedure codes. verified benefits and gave benefit options.  best part of job was when something was NOT covered and after research and investigation we find code error that allowed a correction to get procedure covered.  worse part of job was having to tell parent of autistic child certain therapies were no longer covered.
good,"Job security and advancement excellent until last 2 years."
good,The training program has great teachers.  I started out in swing shift and then progressed onto the call center floor.  I disliked being timed like a lab rat for all my breaks and lunches.  But there are some people who cannot be trusted to come back on time so I understand the reason for being tracked.
good,"Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield was a very exciting place to work. The environment was very energetic, and family oriented."

We were spread out all over the country, but it didn't seem that way.  Everyone was very helpful and great to work with."
good,not a lot of people to help in our area.  lots of calls daily.  couldn't get time off for personal reasons and if people were sick or had emergencies they felt guilty taking off or calling in
good,"There is definitely enough work to fill your day. My manager was very good. Easy to work with. Co-workers are nice. I worked from home for the last 5 years so I didn't have any personal interaction with my co-workers. We communicated via email, phone and IM."
good,This is a great career opportunity for anyone to have. The trainers really take time to make sure you're well equipped to handle the basics of your position. Once you start your job you have a lot of knowledgeable people around you able to help with any questions or problems you may have. There are plenty of advancement opportunities to choose from and the managers are more than happy to assist you with an advancement you choose. Very happy I started a career with them.
good,Work was always good for us to learn to start on our own. I learned Health Care plans coverage like HMO and PPO plans as well as plans offered through Covered California. Management was really helpful in a way that they were flexible. The co-workers was by far the best experience. The hardest part of the job was trying to locate doctors for members that had Covered California plans. The most fun part was again my co-workers.
good,"Busy, productive, training atmosphere"
good,"I enjoyed working at Anthem BCBS.  Even though a lot of the underwriters worked from home, we still stayed connected thru weekly meeting, e-mails. etc.,  There was a time when the company paid for all of us to meet at our home office.

good,"A typical workday for me was to come in startup my computer system, check VM start a priority list of things I needed to accomplish before EOD, assist my peers with what they needed, review emails that direct manager sent for completion.  The hardest part was when I was not able to get another department to be on the same timeline.  The most enjoyable was the happy satisfied customer on the other line when I called them back at my committed time with a satisfactory resolution."
good,"I have worked with this company for the past 5 years. It is fast-paced. My managers and my co-workers have been great. They have been lots of fun to work with and easy to get along with. It is a job with a very high level of stress. Overtime is available on a case by case basis. "

good,They give fully comprehensive training.  We focused on helping people.  Management kept us informed and prepared for any changes.  The most enjoyable part was being available to members in 14 states from one location.  The hardest part was ending a temporary assignment without being able to transfer to another department to become permanent.
good,"Being able to support National Large Groups in resolving their day to day issues, resolving member abrasion whether for 1 member or the entire group was /is extremely rewarding."
good,Guaranteed 40 hours with sign on benefits. Management is understanding. Can make up hours If you have appointments. Pto available. Can borrow pto from coworkers.
good,However very flexible; allows remote working environments. That's the biggest benefit. Foot print of what you will do is HUGE - 78 million customers (called members).. so all systems have a ton of data.  IT organization is working very well on a successful Agile transformation from waterfall.  Even business leaders are behind the Agile mindset. Sometimes hard to understand who is in charge but stuff gets done!  Highly recommend Anthem.
good,"Great people to work for"

good,"Anthem definitely provides adequate opportunities for growth. Also, benefits are pretty good and they promote a healthy workplace culture. A typical day at work is close coordination with your on-premise team."
good,"I could not have found a better place to work. The environment is ideal, especially if you want to work from home.  They are flexible and give you what you need to make it in your career.  If working in the Norfolk, VA office, you have access to a gym with personal trainers, medical staff if you get sick, outdoor recreation area with nature trails and so much more.  "

good,"Number 1 in the Insurance  field for  the Medical, Dental, Vision and Specialty Lines of Business."
good,"Anthem is a great company to work for. Since I have been on board for 8 months, I have been offered very competitor pay, promotions, and value and actions bonuses. While I am a work from home employee. The only draw back is that it is a very large company that is making adjustments to bring people back into the office which is fine; however, that lacks an overall feeling of job security."

good,I enjoyed the majority of my time at anthem. My first manager was amazing but the manager i moved to was very cold and i actually never met her. She is the one who chose me along with about 2 others to lay off.
good,"I was with Anthem for 16  years, initially as medical management support, was able to rise to manager as well as Case Manager, gained support from all levels of management and peers, easily understood how to escalate any concerns, issues to HR and/or managers.  Workplace culture included out- reach to others that such as managers, peers (excellent ability to conference with peers), good support from all to seek exercise at times of need to boost daily morale.  Hardest part of the job was completing significant outreach to members quickly as well as providing specific information that member was wanting immediately."
good,"Good place to work, Had fun with co-workers. Interacted well with my members and clients. Was difficult to meet the pre and post pgs. Enjoyed working from home."
good,"Overall it is a very good work culture at Anthem. You will get people ready to mentor, teach and help when you are new in the organization. They appreciate the hard work you do."
good,"Nothing bad at all to say about Anthem. I mean the oay could have been a little better starting off, however your performance determines your raises so it kinda evens out if you’re a go getter. I loved my supervisors and managers and would definitely recommend Anthem to anyone! The work is not hard and if you love helping others this is a great place to work."
good,Great company to advance. The hardest part of the job is getting the desired salary. Its easier to negotiate salary if you coming from outside of the company.

good,"I worked for Anthem West Region for 15 years. I worked in 4 different positions starting as a Call Center Rep and leaving as a Process Improvement Coordinator, more than doubling my starting salary.  They have a great benefit package and allow for ample time off.  There are yearly department bonuses which are determined both by department and individual performance results. I had 7 different supervisors during my employment and 6 were absolutely wonderful at offering guidance and mentoring. The culture is very positive and upbeat. There were tasks given to me which challenged me at times, but most often times resulted in professional growth. This is a great company to work for."
good,They pay really well for the customer service jobs especially compared to other companies. The management is good. The only downfall is the commute time from Hamilton County.
good,Great opportunity  in Learning and Development department. Difficult to find leadership position even though  you attend multiple upskill sessions and other educational trainings

They really took care of their family of employees. The culture, team, management and opportunities were without question some of the best I have seen."
good,"Great place to work.  The training was very detailed and helpful.  I worked with a good management team and co-workers.  90% of job the was making outbound calls to healthcare facilities and hospitals in order to retrieve medical records.  5% of the job was researching, collecting necessary data, and uploading records. I learned to be patient, communicate effectively, and complete tasks in a timely matter.  Hardest part of the job is leaving the company and my co-workers. Everyone worked together to make our department a success.  I enjoyed my experience with the company."

Learned a great deal about Medicare part D plans and open enrollment. Management is the most professional and motivating always encouraging each employee to go to the next level.   The culture is fine if you like change and growth then it is for you.   The hardest part of the job system issues no fault of your own, however work still needed to be completed. The most I gained was the mentors at this company they taught me a great deal and their work ethics are admiring and I respect all of them."
good,"You have potential growth opportunities while working at Anthem. Great work environment with continuous improvement of overall business practice."
good,I miss working for this company because this company is awesome. Pay is great plus benefits are wonderful as well. I only had a a problem with one manager but everyone else was wonderful. Great environment

good,"Anthem is an outstanding company, positioned for growth."

good,"Working as an actuarial intern was very rewarding for me, as I was able to learn about the type of work I would be doing for my career. I was also able to network with my colleagues and learn more about the profession as a whole."
good,"This was a very busy office, but I was able to hone my Excel skills and I learned so much about health insurance and actuarial science too."
good,"A typical day at Anthem  included back to back meetings with time to send meeting minutes to the team.  At Anthem I learned formal project managment through training, the environment and experience. The culture is very diverse.  The hardest part of the job is the time sacrifices you sometimes have to make during releases, however it is expected.  The most enjoyably parts of the job are the many many wins recieved throughout the various program executions."
good,Anthem was a great place to work.  The company cares about your work/life balance and believes in keeping their word.  They really look out for you. They also believe in promoting well care.

good,"A typical day at work was getting in the office at 6:30am and making sure the test cycle was up and running, if not, fix whatever jobs are down and get the cycle finished.  Monitor the test cycle throughout the day.  Work on the different assignments you have by coding and testing the programs you made changes to.  Write up documentation such as design documents and testing hand off documents.  Work with business analysts and system testers as required.  Attend meetings as required.  Code, test and FTP to Excel Adhoc report data as requested.  24 x 7 on call support on a rotational basis."

The Management team during my tenure at Anthem was exceptional; while they expected much, they made sure to provide help and guidance along the way.  My co-workers were wonderful too, providing teaching and patience as I learned what I needed to help them.  Hardest part of the job was learning to keep up with all of the changes due to the Affordable Care Act, and the most enjoyable part of the job was being mentored by my co-workers and other individuals throughout the company."
good,"Great leadership across the board. Innovative, friendly, hard- working coworkers- the best team I've ever worked with, hands down. Management is supportive, and knows how to utilize talent, fostering a cohesive team environment, where everyone is respected. Interorganizational work groups and brainstorming teams are encouraged. When I need to ask for deliverables or information from leadership in multiple departments across the health plan, I either immediately get what I need, or am able to collaborate to produce what I need without push-back. Leadership is engaged, and committed. If you are willing to show equal engagement and commitment in your role, they will give you 130% of what you need to get the job done. Very transparent organization, as well."

good,"I worked for Anthem Blue Cross, in Woodland Hills, CA during Open Enrollment. I was offered the best training to provide excellent customer service to customers in various states. I have worked around the country for other companies providing benefit enrollment, and bar none Anthem Blue Cross offed me a full package. The Management Team, and Team Leads truly care."
good,"Anthem was a great starting point in getting into Insurance Sales.  They trained me from the ground up, paid for everything and were extremely supportive while there.  Overall a great place.  It was unfortunate that the sales team was dissolved after this last Open Enrollment."
good,"I created several different spreadsheets for the actuaries that I assisted. I would help my supervisor in interviews, plan departmental meetings, proctor tests, answer phone calls, type letters and file."
good,A typical day at work is to analyze and process medical claims for the Medicare Medicaid Dual Market to insure timely payment for providers both professional and facility.  Never ceasing to learn new things everyday surrounding Medicare and Medicaid program.  The management continues to keep the team abreast of the ever changing parameters.   My co-workers are the best and we continue to support one another daily in our quest to be the best we can.  The hardest part of the job  is keeping up withe the daily procedural changes.   The most enjoyable part of my job is the serving our customers and bringing resolution to their claims inquires.

good,I enjoyed working with BCBSGA.  It is a great company with excellent benefits.  It was unfortunate that I had to leave due to family issues.  I would love to return to the best company I have had the pleasure to work for.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of member calls both Monday and Tuesday out the week, incentives throughout the day such as Bingo, or trivia questions about the job. I have learned Customer Service soft skills and how to deal with different callers within the first 10 seconds of the call. Management pushed me everyday to become better In my work. Co workers always worked off my positive vibes and laughter. The most Enjoyable part about the job was knowing a member was helped within that one call and working with a team that was able to help out if you were unsure of the answer."
good,"A typical day at work is structured."
good,Anthem in Andover is a great place to work.  The people are friendly and the company offers very competitive rates and benefits.  The company offers job enhancements and tuition reimbursement.  I loved the work and the people I worked with.
good,"I wasn't an employee. I was an intern. The people who work in Anthem Biosciences are really very sweet. The HOD of the Dept, HR, the analysts are whom I'd like to thank. I learned a lot on patience and also coming to Bangalore was fun. I was a bit worried before coming to Anthem Biosciences because that was the 1st time I got a chance to enter a company in my life. I had imaginations that all people working there will be very serious. I was wondering what do I do/learn if nobody has time to spend a second with me. But after joining there as an intern I got to know how it all works. Obviously in the beginning nobody knew me. But later they all became good friends. I didn't feel much of an intern there. I mean, they treated me like one among them. I too forgot that I was an intern for just 45 days. "
good,"I enjoyed my time with Anthem, my dept closing down in June is the only reason I will be parting with the company. I loved my manager and all the wonderful people I worked with on a daily basis. Even though we all are at a callcenter, we all worked well together and grew a bond. We took time off accordingly and looked out for each other as a team."
good,Excellent company to work for. I learned alot from working here and have enjoued my  last 21 years with the company. I started as a provider service rep and made my way up the corprate ladder. Meet so many great people and made alot of good friends.
good,"A typical day at work was to start by gathering data from seven different data sources that include Business object reports, Database inquiries, and personnel surveys. Generated daily, weekly by-weekly, monthly, and quarterly reports with summary report outline department performance, and recommendations for improvement of KPI. Assisted management in development of policies and procedures include new training processes and materials. I worked closely with department and executive management regularly to ensure that quality reporting standards were met, and to assist with special assignment that required my expertise or analysis. management and team members were very supportive of all my efforts. They are all a great group to work with. "
good,"I would go in at my start time, open all my applications, read my emails, etc.   If i had question time, I would do that.  I would attend conference calls, meetings or personal meetings with my boss directly.  My current/last boss was a new manager, however she had worked there for years herself.  This was her first manager position & she had only been in that role for a little over a year.  I won't say that i dislike her as a person because I do not at all, however I disagree with the way she handled everyday work.  I do not think that she knew exactly what she was doing herself, therefore that made it very, very rough on her unit (my coworker OE, her reps & myself)  It was very chaotic on a daily basis.  The hardest part of this job was not knowing exactly how to do the job itself since i was NEVER trained on how to do it.  I wasn't provided with all of the tools to do the job, therefore when that happens, you do not succeed!  My co-workers were great, but again, they were all brand new to the company.  This unit, Provider Services, was a unit that only people with 5+ years of experience should have even been considered.  Teaching them to do this type of job, was the hardest.  At first i enjoyed this position, however shortly after training the class and then being thrown into the position with no direction, i didn't enjoy it"

good,"Excente company to work if you want to work healthcare.  Meet alot of providers from different doctor office and even got to speak with other people from different part of the world calling to get benefit or information about a patient.  Glad I was able to help and assist them.  Even though I was able to say goodbye to alot of them, I'm sure I didn't reached each and everyone of them."
good,"Interesting mentors. Amazing Co-Workers. Everyday is different and thats what makes it more interesting.

Sending out letters."
good,"I was part of a great team, we where the unit that handled benefits to one of the multi million dallor accounts in the National Accounts department.

I held many positions within the company; such as, Business Operations Analyst, Business Operations Analyst II, Business Consultant and Manager II of reporting/analysis/auditing. I enjoyed working with all the teams and probably the hardest part was being a virtual based company. It was hard not seeing everyone face-to-face during project work."

Everyone pitches in and helps anyone in need. The most enjoyable part of my job is my boss. She is truly the best person I have ever worked for. It is a great company to work for."
good,Management was a pleasure to work with.  They provided the necessary tools and resources to make your job a successful experience. State of the art equipment and support was provided in a hassle-free environment.
good,"Great Company, great leadership, flexible, upward mobility and career advancement, stability, solid management, benefits, collaboration of interdepartmental leaders."

good,opportunities for advancement and growth were abundant.  I was blessed to have a great management team that supported our personal and professional development.
good,Great company. Job security is a solid guarantee and the management is flexible to assist with a balance between work and personal life.  One of the things that  this company does to assist with work/life balance is to allow other co-workers to share their PTO with you for special occasions or grievous reasons.
good,I enjoyed my time with Anthem Blue Cross.  I plan on working with them again in the near future.  I would like a position that allows me to work from home.
good,"A typical day at Anthem is mostly very busy. Lots of calls from both providers and subscribers getting information about dental plans. The day usually went by fast due to the constant calls. I learned a lot about dental procedures and insurance. We had weekly team meetings to talk collectively and be up to date about what is happening. Management is as helpful as they can be and if they couldn't help, there is a designated help team that would assist. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the constant calls and finding time to resolve other issues that you are waiting for information on. The most enjoyable part is being able to be thorough and friendly to those we help and ensuring them we will be able to resolve their issues."
good,"My manager was very understanding, and had an open door policy. "
good,Typical work day is reviewing cases for precertification of procedures and inpatient hospital stay. Able to utilize and appropriate time according to case load.

good,"I have had a great experience at anthem so far (1 year). Salary, raise and bonus are all great. Working from home is flexible (I read someone said you have to have great credit-- this isnt part of them hiring you at all for most any department (maybe finance, but doubtful at best))."

good,Great work life balance. I really enjoyed working there and had a great boss. The company has a lot of good benefits for employees. I would recommend this.
good,We had a difficult 15 mos with Anthem.  Our call center was involved in a huge scope of problemsolving for insured employees and various agencies involved.  Received incoming and had to make outgoing calls.  Did not like the call center environment.  They laid off management and company lost some income.  Effected morale of employees.
good,"worked did not receive my bonus for the year  2003 only issure"

good,"Every career has its lessons, I enjoy every opportunity."
good,"I enjoy working at Anthem when I have a functioning desktop. When it doesn't work right, the IT department usually causes more problems than it fixes, and ultimatly, the IT departments inability to make my job do-able is by far the #1 factor that makes me want to leave."

good,I really enjoy working with our members. We help a lot of people to learn to make healthier choices and help them to take a proactive approach to their health.
good,I answer emails and do conference calls.  Audit groups payments if there is a discrepancy.  Check enrollment eligibility for subscribers.  I work from home so that is really convenient.

good,I have enjoyed working for Anthem for 16 years they are a good company to work for. Helping group administrators agents/brokers also helping the individual member making sure all is in place to aid in their health care. Can be stressful due to volume I enjoy being able to help people with their needs.
good,The work could be stressful at time but its a great place to work they really care for all the employees. All the staff got along very well can didn't mind helping each other out if  need be. Its a cool place overall really going to miss it.
good,"I enjoy working at Teletech, the company has a very family oriented environment. Teletech is a place where you can learn the product, but enjoy what your doing."

good,Very busy and productive place to work. Great employees rewards. Everyone was very helpful and ready to lend a helping hand. Management was very supportive to employees. There was much room for advancement with this organization.
good,"This is the ideal position for an introvert such as myself. I dont have to talk to anyone, the job is very independent (no micromanaging), work from home opportunities and Ive been blessed with a manager who recognizes potential in people and supports us in growth goals. There is an onsite cafeteria, full benefits, company matching 401K, amazing shift flexibility.  The pay is ok.....average. It could be better but with all of the opportunities available there is no reason you can't make your salary what you want it to be."

good,"Worked at Anthem, initially BCBS of Virginia, when I began working for them, with later iterations of Trigon & WellPoint.  I have always enjoyed facilities related work, and Anthem was no exception.  The work varies from day to day and year to year with the variety of projects changing constantly.  As with many businesses which began to concentrate on their core business and competencies, the corporate real estate department was outsourced - in our case, to Cushman & Wakefield.  My 16 years at Anthem were full and opportunity and change, as the company converted from a mutual insurance company within the Commonwealth of Virginia, to a multi-state, stock held company, with two mergers, which meant priorities changed along with scope of work and territory.  The work could be exasperating at times when retrenchment strategies came into play, but overall it was exciting to be able to work and enjoy all the change.  Senior facilities management staff were very supportive and let the FM's run their individual properties without micro-managing.  We had our directions and policies, and we were free to develop our own strategies to maintain our individual properties."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is my coworkers because we all get along and like to have peace. The hardest part of the job is making sure all the member needs are met and in a reasonable time.

good,"Culture of continuous improvement helps to keep associates on track, Anthem does a great job focusing associates on a single message."
good,Working at this company has been a pleasant growing experience. I have learned a lot of things since being employed by this company. I intend on taking the knowledge and experience to another organization and continue to grow.
good,"Despite being a fortune 50 company,Wellpoint is a great place to work.  It values its employees and their lives outside of work.  Executive Leadership is great some of the midlevel managers not so much."
good,I have been with Well Point almost 7 years. I still love my job and believe in and stand behind Wellpoint's core values.

good,Wellpoint was a great place to work.  A typical day was answering customer calls and follow up for customers.  I learned a lot about health insurance and medical billing and coding.  Management was fair and the coworkers were a team.  The hardest part of the job was telling a customer that there was nothing that could be done to pay a claim and the most enjoyable was the ability to get an issue solved for a customer.

good,Good experience with the company. Knowledge about regulations and requirements with multiple markets and state agencies. I would recommend this job to prospective job seekers.
good,"My days are work are easy very low stress. Management is always around to help and pushing you to move further in the company and with your career. The diversity at Anthem is refreshing down to the cafeteria they cater to every one and their diverse needs even the committees they offer so many. Hardest part of my job would be dealing with irate customers because I wish I could do more,with Anthem as long as you follow the chain of command correctly the job will get done. I enjoy my job because my personal is allowed to be a priority. I'm moving within the company and its just a refreshing company to work for."

Not all managers are the same but they are very open to communication and trying to understand each individual employees. The worst part of the job is the surveys done by customers often are a reflection of the experience they have had with the policies and practices of the company and not the rep they spoke to.

My manager is very helpful with any questions I ask and any needs or requests I have.  Anthem has been one my best employers I have ever had.

It would be nice to be to move around more but I have to meet production so I do not get up and mostly just on breaks and lunch.
good,"good place to work "
good,"I worked a lot of hours at Anthem, but the learning experience was worthwhile.  Assisting beneficiaries with enrollment, portability issues, pharmacy problems, etc. were only a small part of my day to day work activities.  I encountered problems along the way, but always managed to assist my customers to the best of my ability and made sure they were pleased with their overall customer service experience before disconnecting from a call.  I believe the hardest part of the job was dealing with the retired military members and their family, as ""space availability"" for them became a serious issue."

good,"Responsibilities:"
good,"I've only been here for a little over 3 months, but I already feel like I finally found THE job. I've been a contractor most of my life, so I'm used to the feeling like I don't matter. As a contractor, when you speak up about improving something, that's grounds for a firing. Not at this place. I'm not a contractor anymore, but I've witnessed how even the contractors are treated like equals. The office welcomes everyone trying to make work more efficient and input is encouraged. Management is smart about how they have employees do work, by multi-tasking them against multiple projects at once. Other places give you one task and you're out the door when that task is completed. This isn't like that. The project managers are smart, know what they're doing, and they are people I would spend time with outside of work. Everyone works hard and managers listen to employees. I'm historically terrified of managers because I've worked with many who had ego trip issues once in a position of management. I'm blessed to have a manager that studied organizational psychology, so he truly cares about his people being successful. He gets it. They all do. The managers there are amazing and very organized. The employees smile and laugh while they're working hard for the customer. I've already learned so much from everyone."
