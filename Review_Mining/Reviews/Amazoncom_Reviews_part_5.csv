It’s a fun place to work overall. You won’t regret it. The hardest part of the job would have to be lifting heavy packages. You don’t get a lot but when you do they can be heavy. But, you can always count on someone to help you lift. A typical day at work is clock in, check the board for where you will be working, have a shift meeting, we always do joke of the day or fun fact, do our stretches and get started. Amazon offers free drinks during your shift (water or Gatorade). After everything is done, if there is time left in your shift you get the option to go home without it counting against you."

good,People and staff members are too good to help and conduct lessons on every software concepts. Motivate even a fresher to achieve his or her goals. Make sure to give quality to the customers.
good,The company is customer centric however takes care of its employees very well. Manager's are awesome. Leadership is great. Everyone was supportive. Policies are great. Helpful environment. Love Amazon.
good,You get what you expect. Eleven hours shifts whit one hour break. Four days out of seven. When overtiming you get good money. You can decide your timeshift and if you want to overtime.
good,At Amazon you have room to grow and lot to learn it never gets boring . Here is the thing once safety always comes first in the fulfillment building and your opinion matters your management is always there to answer any question you may have and many veterans are always there to help is you feel your doing something incorrect
good,Their website is very clear and to the point. Shopping is beyond easy for everyone. Very supportive atmosphere from my superiors and peers at work. I would definitely work there again

good,"The firm taught me to see my professional and personal life with a more well rounded and mature perspective. Challenging and insightful, you get what you put in."
good,"helped customer with anything that they need. I make sure to be ready and out the door so I can get to work at least 30 minutes before ‘start time.’ That way if there are delays such as traffic I’m still on time for any meetings or important tasks. I check voice mail and the calendar, then plan my sit down work time around other things like meetings. Sometimes it’s hard to balance between being friendly and keeping on task, but people understand that I don’t like to chit chat during the day – I like to work."

good,Was an easy and fun work environment. Everyone was nice and professional. Management made sure you knew how to do the job and helped when needed. Great place to work.
good,I Would love to work there again this was a great job with great staff and great benefits and great opportunities.

good,the shifts were short and although it was very fast paced I was a quick learner and the job went smoothly. management was layed back and most days were the same.
good,I learned how to work in fast paced environments and staying safe at the same time.  I became more of a team player and set goals to reach at work.  I was always on time and if not I had paid time to take care of the time I missed.  I‘m very focused at work.

good,I love love love Amazon! But Amazon didn't pay me enough when I worked there. I need a more life changing type of salary and somewhere i can retire from.
good,Love the people the job and the company. Dont have any bad experiences except some HR dont know what there doing. Would prefer a better structure on getting the help that is needed then to tell us to call the HR customer support.

good,"Best place as a summer/part time/short term job. It's a really great place to start even as a first job.

Try to apply to the other positions, there are easily available and not too hard to advance up."

good,Amazon is an amazing company to work for. They offer a chance to move up in the company and are very understanding and they care for their employees. I would work for them again if given the opportunity.
good,"I worked from home as a virtual customer service agent, would highly recommend! I made my own schedule, they only require 24 hours notice to cancel a shift (shifts are 0.5 to 5 hours, but you can work 12 hours a day) at home, in my pajamas. Always had manager support, and resources were always handy.  They give you a lot of options to help customers, so you don't get yelled at often."
good,Good on the side job to have to make extra money. The blocks was easy to pick. You just have to watch for the money. Wish the app would tell you where you was going for the delivery
good,"My supervisor was really cool. They also offered me a manager position, but i had to turn it down because was in transition. I worked the pallet jack, Cherry picker etc."

The break area was like a carnival with games and amusements, TVs, a commissary, and free water and ice."
good,"Typical day at Amazon is getting there early to get a decent parking spot, putting your things up clocking in before traffic gets heavy and starting the day with exercise "
good,"La vita lavorativa in amazon è come stare in famiglia."
good,Working at Amazon is not an easy job. Expect to work the entire time. Management is very helpful though. They try to boost productivity by sometimes working on the floor or incorporating incentive programs to achieve goals faster.
good,Excellent place to work. One of the best companies I have ever worked for management is great here on all levels. Great home to work balance without a guilt trip

I’ve been with amazon for 2 months and I’ve moving up to clear jam personal. 4th month will be manager roll soon.
good,"I always looked forward to going to work every morning time flies, kept busy learned how to keep track of orders coming in and out.

The long shifts can take away a lot of energy and impact work rate which made the job a bit harder. Amazon does a good job in making sure each employee is safe and hydrated. The most enjoyable part of working for amazon is becoming part of a team and delivering productivity with great people. Everyone is nice and caring."

A routinely number of tasks assigned and expected per shift. Falling short results in three strikes and your out. Management flexible and helpful and always available on site. Learning patterns of time management, multi-tasking, safety and rational thinking. Taking classes within Amazon for understanding and evaluating potential hazardous areas. Taking responsibility for navigating your environment safety and avoiding accidents. Being cautious while keeping yourself and your team safe is a top priority for employees. I learned the benefit of mentally pushing myself in order to have a positive impact on society's workforce. The hardest part of the job was travelling to and from work, simply due to location and awkward bus timetables. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing all the hard work and effort I put in and then receiving my pay check, I had earned it."

good,What can I say its Amazon. The only company I have ever worked for thay cares as much for its employees as it does its customers.  The one downside is that there is not enough mid level opportunities for an entry level person to advance into.
good,"Amazon was an excellent place to work. Although it was fast paced, it made it seem as if the day flew past. My manager was very understanding yet she ensured that the job was done. She offered help and advice on how to complete tasks in a safe and timely manner.

They were all very hard workers in the warehouse where I conducted the employment sessions, and they helped me with set up even, and assisted with printing out documentation.  I had to follow the Amazon guidelines that my supervisor mentored me in, but then I was on my own.  It was a full day when I would interview, drug-test approximately 200 or more candidates. After I left the warehouse and had shipped out the drug tests via FedEx to the lab, I would go home and complete all of the data entry of the new potential candidates into their database for processing. This experience allowed me to develop my skills in Human Resources processes, and in working face to face with potential candidates in answering their questions about the opportunity. Once hired at the warehouse they would often come to thank me when I would come back for another hiring session, and that made all the work hours worthwhile."

They do stretches at the beginning and middle of every shift, I recommend you do them.  It is fast paced and energetic. There are plenty of mentors and assistants and managers, if you need help, ask.  Great benefits, paid time off, sick leave, insurance - dental, vision, health, and life. for very affordable rates. The hardest thing is adjusting to the physical demands and peak season is kinda crazy.  Depending on which job you do there you will work 60 hours a week for at least 2 and 1/2 months, from either Sept-Nov if you are a receiver/stower, Nov-Dec if you are a picker/packager, or Jan-Feb if you are in quality.  It is easy to lose weight on this job, no gym required!  During peak, you will make bank."

good,although its a lot of work its very easy so it don't seem to be as much work as it is. everyone was nice and helpful there so all around good vibes. the best part of the job was picking the items of the back of these moving robots  that would drive up to you and place the items in the assigned box for it. although it wasn't that bad the worst part stocking up the trucks and i say that because it would get hot if you didn't have fans blowing in there.

good,You are your own boss with Amazon Home Services if you own a business that meets their criteria.  It is an exciting chance to grow your business and team up with their talented Provider Support Reps who can keep you on track and well advised.  The easiest part of the job is the actual work.

good,"Personally I worked stow at a fulfillment center overnight with great coworkers. Everyone was cool, most people worked hard, and all of the managers were great. Typical day is you clock in, go to stand up (team meeting/stretching), go to your station (station number given to you as you go to stand up), stow for a few hours then break, stow again, break, another standup, and since I worked 12 hour shifts instead of 10 we had another short break then you finish the night and clock out. Very consistent, very mundane, and very easy. Highly recommend getting stow then if you want to just move around all day/get paid to workout then become a runner, become a problem solver if you don't want to do any real physical labor just staying on a computer for the shift, and waterspider if you like directly helping people or want to hangout and chat with people while you work. Problem solver is best if you care about career advancement since you can become a PA then potentially an area manager if you are a good problem solver for a while."
good,".Great place to work. "
good,"The duties of an Amazon sortiation employee consists of processing orders, packaging, and shipping orders accurately. Organizing stocks and maintaining inventory."
good,The break room was fun because if people would come for lunch some of them would tell each other stories about what's going on at their station or would tell us funny jokes
good,"Multi culture surrounding. Keeps me very busy every day. Different task are assigned everyday so your not stuck doing the same thing all week long. Management is very nice, checks in on your everyday to see how your days going. See how they can help you better your day."
good,As I worked with amazon through my school it gave lots of time to think of new ideas and share them with my group in order to have a successful pitch in order for amazon to fund our project.We had plenty of time and it was nice and easy going.
good,Good attitude and friendly environment for everyone working here at Amazon. It is a dream like work place with flexible working hours and lot of empployee benefits.

good,I loved working here wish i stayed a little closer. I learned that to keep a good paying job; you have to work a little hard than usual. Amazon will always have great job oppurtunity and a change to advance in the work place.

good,"I worked at Amazon 2 years ago for about 6 months, I was in a department where everyday was something new. It was never repetitive and you are always moving. 10 hour days so you work 4 days and off 3. The dress code is very casual, I wear workout attire and many people wear hats/beanies. I have recently gone back to Amazon due to them having a pay increase for all employees they now start at $15.00/hr. I am happy to be back and enjoy working here."
good,"Amazon offers a great work environment. The people that I work with are intelligent and thoughtful, and I always feel inspired to do my best work. Amazon's leadership principles are definitely reflected in the corporate culture and senior leadership. It can be challenging work, but I find this job to be very rewarding."
good,i worked in a amazon warehouse where there are fast pace environment and safe too. people are so helpful and inspired. I worked as a rebinner in Amazon where i need to scan my press a button and stuffs are automatically scanned and just put in a packing wall.

good,"great staff.very clean. always bring in caters for special holidays, always made sure everybody was ok.people are always friendly.if there is a problem find your problem solver and he or she will fix it."
good,"The overall work day was easy, if you are competitive and want to work hard this is the job for you. I learned how to work in a team, and keep a timely manner. The job itself sometimes proved difficult if other co workers didn't have the key skills to pack away in a specific time requirement, but as long as you concentrate on your own objectives, you will meet all your tasks."
good,I have nothing bad to say bout Amazon. Great staff. Great service. I like the fact that it is competitive and they help you get ahead. they do anything and everything possible to make you comfortable while working for them.

good,I love working there but i got another job thats why not working any more with amazon.May be in future i go back.Its very good place for working......
good,Was a little exhausting sometimes especially around the holidays but the pay was worth it and the employees I worked with were as well. Would never bad mouth this company.
good,"As an entry level job, the work was good. You get in and you can grab a cup of coffee or tea as you start your work. You are taught skills like how to handle sellers regarding any of their queries about products in Amazon."
good,Great place to learn and build your confidence with Recruiting. You also have the work life balance in full effect as well.  Always positive to hear..
good,"I always enjoyed my time at at work something new always to do."
good,I worked at a fulfillment center where we worked for 3-5 hours a shift and I loved it!! I would recomend anyone to work there and tell everyone they should try it out. The place I worked had gift card give always and food days where they gave us snakes during our breaks. We all had a 15 min break together and over time was always optional. They would ask us as a group if we wanted over time or not and went from there. You really feel like you are apart of a team and not just a body to fill in a spot. Now that I'm pregnant I cant work there anymore cuz of my fears of miscarriage but if I wasnt I would apply for it again
good,I love Amazon but I was trying to get my foot in the door what I was hired for was not what I qualify for. So I’m still reaching to move ahead in the company

good,"walking about 15 miles a day, fast pace work environment."
good,"as an Amazon sortation assosiate, I was able to move around and organize packages to be distributed to there rightful addresses. I had a lot of fun being independent in a warehouse and moving along the company."
good,"Working in Amazon was indeed the best kick start to my working career. I always thought, working is really hard, however Amazon never let me feel that, the training period was amazing, then coming live on the floor from taking calls of our UK Customers, sending them emails and making them smile at the end of the call was really very satisfying. Work environment and ethics of people are commendable. In short I loved to work over there and still want to continue."
good,"I enjoy the flexibility of working at Amazon. The pay is good and the environment is relaxed, I'm currently a seasonal employee, but I hope to be part time or full time. I hear they have great benefits so I want to take advantage of them, in order to do that I have to be part-time or full-time. Leadership is great because they're kind and respectful. They only ask that you work and be safe. They are not following you around or being bossy. They trust that you will be and adult and work."

good,I pack items in a box and ship it off that is a typical day at work. I learned that it was a great company to work for. The management was always friendly and they actually cared about you and others that worked there. The hardest part of the job was keeping a fast pace rate everyday. The most enjoyable part of the job was making lots of friends.
good,Best experience looking to come back ! The pay is great and the benefits even greater. Such a peaceful place to work and so much to learn. Also plenty of opportunities to move up!
good,Management is amazing they help with all the problem and they give advice on the work ethics and the work that needs to be done. they are easy to talk to as well

good,"Amazon è una grande realtà, il lavoro ha dei picchi alti e bassi che dipendono dai vari periodi durante l'anno. Purtroppo non tutti hanno la fortuna di lavorare per lunghi periodi."
good,Amazon is an amazing company to work for and it is the number one distribution warehouse in Canada.I worked at Amazon for almost 5 years and it was a wonderful experience.
good,"Every day 4-5 days a week I arrive, grab a scanner, and pick customer orders for 10 hours. You get two 15 minute breaks ( actually 10 with walk time) and a 30 minute unpaid lunch. It is not like what you read online about being yelled at and being a unsafe environment. Safety is their number one focus, quality and production rate come afterwards. I have also never been talked down to everyone is very friendly. The money is very good for someone who is willing to put in the effort. You make $16.15 per hour if you work nights. It’s not uncommon for my check to be $850 every week if I put in the hours. Also the rate is not that hard to meet it’s only 85 items per hour. It all balanced out and if there is plenty of work you can easily hit 120 items per hour this balances out the slow periods where there is a long walk between items. I’m a currently a seasonal employee but expect to be converted to full time soon where i will than receive great insurance in addition to various time off options. Overall if you want to work hard and receive an honest paycheck I would recommend working here."
good,"start by collecting all items for delivery. make sure everything is in order. organize everything into truck in a way that is easy to deliver. Workplace culture was very good, managers and supervisors are very hands on."

good,Amazon is a great place to meet new people and a great place to work. I only worked for a short period of time but my experience was overall great. Someday in the near future I have plans to return to Amazon.
good,"Great warehouse to work, during Christmas season, don't take this job too serious if you're working part-time it will drive you crazy, the work around this place is not so hard if you are a hard working person, There are 6 different types of department at your start day you will be assigned to work in one of them, training classes are great, everybody department have lunch together, there is a round cake table for your birthday and different activities during holidays, hours are fair you will be working 40hr/week there is optional overtime and mandatory overtime to meets customers expectations, management is competent and very professional, I personally enjoy working for Amazon."

In your huddle they give you up dates of the day before and also things you as a group need to work on. Before you leave huddle you stretch it out and get to work. When lunch comes you clock out and clock back in 30mins later. Next you will go back for a second huddle and they will give you more information and also let you know if they switched you to help fill slots to get customer items out. All and all Amazon is a great place to work at."

good,A day at work is not mad it's nice you get two 30 mint breaks one is paid one isn't.  Management is good people are good to work for the most enjoyable part of the job is working threw the day able to fell relaxed about the work area.
good,It was a job where everyone was treated equal including management. Everyone got along and talked about their lives. We all got along great and no one had any issues. We would all come clock in get a small meeting about our task for the days and went off on our own. The hardest part was remembering we were at work and not just having a fun day.
good,Very competitive place to work.  Fun place to work. Would recommend it to friend to work.  Stressful at times just be able to complete the packing demand for the customers.

good,"My typical day required me to pick order using an RF scanner. The skills that I learned were given to be throughout the training that was provided. The management was outstanding and I found that the staff was extremely helpful in listening to our concerns. The hardest part of the job was being able to stand continuously for 10 hours a day. However, breaks helped out a lot giving us time to sit down and talk to colleagues. the most enjoyable part of my job was being able to see the way that the work flow was happening around the warehouse."
good,"What I really liked about going to work at Amazon was that I would go in to work in the evenings and had the day for other stuff to do around the house. The people I worked with were all great to be around. The work was a fast paced one but I feared it. work was always satisfying, every night you were positioned in a different area so it never got old. I was saddened when I had to move away and leave my job. I did enjoy every bit of it."
good,"Love the benefits, and good pay, paid time off/vacation. Overall a positive challenge.  Love the Amazon culture and their diversity. If you like to work hard this is a great place to work."

Although it lacked in some areas like parental leave, and employee grievance handling, it is a place that catches up and even excels quickly when any optimization becomes a priority, including it's cultural and workplace environment. Great, smart people, but highly susceptible to politics...internal mobility among leaders is often destabilizing to workers."

I  helped with yard audits and worked primarily at the inbound yard jockey exit. I  learned how to create the various reports that were required for that post. I enjoyed my time there and made some really good friendships. I worked there for about a year, but then they cut out the part-time work and made their weekday workers work weekends for less. I was offered a full time position, but it didn't pay as much as my regular job, so I declined the offer. I was given a severance package, so they where very fair about that, but a couple of months later I lost my regular job. I wish I had opted to go full time, but hindsight is always 20/20.  My year long experience at Amazon was positive and I recommend the place to anyone, but it all depends on which department you end up working and the caliber of the individuals around you. The  individual circumstances which you may face can make or break any situation and it is different for everyone.  My experience at Amazon however, was very positive."

As a picker you would be scheduled a task on your scanner and you have to search each isle location to find the item placed in the bin depending on if you drive a Cherry Picker or if your walking on the floor. The hardest part of the job is during holiday season when everything picks up and the work environment stays at a high pace. The management is great they’re very cooperative with coworkers and makes sure everyone feels comfortable doing their job. I learned how to drive a cherry picker for the first time. The best part of the job is competitions drawings and social games that they come up with.

good,This is a great place to work.. The team culture is on the the things that I appreciate the most of the workplace culture. The hardest part of the job was the commute.
good,"Amazon career began in 2004 with a fall internship. Shortly after joining Amazon as a full time engineer, she heard about an intriguing new project. ""I was told that Amazon was in the process of building an e-book reader,"" she remembers. ""I love reading books and was really excited about the idea. I joined the team and was thrilled to be one of the early developers on  Kindle.”"
good,"Fun workplace, I have met a lot of people, make a lot of new friends. Hardest part of the job is that you must walk a lot.  Leaders and Managers are very friendly and helpful."
good,Working at Amazon happened to be one of the best jobs I have worked in a while. The management were friendly as well as the ambassadors. Only issue really is lack of hours and if you are not a blue badge be prepared to be let go at anytime.
good,"At Amazon, they have their peculiar way of doing things. Take career advancement as an example, I have no idea how you get promoted, even after I asked a member of the leadership team about this, I still do not understand it. It seems to me hard work is a very small, or maybe, insignificant part of being promoted at Amazon. {I may be wrong, this is just my personal opinion}"
good,"Developed an explicit understanding of the Kiva system including IT infrastructure, the custom safety and pod/shelving build and pod induction.  Was able to collaborate with other Kiva engineers daily to diagnose hardware and software concerns in order to develop future enhancement.

Required extreme creativity and innovative problem solving skills with success in high-pressure, fast paced environments."

good,"I think amazon is an awesome employer. Working for them you can be doing a number of things. The work can be tiring, fast paced, a little bit competitive but for the most part you will probably be doing pretty easy work. I've worked at a few different amazon work locations so the actual work you're doing will vary depending on work location. Most likely you'll be either packing items into the building or picking items that will be going out of the building."
good,fast paced  no benefits long hours mandatory overtime truthfully I have no major complaints other than the courier I chose was not a good company to drive for
good,"You need to be able to move and understand your assignments, you scan packages and placed them into boxes, you pull out boxes out of a converter belt and put them in the isles."

good,i enjoyed working here and thought that the benefits were great as well. there was mandatory overtime as well as some paid off days. the paid off days refresh every couple months or so.
good,amazon is the company that at the moment offers a safe dynamic job and we can adjust to the schedules due to its flexibility and I have not had the opportunity to work with the company since I work for Walmart but many of my coworkers have been hired and their experience says very good things about the benefits and how the managers and supervisors manage the area so my interest has been increased thanks to the good recommendations.

good,"It's fast paced but it's fun. You are on your feet for 9 hours per day but the 30 minute break is the only real time to rest them. As you are staying productive and meeting your numbers, the time flies and management normally offers good feedback."
good,I loved answering the phone from the confront of my own home. If I needed help the supervisor would come in on the bottom of my screen to help me. It was very fast paced but the company made sure you had the training you needed.

good,"Working at Amazon was a challenge in many ways upon starting, and I enjoyed learning and working for them. I highly recommend anyone work there.  It was confusing and Helter skelter in picking up knowledge pertaing to the job that was handed down, some employees missed the information, such as a shift time change.  The warehouse later tightened this all up and it became more organized than at the start.  I adapted to the changes quickly."
good,"was only there a few week but everything went well and my time there was productive. learnt lots of new things and had to have good time keeping and keeping up to targets."

good,"work starts late at night around 10:30 pm, meeting with all associates about safety, goals, story of accomplishments we would like to share, amount of packages estimated to be sorted for the night. hardest part would have to be making sure that the partners stay on task and stay productive and give it 110%. Some choose to come in and tend to be slow in their productivity and causes slowdowns for everyone. Those that give it their all, feel appreciated, knowing that when a supervisor or someone with a leadership role ask them to assist, they know they are the first one to be counted upon."

good,"i loved working here but when you have kids it can be frustrating and you will be tired a lot. when working here you have to make sure it works for you and your family, if you are a single mom working here will be great but you will be tired"
good,"El trabajo era un sencillo y fácil de manejar, el ambiente laboral era súper bueno conocías a muchas personas y trabajabas en diferentes áreas aprendiendo más de cada una de ellas."
good,I heard amazon was tough but I loved the job overall great learning experience. Thank you!!!!!!!!! Good job overall great opportunities to learn more.

good,All the employers at amazon was very friendly and very curtious to all the employers and I would recommend amazon to my friends that is the reason I’m applying again

I went to a private Doctor and found I had crushed three disc in my lower back. Now I am trying to survive on Social Security Disability.
good,"Amazon was great, I was a seasonal full time worker over the holidays. This job isn't for everyone, as it calls for LOTS of retaining information, switching through programs, etc. My particular job was actual customer service AND driver support. A bit much for one person because each call was different and there was no way of knowing if a driver or customer was calling... not to mention we were taking calling in the United Kingdom. Training is self led, with a calendar that you follow each day and team meetings every morning and afternoon. I worked over nights, SUPER BUSY as while the US was sleeping, the UK was not. Training does need updating but it was manageable... also training has NOTHING on actual hands on working... which I think Amazon should implement ... because once you hit production it's every man for himself... you can reach out via chat and hope for the best. The pay was great, but again it isn't for everyone."
good,The position was very busy which I loved. Overtime available but not forced. Compensation and benefits were generous. I would never have left if not for family health reasons.
good,Loved the call center very relaxed but fast paced lol all TMs were awesome wish I could have had a better work schedule though worked 11am-10pm but 4 days a week

good,"The only job I've ever had that I'd highly recommend. The management was very understanding, and very helpful. They will go extremely out of their way in order to make sure you're comfortable."
good,It was the best customer service training for a work at home job. Great staff and very friendly atmosphere. I would be still working had not my own equipment not been damaged.
good,"No complaints here! Friendly staff and management is the key to a great work culture. Amazon, in my opinion, is overflowing with friendly staff and management.  The pay is excellent! By far the highest pay in my area for an entry level position!  The work is physically demanding but most warehouse jobs are physically demanding. The benefits are amazing! I work partime and qualify for dental, vision, and tuition assistance!  If youre looking for a great place to work... look no futher!"
good,"I enjoy my job at Amazon, but I would like a part time job for my days off. I currently work Sunday - Wednesday and I'm looking for part time work on Thursday- Saturday."
good,"I was first impressed by the high requirement of Amazon in working."
good,Picking items packaging items auditing make sure they were correct. Making sure the orders went out to the correct addresses of the customer. Organizing the team.

good,"I highly recommend Amazon. They have great benefits, they really care about the future of their employees. They provide full training that prepares you for your job before they send you out on the floor and it is payed for. They also provide awesome benefits and respect your time & privacy."
good,"I loved working at amazon if I still had the opportunity I’d quit my job now and work full time overnight back at the wearhouse in Milford. Organizing boxes, labeling them, unpacking the truck, all that stuff too me is fun and I love doing it and keeps me moving and doing something."
good,"Most jobs in Amazon are fast pace and require a alot of walking. I enjoyed my job and the people I worked with, The work place enviroment was always good and they would have games and activites for the employees."

good,This job is a very fast paced work environment. Management was very hands on with showing and telling us what we were to do. The workplace environment was very open and laid back.
good,Ho lavorato presso Amazon di Burago per tre mesi e da subito ho amato questo lavoro. Reputo Amazon un'azienda serissima e rispettosa nei confronti dei lavoratori. Comprendo anche che le assunzioni sono a  tempo determinato poiché si lavora molto in alcuni periodi dell'anno e in altri serve purtroppo meno personale.
good,"5 hours a day, plus VET (Voluntary Extra Time) if claimed before it became full. Great paycheck weekly, friendly workers, and easy communicate. I learned pretty much differently for the first few weeks."

The job is fast paced, you need to be self motivated (meaning no boss is looking over your shoulder the way they would in an office), customers can be rude at times, and very busy, but they trained me well and I did advance during my time, twice. Each time I advanced I was trained. I worked from home but tools were provided for me. My managers were there for me when I needed them and our group was helpful to one another. It does take some adjustment when you first get hired if you have not been in the field before."

good,Amazon is a place where one will definitely get in shape and learn at the same time. People see it as a downfall due to the excessive walking however this is a benefit towards human health. Amazon gives 3 days off and 4 days on for work. This allows one to spend time with their family. Amazon also have shifts which consist of 5 days and sometimes 36 hours a week. They have accommodations for school and parenting situations which allow much flexibility for work and life balance. Things can get tough however this is more so due to customers ordering at a high velocity. Labor planning can fix this issue which is usually does. Great place to work at because you will learn more than what you can learning in high school. Literally.

The managers here at amazon are very understanding and always gives us feedback. The most enjoyable part at Amazon is training new hires."

good,The hardest part about working as a runner was when I couldn't find what I was looking for. I'd have a list of items that needed to be filed fast so when I couldn't find something it would remain distracting and inevitably slow me down.
good,The pay is ok if you don't live alone in a apartment. the management is great they care about their employees. The number one rule of amazon is safety above production. But they keep you in mine to hit number most of the time if you miss a few no big deal.
good,Ive worked here for 3yrs and its pretty easy I like it and would regiment to anyone the salary might no be as great but works for me you work 40 hrs a week 4 days a week which I like cus you get 3 days off more family time

good,"Amazon SNA4 was one of the easiest jobs i've had. Working at a 3rd shift from 6pm-6am the days do start to drag a week after training is completed, but if you can push through the initial cycle that is working at an Amazon warehouse, you find that the time can easily be passed with some singing or using the time for some introspection. During my time here, I had learned to operate a Cherry Picker, and an Electric Pallet Jack. Alongside learning how to stow, pick, and consolidate products. Management at Amazon is very uplifting. Before the start of shift and after lunch, the departments have a routine meeting outlining our productivity and workload called Stand-Up. The culture of working at amazon is mostly routine, cranking items in and out for a couple hours at a time, followed by breaks, lunch, etc. before you realize it, the shifts over. I've many friends and family who have worked alongside amazon and a recurring thing among their coworkers is that many tend to complain about working at Amazon, which is something I never understood as the workload isn't overbearing, the hours and wages are fair, and management is uplifting and understand. The company does all if can to accommodate its workers, but it still has one of the highest turnover rates."
good,"I need a good job. I am working hard and carefuly to it."
good,"I loved working for Amazon.  It was fun.  We also got extra prizes for showing up to work and meeting certain goals.  It was only four hour shifts which I really didn't like too well, but other then that it was a great and fun job."
good,Amazon is really a good warehouse job But Much of it is really just Alot of walking. I learned alot from others & the managers such as the job can be fun only if you make it to be. The workplace can be hot sometimes so you have to dress very cool. The hardest past is meeting rate cause it takes so much to meet rate. The most enjoyable part is the managers buying food on a good day at work.
good,Really all I did was that I stocked the products where they needed to go in the right order. So when it came time for the order to be sent out. It was able to be found in a timely fashion. If work was slow in my area then we were able to move other things. For 5 days I did work the belt line sending products down the line to be shipped off to the there destination.
good,Its okay to work there. The work was slow and repetitive. Management talks down to you if you're a seasonal worker also the regular workers will also if youre seasonal.
good,"being work there, too focused to do stuff be finish and enjoyed keep busy at overnight. And make new friends and new faces. There have First aid and give good health insurance/ colleges too"
good,like it there but waiting for bus to bring us to warehouse was long because I drive from milford  and just have to wait even if your very early like I was at least 1 hour

good,fun place to work  clean brank rooms /bathroom nice management   great security advancement  and you get to learn a lot about all the different departed
good,"Good job, friendly people, good pay and hours. Management works, easy work... Alittlt hectic during peak season but when everyone is working together i goes well"
good,amazon is a good paying job but sometimes the shifts just aren't there you use your own car for deliveries the staff is nice cutomer service can be an issue at times because its all email no phone number to call
good,amazon is a fast paced job that is well paid and well organized management is friendly fair and helpful and employees are there to help the new people not feel so lost and confused
good,I feel Amaxon is a great company. It provides good benefits and great work schedules. You get some major holidays off. There is opportunity for advancement.
good,Lots of room for growth and definitely a very fun place to work. I enjoyed showing students at CU Boulder what a cool company Amazon is. There was lots of fun giveaways.
good,fast speed environment always had to hit rate 60-100 merchandise per hour was a fun face pace employment my day always went by fast everyone was real nice like a different world in there
good,long hours but they go by fast.  on your feet all the time. good exercise and incredible team to work with.  the hiring process went smoothly and the team leaders were very encouraging.
good,"Amazon.com is a productive, and fun yet challenging workplace it can be stressful and laid back at the same time. You will physically work but you can stop for a second or so to get a drink of water or use the restroom."
good,"Amazon is a great,easy laid back job. Working at Amazon i learned to be a team player an to help co-workers and managers when they need me the most. The managers are great people an will encourage you an will give you help anytime you need help. The workplace is kinda laid back but sometimes all the boxes can make  it very tensed an fast pasted most of the time. In my opinion Amazon is not a hard job as long as you keep up the paste with your boxes an pay attention to your job then the work place is not hard at all. My favorite thing about amazon is trying to be the best competitive an being the fastest worker an the most accurate scanner in the building. Also i love the managers an how they are friendly an will coach you to be the best you can be."
good,Working environment at Amazon is quite good. All health and safety issues are taken seriously. Workplace culture is fast paced. There is quite good vending machines for food.
good,"Absolutely love working for Amazon. I intend to continue working for this company part time as the culture and the people are al amazing, the customers are also a pleasant to work for."
good,I really enjoyed working for Amazon. I didn't want to leave. I wish I could go back. The benefits alone were perfect. The hours are long but they go fast because of the quickness of the job. Amazon is definitely worth working at.
good,"first of all, every morning when we all arrive there, the team lider was expecting us with good music and he was shaking hand with all."
good,I believe that Amazon is a great place to work. The management listens and is sensitive to my concerns. The coworkers are helpful and friendly. Compensation is above the local average. The benefits are great.
good,Working at amazon is a very great experience. very easy to work and fast paced that makes time go by really fast. i would definitely recommend anyone to work there.
good,"The place was fun to work, but fast. You gotta be able to get along with all different people from all different walks of life. Keep a fast pace and be able to stand for 9 in a half hours. The people are fun and the fans at every work station keep the heat down on the floor. Fully stocked break rooms with microwaves."
good,Good for people who want to work from home. The people at Amazon seems less educated from management to associates. I wouldn't recommend this for people who want to grow in the industry.
good,"before starting the job we do exercise, stress free, working as team, it was really fun and enjoyable to me, paid lunch break, great mangers, and safe place to work at."
good,During a typical day at DSE-2/Night shift your day starts with a briefing and greeting then on to either the front or back half of the warehouse. whether you were unloading trailers in the back or sorting packages in the front everyone shared their part of the work and at the end of the day you were either picking a list to route for the flex drivers or cleaning up the back area. this job was very enjoyable with awesome benefits and time off.  the supervisors were awesome and fair to everyone. i highly recommend this job to anyone looking for a 2nd or part-time job.
good,"While employed at amazon I was able to be very productive, I was a picker and required to meet production at a certain time. My job performance met the expectations according to my shift leader."
good,Amazon is a great company they encourage all nationality

good,Great place to work if your in school or looking for extra money. Get paid every Friday. Great management. Well oiled machine. High emphasis on Team Work and safety is priority one.

I loved it but it’s hard to rely on 4 hrs a day 5 days a week.

The environment is guest oriented and if you can find the right leader and ask the right questions you can move up. however, if you are also looking for a paycheck and a job to clock in and out Amazon is still a great place to work at, just show up and do the right thing and ask questions and keep yourself informed."

What I did not find fair was the pay; I did not feel the pay justified the work performed and was responsible for.

good,"Constant revisions of processes can be annoying. The workforce is pretty rag-tag, but everyone works together as a team. There's plenty of room to abuse the system, which a lot of workers exploit, which isn't fair to hard-working and success-driven co-workers. HR lacks checks and balances. Several of the temporary HR staff were highly unqualified to be in a people-management role, exhibited favoritism and were highly combative, arrogant, punitive and ego-driven. One HR temp in particular was permitted to stay in place despite complaints against his overt attempts to destroy anyone who disagreed with him, which highlights Amazon's lumbering inability to take correct actions against bad workers."

good,"Excellent management and environment!"
good,Amazon is a fast-paced work environment which is what I like. I don't like standing around or not having something to do. Right now my dissatisfaction is with the lack of hours that I am getting there compared to what I got when I started this job two and a half years ago. My work shift is usually 4 to 5 hours and now it is down to three hours per day. I also have to commute 25 minutes there and  25 minutes back and working only 3 hour shifts is almost not worth the trip down to Kenosha. Even though I am a retired teacher I am still physically able and healthy to work a part-time job and I like the physical work that I get at Amazon.

Also the details in packaging and working with the different carriers for delivery. The RMA process. Very exciting and I have learned quite a bit from my normal duties working in large call centers.
good,"You wasn't doing the same thing everyday. You could be scanning for 10 minutes and then your being a water spider and wrapping the pallet for it to be ready to ship off, or you could be a jammer and getting large packages to get unstuck on the belts. Management is willing to work with you, lots of opportunities to receive time off and all in all, great work environment"
good,"Easy place to work, good pay. Management is easy to work with, so are the other associates. Weekly pay is always a plus and the work is worth the money."

I, as a warehouse associate, was granted paid time off hours, unpaid time off hours, vacation hours, voluntary time off hours, plenty of over time hours, as well as mandatory overtime hours. The environment  the amazon associates created was very friendly and diverse. They all worked hard to keep Amazon safe,  organized, and productive.

They also try to help you advance to supervisor positions or if you have a degree they try to help you get on a position to use it.

After that, head upstairs and begin the initial meeting, in which case we were given a number amount that the packing team had to fulfill within the shift. Ten hours later, we would call it a night. If a team is all on the same page with the same goal in mind and they put in their utmost effort, goals can be achieved. The workplace culture was inviting and the managers didn't mind getting their hands dirty, so to speak, to help the entire team to achieve the goals set. The hardest part of the job was crossing the midnight mark. The most enjoyable part was the three consecutive days off; however, I left a job that I would work 7 days a week so it seemed all too easy anyways."

good,"I was a picker for the holiday season in 2016, it was a good environment but kinda strict. Pretty boring work at the Rialto Fulfillment center, you just drive a fork lift around and fill up cages with garbage people bought. Good money, good work, a lot of hours on your feet though."
good,Amazon was a very productive workplace with great benefits and great opportunities to advance. Enjoyed the fast pasted work atmosphere and wonderful since of team efforts
good,"realmente me gustaría trabajar en Amazon porque yo seria el prototipo de hombre que necesitaría la empresa yo ,estoy capacitado y preparado para meterme en el mundo laboral"
good,"This was the best job I have ever had. As long as you worked hard to meet quotas, you had job security and opportunity to advance. Definitely a hard environment for older people to keep up with the rates the company expects, but fantastic for a first job and for those in their 20s. Team environment. They have raffles during the holidays to keep employees engaged. Monthly meetings to discuss rates and accomplishments. Working 4 days then having 3 days off gives you the ability to schedule doctor appointments and other such things so you don't need to miss work for them. Management is very encouraging and it creates a family feel among your department in the massive warehouse. The hardest part of the job was getting my legs and feet used to being on them for 10-12 hours a night, especially the nights when I walked 25 miles briskly to pick orders."
good,"I do enjoy how picking and loading and delivering is all based on your time and pace. I am a fast pace worker and would be able to do it all within a reasonable time left over. I do enjoy seeing other parts of Orange County that I haven't seen, been to or heard of and just great to know more of where I live at. Early hours aren't my favorite, only because I am not such a morning person but still worth it, and reasonable time that I am done and get to go home in the late afternoon. The only time I see coworkers are before I leave to delivery and when I get back so I am by myself most of the job delivering and same with everyone else. I do enjoy my dispatcher and manager, some days they bring in breakfast for everyone like snacks for the day or donuts in the morning, or bring in pizza lunch when we get back after delivering. I do enjoy this job and don't plan leaving it, just plan to work less hours to work at a job that I do enjoy to spend more experience on in the food industry. It wouldn't be a good while until I chose to leave Amazon"
good,"Amazon ,IS A GREAT PLACE TO WORK , good benefits , safe environment , positive environment , staff are punctual , you can advance in your carrer, awesome breakroom ."

good,"Overall working at a amazon center was and still is as fun as it was when I first started! A  typical day at work would be the employee's would gather around and begin stretching. Then go over the work like how many packages we have tonight and end it all off with a cheer and get to our stations and being scanning, wrapping an closing out the pallets and packages. It is a fast paced environment and we have to maintain a good pace to keep up. I would have to say the hardest part about the job is finding a station in amazon that you are great at. overall anyone can do anything in the building but each station has its differences pros and cons the last part is finding which suits you the most. The most enjoyable part of it all is the fact that you have many friendly people around and a ton of stations to pick from."

The most enjoyable part is getting to meet new people coming from different backgrounds."
good,"It's all how you make it! Management and co workers are great people to work with and be around. There is support and room to grow and advance! Amazon is more of a career based job and company, and they do a lot of hiring within the company and building. They are always expanding and promoting associates. Everybody is treated equally and with dignity and respect. The pay is good on a starting level, however the only way for higher pay is to advance up the ladder within. Benefits begin on your first day of hire. They give PTO, UPT, and paid vacation time. All in which, more time gets added at the end of each pay period and/ or quarterly. I highly recommend working for this company. Also, you have a decent and set working schedule."

good,I am always learning something new.  I continuously look up product MSDS to place in the correct waste stream.  The hardest part of my job is throwing away products that are not damaged because the vendor  does not want to sell it and does not want it shipped back.

They have expectations that have to be met in order to keep your job but they will give you EVERY bit of training and a reasonable amount of time time to get There. They want PEOPLE who WANT to work and CARE about the work they do. If you are a new College Graduate, THIS is the company you WANT to work for... Listen, Learn, and GROW... you will go FAR..."

I learn how to be very quick on my feet not only that t be prepared to move to one task to the next you definitely got to be multi-task. Working at amazon you would see all types of culture in the facility which is great to see to me because the work place does not discriminate also you can learn different things from them as well.....The hardest part of the job is trying to meet the quota when you know you got different tasks to complete everyday....because some days it can be the same work but then they can switch it up on you. The best part is working together and getting the job done also helping each other and teach one another that might not know the work and need help

Very laid back work environment. Upon getting hired I was able to choose from a list of available schedules, there were probably 20 different options available. You accrue paid time off, unpaid time off, & vacation time throughout the year. There is also another form of time off called VTO (voluntary time off) which is usually given on a day to day basis depending on work needs. It is time you can take off voluntarily without it effecting your other time banks. You get full benefits, health, dental, vision, life insurance. It is a great company that is growing rapidly. They always had potluck at the call center I was at so you were never hungry."

How to work under very fast pace, How to perfect pallet building. Management was great, treated everyone fairly, was nice and helpful. The workplace culture was very diverse, you'd have people with prosthetics, people who spoke different languages, people with different backgrounds.

Basically maybe 3-4 hour shifts for a few day only gave me about no more than 10 hours a week.  I left on good terms and would definitely go back there again.  It was fun and stressful at time because some of the workers didn't understand English and they kept making messes everywhere, taking up our work time to fix their errors."
good,"You went into work knowing already what you need to do and what needs to be done. You have no one breathing over your back, just management on a pier making sure no one is just standing around because Amazon Prime is full of something to do never nothing!

good,"Indeed is a seriously great place to work. Product teams are really close and tight-knit and there's very little friction across functional units. Management takes a very dedicated - yet weighted and scientific - approach to employee feedback and really listens to everyone at every level. The degree of ownership and impact you'd like within your product team is very flexible so everyone can easily find his or her comfort zone. There's an open culture that strongly discourages immature, ignorant, intolerant, hateful, or negative attitudes. The food at HQ is amazing, and the work groups and events allow you to meet a ton of people. Desk space is ample and collaborative while allowing for flexible environments (go work at a couch, a conference room, or the kitchen if you want.) Hours are flexible as long as you're around for meetings."

good,"A typical day at work is always busy, there is always something to do. I've learned how to pack customer products, package turning, assist in coaching other coworkers. The workplace culture is always demonstrating safety due to hazardous spots within a warehouse. The hardest part of the job is staying on top of package ratings. Each coworker must reach the limit of packing products per minute.   Associates have to complete 30 packages per min to stay on top of ratings.

good,There are a lot of great things about working for Amazon. The main one is that there is a lot of opportunity if you apply yourself. The culture really depends on where you are working and who you are working with and for. Much like any company. The only real issue I have with Amazon is that they low ball the heck out of you if you are moving up internally. I guess the fine print under Hire and Develop the Best says; and try not to pay them what they are worth on the outside. The stock is a nice perk but you have to hang around a while to get it.
good,"This has been one of the best experiences in my work history.  There is room for advancement, and the management and training is key to the success of the employees."
good,"Fast paced all of the managers, ambassadors are nice. Great pay and frienly workers as well. Would recommend, I left due to sickness but they were very understanding"

good,"Amazon believes in working hard, having fun and making history and it is always successful in doing so by providing the best work culture and an amazing environment to its employees to work in."
good,I am a people person and very outspoken. I was a Business Developer / Sales Associate and was a part of the Direct sales team in India. My job required me to interact with new people everyday and assist them on board their business to Amazon. This required a lot of interaction with the client and I found this as the best part of my job. Also the work culture and the ease the company provided me was an add on to my career in Amazon and made my life at work better.
good,Amazon is a great place to work because of it's positive atmosphere and encouraging management team. There is plenty of room for advancement for motivated people and they offer support for everything you may want to do. A typical work day starts out with a meeting where you may hear what's new with the company but more than likely you're going to get an update on work flow and what's expected for the day and prework exercise. hardest part of the job is putting boxes on the pallets because sometimes the boxes are too big or the pallets are stacked bad and you'll have to rearrange the pallet but that's about it. The most enjoyable part is dealing with different types of people.
good,Is there anything better that could have happened to me than joining and working for amazon !!

good,"My typical day at Amazon, friendly employees with who i was spending whole 10 hours  i worked there, manager was very  helpful, I learned some leadership and motivational skills while i have been working in Amazon. In Amazon I meet many different people from different cultures but overall the amazon culture is one culture and everyone follows that rules.

Then we would proceed to the location on our scanner and begin ""picking"" products to be shipped to consumers.  I learned that Amazon has way more things than I ever imagined in their warehouse to ship and the technology required to run a warehouse.  The hardest part of my job was when I could not find an item where it was supposed to be located.

I also enjoyed the ""exercise"" because I felt like I had a job where I got paid to work and exercise."

good,i went in at 7am and had coffee. then we had a team meeting by 7:10. we went over any issues that need to be addressed and came up with solutions while doing our morning stretches. right after we would go to the assignment board and see our job assignment. depending on your knowledge of the job functions we would be moved frequently from one job function to another. sometimes when there was an issue that was interfering with your work performance we would report the issue to the process guide and they would relay it to the area manager to get the issue resolved. the hardest part of the job was being flexible going from function to function but also the most enjoyable because some of the work can be tedious and get tiresome so going to a different job function allowed you to have a sense of new work and not get bored.

good,I learned to develop my communication skills and my leadership qualities for better management. The whole management was very supportive to each other. Every coworker loves to volunteer themselves to help their team mates and friends. Amazon's culture is one amazing experience. None of us can find such a Flexible place to work and survive. All of us were able to cope up with everyday tasks within the given time and everyone maintained their daily targets and deadlines.

The company is set up to help you grown, and become more well rounded in all areas . There is no question that management cant answer somebody knows the answer to every question.

I would say the hardest part of the job is finding time to do everything that is needed to be done. I enjoy the pressure because I see it as an experience more than a a hardship.

The compensation is much better than most companies and the benefits help take care of all my everyday health needs. I believe that job security is based on performance so everyday I work hard and put excellence at the top of my list so that I can continue to know my job is safe. My management has always been supportive in allowing me to take steps to improve my ability to move up in the company. I have worked both the night shift from 5pm-3:30am and am now on day shift from 5am-4:30pm and the job culture is surprisingly similar to one another. Most people are just there to work together and get through the day while improving themselves so they can feel successful at work as well as successful as a person taking care of their families.

Management was always nearby to help if you ever had any issues with anything. If you were lucky you could spend the whole day near by a friend, but as for everyone as a whole most everyone was pretty friendly.

The job roles provided in amazon is quite unique and gives more exposure to each aspect and have educated myself with unknown things and got a chance to explore with ideas and build the career. the management is quite supportive and provides a lot of opportunities to explore themselves and have a fruitful growth. The most enjoyable part all are treated equally and no one biased and working in amazon is a dream and is too calming and awesome place start up your career.
good,Amazon is a great place to work. The people there are wonderful to work with. There was great latitude in solving customer issues.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of counting the stock that came into the warehouse. It is needed to be counted in a timely but accurately fashion. Accuracy could not be below 99.5%. Anything below that would be considered not acceptable. The management there was always on the job making sure that employees kept up with their duties and accuracy. If ever an employee was to go below 99.5% in accuracy, the team leader or manager would work with you very well before actually giving you a write up. Because of being on one station counting product all day, associating with co-workers was very limited because it was more important to count the product so that the customers orders could go to the next step after being counted, so that their order could be processed and shipped out to them. Counting product was is a very easy at Amazon, but the hardest part comes when you're about 8 hours within you're shift and sometime you would get zoned out from the constant standing all day and waiting for Kiva Pods to bring you shelves to count."
good,I finish my internship there. The project is quite challenging but not easy to finish. My manager is too pushy to me. There is less work-life balance.
good,A typical day is long u work about 10 hrs a day for 4 days but then u have 3 days off.  They treat their employees good they have treats for them sometimes and a Thanksgiving dinner around Thanksgiving.
good,Amazon at days was good then others it was not. If you ask me I would say don't work at amazon cause they pick favorites. They don't go by the book when it comes to rules. They don't care about there employees just the money the employees are getting for them.

good,"Great company, very organized, great benefits, family oriented atomsphere. Job is not secure but the pay is great and managemnt is very considerate."
good,"It was a good learning experience. Taught me very good time management skills. Typical day would be arrive to the warehouse, pick up the packages & deliver the rest of the day. If down early, help with other deliveries. The hardest part of the job was memorizing all the different routes & apartment passwords/gate codes."
good,"working out and get paid ....i really loved it and i do miss it now ,"
good,"good work environment, had to leave on family issues but would have stayed if I could. typical warehouse job just moving things around and putting things where they should go"

good,Great Company to work for. Demonstrates positive work attitude. Running offers on line making sure they are complete and sent out on time.
good,I love working at Amazon its fun and easy all in one. There are some challenging days but nothing the average person can't handle.

good,"This company is all about production. A very go-go-go enviroment. I liked it, there was always something to be doing and it made for a highly productive and busy day. The hardest part id say was keeping up with the production expectations. I was a picker for this company and as i nearly was sprinting for items on our pick gun, it seemed i was only nearly meeting hourly goals. I push myself to be an overachiever and this was disappointing to me sometimes."
good,"Working at Amazon you meet a wide range of people, it is a fun productive place of employment. The Benefits are great and the management is very helpful. The hardest part of the job is getting use to standing for long periods of time, and getting use to the fast pace."
good,A typical day at work is busy and fun at the same time. But you have to be a fast pace worker in order to get the job done in the right amount of time.

good,"I really enjoyed the work environment at Amazon. Every morning before each shift there was ""Stand Up"" which included multiple stretches and an over all production summary of our specific department. The managers and leaders/coaches were very friendly and personable. I felt as ease when coming to them with any questions or concerns. Same goes for co-workers, very helpful and friendly.

good,"When I think about happiness in general, I picture being passionate about whatever I am doing, having freedom, and being surrounded by people that truly care about me and want to see me succeed. Most Millennials agree with me, especially on my last point, as 71% say their coworkers to be a second family to them. Socializing and having fun with coworkers creates a bond and fosters camaraderie, so these two factors directly correlate with one another. Considering this, it should come as no surprise that a study found socializing to be rated the highest out of all fun-related activities throughout employees of all ages and generations.  Organizations that cater to these desires will attract and retain the most talented candidates out there, and will experience a big boost in employee happiness, retention, and debatably, even productivity."

good,I really do enjoy working at Amazon.  It's not like any other warehouse I have worked in the past.  Yes numbers are important but they more interested in helping you to meet your goal rather than disposing of you if you cannot.  They care about their employees and that is a huge motivator.

good,"Depending on your proffered job role i personally think this suits me, reason being is because of long hours and night shift availability."

Getting CPT (critical pull times) out in a speedy but safe fashion,  break then more cpt then lunch followed by stretches and more cpt then one more break followed by the end of the day cpt's.  I would normally be fixing the problems handling any issues anyone might have.  Running a specific area like gift wrap where i would makes sure everything was flowing and getting done in a speedy fashion... Never wanted to miss a customers order or have it late.  Quality of the item and the packages(s) itself were also very important.  I learned how to do every function in the outbound department, became very good at them in-turn.  I was trained to train new employees in there function.  I learned more of the technical side of things began fixing shipments, any red flags and managing inventory...  I also learned how to become a PA (process assistant)...  so basically i was responsible for all of the packers in a specific area.. and making sure the thousands of orders went out on time."

Its easier to go through the temp agency and then get converted to a full time employee. As an amazon employee you get a raise every 6 months benefits the same day as hired 401k options and stocks. You can pretty much transfer with this company anywhere in the u.s. and outside. I tried the transfer to the Florida plant in Lakeland and it did not happen so i relocated to Florida anyway. But if your not in a hurry and have time to wait on a transfer its a good option. If you just work hard you can get converted and move up from there! Amazon pays there employees at a very decent rate, especially the salary employees. You can make a lot of money during peak lots of overtime!"

good,"I have been there for over a year. What they say about you being laid off is a bunch of lies. If you are lazy then of course, because you won't make rate. Amazon is a great place to work at, you can work yourself up the ladder and become someone bigger and better in no time! Patience is all you need!"

good,Working at Amazon was an exciting challenge each day. I learnt how to communicate better over the telephone. I learnt to solve problems in a way that it would benefit the customer. Management and my co-workers were great. We worked very well together and we helped and supported each other when needed. The hardest part of the job was not being able to solve the problem after doing everything possible for the customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was just working in that energetic and vibrant environment.
good,On a typical day you will experience a fast paced and fun work day. In my time at Amazon have acquired great problem solving and team building experience. Managers rotate a little too often which makes it difficult to always meet every individuals expectations. Co-workers are amazing and hard working as well reliable.

good,"Amazon is continuously changing, or evolving processes. A company that puts safety first is the company for me. The hardest part of the job for me was having people that would not work and stop others from giving their 100%. The work is hard but that is when you have to own the process and work it for your personality. I had very good managers who listened and took action. If a person showed initiative Amazon managers were quick to engage associates abilities. This is a company that will allow you to go as far as you wished."
good,"This is a place where you learn a lot about providing excellent customer service. Co-workers, supervisors and managers are upbeat, friendly, helpful, and show that they really want you to succeed. The hardest part is the first week after training but after you make it past that week the rest is a breeze. And like to add the break room has an awesome setup so you can hangout and not think about work for a little while. Without a doubt the best company I've ever worked for."
good,"The work was hard (especially on the feet) and you work about 18 hours straight. When you first start they tell you that you need good shoes, they weren't kidding, you are standing and walking your whole shift."

good,"first time we need have a meeting to know what will be the must important job to do, getting to remember the mandatory safety, getting the scanners to pick up items, or stowing item  or be at the line to make the pallets ready and wrap them to sent to all United States. or Sorting the flat items to sending too. .The co-workers very respectful hardest  part of job is when the people don't work at the same effort  most enjoyable part of the job is be Amazonian"
good,learned how to work some new things. coworkers were nice managers was good at what they do. There was nothing really hard about the job I adapt to it really quickly.
good,"""You can definitely learn a lot in short spam in Amazon as they make you work a lot"""
good,"J'emballais les colis dans les cartons pour les mettre ensuite sur le tapis roulant. L'ambiance était très bien, j'ai bien aimé travailler dans cette entreprise. Le travail en lui même était très bien. On peut évoluer sur tous les postes quand il y a besoin et si on en fait la demande. Le plus difficile c'est de rester debout derrière un poste, à piétiner. Ce qui à été agréable dans ce travail c'est de pouvoir parler à ses collègues tout en travaillant."
good,The several months I was working at Amazon I gained experience and I learned how to prepare myself to work. I met a plethora of helpful and caring people.
good,"The fulfillment center is a new idea with Amazon, and I like how they're all about taking care of their people--something I've rarely seen in my previous stops. Seems like they're willing to move you up if you're willing to put the time in."
good,"Normalmente os dias são tranquilos, atualmente estou exercendo a função da antiga encarregada que foi deligada, foi um grande desafio para mim tomar posse desse cargo de muita responsabilidade, mas aceitei, esta foi a parte mais difícil pois não havia experiência como encarregada e a parte onde também aprendi muito. Meu superior procura sempre nos ajudar quando necessário, os funcionários sempre estão trabalhando em equipe."
good,"Amazon is very flexible, and a nice place to work. With the laid back dress code its makes the day easier to get through and more comfortable."
good,"I loved the environment, the work ethic, the coworkers, and knowing I am making a difference by getting orders out to a guest on time, if not earlier!"
good,Worked for a temp service and very interesting job and learned alot about on line shopping. My knowledge about new technology has expanded tremdously. I had a fun night because I learned about products that I didn't know about. Co-workers was great.
good,i worked in amazon warehouse was a stower and it was okay until they had to lay me off because it was a temp job. i worked there for 6months straight.
good,I worked in the pack department and it was fairly easy. Everyone was very helpful. I learned how to work in a environment where everything is moving at a steady pace.

good,"Great place to work, and great company to work for. This company really cares for their customer. Number one customer service satisfaction."
good,"Amazon is a company that recognizes a skill set and uses that skill set to adhere to their bottom line. This is a company that evolves as necessary. I learned to identify and correct problems with support of staff in other departments. Yes work was hard because of customer base, but with good people in the background help move processes forward. With an open door policy in place, any issues get resolve fairly and quickly. I like being surrounded by people that worked as hard as I did. The hardest part of my job was when associates had days they needed to talk. Everyone has personal problems. but not everyone can leave it at the door. I took pride in leaving my area squared away for the next shift. One of my bosses told me... You can show 100 people how to do a process and at least 95% of them will follow it. When I clocked in I owned it, just as it was. I grew a lot with Amazon, but life required me to move on."
good,Easy to meet your daily quota and get to move around constantly. Enjoyed being on the move in picking orders time always flies by.
good,"I was able to push my self to the limits working at this job, trying to make rate.  I am sure this job made me that much of a better worker. I learned a lot and the importance of working as a team."
good,I do my daily task with no problems which lets me talk to other co works and enjoy their company. the hardest thing might only be is just trying to stay focus.

good,"I packed the consumer products so it could be shipped out to the consumer. I was responsible for my own station. Sometimes we were required to lift packages that were 50+ pounds. We were required to bend at the knees while doing so. Safety was our #1 priority. While I was working at Amazon, I was briefly transferred to their Redlands fulfillment center, where I did shipdock and sorting and worked the conveyor belt."
good,Having to meet up with the company stated monthly target made the job even more challenging but fun. The co-workers were friendly and great team players.
good,"everyday new new duty, not the same routine."
good,"I work as an ICQA a.k.a Quality Control worker for amazon at one of its warehouses.A typical day at work was arriving at the warehouse at 6am and greeting my co-workers. When it was time to clock in we did and then went to our assign station with our supervisor who then started us off on our mandatory exercises before starting work. When we were done stretching it was time to get our equipment which consisted of a scanner and a stool , stickers, paper, pencil etc. After that we went to check out the board to see what we had to do for today then once we knew where to go we started out signing into the scanner and then start by scanning a an item on a near by shelf then go wherever the scanner tell you. Our job consisted of scanning items like books, dvds, video games, phones etc and making sure the items where put in the right place and that the scanner had the correct information on the item. Another important part of the job is looking and making sure no items where stolen from its packaging."
good,Start meetings and exercise. Learned to use hand scanners. Management provided ample training for making rate. Very high turnover rate during peak season. The hardest part of the job was trying to understand the stowing methods for making a very high stow rate. Most enjoyable was learning methods to maintain a high stow rate and getting the job done.
good,"The company  is a joy, plus the pay isn't that bad. There environment is a positive  energy. Also there achievements and goals are easy to reach."
good,"I’m currently working in Amazon located at Hemel Hempstead; from Sunday to Wednesday for 26 months has PACKER. My jobs includes packing, picking and problem solve on kick-out areas. Experience grabbed as the years and days go by includes safety, team work and targets. In Amazon, every staff is constantly trained as the change or new techniques is involved and also make them happy. The most interesting part of the job is to be at the highest point of the target given at the end of the day with success."
good,A typical day at Amazon would be on a Sunday night where mostly its very slow and really not using that much energy as you would any other night. What I learned from this job is that its take a lot of time and you have to be a true worker to get through the night. The co-worker was very friendly made the job more fun. There really wasn't a hard part me. The most enjoyable part was everything I love it.
good,"good work place ,good people and environment.I got a lot of skills and spend good time.managers are working very good and smoothed"
good,"Amazon Swansea - 2014 to 2015 (night shift)"
good,"im a people person who has been involved with customers for the last 15 years of my work life! this is a new experience/work style for me. During peak it was exciting and then after peak it seems like I have no interest in the business, I need contact with customers and with amazon I do not have that ability. Overall, Amazon is a wonderful place to work and they offer stellar benefits!!! just not for someone who likes to communicate while working."
good,The team management in amazon is as such well organized. My team comprises of 8 members working for Amazon's kindle devices. Each person in the team is assigned a specific task well in advance to the commencement of the project.

good,Amazon is a very good place to work with and the management are are very respectful and nice. I worked with a very good co-workers.
good,"While working at Amazon you truly don't know what to expect because of the many workers you encounter with from day to day bases, everyone that I've came across seems more than satified with their job. Most are considered very friendly but the best part is that it doesn't take long to learn your position and your co workers in your department are more than happy to take time out and show you how to maintain an overall good rating, even the managers will help you when their not occupied. Overall, I'll have to say the hardest part of the job is knowing your limits but a person such as myself doesn't really consist of none, for example, as a process guide in cases, my manager had me build U-Boats, Stow and help my stowers find locations in pallet land all in one day, which I enjoyed it because it kept me occupied."
good,fast growing company and employee friendly and they support employees a lot whenever its required.
good,"The best part of the job is you have chance to work with great people on daily basis. I've learnt how to manage up to 100 people on shift working closely with my co-workers and Management. I've learnt how to lead shift by myself and do it well. Typical day at work consist of dealing with Associates and Managers on the shift, doing Admin part of the job and solving all possible enquires."
good,A typicaln work day would be getting up at 5am to be at work by 6:30am til 5pm. You would have to have lots of endurance to be able to stand 10hr shifts and work at a fast pace. I learned a lot about a warehouse job becuase it was my first experience with this type of employment. It was easy work but the hard part was being on your feet all those hours but you soon got used to it. Management did the best they could do and was overall okay. The co-workers sometimes complained a lot an got away with doing what they wanted to do. The hardest part of the job was the constant walking and standing. The most enjoyable part of the job was the pay the all the overtime that was required.
good,A typical day at Amazon.com consists of picking customers orders.
good,When I was employeed at Amazon.com I was doing the over night shift and I loved it. I was constently doing somthing. My co-workers were always friendly and the job description was perfect for my needs since I like being on shape nd my job position included a lot of walking (up to 10-12 miles per night). I learned that the fastest you do the task the higher up you are on the scale and managers notice you. My managers were really friendly I had good friendships or may I say stable relationships with everyone in the wearhouse. I enjoyed the music playing and the constant interaction with every single person at the wearhouse. The only thing that would bother me is that the bathrooms were so far from the actual work place.

good,"A typical day in Amazon would be stretching before the workday would begin, listen to a few announcements, and then head on to where we were scheduled to work(on the pack lines), I learned how to carefully pack customer items and ship them down the line. How to use required machinery for this specific job, Since this was a small environment, my co-workers were easy to talk to, as well as for my managers. If I had a question, I did not hesitate to ask anyone. I would say that the hardest part of the job was not being able to have longer breaks, since we did work ten hours each day. The most enjoyable part of the day was working with others and knowing that we were doing a good job with rates and time."
good,Definitely. I was a Hardware technician who had a chance to try different roles within the company.
good,"Go to work everyday and take phone calls along with looking at e-mails, going to meetings and solving customer issues. I learned a lot at Amazon from the customer's, and how Amazon works to the people I worked with. Management was always going above and beyond to help out their employees, and there were always there when you needed them. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers who were angry but, at the end of the day, it was all worth it.

good,"team work.Counted and verified orders to be stocked. Cleaned, scanned, packed, and labeled outgoing orders. Exceeded customer product expectations by going above and beyond ensuring the accuracy of my work"
good,"Working for Amazon is a little like signing up for the gym. You're pledging to walk 20+ miles a day, to lift as much as 50+ pound items, and to cart them around several different warehouses. Nothing about it is easy, especially when it's anywhere from 80-100 degrees at all times. You don't see many people, you're on hard concrete flooring, or up to four floors above the rest of the workplace. You're also timed, so there isn't any of this stopping to smell the flowers business. It's go go go, or the supervisor is coming after you with the demand to get back to it. If you're a self-motivator, it's pretty rewarding. You're on your own 99% of the time and hey! You get to look at cool stuff all day. If you can handle working yourself to the point of overexertion and self-injury, it's a good place. Just don't get mad when you walk past the office - sweat dripping down your face and panting for breath - when you see the managers with their feet propped up in the air conditioning."
